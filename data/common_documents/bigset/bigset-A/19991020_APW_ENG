<HEADLINE> NYSE Seeks More China Listings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- The New York Stock Exchange hopes to attract  
more listing candidates from Hong Kong and China, Richard Grasso, 
chairman of the NYSE, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso, who met with a few potential listing candidates in Hong  
Kong, said one of the biggest opportunities for the globalization 
of the U.S. market will come from China where the government hopes 
to privatize many state-owned enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``This part of the world is clearly the number one or number two  
in terms of opportunities'' for the NYSE, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he hopes to have the merged Hong Kong stock and  
futures exchanges to list in New York. The exchanges are planning 
to merge and then list next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they privileged us with that opportunity we would list the  
NYSE here'' in Hong Kong, he said. The NYSE plans to sell stock in 
itself next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso also said the NYSE eventually hopes to be able to offer  
investors the chance to trade in other currencies besides the U.S. 
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Alabama Athletic Director Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Former University of Alabama athletics  
director Jim Goostree, best remembered as one of former coach Paul 
``Bear'' Bryant's trusted aides as the Crimson Tide racked up six 
national championships, has died. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Goostree, who died Tuesday from a heart attack, arrived at  
Alabama in 1957 and retired from the athletic department in 1993 
after rising to executive athletics director. He was inducted into 
the National Athletic Trainer's Hall of Fame in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama coach Mike DuBose called his death a ``a real shock and  
a real tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to think about Alabama football without  
thinking of Jim Goostree,'' said DuBose, who met Goostree during 
his playing days with the Tide. ``It's especially ironic that this 
tragedy should happen during Tennessee week because this was the 
game that he always looked forward to the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goostree, a native of Clarksville, Tenn., was a Tennessee  
graduate. He retired from Alabama in April 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members said that funeral arrangements would be announced  
today.

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates Late-Term Abortions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate, reopening an emotional debate on a  
bill that would ban some late-term abortions, rejected an 
alternative Wednesday that offered a broad exception for women 
whose pregnancies endangered their health. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the stronger bill argued that the alternative,  
defeated by a 61-38 vote, would permit late-term abortions in 
virtually any circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about infanticide,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.,  
chief sponsor of a stricter version. ``This is a baby who is all 
but born and then killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats contended Santorum's bill was unconstitutional and  
designed to boost GOP election prospects next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know ... this is the third time the president will veto  
this bill,'' said its chief opponent, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. 
``Why go through this if not for politics?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate almost immediately focused on the argument over the  
definition of viable life and at which point a fetus should be 
considered born. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure in question involves the partial, feet-first  
delivery of a fetus and the draining of its skull contents. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum's bill, the ``Partial Birth Abortion Act of 1999,''  
would make it a felony punishable by a fine and/or a two-year 
prison term unless the procedure is ``necessary to save the life of 
a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness 
or injury.'' The mother could not be prosecuted under the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the legislation provides for lawsuits against the  
physician by the father of the fetus and by the mother's parents, 
in certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative offered by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., would have  
stopped all abortions after fetuses can survive outside the womb, 
except in cases where two independent doctors certify a woman's 
life was at risk or she faced ``grievous injury'' to physical 
health. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the proposal was a broadly worded attempt to  
permit abortions in almost all cases because pregnancy easily can 
be considered a threat to a woman's health. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has little chance of becoming law. Senior Senate  
Republican aides who spoke on condition of anonymity acknowledged 
that even if Santorum's bill passes, it would probably fall short 
of the two-thirds majority required to override Clinton's expected 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	It has sparse support in the courts. Thirty states have passed  
late-term abortion bans, but lower courts in two-thirds of those 
states have struck down or prevented the activation of those laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., planned to have a  
final vote on the bill Thursday. But angered by his decision to 
bring up the legislation a few days shy of the anniversary of the 
unsolved murder of abortion provider Barnett Slepian near Buffalo, 
N.Y., Democrats threatened to extend debate into an array of 
women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could be on this bill for a couple of weeks,'' said Sen.  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a time frame that 
would take it well beyond current plans to wind up the session for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1692.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Alter Bush Campaign Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The day after presidential candidate George W.  
Bush redesigned his campaign's Web site, hackers vandalized it by 
replacing his photo with a hammer and sickle and calling for ``a 
new October revolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, said the campaign's more sensitive  
computer operations -- such as its e-mail system and contribution 
records -- were protected on other machines and weren't believed to 
have been compromised. 
</P>
<P>
	The embarrassing security lapse Tuesday came the day after the  
Bush campaign launched what it described as its ``innovative new 
design'' for its Internet site, www.georgewbush.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken steps to make sure this particular problem is  
fixed, and we are looking at other ways to further secure the 
site,'' Tucker said. The campaign was considering whether to 
formally notify the authorities, such as the FBI, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A review of the Bush site by The Associated Press listed  
computer files plainly visible that experts -- including the 
Microsoft Corp. -- recommend deleting for security reasons. One file 
includes instructions for users to edit Web pages on the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means to me there is no security policy for this site,''  
said Russ Cooper, a specialist who runs the popular NTBugtraq 
discussion group on the Internet. ``It's typically unfortunate that 
a lot of these people do not take the time to protect themselves 
from this kind of embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hackers replaced a news story about Bush on his Web site  
with a note that ``the success or failure of the working class to 
achieve victory depends upon a revolution (of) leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site runs software from Microsoft, called Internet  
Information Server, that has suffered several serious security 
problems during the past year. Microsoft has distributed patches in 
each case but relies on local computer administrators to install 
them correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	Another security expert, Weld Pond, said there was ``no  
question'' that the Bush campaign neglected to remove remnants of 
sample computer code, which made the site vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably how they got in,'' said Pond, a consultant  
with L0pht Heavy Industries of Boston. ``The fact that there are 
these sample files on there is pretty problematic, meaning they 
didn't take much effort to secure it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said the campaign's own investigation found that the  
altered Web page was accessible by the public for fewer than five 
minutes before a backup system kicked in and restored the 
vandalized text with a fresh copy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (hammer and sickle) image wasn't subtle,'' said Jeremy  
Pinnix, a director at a Nashville, Tenn., design company. He 
noticed the change while looking at the site early Tuesday and 
captured a snapshot of the altered page.

<HEADLINE> Parcells Defends Player's Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Bill Parcells insisted on Wednesday the  
New York Jets have not abandoned Kevin Williams, the defensive back 
who is on a respirator with a mysterious throat and lung infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells took exception to the portrayal of the team's conduct  
by Jerome Stanley, Williams' agent. Stanley contends the Jets have 
not showed enough concern for Williams, who is in intensive care at 
Lenox Hill Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley said the team put Williams on the reserve, nonfootball  
injury list so it wouldn't have to pay his client for the rest of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had a grievance filed here in three years,''  
Parcells said. ``That's because we try to do what we think is in 
everyone's best interest all the time, and I would charge you to 
find many other teams that can make that statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin had earned about 6/16th of his salary. We elected to pay  
him half of the remaining amount he was due. But in doing so I made 
another move that was, in fact, vastly economically more beneficial 
to the player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams will get approximately $175,000 from his $250,000 base  
salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the option of not paying anything,'' Parcells said.  
``But in electing not to put him on (nonfootball injury list) prior 
to the sixth game, I assured him a credited, accrued season toward 
free agency. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was in the player's best interest. Some people  
say that wasn't. Ask the people who are talking about these things 
if they'd prefer it the other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Williams is in his second season with the Jets.  
He is a backup safety and kick returner who appeared in four games 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he contracted the illness that originally was diagnosed as  
strep throat. He has had three surgical procedures to clear fluid 
from this throat and around his lungs. Parcells said doctors were 
``cautiously optimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a job or business in America that would treat an  
employee like this,'' Stanley said Tuesday. ``Nobody offered the 
family any communication or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said he was simply following instructions from the  
team's medical staff in not contacting Williams while he is in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told my coaching staff not to bother him, that this was a  
very fluid and changing thing,'' he said. ``There's nothing we 
could do, the player was not going to be communicative. It was 
probably in the player's best interest to just let the medical team 
deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Stanley's charge the Jets ignored Williams' family,  
Parcells said he has not talked to the agent, nor does he plan to. 
However, Parcells said Dr. Elliot Pellman, the head of the team's 
medical staff, has spoken with the agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to discuss Jerome,'' Parcells said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stanley said Wednesday: ``I've heard what the organization has  
to say and I have nothing to add to it. I think it speaks for 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said he was told before the fifth game of the season,  
that it was unlikely Williams would play again this season. But 
Parcells chose to keep him on the active roster for two more weeks 
to assure that 1999 would count as an accredited season. 
</P>
<P>
	By doing so, Williams can become a restricted free agent after  
next season and an unrestricted after the 2001 season. Williams 
also will be eligible for the minimum third-year player salary, 
which currently is $325,000.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Reveals Weapons Locations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon for the first time has revealed  
where it stored nuclear weapons abroad during the Cold War, 
including unarmed submarine-seeking depth bombs in Cuba during the 
1962 missile crisis with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of nine places where bombs or bomb components minus  
their nuclear charges were located between 1951 and 1977 are 
revealed in a newly declassified official Pentagon history. The 
names of 18 other locations were blacked out by government censors 
before the document was released to Robert S. Norris, a private 
specialist on nuclear weapons and author of numerous books on the 
topic. 
</P>
<P>
	Using other documents, Norris and two colleagues said they could  
identify 17 of the 18 unnamed locations, ringing the globe from 
Canada to Iceland to Morocco and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine nuclear weapon locations named in the Pentagon document  
are Cuba, Puerto Rico, Britain, West Germany, the U.S. territories 
of Guam, Johnston Island and Midway, and Alaska and Hawaii, both 
U.S. territories in the early years of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with material blacked out, the ``History of the Custody and  
Deployment of Nuclear Weapons,'' published in February 1978 as a 
top secret document, ``shows a huge expanse of nuclear weapons 
around the globe,'' Norris said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an article about nuclear weapons history published today in  
the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Norris and co-authors 
William Arkin and William Burr estimate that in the early 1970s the 
number of U.S. nuclear weapons deployed abroad peaked at about 
12,000, including 3,000 aboard U.S. ships and submarines. 
</P>
<P>
	The narrative portion of the Pentagon history makes no reference  
to U.S. nuclear weapons in Cuba, but an appendix listing locations 
outside the continental United States says an unspecified number of 
``non-nuclear depth bombs'' were stored in Cuba between December 
1961 and July-September 1963. The crisis over the Soviet Union 
trying to put surface-to-air nuclear missiles in Cuba was in 
October 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	The term ``non-nuclear'' referred to components, such as bomb  
casings or assemblies, for nuclear weapons, the report said. At 
that time, bomb design technology required that the actual nuclear 
charge, or capsule, be kept separate from the non-nuclear assembly. 
In the event of war, capsules could be flown to bases where they 
would be inserted into the assemblies to make complete bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Depth bombs were weapons dropped from airplanes or helicopters  
to dive into the sea to kill submarines. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham Allison, a former Pentagon official and expert on the  
Cuban missile crisis, said in a telephone interview he was not 
aware that nuclear weapon components had been stored in Cuba. He 
said they probably were at Guantanamo Bay, a U.S. Navy base on the 
eastern tip of the island. During the Cuban missile crisis the Navy 
searched intensively for Soviet submarines in the Atlantic, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Details about locations of American nuclear weapons abroad are  
among the most closely protected Pentagon secrets. Today the only 
remaining full-time U.S. nuclear deployments outside the United 
States are in Europe, where bombs are stored for potential use by 
U.S. Air Force planes based there. The Pentagon also has U.S.-based 
submarines, aircraft and missiles armed with nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said he and his two co-authors used publicly available  
documentation to determine the names of 17 of the 18 censored 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17 were Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Japan, Kwajalein Island,  
Morocco, Okinawa, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, 
Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. It has 
been known that U.S. nuclear weapons were in some of these 
countries, even if not officially acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	The one country that Norris, Arkin and Burr could not identified  
falls, alphabetically, between Canada and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	With the onset in 1950 of the Korean War, the Truman  
administration approved the movement of non-nuclear bomb components 
to Britain, and later that year to Guam, according to the Pentagon 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``By having non-nuclear components readily available to these  
units, the initial strikes against their assigned targets could be 
mounted in a much shorter time, and the time schedule for 
subsequent attacks could be advanced,'' the document said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first overseas movement of nuclear capsules -- the bomb's  
plutonium or uranium core -- came in 1951 when President Truman 
authorized the shipment of nuclear capsules to the Pacific island 
of Guam. Starting in 1956 a wide variety of nuclear weapons and 
their delivery systems were sent to the Pacific.

Theater in December for 24 performances -- and she won't come cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	The top ticket price will be $125.  
</P>
<P>
	Her show, ``Minnelli on Minnelli,'' will salute her father,  
Vincent Minnelli, who directed the classic musicals ``Meet Me in

<HEADLINE> AOL Quarterly Earnings Triple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. reported quarterly  
earnings of $184 million Wednesday as it trumpeted a deal to have 
its Internet software loaded onto computers sold by Gateway Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Gateway, which will receive $800 million over two  
years, will allow AOL to reach even more consumers in a time when 
it continues to expand its global reach, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as AOL released first-quarter earnings of  
15 cents per diluted share. The $184 million was up from $50 
million, or 4 cents per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had been  
expecting earnings of 13 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose to $1.5 billion, a 47 percent increase over last  
year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL added nearly 1.1 million new members worldwide in the period  
ended Sept. 30, giving the world's largest Internet service 
provider 18.7 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive officer Steve Case said the results  
show the growing importance of AOL's products in the lives of 
Internet users. AOL products reach eight of 10 American Internet 
users, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This quarter's results clearly demonstrate America Online's  
leadership and growing earnings power,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dulles, Va.-based company's subscription revenues reached  
$995 million, and the average daily minutes online of its members 
hit 55 minutes, an increase of eight minutes over last year's first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from advertising, commerce and other sources climbed to  
$350 million, up from $175 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	To expand its reach, the company is making its e-mail services  
available on Palm Pilot hand-held computers and last week announced 
an alliance with Motorola that will allow users of AOL's instant 
messaging service to communicate with users of Motorola's wireless 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also continued to broaden its services, signing a  
deal with drkoop.com, the online health care information company 
headed by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. AOL also expanded 
its travel and personal finance offerings during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of America Online rose $2.75 in trading Wednesday to $118  
on the New York Stock Exchange. In after-hours trading, investors 
pushed AOL shares down a bit to $117.50.

<HEADLINE> Washington's Tents Deteriorating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YORKTOWN, Va. (AP) -- The National Park Service is trying to  
raise $400,000 to repair tents that were used by George Washington 
as he planned some of the key battles of the Revolutionary War. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the tents were removed from display at the Park Service's  
visitor center at the Yorktown battlefield in 1997 because of 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	A faulty air system deposited a film of oily dirt, and a leak in  
climate control equipment left a large water stain. Fluctuations in 
humidity weakened the 200-year-old fabric, causing it to sag. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't put them back on display the way they were. It would  
just cause more damage,'' said chief historian Karen Rehm. ``So if 
we can't raise the money we need, they'll have to be packed up 
again and put away in storage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservators were awarded a $162,500 federal ``Save America's  
Treasures'' grant. But they have six months to raise a matching 
amount in order to receive the grant, said Bob Cornelius, 
development director of the Yorktown Foundation, which raises funds 
for the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
	The tents, fabricated according to Washington's instructions,  
originally included a field office and separate sleeping and dining 
enclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	Within their walls, Washington planned and executed the last  
major battle of the Revolution: the American and French victory 
over British forces trapped at Yorktown in 1781.

<HEADLINE> Church Promotion Pushes New Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Movie producer Matthew Crouch went to an odd  
place to promote his new thriller, which features cutting-edge 
special effects and lots of chases after stolen computer discs. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to church.  
</P>
<P>
	Five days before his new film ``Omega Code'' opened last Friday,  
Crouch showed the movie's two-minute promotional trailer during 
Sunday services in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	It got a standing ovation, and the ``pastor's two sisters told  
me afterward, 'We're going to this movie, and we've never been in a 
theater before,''' Crouch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the summer's biggest surprise hit, ``The Blair Witch  
Project,'' Crouch's latest film has built a groundswell of interest 
on a shoestring budget. This time, church volunteers have helped 
spread the word about the movie with a religious theme. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in just 304 theaters, the film cracked the top 10,  
taking in $2.4 million its opening weekend and earning a per screen 
average of $7,745. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, ``Fight Club,'' the heavily hyped film with  
A-list stars like Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, earned $5,662 in 
nearly 2,000 theaters during its debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm as shocked as you are we were No. 10 and had the  
top-grossing number,'' Crouch said. ``That is David and Goliath 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starring Michael York, Casper Van Dien and Catherine Oxenberg,  
the biblical thriller centers on efforts to stop a villain from 
using a stolen secret Bible code to take over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial idea that the Old Testament contains hidden  
references has been the subject of numerous studies, and recently 
was the subject of the 1997 bestseller ``The Bible Code'' by 
Michael Drosnin. 
</P>
<P>
	The PG-13 film has no bad language, no sex and no gore, but  
plenty of scary imagery and a few deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The $7.2 million movie was financed by Trinity Broadcasting  
Network, the Christian television network founded by Crouch's 
father, Paul. Trinity plugged the movie on the air and enlisted 
2,000 volunteers to promote the film, which initially had a tiny 
promotional budget of $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's distributor, Providence Entertainment, sent  
volunteers ``Marketing 101 kits,'' said Susan Chaudoir, national 
campaign manager for the movie. The kits included ``Omega Code'' 
posters, flyers and even a sample sales pitch to turn church-goers 
into movie-goers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing is perfect for the movie, rounding the corner into  
a new millennium,'' said Shane Harwell, vice president of marketing 
for Impact Productions of Tulsa, Okla., a religious film producer 
that contacted 2,400 pastors around the country to help with 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The movie gives us something a little more pro-family, more  
uplifting and at least points us toward hope and faith, if not God 
personally,'' Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volunteers put up movie displays at churches, and ministers  
talked up the film during services. The result was heavy advance 
ticket purchases and long lines at theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they had some divine intervention,'' said Paul  
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which 
tracks movie audiences. ``Who knows? Maybe they had God on their 
side trying to build up the box office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Churches in places such as Phoenix, Jacksonville, Fla., and  
Oklahoma City bought out entire theaters for weekend showings of 
the movie and distributed them to their congregations. 
</P>
<P>
	``'The Omega Code' was really something we could get behind. It  
had a good message,'' said the Rev. Mark Crow, pastor of Victory 
Christian Center in Oklahoma City, which snapped up about 100 
tickets for the movie for its church members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It communicated the message in a contemporary and relevant  
way. That's something the church hasn't done really well,'' Crow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Providence Entertainment plans to expand the movie to as many as  
400 theaters by early November, though Crouch said he hopes to get 
it into about 1,000 cinemas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see these megaplex theaters filled up on weekends. For young  
people, it's the place to be, and the church parking lots are 
empty,'' Crouch said. ``Why not utilize the influence of these huge 
theaters? I think they're the new streetcorner churches of the new 
millennium.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Plans Deadbeat Dad Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore urged fathers on  
Wednesday to ``step up to their responsibilities'' and pay child 
support or risk losing welfare benefits or damaging their credit 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	If they are unable to pay, the Democratic presidential candidate  
said he would seek to expand welfare programs to help them find and 
keep work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Way too many children are living without the influence of  
their fathers,'' Gore said at the Congress Heights United Methodist 
Church. ``There are too many mothers who are struggling because of 
fathers who will not step up to their responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Children and mothers are not the only ones who can benefit from  
increased paternal involvement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outside of a genuine religious experience, there is hardly  
anything that is more transforming in the life of a man than 
getting involved with his children,'' Gore said. ``It can change 
his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore laid out his ``responsible fatherhood'' package one day  
before Bill Bradley, his Democratic presidential rival. Bradley 
travels to New York on Thursday to unveil what his spokesman called 
``a comprehensive package to make a major move against child 
poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the vice president's plan also was designed to attack  
child poverty by remedying two of its biggest causes: financial and 
emotional abandonment by fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proposed giving federal child-support funds only to states  
that require all non-custodial parents -- mainly fathers -- who owe 
child support to get a job and pay up, or go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	If elected president, Gore said he also would require fathers to  
sign ``personal responsibility contracts,'' in which they would 
acknowledge paternity and pledge to work to pay child support, as a 
condition of getting aid from the Welfare to Work program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Gore's plan, the government would provide credit card  
companies with data on ``deadbeat dads'' who have not paid child 
support and urge lenders to deny them new credit cards or line of 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also referred to another group he calls ``dead broke dads''  
-- those who don't pay because they can't afford to -- his plan would 
broaden regulations allowing states to use federal welfare money to 
help them find and keep jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 welfare reform law moved millions of families off  
welfare, Gore said, but there are still many left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to lead the next generation of welfare reform that will  
ask fathers to step up to their responsibility,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also offered measures to help ensure children grow up in  
two-parent homes, including new grants to community and religious 
groups to ``help couples prepare for and strengthen their marriage, 
become better parents and reduce domestic violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president routinely pre-empts Bradley's speeches. Days  
before the former New Jersey senator unveiled an ambitious and 
expensive plan last month to provide near-universal health 
insurance, Gore rushed together a more limited health plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley press secretary Eric Hauser said it was a matter of Gore  
``agreeing with our agenda'' and lacking his own new ideas. ``The 
depth and significance of our proposals to solve big problems are 
far greater than his. That's even more clear given that a 
significant part of the announcement today are initiatives that the 
vice president already proposed,'' Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane fired back with a reference to  
Bradley's vote in the Senate in favor of President Reagan's 1981 
spending cuts. ``Al Gore's interest and commitment to strengthening 
families dates back ... to 1981 when he stayed and fought against 
the Reagan budget cuts that devastated programs for working 
families and the poor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore reached out Wednesday to key primary states even while  
campaigning in Washington. He made calls to reporters in New York 
in which he criticized Texas Gov. George W. Bush's environmental 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	He also spoke with reporters in Iowa, saying an increasingly  
competitive race with Bradley wouldn't force him out of the 
political center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to cause me to change my views,'' Gore said.  
</P>
<P>
	He also assailed the Republican-controlled Congress during  
remarks at a fund-raiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
Committee, which raised $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not worthy to run the Senate. They are an  
embarrassment to the United States,'' Gore told about 1,200 party 
faithful. ``They are headed in the wrong direction -- completely -- 
on every issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president also crowed when he introduced Miss America  
Heather Renee French and announced that she had switched her voter 
registration from Republican to Democrat on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Heading Toward $6 Million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Winning five tournaments, adding  
his second major championship and soaking up the thrill of a Ryder 
Cup victory apparently isn't enough for Tiger Woods going into the 
last three tournaments of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to put a little hat trick on them,'' Woods said  
Wednesday at Disney's National Car Rental Classic, his first 
72-hole tournament in seven weeks. ``That would be nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That just might happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Even though he hasn't played since the Ryder Cup four weeks ago,  
even though he will be playing for the first time since undergoing 
Lasix eye surgery, Woods has proven once again that anything is 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had such an astounding season that even with $12.5  
million in prize money on the line in the last three tournaments -- 
$2.35 million in combined first-place checks -- only three players 
have a mathematical chance to surpass him on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	The other side of the equation is this: Woods can win two of the  
next three tournaments and become the first $6 million man in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would definitely put a good end to the year,'' Woods  
said. ``If that doesn't happen, what's really important to me right 
now is making sure that my game stays solid. If I can continue 
that, I know I'll probably give myself a chance in the tournaments 
to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It all starts Thursday next to the Magic Kingdom, where Woods  
leads a strong field that includes 27 of the top 40 on the money 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the final tournament to qualify for next week's Tour  
Championship in Houston, where only the top 30 on the money list 
compete for $5 million. That explains why every player from No. 27 
to No. 40 is at Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	So what is Woods doing here?  
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the fact the Magnolia and Palm courses are a mere  
30-minute drive from home, Woods is ready to gear up for a hectic 
finish to the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up is the Tour Championship, followed by the final $5  
million World Golf Championship in Spain. After that, he goes to 
Taiwan for the Johnnie Walker Classic, followed by the World Cup in 
Malaysia a two-day exhibition in Japan and then the Grand Slam for 
the four major championship winners in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Whew.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting ready to go on a schedule that's going to be tough  
on the body,'' Woods said. ``So I've stayed away from the game as 
long as I possibly could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe he should have stayed away longer to give everyone else a  
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	While David Duval, the only player in the top five on the money  
list not at Disney, had the best spring in 25 years by winning four 
times, Woods has made that a distant memory. 
</P>
<P>
	It all started one morning on the driving range in May.  
</P>
<P>
	After more than a year of a meticulous, step-by-step overhaul of  
a swing that was good enough to win the Masters in record fashion, 
Woods stopped thinking about mechanics and found that his rebuilt 
swing started coming naturally to him. 
</P>
<P>
	He called swing coach Butch Harmon with the news: ``I got it.  
Everything has come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he went out and proved just how much it had.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went out and shot 61 the first round of the Byron Nelson,  
and I've gone on that stretch since,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That stretch has established Woods once again as the premier  
player in golf. He has finished worse than seventh just once since 
then, a tie for 37th in the Sprint International, the week after he 
won the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Take out Carnoustie, the toughest conditions in a British Open  
since World War II, and Woods has averaged 68.5 per round. In fact, 
Carnoustie was the last 72-hole stroke play tournament that he 
failed to win. 
</P>
<P>
	So, the only thing that might hold him back now is rust.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been seven weeks since I played in Akron,'' he said. ``I  
played in the Ryder Cup, but other than that, I have not done much 
of anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of that time was consumed with Lasix surgery. Woods has  
always worn contacts, which can irritate him when the wind kicks up 
and his allergies get bad. Now, he says he can read the subtleties 
in slopes on the green a little better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Objects are bigger,'' he said. ``The hole is bigger, the ball  
is bigger, clubs are bigger. You definitely have to adjust to 
everything. I've been practicing around and making sure everything 
looks all right. And I found that I'm actually able to clip the 
ball off the ground better. Maybe my swing has improved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another thing that could really get bigger is his bank account.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods already has just over $4.2 million, nearly $740,000 more  
than Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart and Vijay Singh also have a  
mathematical chance to win the money list -- assuming Woods finishes 
near the bottom in the final two events and misses the cut this 
week, something he has done only once in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Who knows?  
</P>
<P>
	If the long layoff doesn't stop the Tiger Woods Express, the PGA  
Tour could be looking at its first $6 million man.

<HEADLINE> EPA Seeks To Regulate Radon in Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time, the Environmental  
Protection Agency is planning to regulate the amount of radon 
allowed in drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA announced Tuesday it hoped to complete the new radon  
drinking water standards by next August, leaving it to states to 
decide how they will be met. 
</P>
<P>
	Radon, a naturally occurring gas that comes from soil, has been  
linked to thousands of cases of lung cancer and is second only to 
smoking in causing the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA proposal calls for states to allow no more than 4,000  
picocuries (a measure of radioactive decay) of radon per liter of 
water as long as states develop an ``enhanced program'' to reduce 
radon concentrations in indoor air. 
</P>
<P>
	Without an aggressive air quality protection program, states or  
local water authorities would have to meet a much tougher drinking 
water standard: 300 picocuries per liter of water. 
</P>
<P>
	Water systems where radon already is below 300 picocuries would  
not have to take additional action, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials said the combined water and air approach -- using  
the 4,000 picocuries per liter standard -- would be much less 
expensive and likely more beneficial because scientists believe 
radon in indoor air poses the greater health threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council  
reported last month that radon consumed in drinking water poses a 
relatively small cancer risk compared with radon inhaled from the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1998 National Research Council study concluded that radon was  
linked to about 21,800 lung cancer deaths a year, although most of 
those victims also were smokers. Scientists concluded that exposure 
of radon in the air poses the greatest health threat in combination 
with smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA has no standards for airborne radon levels. The agency  
has recommended that households reduce indoor radon levels to a 
maximum of 4 picocuries per liter of air. It is estimated that 6 
percent of homes have radon levels higher than the EPA 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people get exposed to radon from air inside buildings and  
homes. Radon can enter the indoor air from the soil through 
foundations as well as evaporation from drinking water, EPA 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Private individuals have spent more than $400 million on radon  
testing and house renovations to reduce radon levels since the 
1980s, when the gas was first linked to lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA estimated that it would cost the economy $86 million to  
meet the 4,000 picocuries drinking water standard, and $407 million 
a year to meet the more stringent 300 picocuries standard.

<HEADLINE> GM, CAW Reach Tentative Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers will vote this weekend  
on a tentative agreement with General Motors Corp. that covers 
22,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Union president Buzz Hargrove said Wednesday he expects workers  
to easily ratify the pact -- despite a small wildcat strike at a GM 
plant in Oshawa, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike by about 100 workers ended Wednesday morning a couple  
of hours after it started, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year deal reached Tuesday night includes raises of 4.5  
percent a year, an extra paid week off and a $670 signing bonus, 
Hargrove said in a telephone interview from his Toronto hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract also calls for a 25 percent pension increase over  
six years, and for retirement incentives that could apply to 7,000 
workers over the next six years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM agreed not to sell or close any of its Canadian plants during  
the life of the proposed contract, Hargrove said. GM also agreed to 
keep open through September 2002 its Ste. Therese, Quebec, assembly 
plant that builds Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tentative agreement, Hargrove said, GM will study the  
feasibility of producing a low-volume, high-end niche vehicle like 
DaimlerChrysler's Dodge Stealth at Ste. Therese after Camaro and 
Firebird production ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement follows the pattern CAW negotiators reached  
earlier with Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike would have halted production of several GM products and  
cut off the flow of engines, transmissions and other key components 
to many GM plants in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1996 contract talks, the CAW struck the Oshawa plant,  
idling some U.S. parts and assembly plants.

<HEADLINE> Mets Can't Comeback This Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The New York Mets had been rising from dead so  
often and for so long that people had come to expect it, especially 
the players themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why they took the end so hard.  
</P>
<P>
	Any team can fall behind 5-0 when it's just one loss from  
elimination. But to come back and tie it 7-all, take an 8-7 lead 
and blow it, and then take a 9-8 lead in the 10th and blow that, 
too? That's special. 
</P>
<P>
	That's amazin'.  
</P>
<P>
	That's the 1999 New York Mets.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's so typical of what's gone on,'' Al Leiter said early  
Wednesday as players milled about the visitor's clubhouse at Turner 
Field. ``I thought for sure we would win this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't, and winter at Shea Stadium started Wednesday. The  
Mets, the team that just would not die, finally drove a stake 
through their own heart at 12:38 a.m., when Kenny Rogers walked in 
the winning run that gave Atlanta a 10-9, 11-inning win and a 4-2 
victory in the NL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a big boy,'' Rogers said. ``I can handle it. God thinks I  
can handle a lot. He can lay off me now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than an hour later, Mike Piazza finally emerged from the  
showers and talked about the amazin' three weeks -- the seven-game 
losing streak that put them on the verge of wasting a wild-card 
lead for the second straight year, the three-game sweep of 
Pittsburgh on the final weekend that forced a tiebreaker against 
Cincinnati, the first-round upset of Arizona that began with 
Edgardo Alfonzo's ninth-inning grand slam and ended with Todd 
Pratt's 10th-inning homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the Braves' series, losing the first three games  
but clawing back and forcing a return to Atlanta on Robin Ventura's 
15th-inning grand slam-turned-single Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the first inning in Tuesday night's finale, when Leiter  
allowed his first five batters to score, the teams never had been 
separated by more than two runs at any point, in any game. 
</P>
<P>
	And even then, the Mets came back again, with Piazza's two-run  
homer off John Smoltz tying the score 7-7 in a four-run seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it wasn't enough. John Franco couldn't hold an 8-7 lead  
in the eight, and Armando Benitez wasted a 9-8 lead in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gone a lot of miles,'' Piazza said softly in a corner of  
the room. ``There's a lot of guys that matured in here. There's a 
lot of guys that have learned so much, not only about themselves, 
but what it takes to get to a World Series, not only the tangibles 
on the field, but the things that you don't see in a boxscore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Mets showed up at Port St. Lucie, Fla., in February,  
they were an entirely different team. Since then, they've added 
Shawon Dunston, Darryl Hamilton, Orel Hershiser and Rogers. Benny 
Agbayani emerged during the season, and Melvin Mora and Pratt took 
star turns in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this team,'' said Mora, who last year was playing pro  
ball in Taiwan. ``This is a great team. I've never played with a 
team like this before. Now that I know what goes on in this league, 
I'll be better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, acquired just before the July 31 trade deadline,  
talked about how many players ``ran out of gas,'' that they were 
too banged up at this point to perform up to their abilities. 
Piazza and many Mets repeatedly said they ``left it all on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter remembered back to last year, when the Mets went 0-5 in  
the last week and fell one win short of forcing a wild-card 
playoff. That, he said, was a ``flop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This wasn't.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a damn good stepping stone to get to the next level,'' he  
said. ``It's a great group of guys. With a tweak here and there, 
there's no question we can get to the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets know their weak spots: atrocious outfield defense and  
shaky starting pitching. While Leiter is an ace, Ricky Reed, Masato 
Yoshii, Bobby Jones are on and off. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear if Orel Hershiser will be back. First, he wants  
to explore whether Cleveland wants him as its manager. Rogers' 
return also is uncertain, especially after his Game 6 performance. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are few pitching options on the free-agent market,  
with David Cone perhaps the best available starter willing to play 
in New York 
</P>
<P>
	Re-signing John Olerud would appear to be the first priority.  
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, all of that could wait.  
</P>
<P>
	About 1 1/2 hours after the game, nearly half the team was still in  
the clubhouse, most wearing orange Mets' T-shirts, so proud of 
their accomplishments, even in defeat. It seemed like they wanted 
this season to go on and on. 
</P>
<P>
	They had moved the folding chairs set up in front of each locker  
and formed a circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on, have a beer,'' Franco yelled to a teammate across the  
room. 
</P>
<P>
	By now the girlfriends and wives were in, consoling, just  
wanting to be part of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think every guy in this room should be proud of the way we  
handled ourselves,'' Franco said. ``We're champions in our own 
hearts.''

<HEADLINE> SGI Reports Sharp Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Troubled computer maker Silicon Graphics  
Inc. reported its first-quarter losses steepened, falling below 
Wall Street expectations, after it set aside money to slash its 
work force and retool its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended Sept. 30, SGI reported a net loss of  
$212.9 million, or $1.17 a share, compared to a loss of $44 
million, or 24 cents a share, the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding charges the company announced in August it was taking  
to cut up to 3,000 jobs and write down costs of some computer 
lines, SGI's loss for the most recent quarter was $68 million, or 
37 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street had expected Mountain View, Calif.-based SGI to  
report an operating loss of 7 cents a share, according to a survey 
of analysts by First Call/Thompson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old high-tech company has lost money for two years  
as the supercomputer market continues to show weakness. SGI also 
has been hurt by stiff competition in the high-end computer 
workstation market from competitors such as Hewlett-Packard Co., 
IBM and Sun Microsystems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said also suffered in the current quarter from the  
sudden departure of Richard Belluzzo, the architect of SGI's 
turnaround plan, who became Microsoft Corp.'s head of Internet 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed with the results and the temporary loss of  
momentum that has resulted from the recent management transition'', 
said Robert Bishop, SGI's chairman and chief executive. ``I remain 
confident that by continuing to simplify our business we will be 
able to improve our execution and return to growth and 
profitability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell 5 percent to $585 million from $616.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Silicon Graphics rose 37 1/2 cents to $10 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Man Trapped in Elevator for 40 Hrs. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A magazine employee got trapped in the elevator  
at his high-rise office over the weekend and screamed, banged on 
the walls and tried climbing out through the ceiling before someone 
finally noticed him on a video monitor -- 40 hours after he got 
stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas White, a production manager for Business Week, emerged  
Sunday afternoon from the elevator at his 51-story building at 
Rockefeller Center. He refused medical attention but took two days 
off from work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still a little shaky,'' he said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Manley, a spokeswoman for Rockefeller Center Management  
Corp., said officials are trying to determine who should have been 
monitoring the building's security cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the heart of the matter,'' Ms. Manley said. ``We have  
24-hour security in this building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She would not say whether the elevator cameras run constantly.  
</P>
<P>
	White was working late Friday night to finish a project when he  
left his 43rd-floor office for a cigarette break. A split-second 
voltage dip caused the elevator to stall just above the 13th floor. 
White yelled, pounded on the elevator's walls and pushed every 
button. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until Sunday afternoon -- after someone saw him a video  
monitor -- that the elevator started up again, Ms. Manley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Manley said she had no details about White's ordeal,  
including how he went without food or relieved himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Weiss, a spokesman for McGraw-Hill, which owns Business  
Week, said the company has asked Rockefeller Center to explain how 
White could have gone unnoticed for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Russo, whose firm American Communications installs security  
systems in Wall Street area buildings, said high-rises like those 
in Rockefeller Center usually have 24-hour live feeds from elevator 
cameras, with monitors at a security desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a guy who sits there who's supposed to check the  
cameras once in a while,'' Russo said. ``When I heard the story on 
the radio this morning, the first thing I said was, `These guys 
were either sleeping or they weren't monitoring the cameras.'''

<HEADLINE> Investors Win in Online Trade Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors are emerging as the winners in an  
increasingly competitive race on Wall Street to provide low-cost, 
online brokerage services. 
</P>
<P>
	One after another, the big name brokerage houses are scrambling  
to offer a wide range of online services to compete with discount 
firms that offer Internet stock trading at a small fraction of 
traditional brokerage commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is that fees are being restructured -- mostly downward  
-- to cater to a growing variety of investor trading practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Easy access via personal computers to both online stock trading  
systems and market information has unleashed a wave of competition 
that has helped reduce brokerage fees, said John Markese, president 
of the American Association of Individual Investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The success of Charles Schwab and other online discount  
brokerages has overwhelmed the full-service brokerage industry,'' 
said Markese. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors who once relied on a broker for advice on which stocks  
to buy -- and paid him hundreds of dollars for every trade -- can now 
do themselves it on the Internet for $10 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this trading revolution, the full-service firms have  
moved slowly into online trading for fear of cannibalizing their 
lucrative brokerage businesses -- up until now. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., the second  
largest United States brokerage firm, became the latest 
full-service firm to unveil a tiered fee system for its customers 
who want to trade online, but also may sometimes want the advice 
and service of a traditional stock broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley will charge $29.95 for each unassisted online  
trade, and $39.95 for online trades assisted by a broker. Customers 
can also choose to pay a flat annual fee -- based on the size of 
their trading account -- and get an unlimited number of trades. Or, 
they can continue to pay traditional fees for full brokerage 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the plan, Morgan Stanley's existing Discover  
Brokerage Direct discount unit will be blended into the firm's new 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online business. The new services begin 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Salomon Smith Barney Inc., Prudential  
Securities Inc. and PaineWebber Group have all either announced or 
begun offering similar services with comparable fee structures. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the names are impressive, analysts say these firms are  
merely playing catch-up to independent brokers and financial 
planners who have offered low-cost, do-it-yourself plans for years 
-- even before the Internet allowed individual investors to with the 
click of a mouse button. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, independent brokers have offered flat annual fees  
since the early 1990s. In addition, the independents have slashed 
their own commissions by using discount trading services such as 
Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity Investments instead of the big 
Wall Street brokerage houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Pomeranz, an independent investment adviser in Boca  
Raton, Fla., said it is no longer practical for a broker to provide 
investing advice to clients who don't want or need it. Information 
on stocks can all be found on the Internet and so many investors no 
longer rely on a broker for trading decisions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly five years Pomeranz has charged his clients a flat  
annual fee -- about 2 percent of a client's account assets -- for 
stock trading. Those who want his advice pay extra. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of separating fees for advice and trading is now  
spreading to the large Wall Street firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big brokerage houses are being forced into this kicking  
and screaming by competition,'' said William Berg, president of 
Sigma Investment Management, a Portland, Ore., investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of their strategy to capture online customers, the big  
Wall Street firms are now undercutting the flat annual fees charged 
by independent brokers. Salomon Smith Barney, for example, charges 
between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent of a customer's account assets 
for unlimited trading, as opposed to the 2 percent charged by most 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fees charged by independent brokers are about to come  
under attack,'' said Steve Galbraith, a brokerage firm analyst at 
New York investment bank Sanford Bernstein. ``It was a good gig 
while it lasted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which means the costs to investors will continue to fall, as the  
independents scramble to keep pace with their competitors on Wall 
Street.

<HEADLINE> Thompson: Shoulder Getting Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Injured Penn State quarterback Kevin  
Thompson thinks he should be ready to play Saturday when the 
second-ranked Nittany Lions meet No. 16 Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shoulder is good and ... things are working out well with  
rehab,'' Thompson said. ``As of right now, things are a go for 
Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson injured his shoulder last Saturday when he was sacked  
in the end zone by Ohio State linebacker Na'il Diggs. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they think might have happened is I might have  
re-aggravated something I did earlier in my career,'' he said in a 
teleconference with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays and other tests on the shoulder came back negative.  
Thompson said his rehabilitation consists of stretching and 
strength training. Thompson threw on the side Tuesday, but did not 
participate in drills that would have required him to throw deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson started every game of 1998 and the first seven of 1999.  
If he doesn't start Saturday, Rashard Casey with start for the 
first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said the injury has been frustrating.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to be on the sidelines, especially in your  
fifth year,'' he said. ``It hurts more than anything to be watching 
a game on Saturday when you know you only have a few left.''

<HEADLINE> Nabisco Reports 37 Pct. Profit Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Snack maker Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s  
profit from ongoing businesses jumped 37 percent in the third 
quarter on improvement in its domestic cookie, cracker and food 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Planters nuts  
reported Wednesday its income from ongoing businesses was $81 
million, or 30 cents per share, in the July-September quarter 
versus $59 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue dipped 2 percent to $2.06 billion from $2.1 billion, due  
to unfavorable foreign exchange rates in international businesses, 
which offset higher sales in the domestic food business. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat analysts' forecasts by a penny, according to  
First Call/Thomson Financial. But in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, Nabisco shares fell 2.9 percent, or $1.06 1/4, to $35.50 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Nabisco sold several non-core businesses and closed  
or consolidated several plants in an effort to turn around slumping 
sales and profits. Including a $59 million credit for 
higher-than-expected proceeds from the sale of some facilities and 
lower-than-expected costs from that restructuring, net income more 
than doubled, to $114 million, or 43 cents per share, from $55 
million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of our businesses are now operating on solid footing and  
are building momentum,'' said James M. Kilts, president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco said its U.S. foods group posted a 9 percent sales  
increase, led by especially strong performance by Planters nuts and 
LifeSavers candy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the U.S. biscuit division held steady as slumping sales  
for its breakfast products offset a 3 percent increase in cookie 
and cracker sales. 
</P>
<P>
	International sales were down 7 percent but would have been 5  
percent higher excluding effects of unfavorable exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	For first nine months, Nabisco said net income from ongoing  
businesses was up 18 percent, to $202 million or 76 cents per 
share, from $165 million or 62 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the $59 million restructuring credit from the third  
quarter and a $406 million restructuring charge taken in June 1998, 
net income for the first nine months was $215 million or 81 cents 
per share, versus a loss of $90 million or 34 cents per share a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell to $5.94 billion from $6.19 billion a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Rain Doesn't Dampen Red Sox Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox didn't win the World Series, an  
AL pennant or even finish first in the division. In this 
long-suffering town, that's no reason to cancel the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could be a long wait'' until the Red Sox win the World  
Series, said Anthony Macchiavelli, a lifelong Red Sox fan who works 
next to City Hall Plaza, where the mayor held a rally for the team 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred fans braved the rain to cheer for the Red Sox  
two days after they lost in the American League Championship Series 
to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Macchiavelli had to skip the rally because he was  
working, those who did attend wouldn't let the weather or the 
team's early exit from the playoffs dampen their mood. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity to show how proud I am of the team,'' said  
Stephen Roache, of Charlestown. ``It's been a great season, and I'm 
counting the days until April.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox lost star slugger Mo Vaughn last winter and were  
expected by most to finish near the back of the pack. But they won 
94 of 162 regular-season games to finish second in the AL East and 
earn a wild-card berth into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing the first two games of their first-round series  
against the Cleveland Indians, the Red Sox won the last three to 
set up a dream matchup against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	New York won that best-of-7 series in five games, finishing the  
Red Sox off on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We say thank you to a team that ... confounded all the  
experts,'' Mayor Tom Menino said. ``They said they couldn't do it. 
But they did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox CEO John Harrington, general manager Dan Duquette and  
manager Jimy Williams also spoke to the crowd, as did players Bret 
Saberhagen, Nomar Garciaparra and Pedro Martinez, who were among 
the handful of players on the dais. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected to have a World Series championship, but we fell a  
little short,'' Saberhagen said. ``We're a little disappointed 
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All promised that next time, the party would be bigger.  
</P>
<P>
	``Next year, you will have a parade in this town,'' Martinez  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd sang ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' and chanted  
``M-V-P!'' for both Garciaparra and Martinez. Even Wilton Veras, a 
little-used infielder, got a big hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised,'' Garciaparra said. ``The way this town  
supports us so much, this was great. It doesn't make it any easier 
(to lose), but it's definitely nice to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Walsh, 25, who has been going to Red Sox games since age 5,  
said he didn't see anything wrong with having a rally for a team 
that fell short of its goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they did today was pretty mellow,'' he said. ``If they  
ever won the World Series, the city of Boston would be upside 
down.''

<HEADLINE> SGI Reports Sharp Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Troubled computer maker Silicon Graphics  
Inc. reported its first-quarter losses steepened, falling below 
Wall Street expectations, after it set aside money to slash its 
work force and retool its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended Sept. 30, SGI reported a net loss of  
$212.9 million, or $1.17 a share, compared to a loss of $44 
million, or 24 cents a share, the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding charges the company announced in August it was taking  
to cut up to 3,000 jobs and write down costs of some computer 
lines, SGI's loss for the most recent quarter was $68 million, or 
37 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street had expected Mountain View, Calif.-based SGI to  
report an operating loss of 7 cents a share, according to a survey 
of analysts by First Call/Thompson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old high-tech company has lost money for two years  
as the supercomputer market continues to show weakness. SGI also 
has been hurt by stiff competition in the high-end computer 
workstation market from competitors such as Hewlett-Packard Co., 
IBM and Sun Microsystems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said also suffered in the current quarter from the  
sudden departure of Richard Belluzzo, the architect of SGI's 
turnaround plan, who became Microsoft Corp.'s head of Internet 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed with the results and the temporary loss of  
momentum that has resulted from the recent management transition'', 
said Robert Bishop, SGI's chairman and chief executive. ``I remain 
confident that by continuing to simplify our business we will be 
able to improve our execution and return to growth and 
profitability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell 5 percent to $585 million from $616.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Silicon Graphics rose 37 1/2 cents to $10 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> 9,000 Weather Radios Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Midland Consumer Radio Inc., of Kansas City,  
Mo., has recalled 9,000 incorrectly programmed weather radios. 
</P>
<P>
	The error can cause customers to miss important information  
about approaching severe weather, putting lives and property at 
risk, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only model 74-200 radios that have serial numbers beginning with  
904 or 905 are being recalled. The model and serial numbers are 
found on the bottom of the radio. Other Midland radios are not 
involved in this recall. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the programming error, the radio may not recognize  
certain signals broadcast by the National Weather Service, the 
commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	No incidents have been reported.  
</P>
<P>
	Electronic, hardware, mass merchandise stores and truck stops  
sold the radios nationwide from May until August of this year for 
about $70. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommends customers return the recalled radio to  
the original place of purchase for a new, correctly programmed, 
74-200 radio. For more information, customers are advised to call 
Midland Consumer Radio at (877) 302-1904.

<HEADLINE> US Nuclear Arsenal Once Fought Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the early years of America's monopoly on  
atomic weapons, civilian and military leaders fought behind the 
scenes over who should have custody of the small but growing 
arsenal, according to a newly declassified Pentagon history of the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``suspicion and distrust on both sides,'' the quiet  
struggle reached crisis proportions in 1948. Civilian leaders 
deemed the military unfit to maintain the new weapons; the military 
argued that it must have possession and control in order to be 
prepared to use the weapons on short notice. 
</P>
<P>
	In the summer of 1948, President Truman, citing the approaching  
elections, chose to let the tempest continue, according to the 
once-secret Pentagon document, ``History of the Custody and 
Deployment of Nuclear Weapons,'' written in 1978. The history was 
partially declassified this year and released in response to a 
Freedom of Information Act request by Robert S. Norris, a military 
historian. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military leaders grew increasingly concerned about the  
custody dispute as world tensions increased with the Soviet 
blockade of Berlin in June 1948, although the Soviets did not yet 
have their own nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	In the spring of 1949, a few months before the first Soviet  
nuclear test, a resolution began to emerge, allowing the military 
initially to control nuclear weapon assemblies positioned at bases 
overseas. Internal tensions eased, although more than a decade 
passed before the Defense Department gained full custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as now, the president retained final say over ordering the  
actual use of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say that the issue of civilian versus military control of  
atomic energy had been a burning, acrimonious issue for years would 
be an understatement of classic proportions,'' the Pentagon history 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even today arguments persist over responsibility for U.S.  
nuclear weapons and the vast network of laboratories and other 
installations associated with them. The Energy Department has 
control over research, development, manufacturing and testing of 
nuclear weapons, but after reports of Chinese stealing U.S. nuclear 
laboratory secrets, some in Congress called for the Pentagon to 
take those responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The first atomic bombs were built during World War II by the  
super-secret Manhattan Engineer District, run by Army Gen. Leslie 
R. Groves. Two were dropped on Japan in August 1945, ending the 
war. In late 1946 the small existing stockpile of nuclear weapons 
was transferred to control of the Atomic Energy Commission, a 
civilian agency whose first chairman was David Lilienthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Groves led the charge to win military custody of the weapons.  
Lilienthal was his chief antagonist. At a White House meeting in 
March 1948, one month after Groves retired, Truman cautioned the 
two sides that in view of troubling signs of communist aggressive 
intentions in Europe they had better find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who is writing a biography of Groves, said the Army  
general was offended at the civilians' position. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was wounded by all of this,'' Norris said. ``From his point  
of view, `You gave me the responsibility of building the bomb 
during the war, and now you don't trust me with it?''' Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
	The military pressed Defense Secretary James Forrestal to get  
Truman on their side. Truman said no. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to Secretary Forrestal, the president had informed  
him that it might be possible to re-examine this issue at a later 
date, perhaps after the fall elections,'' the Pentagon history 
says. In the months leading up to the November election Truman said 
custody should remain with civilian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, however, agreements were reached on giving  
the military a limited custodial role, and as of June 1949 military 
personnel of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project were involved 
in inspection of weapons and their routine maintenance at storage 
sites in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak of war on the Korean peninsula in June 1950 gave  
rise to more controversy over custody. Concerned about Soviet 
intentions in Europe, Truman authorized the first transfer of 
nuclear weapon components -- minus their nuclear explosive capsules 
-- to storage sites in the United Kingdom, Guam and aboard the U.S. 
Navy aircraft carrier Coral Sea in the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The military wanted control at overseas bases not just for the  
nuclear bomb components but also the U.S.-based nuclear capsules 
under Atomic Energy Commission control that would have to be flown 
in during a crisis. President Eisenhower approved the first such 
transfer of nuclear capsules to military control abroad in June 
1953.

<HEADLINE> ATM Surcharge Ban at US Bases Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon, moving to help financially  
strapped military personnel, has proposed banning ATM surcharges on 
all U.S. military bases, both in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department issued the proposal for public comment in  
August, and the comment period ended last Tuesday. A decision is 
expected within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal ``is a nuclear bomb that spells the beginning of  
the end of the ATM fee rip-off,'' Jon Golinger, consumer program 
director for California Public Interest Research Group, said in a 
statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His group is among several organizing a Nov. 2 ballot  
proposition banning ATM surcharges in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks levy the highly unpopular surcharges for the use of their  
automated teller machines by people who are not their customers. 
The fees come on top of any charges by the ATM users' own banks for 
using ATMs operated by other banks. The surcharges now average 
$1.20 at banks and $1.15 at savings and loans, according to a 
report the Federal Reserve submitted to Congress this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups oppose the surcharges, which are banned in  
Connecticut and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry generally defends them, insisting that ATM  
fees are clearly disclosed and are warranted for the 24-hour 
convenience ATMs give customers.

<HEADLINE> Study: Valium Can Be Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Valium and similar tranquilizers used to treat anxiety and  
insomnia could be reformulated to reduce such side effects as 
clumsiness and memory loss, researchers reported today in the 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Changing the drugs might also prevent them from intensifying the  
effects of alcohol, according to the study conducted by researchers 
at the University of Zurich, the Swiss Institute of Technology and 
Swiss pharmaceutical giant F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., which makes 
Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the results are quite exciting because there has been  
a lot of talk over the years about whether the therapeutic effects 
of tranquilizers can be isolated,'' said Dr. Patricia Kroboth at 
the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Human and animal brains are wired with receptors for  
gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA, a molecule that regulates mental 
states such as anxiety. Valium, or diazepam, is part of a family of 
drugs called benzodiazepines -- including Halcyon and Librium -- that 
ease anxiety by making the GABA receptors act more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that GABA receptors are found throughout the  
brain, so Valium affects other circuits, such as those that control 
attention and balance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss researchers created genetically altered mice in which  
one kind of GABA receptor was insensitive to benzodiazepines. That 
blocked some of the side effects of Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	Normal mice given Valium became sluggish, relaxed and showed  
poor memory, failing to remember how to avoid an electric shock. 
The gene-altered mice given the same dose remained active and 
avoided the shock. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe they can remake the tranquilizer, instead of  
the receptor, to work only on the specific GABA receptors in the 
brain that control anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	A small change in the chemical formula of Valium could allow  
people to take it without worrying about loss of memory or 
coordination, or possibly even addiction, said Hanns Moehler of the 
University of Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
	GABA receptors are nearly identical in humans and animals and  
work about the same way, Moehler said. But experts said any new 
versions of Valium and other tranquilizers are years away.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gun Buyback Program Has Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A state program designed to take  
illegal assault rifles off the streets has used only a fraction of 
its $1.4 million budget, spending about $80,000 to collect 350 SKS 
Sporters since January. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers gave the Department of Justice enough money to  
purchase 5,000 SKS Sporters from their owners. The state pays $230 
for each SKS Sporter. Gun dealers say the gun is actually worth 
about $130. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyback program gives gun owners a year to destroy their  
modified SKS Sporter, take the gun out of state or sell it to the 
state before it becomes illegal Dec. 31. After that date, anyone 
caught with an SKS Sporter with a detachable clip risks having 
their gun confiscated and being charged with a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the money and the amnesty offered, the guns are just  
``trickling in,'' said Janelle Beland, a spokeswoman for state 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer. The turnout may be an accurate 
reflection of how many guns are out there, but nobody knows, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales records on rifles, such as the SKS Sporter, erase personal  
information five days after the purchase. That includes names, the 
number of guns and the model, Beland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiautomatic rifle was manufactured in China. The original  
model held 10 shots, but a conversion kit would allow the user to 
attach a 30-round clip. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the National Rifle Association and the California  
Rifle and Pistol Association said the state Justice Department 
isn't seeing results because they aren't letting people know about 
the buyback and the impending deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people out there who become accidental  
felons under this, but if you don't hear about it, you can't do 
anything,'' Chuck Michel said.

<HEADLINE> Griese To Start for Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Brian Griese regained the starting quarterback job  
on Wednesday that he never really lost in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Confused? It's understandable these days as the Denver Broncos  
continue to search for a stable successor to John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese, promoted in the preseason, lost his job to Bubby Brister  
in the wake of Denver's 0-4 start, but he has led the Broncos to 
consecutive wins after a muscle strain prevented Brister from 
accepting his promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister threw on the side Wednesday and remains questionable for  
Sunday's game at New England. Griese's solid performances have made 
Brister's ailing rib muscle a moot point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian would still be the quarterback,'' coach Mike Shanahan  
said. ``I like the way he played. I like the way he handled 
himself, and we played well around him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griese, in his second year out of Michigan, seems to have gained  
confidence in the past two weeks, remaining poised in the pocket 
and scrambling when things break down. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw an interception Sunday but countered with two touchdown  
passes and another TD run. Griese also finished with 363 yards 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've come to learn that if you're given the starting job and  
have an opportunity to play, you need to respect that because it's 
not always going to be there and it's dependent on your 
performance,'' Griese said. ``I'm going to do everything I can to 
continue to prove (Shanahan) right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By no means is Griese's starting job permanent. Shanahan said he  
will continue to evaluate Brister's health as well as Griese's 
progression as a first-year starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's take this thing week by week,'' Shanahan said.  
``Hopefully he'll keep on playing like he's played. I'm going to 
have to make decisions in the best interest of the team, and it's 
hard to say right now when you're 2-4.''

<HEADLINE> House GOP Push Voucher Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House conservatives sought support Wednesday  
for a plan to give poor students $3,500 private school vouchers. 
Democrats battled to save a program aimed at ensuring equality for 
girls in America's classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came as the House debated the renewal of an  
$8.3 billion federal education bill that governs programs for 
nearly 11 million of the nation's impoverished and failing 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering modest changes to Title I, the  
34-year-old law designed to raise the historically low achievement 
of poor children. After Title I's last overhaul in 1994, it became 
a high standards program, shifting from its remedial focus. 
</P>
<P>
	The main point of contention Wednesday was private school  
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The House's second-ranking Republican, Rep. Dick Armey, promoted  
a plan that would provide elementary students on low-performing 
schools with vouchers of up to $3,500 to help pay for tuition at 
other schools -- public, private or parochial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are shifting the focus off the school and onto the  
student,'' Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students in any grade who are victims of a violent criminal act  
at school also can apply for the vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you tell a parent when their child comes home  
injured?'' he said. ``Do you say to a child that you have to go 
back to a school, even if the governor has said it is an academic 
disaster?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate Republicans appeared to offer little support while  
Democrats said the voucher plan could jeopardize the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee  
planned to oppose the provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main focus of this program is to improve Title I,'' said  
Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., a former school superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meantime, worked to save the Women's Educational  
Equity Act, a $3 million program intended to ensure girls are not 
deterred from taking the viorous courses in math, science and 
technology to which boys are attracted. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still a gender gap in America's schools,'' said Rep.  
Carrie Meek, D-Fla. ``We can't relax any of our efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the larger debate over Title I, Democrats sought to further  
target funding so it goes to the poorest of the nation's 50,000 
schools. Republicans want more flexibility for schools complaining 
of cumbersome federal rules and paperwork associated with a program 
that accounts for less than 10 percent of their total budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent series of reports from civil rights groups and  
conservatives has criticized the program, citing remaining gaps in 
the test scores and college attendance of poor and rich children. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the proposed changes lawmakers were considering Wednesday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Requiring parents of children in bilingual education to sign  
consent forms for the instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowing students with limited proficiency in English to be  
taught completely in their native languages instead of partially in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	--Making it more difficult to hire teacher's aides, in an effort  
to increase the number of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate Republican-backed bill would allow states more  
freedom in complying with Title I and other federal school 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend the Academic Achievement for All Act would turn  
federal education programs into a lump sum that states could invest 
in children who are neither poor nor low-achieving. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP was struggling to win votes for the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Yankees, Braves Have Rematch of '96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- To the winner goes the World Series trophy and a  
title -- Team of the Decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and the Atlanta Braves making their  
fifth trip in the 1990s and hoping to capture that elusive second 
title. Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams and the defending champion New 
York Yankees trying to win it all for the third time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a rematch of the '96 Series won by the Yankees, with Game 1  
Saturday night at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got another shot at them,'' Atlanta third baseman  
Chipper Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves derailed any chance of a Subway Series, beating the  
New York Mets 10-9 in 11 innings Tuesday night to win the NL 
Championship Series 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to go through both New York teams,'' Braves owner  
Ted Turner said. ``Nobody has ever done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matchup includes this twist -- for the first time, the World  
Series features teams that played during the regular season. Right 
after the All-Star break, Brian Jordan and Atlanta won two of three 
interleague games at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees wrapped up their record 36th pennant Monday night  
with a 6-1 victory at Boston to take the ALCS in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre, once fired by the Braves, will try to lead  
New York to its record 25th title and make the Yankees the first 
club to win two in a row since Toronto in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees and Braves both posted the best record in their  
leagues this season, and they did it the same way -- strong 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	ALCS MVP Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, David Cone, Roger  
Clemens and Andy Pettitte lead New York's rotation, and closer 
Mariano Rivera has been dominant, especially during his postseason 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine, Smoltz, Greg Maddux and Kevin Millwood lead the Braves,  
with excitable John Rocker in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	In three years of interleague play, the Braves and Yankees have  
split 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, Andruw Jones and Ryan Klesko each hit two homers  
and Jordan, who nearly signed with the Yankees in the offseason, 
drove in five runs against New York. Rivera and Hernandez were hit 
hard for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	For Atlanta, this is one last chance to win that elusive second  
Series title. The Braves reached the final eight NLCS of the decade 
and lead the majors with an 860-532 regular-season record since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Yankees, whose 784-607 record since 1991 is second-best  
in the majors, this is an opportunity to win their third Series 
title. New York reached the playoffs in the last five years of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll try to be team of the decade if that's what we're  
playing for,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``It will be a lot of 
fun.''

<HEADLINE> AOL, Gateway Form Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- America Online, the world's largest Internet  
service provider, is teaming with Gateway Inc., the country's 
leading seller of made-to-order personal computers, to market and 
distribute each other's products. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the two-year deal the companies announced Wednesday,  
AOL will invest $800 million in cash and equity securities in San 
Diego-based Gateway Inc.; $180 million of that in AOL stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway will spend $85 million to feature and market AOL  
products and services on its PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the Internet fans out into the mainstream ... people are  
looking for technology leaders like Gateway and AOL to drive out 
the complexity and simplify the Internet,'' said Jeff Weitzen, 
Gateway president and CEO. ``This exciting new relationship does 
just that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Pittman, AOL president and CEO, said pairing the companies  
is natural. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gateway was the first PC manufacturer to start its own  
internet service provider, recognizing that the Internet was a 
major reason why people buy PCs,'' Pittman said. ``We're pleased 
they have decided to work with AOL to take this business to the 
next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL will add the 600,000 subscribers to that successful ISP,  
Gateway.net, to its base of 18 million members and another 2 
million subscribers through its CompuServe subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway has 5 million customers and 180 stores nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
	The companies will collaborate on an online software store and  
offer computer and Internet training programs for AOL subscribers 
who own Gateway computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers who buy a Gateway computer will find AOL and  
Gateway.net installed on their PCs, and can choose either one as an 
Internet service provider. AOL will control the operation, billing 
and customer service for both Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials made the announcement after the U.S. markets  
closed in regular trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Dulles, Va.-based AOL reported third quarter net  
income of $184 million, or 15 cents per share, up from $50 million, 
or 4 cents per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway reported a net profit of $113.2 million, or 35 cents per  
split-adjusted share, for the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30. 
That's 40 percent higher than the same period last year, when 
Gateway earned $80.6 million, or 25 cents per split-adjusted share. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL expects to incur a pre-tax charge of $30 million in the  
fourth quarter of this year for costs associated with the deal; 
Gateway will report costs of $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to  
close by year's end.

<HEADLINE> Jays' Brumfield Chooses Free Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Jacob Brumfield has  
elected to become a free agent after refusing a minor league 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto also released right-handed pitcher John Hudek and  
outrighted catcher Kevin Brown to the Syracuse of the International 
League on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brumfield, 34, had two home runs and 19 RBIs in 62 games with  
the Jays after being claimed on waivers from the Los Angeles 
Dodgers on May 7. He started 44 games for Toronto this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudek, 33, appeared in three games for Toronto and was 0-0 with  
a 12.27 earned-run average. He opened the 1999 season with 
Cincinnati, was traded to Atlanta on April 16 for Mark Wohlers and 
then signed a minor-league contract with Toronto on July 31 after 
being released by Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	In 12 games with Syracuse, he was 0-2 with a 5.50 ERA.  
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 26, spent the majority of 1999 season with Syracuse where  
he hit .258 in 88 games with 13 home runs and 51 RBIs. He appeared 
in two games for Toronto in May and went 4-for-9 with two doubles. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stayner Charged in Yosemite Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIPOSA, Calif. (AP) -- Three months after he confessed to  
killing three women who were sightseeing in Yosemite National Park, 
motel handyman Cary Stayner was charged Wednesday with their 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Stayner, 38, could face the death penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	FBI investigators said Stayner confessed in late July to killing  
Carole Sund, 42, her daughter Juli Sund, 15, and their Argentine 
friend Silvina Pelosso, 16, while the three were visiting the park 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
	He confessed while being questioned in the beheading of Yosemite  
naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong, 26. Stayner, who also said he 
killed Ms. Armstrong, has pleaded innocent in that case. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had said they were waiting to charge Stayner in  
the sightseers' slayings until they could rule out the possibility 
that he had accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the FBI task force handling the case, who spoke on  
condition on anonymity, said he was ``stunned'' by the charges 
Wednesday, saying ``there are just too many unanswered questions'' 
about whether Stayner had accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Stayner told investigators and a TV reporter that he  
acted alone, some task force members have said they believe 
drug-abusing ex-cons might also have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner told the FBI he sexually assaulted Juli and Silvina in  
their motel room before killing them. He also led agents to the 
knives he said he had used to decapitate the naturalist and slash 
Juli's throat, a federal affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint filed Wednesday charges him with murder, burglary,  
robbery, forcible oral copulation and attempted rape. The charges 
came without any public comment by the FBI and only a short 
statement from Mariposa County District Attorney Christine Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, her daughter and teen-age friend were last seen at  
the Cedar Lodge motel, where Stayner worked. Relatives reported 
them missing Feb. 17 when they didn't arrive as planned in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The following month, authorities discovered the bodies of Mrs.  
Sund and Silvina in the trunk of their rental car, which had been 
set on fire and abandoned along a logging road. Juli's body was 
found a few days later in a thicket near a lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner was questioned repeatedly but never considered a suspect  
in the sightseers' deaths. Agents began searching for him again 
when he failed to show up for work the day after Armstrong's body 
was found in a remote corner of Yosemite, not far from the motel. 
He was arrested at a nudist camp three days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless there's a change in venue, the case will be tried in the  
state's oldest operating courthouse, in a courtroom with a 
wood-burning stove, where proceedings must pause every hour because 
of noise from the bell tolling in the clock tower.

<HEADLINE> Rockies Name Buddy Bell Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Describing himself a player's manager who will  
emphasize defense and team chemistry, Buddy Bell was hired 
Wednesday as the Colorado Rockies' new manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, 48, who managed the Detroit Tigers from 1996-98, becomes  
the third manager in the Rockies' seven-year history, succeeding 
Jim Leyland, who retired after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who worked for the Cincinnati Reds for the past year, most  
recently as director of player development, signed a three-year 
contract believed to be worth about $2.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan O'Dowd, hired as general manager a month ago, called Bell  
``the perfect fit for this ballclub. He knows the game. He knows 
how it should be played, and he will demand that from each and 
every one of our players. He understands the importance of creating 
an atmosphere where every player has the potential to play to the 
best of his ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd also promised that Bell will be surrounded with talent  
``to give Buddy the chance to put the kind of product on the field 
to realize our mission: having a championship-contending ballclub 
each and every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell didn't have those assurances in Detroit, where he guided  
the Tigers back to respectability but was fired late in his third 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished runnerup in the 1997 AL Manager of the Year  
balloting after leading the Tigers to a 79-83 record, a 26-game 
improvement over the previous year. But the Tigers cut their 
payroll for 1998, and Bell was fired on Sept. 1, 1998, after a 
52-85 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``My run in Detroit was great as long as it lasted,'' Bell said  
during a news conference. ``I think it taught me I could manage. It 
also taught me about getting along with people in the organization, 
how important scouting and player development are, the business 
side of things. Everybody has to work together. When you're a 
player, you don't necessarily understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the best fielding third basemen of his generation, Bell  
played 18 seasons in the majors for Cleveland, Texas, Cincinnati 
and Houston. A five-time All-Star, he hit .279 for his career with 
201 homers and 1,106 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell worked with O'Dowd when they were in the Cleveland  
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``My initial appeal for this job, obviously, was because of Dan  
O'Dowd,'' Bell said. ``I trust Dan's leadership, I enjoy his 
aggressiveness and I understand his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Dan O'Dowd is not the only reason that I'm here. I had  
other opportunities. I am not going to pick up my family and move 
to Colorado if I didn't think this was a great move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the negotiating process over Bell's contract, one of the  
final pieces to fall into place was Bell's willingness to move to 
Denver from his home in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies, who finished 72-90 this season, want to avoid a  
repeat of this summer when Leyland lived in the Colorado clubhouse 
while his family stayed in Pittsburgh. The Rockies also want their 
new manager to be more involved in the community and to have input 
in trade discussions and free-agent decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like players,'' Bell said. ``I prefer to give them the  
benefit of the doubt. I can be demanding at times, but I also 
understand how hard this game is to play. And I think that gives me 
a little edge on some other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said getting adjusted to the high-altitude dangers of Coors  
Field will take some time, but he has some theories. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an offensive ballpark,'' he said. ``Defense has to be  
a priority. You can't walk people, you can't make errors, you can't 
give up the extra base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is expected to retain Rockies hitting coach Clint Hurdle  
and third base coach Rich Donnelly from Leyland's staff. The team 
also has had discussions with Marcel Lachemann about becoming the 
pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need good people around me,'' Bell said. ``There are some  
guys I want to bring over here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said chemistry ``is a major part of any successful team. Look  
at the Yankees. They might not have the best talent, but they have 
the best team because they have guys who can play together. It's 
not necessarily the most talented team. I prefer that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd held interviews with several other candidates, including  
Arizona bench coach Carlos Tosca, Cincinnati coach Ken Griffey and 
Florida minor league manager Lynn Jones. O'Dowd also spoke with New 
York Yankees coach Willie Randolph by phone.

<HEADLINE> Drug Maker Lilly's Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Sales of the antidepressant Prozac fell  
sharply in the third quarter, but pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly &AMP; 
Co. still had enough strong sales from other drugs to post a 15 
percent increase in operating earnings, the company reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time gains, Lilly made $679.7 million, or 62 cents  
a share in the quarter, up from $518.2 million or 46 cents a share 
a year ago. Results matched forecasts of analysts surveyed by First 
Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the $67.8 million sale of its U.S. marketing rights  
for the antibiotic Lorabid to King Pharmaceuticals, Lilly earned 
$732.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 10 percent to $2.58 billion from $2.34 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Prozac, Lilly's best-selling drug and the world's top selling  
antidepressant, had sales of $690.2 million in the quarter, down 13 
percent from $789.1 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in Prozac sent Lilly shares down $4.25, or 6.1 percent,  
to $65.62 1/2, in New York Stock Exchange trading on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly attributed Prozac's decline to heavy stocking by  
wholesalers last year that made for a difficult comparison this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the company conceded that Prozac is feeling the effects  
of competition from newer antidepressants, which will cause annual 
Prozac sales to drop both this year and in 2000. Through the first 
nine months of this year, Prozac sales are down 5 percent to $2.07 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping make up the for Prozac's poor showing was Zyprexa,  
Lilly's antipsychotic drug. Zyprexa sales rose 27 percent to $502.9 
million during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our overall growth for the next several quarters will be  
generated from newer product sales, line extensions of existing 
products and recent product launches,'' said Sidney Taurel, Lilly 
chairman, president and chief executive officer. ``As a result, we 
will rely less on Prozac sales growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Zyprexa, newer Lilly drugs include the cancer treatment  
Gemzar, which had sales rise 72 percent to $119.2 milion, and the 
anti-blood-clotting agent ReoPro, which had sales increase 24 
percent to $107.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Actos, a new oral diabetes drug, had sales of $17.4 million  
since winning approval from the Food and Drug Administration on 
July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Another newer drug, the osteoporosis drug Evista, had sales of  
$92.8 million. The FDA gave Lilly approval during the quarter to 
market the drug as a treatment as well as a preventative for the 
bone-thinning disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first nine months of this year, Lilly earnings rose  
15 percent to $1.84 billion, or $1.69 per share, from $1.60 
billion, or $1.46 per share. Sales rose 9 percent to $71.8 billion.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Agrees To Buy Orange PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Germany's Mannesmann AG announced  
early Thursday it has agreed to buy Orange PLC, a British mobile 
phone company, for $32.93 billion in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann said its largest shareholder, Hong Kong investment  
firm Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. with a nearly 45 percent stake, has 
agreed to accept the offer, which would give it about a 10 percent 
interest in Mannesmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Orange shareholders will receive 0.0965 new  
Mannesmann share and $10.70 in cash for each Orange share held. 
That represents an 18 percent premium over Orange's Wednesday 
closing share price of $13.82. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a statement released by the companies, the Orange  
board ``considers the offer fair and appropriate and recommends 
unanimously its acceptance by Orange shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move by Germany's second-largest telecom concern comes after  
Deutsche Telekom agreed to buy One2One, a smaller British mobile 
phone company, for $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The liberalization of Europe's telecoms market has sparked a  
spate of cross-border competition. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, France Telecom announced plans to buy a majority  
stake in E-Plus, Germany's third-largest mobile phone network, for 
$7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Deutsche Telekom's chief for western Europe, Paul  
Grosse, said a deal to increase Telekom's presence in France is 
expected ``very shortly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have been feuding since  
their plan to form a global partnership was dealt a severe blow in 
May when the German company pursued an ill-fated attempt to merge 
with Telecom Italia.

<HEADLINE> Citadel Sex Bias Suit To Go Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A judge has ruled that The Citadel can be  
held liable if it is proven that five former students harassed a 
female cadet at the state-supported military college. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joseph Anderson ruled Tuesday that The  
Citadel can be tried for sexual discrimination since schools that 
receive federal funds can be sued under Title IX if one student 
sexually harasses another. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanie Mentavlos, one of four women admitted to the formerly  
all-male school in 1996, sued five former cadets, alleging she was 
hazed and harassed before she dropped out after one semester. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentavlos, of Charlotte, N.C., also alleges that Citadel  
officials violated her civil rights by failing to act against male 
upperclassmen who were hostile about the admission of women. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge dismissed about half of her 34 complaints and ruled  
that the former cadets should be tried separately from the school. 
Anderson said there was evidence The Citadel may have covered up 
the allegations, but did not say what that evidence was. 
</P>
<P>
	The former cadets are scheduled to go to trial first, on Nov.  
12. Anderson said he does not want testimony from The Citadel to 
taint the jury's decision against the men. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cadets had nothing to do with the cover-up by the  
school,'' he said. Anderson said he will make a written decision on 
claims against the school pending the outcome of the former cadets' 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims Ms. Mentavlos suffered ``insults,  
indignities, physical assault and humiliating treatment which went 
far beyond any need to toughen, strengthen or acclimate plaintiff 
to the rigors of military discipline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Dawes Cooke, who represents The Citadel, said Mentavlos  
has presented ``a shotgun blast of numerous types of things.'' But 
Mentavlos' attorney, Dick Harpootlian, said he can prove a pattern 
of harassment that the school did nothing to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Citadel cadets prey on those who are different,''  
Harpootlian said. ``Everything that was done was not because she 
couldn't cut it, it's because she was a woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mentavlos, who graduated from Queens College in Charlotte, N.C.,  
and is teaching sixth grade, had said earlier she looked forward to 
a jury trial, but referred comment to her attorney after Tuesday's 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon Faulkner became the first female cadet when she entered  
The Citadel under a court order in 1995. She dropped out after less 
than a week, citing the stress of the court fight and her isolation 
in the corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Messer, another female cadet admitted with Mentavlos in  
1996, settled a lawsuit against The Citadel last year for $33,750. 
In May, Nancy Mace became The Citadel's first female graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the second beating incident at The Citadel in a week  
has resulted in an injured cadet leaving the military school 
Tuesday with 14 stitches over one eye and an injured head. 
</P>
<P>
	Another incident this month led to aggravated assault and  
battery charges against James Edward Trabert, 23, of Bellefontaine, 
Ohio, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to affidavits filed by four alleged victims , Trabert  
allegedly punched them in the ribs and kidneys, slapped in their 
face and hit them with a broom. Two were burned with a cigarette, 
one on his back, the other on his hand.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Encyclopedia Britannica, all 32 volumes and 44  
million words of it, has been made available for free via the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The retooled Web site -- http://www.Britannica.com -- was launched  
Tuesday and also includes daily news and links to related sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 230 years of editorial experience, and we feel that  
the Internet provides us with the best possibility yet of reaching 
the most people,'' said James Strachan, managing director of the 
company's Internet division. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times newspaper said Wednesday that the move comes amid  
collapsing sales of the printed version caused mainly by the 
falling price of personal computers, which are seen as a cheaper 
and more effective educational tool than a bulky set of books. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will continue publishing in book format, with the  
latest volume to be issued in 2001. It is also available on CD ROM. 
</P>
<P>
	The encyclopedia set, whose book set now takes up four feet of  
shelf space, was first published in 1768 in Scotland. It was 
introduced in the United States in 1888. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based company, owned by Swiss financier Jacob Safra,  
said it hopes to increase revenue by selling advertising space on 
the Web site and offering products associated with its reference 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	``By putting the Encyclopedia Britannica online we can reach 200

feel that even though we are supplying a substantial amount of 
content for free, we have a secure business plan for the future.''

<HEADLINE> GM, Canadian Union Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Canadian Auto Workers bargainers have reached a  
tentative agreement on a contract with General Motors Corp. and 
union members are expected to ratify it this weekend, union 
President Buzz Hargrove said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year deal reached Tuesday night includes raises of 4.5  
percent a year, an extra paid week off and a $670 signing bonus, 
Hargrove said in a telephone interview from his Toronto hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract also calls for a 25 percent pension increase over  
six years, and for retirement incentives that could apply to 7,000 
workers over the next six years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM agreed not to sell or close any of its Canadian plants during  
the life of the proposed contract, Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expects his 22,000 GM members to easily ratify the  
pact. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic package, I believe, will stand up to the scrutiny  
of our membership and their families,'' Hargrove said. ``Other 
workers in the country can take courage from what our workers are 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers staged a brief wildcat strike early today at a General  
Motors plant in Oshawa, Ontario. ``A handful of people ... set up 
picket lines at one gate,'' Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed that local issues concerning working conditions  
were behind the walkout by an estimated 100 to 150 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Tony LaRocca said their action delayed work for  
about two hours at Plant 2, which makes Monte Carlo and Impala 
models. Operations were not disrupted at the nearby truck plant and 
Plant 1, which makes Buicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement follows the pattern CAW negotiators reached  
earlier with Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	``GM of Canada has enhanced its commitment to Canada and our  
employees with substantial new capital investment and jobs,'' GM 
said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	A key breakthrough in the talks came Monday, when GM agreed to  
keep open through September 2002 its Ste. Therese, Quebec, assembly 
plant that builds Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tentative agreement, Hargrove said, GM agreed to study  
the feasibility of producing a low-volume, high-end ``niche'' 
vehicle like DaimlerChrysler's Dodge Stealth at Ste. Therese after 
Camaro and Firebird production ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreement also reflects GM's decision Monday to  
withdraw a proposal to contract out hundreds of Canadian jobs. 
Hargrove had said the CAW was ready to strike over GM's plans to 
shift between 700 and 1,300 jobs from its own factories to outside 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the United Auto Workers in the United States, the CAW  
does not settle its national contract until all its local contracts 
are done. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike would have halted production of several GM products and  
cut off the flow of engines, transmissions and other key components 
to many GM plants in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1996 contract talks, the CAW struck GM's Oshawa, Ontario,  
assembly plant, idling some U.S. parts and assembly plants.

<HEADLINE> Russians Reject U.S. ABM Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia has turned down a U.S. proposal to amend  
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty in exchange for U.S. help in 
completing a major defense radar, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials on Sunday offered to help finish a radar  
installation near Irkutsk, Siberia, in exchange for Russia's 
consent to alter the ABM so that both countries could establish 
limited national missile defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said that  
Russia was against ``bargaining'' on the ABM. ``We aren't 
negotiating any kind of amendments to the ABM,'' he said at a 
briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy chief of General Staff of the Russian armed forces Col.  
Gen. Valery Manilov went a step further, saying today that ``there 
can't be any compromise on the treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington wants to amend the ABM treaty, which was key to  
starting arms control pacts during the Cold War, so that both 
countries can defend themselves against nuclear attacks by rogue 
nations such as North Korea. It argues that a national missile 
defense system wouldn't compromise the ABM, because it would only 
be capable of shooting down a few missiles -- not providing a shield 
against a massive missile attack of the kind Russia is capable of 
launching. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russian officials have not been impressed by that argument,  
and warn that the United States would upset strategic stability and 
could trigger a new arms race if the ABM treaty is altered. 
</P>
<P>
	Manilov said that Russia views the U.S. intention to revise the  
ABM as a ``threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The attempts by the United States to quit the ABM treaty  
objectively destroy the entire system of arms control and arms 
reduction agreements,'' he said, according to the Interfax news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. delegation led by Undersecretary of State John D. Holum  
is to begin another round of talks in Moscow on Thursday. The 
topics will include the ABM treaty and prospects of additional 
weapons cuts. Previous talks have brought no progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have welcomed the U.S. proposal to negotiate a  
START III treaty that could cut arsenals to 2,000 to 2,500 warheads 
on each side, but said it would only be possible if the ABM treaty 
is upheld. 
</P>
<P>
	The new treaty also can't be formally agreed upon until the  
Russian parliament ratifies the 1993 START II treaty, which would 
halve U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996, but Communists and  
other hard-liners dominating the lower house of Russian parliament 
have balked at its approval, saying the START II hurts Russia's 
security.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Disability to Work Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans with disabilities would be able to  
seek employment without the fear they will lose their 
government-funded health coverage under legislation moving toward 
congressional passage. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Tuesday voted 412-9 for the bill that would allow  
Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries to keep their 
Medicare coverage for up to 10 years after getting a job. That's 
six years beyond the current law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has passed a similar bill and President Clinton is  
urging Congress to send him a bill that ensures continued health 
benefits to working people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost three out of four Americans with severe disabilities  
who want to work are not working,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
``One of the biggest barriers these Americans face is the fear of 
losing their health insurance when they get a job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most dramatic breakthrough for Americans with  
disabilities since the Americans with Disabilities Act,'' said Rep. 
Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., the chief sponsor. That 1990 act required 
businesses and offices to make facilities more accessible to the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of Americans are awaiting eagerly to unleash their  
creativity and to pursue the American dream,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional auditors estimate that 35,000 people will find  
jobs over the next 10 years with the help of the legislation. The 
bill will also more than quadruple, to 550,000, the number of 
people who will receive rehabilitation and employment services over 
the next decade. The nation has some 9 million disabled adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said that if one percent of those with  
disabilities move off welfare programs as a result of the bill the 
government would save $3 billion over the lifetime of those 
benefits. ``We want people to take the risk to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who led efforts to pass the Senate  
bill, said the House bill was a significant step toward opening the 
workplace doors for the disabled. He urged the convening of a 
House-Senate conference as early as this week so that a compromise 
bill can be passed before Congress adjourns this year. 
</P>
<P>
	One difference is that the Senate grants lifetime Medicare for  
SSDI recipients who go to work, but only during the next six years. 
They also come up with different ways to pay for the costs of the 
bill, which for the House bill is expected to total $323 million 
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills would also give states the option of extending  
Medicaid to those in the Supplemental Security Income program for 
low-income people, allowing them to pay premiums as their income 
grows. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would provide disability beneficiaries with a  
``ticket'' that can be used to purchases services to enter the 
workforce. To increase competition, those with disabilities could 
choose between government and privately run rehabilitation 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine Republicans -- John Doolittle of California, David McIntosh  
of Indiana, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Sam 
Johnson and Ron Paul of Texas, and Utah's James Hansen, Merrill 
Cook and Christopher Cannon voted against the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1180.

<HEADLINE> South Poll Doctor Has Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Nearly five months after she found a lump in  
her breast, a doctor rescued from the South Pole confirmed that she 
has cancer and she will undergo treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerri Nielsen, 47, continued to shy away from international  
attention, saying she would not grant any interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The diagnosis of breast cancer has been confirmed and I will  
undergo treatment. My spirit is strong,'' Nielsen said Tuesday in 
her first public statement since returning to the United States on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be back with my family and friends in the United  
States,'' she said in the statement issued through the National 
Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, of the Youngstown, Ohio area, treated herself with  
chemotherapy until she was rescued Saturday from the Amundsen-Scott 
South Pole Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The only doctor among the 41 researchers at the station, Nielsen  
discovered a lump in her breast in June. She had medical supplies 
dropped to her a month later during a daring mercy mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplies allowed her to perform her own biopsy and begin  
self-treatment with chemotherapy. She e-mailed photographs of slide 
samples of the tumor to doctors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her illness, Nielsen kept busy with her duties up until  
she left the South Pole, said her sister-in-law, Diana Cahill. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's rescue from the coldest place on Earth was possible  
only after the Antarctic winter relented slightly, making it warm 
enough -- 58 degrees below zero -- to risk the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the rescue operation was possibly the earliest  
ever post-winter flight to the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	In her statement, Nielsen thanked those who rescued her and  
helped with her treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heartfelt thanks go out to my South Pole friends,  
colleagues and the general public for their encouragement and best 
wishes during my ordeal,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Says Bite Comment Was Hype </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson's bark sometimes seems worse than  
his bite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just talking smack, just hyping the fight,'' Tyson said  
when asked about a Los Angeles Times story in which he indicated he 
wouldn't hesitate to bite an opponent again in certain situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just blowing off hot air,'' the former undisputed  
heavyweight champion said Wednesday at a news conference for his 
10-round fight against Orlin Norris on Saturday night in the MGM 
Grand. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was disqualified and had his license revoked for biting  
Evander Holyfield's ears in the third round June 28, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would do it again under those circumstances. (Referee) Mills  
Lane wasn't protecting me (from head butts). He didn't handle the 
situation appropriately,'' Tyson said in the Oct. 3 story in the 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to sell some tickets,'' Tyson said. ``The Nevada  
State Athletic Commission knew I wasn't serious. They knew the 
trauma that I went through. I won't do that in the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Ratner, executive director of the commission, said what  
Tyson said was ``what we call newspaper talk. What he does in the 
ring is the only thing we can judge him on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Steele of Las Vegas will be the referee Saturday night.  
The judges, all of Las Vegas, will be Dave Moretti, Dalby Shirley 
and Art Lurie. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Norris said he is concentrating on Tyson's  
punch, not his bite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm expecting an action kind of fight,'' said the former WBA  
cruiserweight champion with a 50-5 record, with 27 knockouts. ``I 
know he's going to hit me and I'll hit him. I just have to avoid 
the big punch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm bringing some pain,'' said the 33-year-old Tyson (46-3, 40  
knockouts), who will be fighting for the first time since he 
knocked out Francois Botha with a right to the jaw in the fifth 
round Jan. 16. Botha had won the first four rounds on two official 
cards and won three of four on the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't a good experience,'' Tyson said, ``but it was a  
sensational ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the victory over Botha, Tyson was jailed in Maryland  
for assaulting two motorists after a fender-bender. He was released 
from jail May 24 after serving 3 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson made a comeback in 1995 from three years in an Indiana  
prison on a rape conviction and again this year after being idle in 
1998. His license had been revoked because of the Holyfield fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not too many people could start over as many times as I did,''  
Tyson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be shown live on Showtime, with the telecast to  
begin at 11 p.m. EDT. Roberto Garcia's IBF junior lightweight title 
defense against Diego Corrales also will be televised live, and 
taped highlights of a heavyweight bout between David Tua and Shane 
Sutcliffe earlier on the card will be shown. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's fight could be delayed until the first game of the World  
Series ends, but Jay Larkin of Showtime said the latest the bout 
will begin is midnight EDT.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- And they call it the City of Brotherly Love.  
</P>
<P>
	Pianist Ivo Pogorelich canceled an appearance at Carnegie Hall  
in New York just days after being booed in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgrade-born pianist known for his expressive but peculiar  
interpretations was supposed to have performed Tuesday night at 
Carnegie with the Philadelphia Orchestra. But he canceled at the 
last minute, citing ``personal reasons,'' said the orchestra's 
artistic administrator, Simon Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Pogorelich played an unconventional interpretation  
of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concert No. 2, finishing the piece in 52 
minutes instead of the the usual 32. The audience booed and 
applause was scant. 
</P>
<P>
	Pogorelich did not immediately return calls Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Higher; Grains Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices edged higher in early  
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid concerns over dry 
weather that could harm the crop in Argentina. Grains were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean gains were expected to be limited, however, as prices  
press toward the $5-a-bushel benchmark that continues to be elusive 
as farmers sell before it reaches that level. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures were mixed, pressured by news that Mexico intends  
to severely restrict duty-free imports from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices were boosted by dry conditions in northern  
Argentina as well as the southwestern U.S. Plains. Investors also 
were anticipating a tender by Egypt for U.S. or Australian hard 
wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1 cent to $2.64 cents a bushel;  
December corn rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.02 3/4 a bushel; December oats were 
unchanged at $1.09 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 2 1/2 cents to 
$4.97 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures were mixed in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle fell .55 cent to 69.72 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle fell .55 cent to 82.05 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs fell .07 cent to 48.90 cents a pound; February 
frozen pork bellies rose .38 cent to 66.40 cents a pound.

<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Director Daniel Myrick, who helped make  
the low-budget blockbuster ``The Blair Witch Project,'' says he 
doesn't want to be pigeonholed. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, co-directed by Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, originally  
cost about $70,000. It has taken in about $140 million and only 
recently fell out of the box office top 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every producer in L.A. dusted off some old bad script and sent  
it to us'' after the ``Blair Witch'' success, Myrick said. ``But we 
didn't want to be pigeonholed into doing horror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myrick's fans greeted him Tuesday night during his appearance at  
the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He said he was unprepared 
for sudden fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden you're doing a photo shoot for Premiere

</P>
<P>
	Myrick and Sanchez are working on a film comedy called ``Heart

<HEADLINE> Dole's Departure Frames GOP Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole's departure leaves a swiftly  
shrinking Republican presidential field dominated by George W. 
Bush, with The Millionaire and The Senator seeking firmer footing 
against The Front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of other Republicans are seeking the White House, but  
they will struggle to compete with Bush's fund-raising machine, 
Steve Forbes' personal wealth and Arizona Sen. John McCain's 
compelling prisoner-of-war story. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line remains money,'' Dole said Wednesday,  
embittered by the cold reality of today's politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 12 Republicans who sought the presidency this year, five  
already have given up. Soon it will be six; Pat Buchanan's advisers 
say he will bolt the GOP on Monday to seek the Reform Party 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave Bush, Forbes, McCain and:  
</P>
<P>
	--Gary Bauer, a little known Washington activist who is giving  
Forbes a run for his money in the race to solidify the party's most 
conservative voters. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, a late-entry who is given little  
chance of breaking through. 
</P>
<P>
	--Broadcaster Alan Keyes, an inspiring speaker who is also a  
marginal candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a game of musical chairs, another chair has been taken  
away,'' said Republican consultant Alex Castellanos of Alexandria, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Dole's decision focuses more attention on the  
remaining candidates and we're getting closer to the inevitable 
two-way matchup. We'll have to see who it is. George W. vs. Steve 
Forbes? Or George W. vs. John McCain?'' said Castellanos, who 
worked on the 1996 presidential campaign of Dole's husband, former 
Senator Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``The contest now begins for No. 2 --the alternative to Bush,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor is likely to inherit most of Dole's  
supporters, though their number was not large enough to keep her in 
the race. Dole campaign manager, Tom Daffron, said internal polls 
showed that Bush was the second choice of her backers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could he lose? Sure,'' Daffron said. ``Is it likely? No.''  
</P>
<P>
	Yet this was not welcome news to Bush supporters, some of whom  
had quietly urged Dole to remain in the race. Her celebrity status 
helped to dilute the media's attention from the cautious 
front-runner, and her candidacy further divided anti-Bush votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor does not want to be put in the same position as  
Vice President Al Gore, who has one rival -- Bill Bradley -- sucking 
up every non-establishment vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is Bush would probably rather have four people  
chasing him than three people chasing him. The more diffuse the 
field, the harder it is for any of them to get traction,'' said Ed 
Gillespie, who worked for John Kasich until the Ohio lawmaker 
dropped out of the presidential race in July and endorsed Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Forbes hope to seize the opportunity.  
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizona senator and former Vietnam prisoner of war,  
has narrowed Bush's lead in polls for New Hampshire's initial 
primary. He also is benefiting from the publicity generated by his 
best-selling autobiography and the failed fight to pass campaign 
finance reform legislation in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Money could be a problem for McCain, who has raised about $7.5  
million. Bush has raised about $57 million and Forbes has spent 
nearly $20 million of his own money, raising questions about the 
senator's staying power after the early primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	He has enough money, however, to raise alarms in the Bush  
campaign. They view him as a threat in New Hampshire and South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't spent a dime on televison or radio and, even without  
paid media, I've gotten traction so money hasn't been the key. It's 
been my message ..., '' McCain said in a telephone interview from 
New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain hopes to benefit from an expected ad war between Bush and  
Forbes, who has a history of going negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has yet to convert his money into widespread support. The  
wealthy conservative is stuck in low single digits in national 
polls. He draws second-tier support in New Hampshire polling. 
</P>
<P>
	A multimillion-dollar advertising campaign has helped Forbes in  
Iowa, where he is a clear second to Bush in polls. He also is 
pushing a blizzard of proposals, including a major economic plan 
this week, to stand in contrast with what he considers to be a 
shallow front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the celebrity, star-quality candidacy getting out of the  
race, we're allowed some serious running room to get our message 
out,'' said senior adviser Greg Mueller. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes may be distracted, however, by the sidebar competition  
for conservatives. Bauer has raised $5.3 million and is not doing 
any worse than Forbes in national polls. Nearly half of his 
contributions have come from women, the highest percentage in the 
field and a sign that he is more likely than Forbes to pick up 
Dole's conservative supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you spent millions and millions of dollars and it hasn't  
gotten you anywhere in the polls, I don't understand why a guy like 
Forbes would be in the first tier,'' said Bauer's campaign manager, 
Frank Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer may be that Dole is right: Money is the bottom line  
in modern politics. ``Money does become the message,'' Dole said in 
her farewell address. ``And when that happens, it makes it pretty 
tough.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Torre Still Has the Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Joe Torre wasn't sure if he was in the right  
place, wasn't convinced his heart was into managing the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer will do that.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, last month in Toronto's SkyDome, with the Yankees'  
division lead dwindling, he learned something about himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, my stomach started hurting and I realized the  
passion was there,'' he said early Tuesday after leading New York 
past Boston and into the World Series for the third time in his 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the fifth Yankees manager to win three pennants, joining  
Casey Stengel (10), Joe McCarthy (eight), Miller Huggins (six) and 
Ralph Houk (three). 
</P>
<P>
	And now the 59-year-old New Yorker will face a World Series  
opponent that fired him, the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	But for a while, he wasn't sure he belonged.  
</P>
<P>
	He was diagnosed with cancer during spring training and left the  
team March 10. He had surgery eight days later and didn't rejoin 
the Yankees until May 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``When that whole thing started with the prostate cancer in  
spring training, you really didn't care about baseball,'' he said 
under the Fenway Park stands, trying to put his team's season and 
his life in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go through that -- and when you're going through your  
recovery, you're not sure if you're going to care when you get 
back. Then, once I got back, it was sort of like, let me study 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Torre rejoined the team, he kind of drifted along, as his  
team did for much of the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot of my players had said I was a little bit  
different because I sort of had this philosophy or perspective that 
it's only a game of baseball,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York opened a comfortable lead and wasn't really pressed  
until the Red Sox swept a three-game series at Yankee Stadium from 
Sept. 10-12. David Wells beat them the next night, and the Yankees 
were losing 5-1 -- knowing Boston was ahead and could close to 2 1/2 
games -- before Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill hit grand slams. 
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' Torre said, ``probably was an emotional turnaround for  
me and I realized how important this was for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, his brother, Frank, had a heart transplant. The story  
of the Torres riveted New York, with Joe finally making the World 
Series for the first time since joining the major leagues in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Torre felt tremendous pressure to win the Series  
after the team went 114-48 during the regular season, setting an AL 
record for wins. 
</P>
<P>
	But since that night in Toronto, Torre has felt he belonged.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the postseason, it's identical to last year, maybe even a  
little more so,'' he said. ``I'm all the way back as far as the 
emotion of what I'm doing. But it's been a wild year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even George Steinbrenner, who spent the 1970s and '80s changing  
managers as often as some teams changed their starting rotations, 
praises Torre. Of course, it's easy for The Boss. Torre wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your manager comes through like that, he inspires them,''  
Steinbrenner said early Tuesday. ``He's definitely been an 
inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players agree. Torre has a knack to say exactly the right thing,  
all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows how to handle every player individually,'' Derek  
Jeter said. ``But he also knows how to handle people 
collectively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre knew the year would be difficult before he went to Florida  
in February, but he was thinking only about the baseball part. New 
York has spent the better part of the last year being measured 
against the 1998 Yankees, a contest they can't win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to warn the club in spring training that we cannot  
compete against ourselves because that's a once-in-a-lifetime-type 
thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to earn it this year. Last year, when we won so many  
games, a lot of ball clubs felt they sort of didn't have a chance 
against us. This year, I don't want to say they played harder, but 
I think they had a better shot at us. It was probably more 
satisfying this year.''

<HEADLINE> Dole Quits Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole abandoned her bid to be  
America's first woman president, giving up Wednesday in the shadow 
of Republican front-runner George W. Bush's outsized bankroll. 
``The odds are overwhelming,'' she told tearful supporters. ``It 
would be futile to continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a near-wistful nod to the historic implications, President  
Clinton called Dole's departure from the race ``a loss to the 
Republican Party and a loss to the country that she couldn't go 
forward'' because of finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth GOP candidate to drop out months before the first  
primaries, Dole leaves Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain and 
conservative millionaire Steve Forbes in the top tier of the seven 
remaining Republican contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Allies immediately buzzed about Dole's prospects for second  
place on any GOP ticket hoping to draw women voters. While Dole 
said emphatically she has not considered the vice presidency, she 
added, ``I'm a long way from the twilight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's campaign attracted new voters -- particularly young and  
professional women -- to the Republican Party. She finished strong 
in an early political contest -- Iowa's non-binding straw poll in 
August -- and displayed a practiced polish on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
	But she was unable to translate that into higher poll rankings  
or increased fund raising. Though second place in many national 
polls -- she hovered around 10 percent -- she trailed McCain in New 
Hampshire and lagged well behind Bush everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of rumors spread by rivals that she would quit, Dole  
turned the talk to truth in a speech tinged with bitterness for the 
fortunes held by Bush and Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Her schedule had her racing through 108 fund raisers this year,  
but still she came up with just $5 million to Bush's $56 million. 
``It's money, money, money,'' she complained to her finance 
committee as she told them of her decision in a morning conference 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	She made up her mind alone on Sunday night, she said, during the  
five-hour flight home from a Seattle campaign stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Insistent on meticulous preparation, Dole frustrated some  
supporters by putting off -- then toning down -- big policy addresses 
and neglecting to take advantage of her strong third-place showing 
in the Iowa straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than stick it out and hope for a revival in upcoming GOP  
debates, Dole wanted to get out now, aides said, before spending 
herself into debt just to meet ballot-access deadlines in key 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning ``quietly but effectively'' in 1996, Bush locked up  
GOP endorsements and big money raisers before Dole had even 
resigned her presidency of the nonpartisan American Red Cross, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican strategist Mary Matalin, a Bush ally, scoffed,  
``What's the implication? That she didn't have a network? That's 
ridiculous, the wife of a former senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's televised concession in a cramped hotel meeting room  
echoed exactly the promise her husband made to supporters when he 
lost the 1996 presidential election: ``We will meet again, and 
often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole stood behind his wife Wednesday, his whole face  
trembling as he fought tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary O'Connor, who ran Dole's fund raising in Georgia, said the  
country wasn't ready for a woman president. ``I found, 'Oh, I'd 
love her as No. 2,' from both men and women,'' O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said she would ``take some time'' before endorsing another  
Republican. One aide said Dole is likely to support Bush but had 
figured on holding off that endorsement as long as McCain was in 
the race -- reciprocation for the way McCain hung in with Bob Dole 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	That calculus no longer holds, the aide said on condition of  
anonymity, now that Elizabeth Dole blames McCain's campaign for 
peddling the ``Dole's getting out'' rumors that further hurt her 
fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in New Hampshire, McCain saluted Dole's ``dignity  
and grace'' and said, ``Someday a woman will be president of the 
United States and Elizabeth Dole will have led the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush called her a friend who shared with him the same ideas on  
education and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	After Dole's press conference, her pollster Linda DiVall  
predicted Dole would ``go to the top of the list'' of vice 
presidential candidates because the GOP, which loses huge numbers 
of women voters to Democrats, needs a woman to counter the ``dour, 
sort of scolding demeanor'' of the Republican Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's advisers said the Texas governor would consider Dole but  
is more likely to favor a running mate who's already been elected 
to public office. Dole would be an obvious choice for a post in 
Bush's Cabinet, these advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Cabinet secretary said nothing of her future, except  
that she wanted to help get other women involved in politics. On 
the campaign trail, Dole said, she saw women in her audiences ``sit 
up a little straighter,'' empowered by her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Democrats who despise Dole's take on policy, seemed to  
mourn her campaign's demise. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole ``helped get it into the public mind that a woman could do  
this and be taken seriously,'' said Patricia Ireland, president of 
the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
	Geraldine Ferraro, who ran as the No. 2 on Walter Mondale's 1984  
Democratic ticket, said: ``I would have loved it if (Dole) had 
gotten to the point where she would have been in debate with these 
guys because you would have really seen her able to address the 
issues calmly and well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Dole's New Hampshire headquarters, a hand-lettered poster  
board went up Wednesday, reading, ``We made history.''

<HEADLINE> Vaccine May Fight Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A team of Johns Hopkins Oncology Center  
researchers has developed a vaccine that helps strengthen the 
body's immune system against prostate cancer, according to a study 
published in the journal Cancer Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, released Tuesday, showed a vaccine can trigger the  
immune system to fight cancer in the manner that it fights 
infection, said Dr. Jonathan Simons, who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, people have said there is no way to turn the immune  
system against prostate cancer,'' he said. ``We were astounded to 
find that every part of the immune system was alerted and turned 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers injected eight of 11 prostate cancer patients with a  
genetically engineered vaccine. The patients had their prostates 
removed prior to the clinical trials, but their cancer was still 
spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	An immune response was detected in all eight patients. Attempts  
to culture a vaccine from cells taken from the three remaining 
patients were not successful, Simons said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the immune systems of the eight patients appeared to be  
attacking the cancer, the response was not strong enough to cause 
tumor shrinkage or remission of the cancer. Additional research is 
being conducted to strengthen the immune response, Simons said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reeducated the immune system to recognize prostate cancer  
cells as a potential infection and attack them,'' said Simons. 
</P>
<P>
	The experiment produced not only the release of T-cells as  
researchers had hoped, but also the production of antibodies 
against cancer, Simons said. Both are key weapons of the immune 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Simons cautioned that it is too early to draw any conclusions  
from the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William J. Catalona, director of urologic surgery at  
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said the 
results seem promising, but cancer patients shouldn't hang their 
hopes on such vaccines in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to have a person who might live in Peoria  
uproot themselves and travel halfway across the country in hopes 
that there's going to be a treatment that's going to cure them, 
when it's really in its development stages,'' said Catalona, who 
was not involved in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 330,000 men in the United States develop prostate cancer  
each year and 40,000 die annually from the illness. It is the 
fourth-leading cancer killer in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Hopkins study, scientists removed tumors from each of the  
11 patients, chopped up the tissue and grew them on laboratory 
culture dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	A gene called GMF-CSF, which produces a protein that alerts  
tissues to the presence of foreign substances, was inserted into 
the cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine was then irradiated to prevent any further cancerous  
growth and injected into the patients' thighs, like a flu shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gene we used to turn on the immune system is so good that  
it activates everything,'' said Dr. William Nelson, who was part of 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have used the technique on many different types of  
cancer, but the new study represents the first time researchers 
have been able to activate the entire human immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns Hopkins researchers will now begin recruiting patients  
with advanced prostate cancer for larger trials of the vaccine, a 
university spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was funded by the National Cancer Institute, the  
Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Initiative and the CaP Cure 
Foundation, founded by financier Michael Milken.

<HEADLINE> British Protest Beef Ban in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French police on Wednesday prevented a group of  
well-heeled British lawmakers from handing out fliers and 
displaying banners decrying a ban on British beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest on the capital's famed Champs-Elysees fell flat  
because the lawmakers, British members of the European Parliament, 
failed to seek permission to hold their demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Arc de Triomphe, the 12 politicians and their  
entourage unfurled a banner reading ``Let them eat cake -- Marie 
Antoinette, 1789. Let them eat British beef -- Tory European 
Parliament members, 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But police ordered the protesters to fold up their banners and  
put away their fliers, leaving them with little to attract 
attention as they headed toward the British Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	The representatives said they were expressing outrage on behalf  
of British farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been doing this diplomatically so far, writing letters  
and lobbying,'' said Chris Heaton-Harris, representative for the 
East Midlands. ``It was time to take action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In August, the European Union lifted a ban on British beef  
imposed in March 1996, saying the meat was safe for international 
sale as fears waned over the illness known as ``mad cow disease.'' 
Evidence has linked the disease with a fatal human brain condition, 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, France said it would continue to ban the imports,  
based on a recommendation from its food safety committee. Britain 
suspects the ban is an excuse to protect French beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute has pitted the two countries against each other,  
with Britain threatening to take legal action and France 
maintaining that its move was not protectionist but a sincere fear 
that beef from the United Kingdom might still pose health threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists on an EU advisory committee are currently examining  
whether the embargo is justified. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative lawmakers, who met with the British ambassador  
and French officials, said they discussed measures that Britain 
could take if France maintains the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``France's action has lowered consumer confidence in other  
countries,'' said Struan Stevenson, a representative from Scotland. 
``If France doesn't comply with the EU recommendations, it could 
cost them.''

<HEADLINE> Teens Accused of Prostituting Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Two teen-age girls were accused of allegedly  
prostituting a 12-year-old girl to male students at a Detroit high 
school, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cooley High School girls, ages 14 and 15, were charged as  
adults with first-degree criminal sexual conduct, said Nancy Diehl, 
deputy chief and director of the Wayne County Child and Family 
Abuse Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	They are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Diehl said a 17-year-old boy has been charged as an adult with  
one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Diehl said authorities are trying to identify and locate the  
other parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-year-old girl, described as mentally impaired, is a

<HEADLINE> Fla. Man Guilty in Prostitute Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A building-supply salesman, arrested when police  
found a gagged prostitute banging on the walls of his apartment, 
has been convicted of killing one of six prostitutes found dead 
over a four-month span. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors on Tuesday found Rory E. Conde guilty of strangling  
Rhonda Dunn, whose body was discovered in January 1995. His defense 
attorney did not deny Conde killed anyone, but argued Conde did not 
plot or premeditate the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Conde could get the death penalty or life in prison without  
parole. The sentencing phase of the trial begins Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Jeffrey Fink said Conde, 34, was not a monster  
who lurked around looking for prostitutes to strangle, but a man 
who was estranged from his wife and needed a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He goes out not looking to kill; he goes out looking for  
contact,'' Fink said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant State Attorney Abraham Laeser said, ``The only  
question here is, did he by his own hand decide to take the life of 
Rhonda Dunn? 
</P>
<P>
	``When the defense attorney comes up here and says, `Yes' and  
the prosecutor gets up here and says `Yes,' I'm not all that 
certain that there's a heck of a lot of reasonable doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Conde -- dubbed the Tamiami Strangler by local  
media -- beat, robbed and killed Ms. Dunn, 21, because it made him 
feel good. 
</P>
<P>
	Her bruise-covered body was found face down in the dirt next to  
garbage cans. 
</P>
<P>
	Although police believe Conde killed all six prostitutes and  
jurors were told he is suspected of being a serial killer, he was 
only tried in Ms. Dunn's slaying. An appeals court ruled that the 
six cases must be tried separately. Trials in those cases are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The first victim, a cross-dressing prostitute named Lazaro  
Comesana, was found dead Sept. 17, 1994. The other five victims, 
including Ms. Dunn, were female. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had no leads six months after the last killing until  
neighbors reported someone banging on the walls of Conde's 
apartment. Authorities found inside a woman wrapped in duct tape, 
kicking and banging on the doors for help. She told police Conde 
abducted her, raped her, sprayed her with Mace and left her in his 
apartment, planning to return later.

<HEADLINE> Nike Taking Shoe Orders Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike said Wednesday it would take orders  
for customized shoes online and deliver them directly to homes, 
bypassing retailers in an industry that has been slower than others 
to embrace the Internet to move its merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good challenge and stimulus for the footwear  
industry,'' said Vada Manager, Nike spokesman. ``The athletic goods 
industry has been a little slow to react to the whole Internet 
revolution, frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only two shoe models will be offered, the Air Turbulence and the  
Air Famished, selling for about $85. But customers can order 
specific colors and features to be delivered within two weeks, and 
Nike will pay the air freight charges for the time being, Manager 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, the Beaverton-based manufacturer of athletic  
shoes and clothing established a retail Web site, Nike.com, but it 
has been used mostly as a showcase for products already carried at 
more than 10,000 retail outlets listed at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Nike announced it had purchased a stake in Fogdog, a  
tiny Internet retailer in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and retailers said they saw the latest announcement as  
an outgrowth of increasing consumer demand for Internet shopping 
rather than competition with stores. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, many stores have beaten Nike to the Net, they said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our Web sales have increased sixfold in the last eight to nine  
months,'' said Juris Pagrabs, vice president of investor relations 
at Venator, the parent of the Foot Locker shoe store chain.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Visits Palestinian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHATI REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Walking the rutted streets  
of a refugee camp and clasping hands with the mother of a boy who 
died fighting for self-determination, Nelson Mandela said today he 
felt at home among the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Concluding his Mideast tour with a hero's welcome in Gaza, the  
former South African president repeatedly invoked the similarity 
between the struggle of Palestinians and South African non-whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``The histories of our two peoples, Palestinian and South  
African, correspond in such painful and poignant ways, that I 
intensely feel myself being at home amongst compatriots,'' he said 
to thunderous applause from the Palestinian legislative assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians, eager to press Israel to accelerate the revived  
peace process, drank up the important moral endorsement of a late 
20th century symbol for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia welcomed Mandela as a ``man  
whose name and deeds well precede him as a symbol of hope to 
Palestinians and Palestine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Posters bearing Mandela's image dotted walls throughout Gaza,  
and banners read ``Our dreams will come true through your 
support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela recalled a time when both movements were treated as  
pariahs by the international community -- a period that saw the 
forging of close bonds between the Palestinians and South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long-standing fraternal bonds between our two liberation  
movements are now translating into the relations between two 
governments,'' Mandela told the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nobel Peace Prize laureate won extended applause again when  
he departed from a speech lauding the difficult choice of 
abandoning an armed struggle for negotiations and noted: ``If the 
only alternative is violence, we will use violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called for an Israeli withdrawal from all Arab lands and the  
establishment of an international commission to supervise the peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	He apologized to the legislators for forgetting to press the  
Israelis to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel acts. ``I 
am truly aware of the pain,'' he said. Mandela led the African 
National Congress from a prison cell for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela also expressed sympathy for the Israeli view.  
</P>
<P>
	``I understand why they occupied territory during the (1967) war  
and after the war,'' he said, urging all Arabs to grant Israel 
``firm and unequivocal'' recognition of a right to exist within 
secure borders. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat has recognized Israel, but some Palestinians want a final  
peace agreement to include the right of Palestinians to return to 
all parts of the land, including Israel's pre-1967 borders. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela, 81, arrived Tuesday in Gaza and canceled evening  
engagements because he was not feeling well, the result of a recent 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the pupils at the Shati refugee girls school waited  
patiently in the sandlot that functions as their school yard, 
hoisting Palestinian and South African flags and banners reading 
``Mr. Mandela -- the man of war and peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Mandela arrived an hour late, the girls burst into cheers  
and lined up to shake his hand, bewildering him with blessings in 
Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
	He also visited the cramped home of the family of an 18-year-old  
Palestinian who died in a clash with Israeli troops in 1990, at the 
height of the six-year Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
	He touched Usama el Aruga's framed portrait and held his  
mother's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our struggle was the same,'' he said. ``Our hopes, our dreams,  
our aspirations were identical. That is why I am here today.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Drops Crop Insurance Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A federal judge has dismissed charges  
against three men accused of swindling $10 million from the federal 
government in a crop insurance scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	When the grand jury indicted the men last year, prosecutors  
called it the biggest crop insurance fraud case in the country. The 
three were accused of lying to the Department of Agriculture about 
how much rain damage their raisin grower clients suffered in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Oliver Wanger signed an order Friday  
dropping the charges against Guri S. Bhangoo of Fresno and Avtar S. 
Gill of Caruthers. Charges had been dismissed earlier against Frank 
T. Fujikawa of Selma. 
</P>
<P>
	Bhangoo is a former claims manager for the Fresno office of the  
West Des Moines, Iowa-based Rain and Hail Insurance Services. Gill 
was president of his own insurance company and Fujikawa was an 
independent adjuster for Rain and Hail. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors declined comment Tuesday on the dismissal.  
</P>
<P>
	Elliot Peters, a lawyer for Bhangoo, said a re-examination of  
the entire case showed ``that these men had never done anything 
wrong.''

<HEADLINE> McCain: Campaign Finance Is an Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Back on the hustings a day after the defeat of  
his campaign finance reform legislation, Sen. John McCain vowed 
Wednesday to continue the fight and said it already has become an 
issue in the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republican said Elizabeth Dole's decision to drop  
out of the race for the GOP presidential nomination hours earlier 
was the latest sign that money is ``corrupting'' the political 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	In her departure speech, Dole said ``the bottom line is money,''  
and to continue with her campaign when she had raised just 
one-tenth of the $57 million raised by front-runner George W. Bush 
would ``be futile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking by car phone from New Hampshire, where he is continuing  
his own campaign for the presidency, McCain added: ``People feel 
that bucks are becoming more important than the ballot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More cryptically, McCain said campaign reform legislation is not  
officially dead for the year on the Senate floor. He pledged to try 
some ``parliamentary tactics'' in the coming weeks to ensure a vote 
up or down on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., McCain has been  
pushing legislation that would have banned ``soft money'' donations 
and allowed non-union members to stop labor unions from spending 
their mandatory dues on political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft money is unlimited donations that unions, corporations and  
some individuals give to the Republican and Democratic parties. 
While the money doesn't flow directly to a candidate, the parties 
often use it in ways to help their campaigns, such as advocating 
their pet issues. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to get the Senate to pass similar legislation last  
year, McCain and Feingold made a tactical decision. They decided to 
strip away a key element of last year's bill, a provision to 
restrict so-called ``issue ads.'' They are thinly veiled attacks on 
candidates paid for with soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., rallied opposition to the  
bill. He contends a ban on unlimited soft money violates the 
Constitution's free speech protections. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the measure died when the Senate twice fell short of  
the 60-vote majority needed to overcome a filibuster led by 
McConnell. All 45 Senate Democrats supported both efforts to free 
the measure, joined by a shifting group of Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Holmgren: Offense Must Get Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Take it from Mike Holmgren, who knows  
exactly what it takes to get there. If the Seattle Seahawks' 
offense keeps playing as poorly as it did in San Diego, the team's 
bid to make the playoffs is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tall order unless you can score some points,''  
Seattle's first-year coach said Wednesday. ``If we're only to score 
10 points a game for the rest of the season, that would be pretty 
tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, who coached Green Bay into two Super Bowls, watched  
the Seahawks lose 13-10 to the Chargers in a woeful offensive 
performance last Sunday. Seattle hosts the Buffalo Bills this 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a game that magnified the absence of holdout wide receiver  
Joey Galloway and his ability to stretch defenses with his speed, 
the Seahawks got pass interceptions from Brian Walker, Chris Canty, 
Cortez Kennedy and Willie Williams in the second half against the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out it wasn't enough.  
</P>
<P>
	Walker's interception set up Seattle's only touchdown, a 1-yard  
pass from Jon Kitna to Itula Mili. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks' offense couldn't get going against the Chargers  
and Junior Seau. Their rushing attack was particularly ineffective, 
gaining only 61 yards on 27 carries. Kitna was 17-for-29 for 151 
yards and a touchdown with an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	John Carney's 41-yard field goal as time expired ended the  
Seahawks' three-game winning streak and left Holmgren frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, Holmgren tried to look at the Seahawks' final  
11 games optimistically. His offense is testing his positive 
approach to coaching, though. 
</P>
<P>
	With a relatively inexperienced quarterback in Kitna, in his  
first full season as Seattle's starter, and an unproductive 
offensive line, the Seahawks rank 25th in the 31-team NFL in 
offense and are 29th in rushing. Ricky Watters is averaging a 
career-low 3.1 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren doesn't know if he has enough talent on offense to make  
it work in Seattle, which is without its best offensive player, 
Galloway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now that doesn't matter,'' Holmgren said when asked if  
he thought he had enough offensive talent. ``There's not a lot I 
can do about that right now. The trading deadline passed and we've 
drafted our players. I have to make it work somehow with this 
group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seahawks president Bob Whitsitt made Holmgren the highest-paid  
coach in the league at $32 million for eight years. Holmgren was 
hired to end Seattle's 10-year playoff drought, longest in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goals haven't changed,'' Holmgren said. ``We're still  
shooting for the playoffs and that kind of stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the league's trading deadline, the Seahawks held  
onto Galloway. So if he plays for them this season, it will be his 
decision to come back for what's left of his $1.585 million 
contract. Galloway is in the final season of his five-year contract 
with the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway flew to Seattle on Wednesday from his home in Ohio for  
what he said was strictly a personal visit. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to give the Seahawks' offense some help, Holmgren  
said he may give second-year running back Ahman Green his first 
carries of the season as Watters' understudy. After having fumbling 
problems in Seattle's first five games, Green has been limited to 
returning kickoffs.

<HEADLINE> Head for New Nuclear Agency Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The message was clear: Comply with the law and  
consolidate nuclear weapons programs under a new agency as directed 
by Congress. Then try to correct what may be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators, some accusing the Clinton administration of flouting  
the will of Congress, gave the message to Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson at an unusual hearing Tuesday on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson tried to plead with the senators to work with him to  
make some ``modest'' changes in a measure passed by Congress only a 
few weeks ago and signed into law by President Clinton on Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	It creates a new National Nuclear Security Administration within  
the Energy Department under which all nuclear weapons programs 
would be consolidated including the nuclear weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the measure say the new agency, with considerable  
autonomy from the rest of the department, is needed to ensure 
safeguards against future theft of nuclear secrets. The agency is 
the most significant response by Congress to the months of 
controversy over espionage at the weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	But now GOP lawmakers are accusing Clinton of refusing to  
promptly staff the new agency and name its administrator. The 
president has directed that the agency be headed indefinitely by 
Richardson and that Richardson fill key agency positions with DOE 
officials already holding similar posts in the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson came to Tuesday's hearing hoping to soothe some angry  
Republican senators, who are convinced Clinton is trying to make an 
end run around the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not trying to frustrate the will of the Congress. We're  
not trying to make an end run.,'' he insisted, adding that he only 
would like lawmakers to consider ``some modifications to make the 
law work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the senators would have none of that.  
</P>
<P>
	The defense bill was passed by a wide margin in both the House  
and Senate, creating the new agency, and Clinton signed it, they 
said, and now the administration is trying to circumvent it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've poisoned the well,'' declared Sen. Pete Domenici,  
R-N.M., who helped draft language creating the new agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., accused Clinton of disobeying the  
law. ``We came out with a law and you're coming back up here and 
trying to re-negotiate,'' Thompson snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Richardson argued that the new agency would undermine his  
ability to strengthen security and improve counterespionage 
programs at nuclear weapons labs and other nuclear facilities. 
While he said he's not opposed to a semiautonomous agency, the one 
created by Congress would be largely unaccountable to anyone else 
within the department, including the energy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., another of the legislation's drafters,  
accused Richardson of trying to ``rehash old arguments. We passed 
the law. The president signed it. It's time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats said Clinton should be given more time, noting  
that full implementation of the law is not required until next 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the three-hour hearing by the Energy and Natural  
Resources and Government Affairs committees drew to a close, an 
influential Democrat had a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said he disagreed with the  
structure of the agency, but cautioned Richardson that the 
administration's reputation -- and perhaps Richardson's as well -- is 
on the line if the law is not complied with. 
</P>
<P>
	``A kind of cloud has been put over you, or at least over the  
department,'' Lieberman told Richardson, adding that he had to make 
it ``100 percent clear that if you don't get the changes you will 
go ahead and implement the law'' anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You're on notice,'' cautioned Lieberman.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Descend on Calif. Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- Two teams of investigators are trying  
this week to determine why a project involving a super laser 
designed to simulate the power of a nuclear explosion could run two 
years late and hundreds of millions of dollars over budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators from the General Accounting Office arrived at the  
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on Monday and a team from 
the University of California, which manages the lab under contract 
to the Department of Energy, visited Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Energy is also conducting a review.  
</P>
<P>
	The inquiries were prompted by the announcement last month that  
the project had run into trouble and could be $300 million over 
budget and two years late. 
</P>
<P>
	That was an unpleasant surprise for officials who had been told  
in June that the project, part of the effort to test nuclear 
weapons through computer simulations, was in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the House Committee on Armed Services has asked the  
GAO to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The UC team is interviewing scientist and management to find out  
what's behind the cost and schedule overruns and the delay in 
reporting them. 
</P>
<P>
	UC expects a report later this year. The GAO report is due by  
the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
	The super laser, called the National Ignition Facility, NIF for  
short, is a football-stadium sized machine described as a 
cornerstone of efforts to test nuclear weapons for reliability 
without actually blowing anything up. With its 192 laser beams, the 
device will shoot a target the size of a BB to simulate 
temperatures and pressures similar to those inside a nuclear 
explosion or at the sun's core. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction on the super laser, which was supposed to cost $1.1  
billion and be completed by 2003, began in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Amtrak Official Admits Kickbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The former Amtrak official in charge of  
rehabilitating Chicago's historic Union Station pleaded guilty 
Wednesday to taking more than $120,000 in kickbacks from 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Corcoran, 48, of Arlington Heights admitted that he  
approved inflated bills that Union Station contractors submitted to 
Amtrak over a three year period starting in July 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted taking $120,000 in payoffs from five contractors,  
though federal prosecutors said the actual amount topped $200,000. 
One contractor paid Corcoran's cellular phone bills and bought him 
gasoline in exchange for getting bills approved, according to the 
plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Corcoran was initially charged with five counts of mail fraud,  
but under the agreement with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty to one. 
He faces up to two years in prison when he is sentenced Feb. 3. 
</P>

mobsters shot it out in the movie ``The Untouchables.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 187.43 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks broke out of their slump  
Wednesday after Microsoft's better-than-expected earnings report 
raised hopes that demand for computers will remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the rally could be short lived as IBM warned as the  
market was closing that demand for some of its major products is 
way off due to Year 2000 concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 187.43 to close at  
10,392.36. The Nasdaq composite index, which lists many of the 
world's leading technology companies, was up 99.95 at 2,788.13. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indicators also rose, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
gaining 28.11 to 1,289.43. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq benefited most directly from Microsoft's announcement  
late Tuesday that profits jumped 30 percent in its fiscal first 
quarter on strong demand for personal computers equipped with its 
Windows operating system. Microsoft also reported strong sales of 
its Office 2000 and other business software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft soared 5 15/16 to 92 1/4, lifting many technology stocks  
that were battered over the past week as investors worried about 
disappointing profit reports from Intel and Dell. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rumor was out that corporate earnings would be good, but  
Microsoft really offered the first evidence of it,'' said Bob 
Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at Dain Rauscher 
Wessels in Minneapolis. ``And Microsoft is such an important 
bellwether for the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rage for technology stocks extended to the Dow, where IBM  
rose sharply throughout the trading day on expectations it would 
post solid earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
	After the close of trading in New York, IBM said its earnings  
matched analyst expectations, but it also warned that customers are 
delaying purchases of its powerful network and database servers due 
to worries that the Year 2000 date change may cause widespread 
computer failures. Sales of the machines fell 40 percent during the 
quarter, a drop that was greater than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	As trading on regional stock exchanges continued past the 4 p.m.  
close in New York, IBM's shares gave up nearly all their ground. 
IBM finished down 1/8 at 107, and in after-hours trading on Instinet, 
sank to 102. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan rose 4 11/16 to 75 13/16 after reporting profits  
jumped 42 percent in the third quarter due to higher fees from 
investment banking and money management services. Chase earned 
$1.19 billion, or $1.37 a share, beating Wall Street estimates by 5 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Robust earnings growth has helped investors shrug off worries  
about higher interest rates. But analysts warned that as long as 
fears of rising rates keep investors on guard, the market may not 
tolerate many earnings disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are in a show-me mode,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior  
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``The strong earnings from 
Microsoft energized the market and brought back a number of 
fence-sitters, but it's not yet clear whether the rally has staying 
power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Airline stocks were mostly lower Wednesday after Trans World  
Airlines and US Airways Group reported losses for the quarter. Both 
airlines struggled with labor disagreements, and rising fuel prices 
cut into profits. TWA fell 1/4 to 3 7/16, and US Airways fell 1 13/16 
to 26 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	While many stocks have rebounded in recent sessions from  
crushing losses last week, the bond market has not yet recovered. 
Wednesday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slipped to 6.33 
percent from 6.35 percent, but yields remain near the highest 
levels since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market's rise was underpinned by news that America's

<HEADLINE> Predators 4, Sabres 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek departed after allowing two  
goals in the first period and the Nashville Predators went on to 
beat the Buffalo Sabres 4-3 on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek allowed two goals on eight shots in the period and was  
replaced by Dwayne Roloson, who could stop neither Nashville's 
shots nor the boos as the Sabres (0-5-2) tied the longest winless 
start in franchise history. The 1990-91 team went 0-4-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo, which fought back from a 4-1 deficit, also sank into a  
tie for the lowest point total after the first seven games with the 
1993-94 team (1-6-0). 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have not won since they beat the Dallas Stars in Game  
5 of the Stanley Cup finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	David Legwand, Sergei Krivokrasov, Cliff Ronning and Patric  
Kjellberg scored for the Predators (3-3-1), and goalie Mike Dunham 
posted his third win in as many starts with 28 saves. Ronning also 
had two assists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres outshot the Predators 14-2 in the third and buzzed  
around the net in the final seconds, but couldn't get the tying 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoff Sanderson scored his first goal of the season for Buffalo  
in the second period. Curtis Brown and Domenic Pittis scored in the 
third to bring the Sabres back to within a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Legwand, a 19-year-old rookie, scored his second goal of the  
season just 46 seconds into the game with a slap shot from the top 
of the right circle to the far side of Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has a career mark of 2-11-2 in games in which he allowed a  
goal in the first minute of play, all but one of them since coming 
to the Sabres in a trade with Chicago in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Krivokrasov scored his second goal of the season for a 2-0  
Nashville lead on the power play at 12:41 of the first. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson snapped a 12-game regular-season scoreless streak with  
his goal at 8:55 of the second period. Sanderson beat Dunham with a 
slap shot from the left wing to make it 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronning scored with a low wrist shot from the bottom of the left  
circle for a 3-1 lead at 10:15 of the second, and Kjellberg's shot 
from the top of the left circle sent the Predators into the third 
with a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown scored on the power play at 9:14 of the third, and Pittis  
batted in a losse puck in front at 10:09. It was the first NHL goal 
for Pittis, a 25-year-old rookie.

<HEADLINE> Investors Win in Online Trade Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the competition heats up on Wall Street to  
provide low-cost, online brokerage services, investors may see 
their brokerage fees drop almost as fast as the stock market has 
risen. 
</P>
<P>
	One after another, the big name brokerage houses are scrambling  
to offer a wide range of online services to compete with discount 
firms that offer Internet stock trading at a small fraction of 
traditional brokerage commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is that fees are being restructured -- mostly downward  
-- to cater to a growing variety of investor trading practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Easy access via personal computers to both online stock trading  
systems and market information has unleashed a wave of competition 
that has helped reduce brokerage fees, said John Markese, president 
of the American Association of Individual Investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The success of Charles Schwab and other online discount  
brokerages has overwhelmed the full-service brokerage industry,'' 
said Markese. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors who once relied on a broker for advice on which stocks  
to buy -- and paid him hundreds of dollars for every trade -- can now 
do themselves it on the Internet for $10 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this trading revolution, the full-service firms have  
moved slowly into online trading for fear of cannibalizing their 
lucrative brokerage businesses -- up until now. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., the second  
largest United States brokerage firm, became the latest 
full-service firm to unveil a tiered fee system for its customers 
who want to trade online, but also may sometimes want the advice 
and service of a traditional stock broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley will charge $29.95 for each unassisted online  
trade, and $39.95 for online trades assisted by a broker. Customers 
can also choose to pay a flat annual fee -- based on the size of 
their trading account -- and get an unlimited number of trades. Or, 
they can continue to pay traditional fees for full brokerage 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the plan, Morgan Stanley's existing Discover  
Brokerage Direct discount unit will be blended into the firm's new 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online business. The new services begin 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Salomon Smith Barney Inc., Prudential  
Securities Inc. and PaineWebber Group have all either announced or 
begun offering similar services with comparable fee structures. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the names are impressive, analysts say these firms are  
merely playing catch-up to independent brokers and financial 
planners who have offered low-cost, do-it-yourself plans for years 
-- even before the Internet allowed individual investors to trade 
with the click of a mouse button. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, independent brokers have offered flat annual fees  
since the early 1990s. In addition, the independents have slashed 
their own commissions by using discount trading services such as 
Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity Investments instead of the big 
Wall Street brokerage houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Pomeranz, an independent investment adviser in Boca  
Raton, Fla., said it is no longer practical for a broker to provide 
investing advice to clients who don't want or need it. Information 
on stocks can all be found on the Internet, so many investors no 
longer rely on a broker for trading decisions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly five years Pomeranz has charged his clients a flat  
annual fee -- about 2 percent of a client's account assets -- for 
stock trading. Those who want his advice pay extra. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of separating fees for advice and trading is now  
spreading to the large Wall Street firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big brokerage houses are being forced into this kicking  
and screaming by competition,'' said William Berg, president of 
Sigma Investment Management, a Portland, Ore., investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of their strategy to capture online customers, the big  
Wall Street firms are now undercutting the flat annual fees charged 
by independent brokers. Salomon Smith Barney, for example, charges 
between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent of a customer's account assets 
for unlimited trading, as opposed to the 2 percent charged by most 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fees charged by independent brokers are about to come  
under attack,'' said Steve Galbraith, a brokerage firm analyst at 
New York investment bank Sanford Bernstein. ``It was a good gig 
while it lasted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which means the costs to investors will continue to fall, as the  
independents scramble to keep pace with their competitors on Wall 
Street.

<HEADLINE> 'Heartbreak Hotel' Lyricist Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAY CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Thomas Durden, who wrote the lyrics to  
one of Elvis Presley's early big hits, ``Heartbreak Hotel,'' has 
died at age 79. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wrote a lot of good music that is out there. It's just that  
`Heartbreak Hotel' is the famous one,'' said his stepson, John 
White. 
</P>
<P>
	Durden, who died Sunday at his home in Houghton Lake, met  
Presley as a result of the song. Presley called him ``sir'' and 
sent Durden Christmas cards to show his appreciation, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Durden co-wrote ``Heartbreak Hotel'' with Mae Boren Axton of  
Nashville, Tenn., who died in 1997. For reasons never explained, 
Presley also was given writing credit even though it was the work 
of Durden and Axton. 
</P>
<P>
	Durden was born in Georgia and grew up in Florida, where his  
older brother had a musical influence on him. Durden had a good 
voice and a special talent for playing the steel guitar, which he 
refined throughout his life, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, Durden was single and performing with a band in  
Jacksonville, Fla., when he came across a newspaper account of a 
man who had committed suicide, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man left a note that said, ``I walk a lonely street,'' and  
Durden used it as the basis for ``Heartbreak Hotel,'' which begins: 
</P>
<P>
	``Since my baby left me  
</P>
<P>
	``I found a new place to dwell  
</P>
<P>
	``down at the end of lonely street at  
</P>
<P>
	``Heartbreak Hotel.''  
</P>
<P>
	Durden continued to write and perform music, playing with  
Nashville legends like Johnny Cash and touring with Tex Ritter, 
White said. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved north to the Houghton Lake area and lived there for  
about 40 years. He performed with bands in northern Michigan, and 
their sets always included his hit song, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1982 interview, Durden spoke of the impact ``Heartbreak  
Hotel'' had on his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I had 12 more songs just like it,'' Durden said. ``It  
has paid the rent for more than 20 years, but you can't get rich 
writing songs unless you have a lot of big ones.''

<HEADLINE> Abercrombie's Accused of Leaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch has been accused in  
two class-action lawsuits of warning a Wall Street analyst of 
disappointing third-quarter growth before disclosing the 
information to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits, filed this week in New York City and in San Diego,  
accuse the retailer of telling analyst Todd Slater, of the 
investment firm Lazard Freres, of the shortfall on Oct. 8, five 
days before it announced the same information to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater then allegedly told Lazard's sales force that the  
company's growth trends trailed Wall Street analysts' expectations. 
They then called the Lazard's top clients. 
</P>
<P>
	During those five days, Abercrombie's stock fell from a high of  
$39.75 to $23.375. On Wednesday, its shares closed at $23.06 1/4, down 
6.25 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The two lawsuits, and at least one similar suit filed Wednesday  
in Philadelphia, seek to represent investors who bought stock in 
the company during the five days. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney John Halebian, of the New York firm Wechsler Harwood  
Halebian &AMP; Feffer, which filed a lawsuit Monday, said that while 
Lazard was told about the weak results, other investors who 
contacted the company were told things were fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that it was a fib because they said something else  
different the same day,'' he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Halebian said he did not know how many investors bought stock  
during the five days, but trading was exceptionally heavy. He said 
the number of investors could total in the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	Another lawsuit was filed Tuesday in San Diego by Little Rock,  
Ark., lawyer Steven Cauley. Cauley's office did not return a call 
seeking further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazard spokesman Bruce Corwin did not return a call seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch spokeswoman Roanne Kulakoff said the company  
had no comment on the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Abercrombie is one of the leading clothing retailers in the  
business today. Teens and young adults flock to the company's 
stores nationwide, attracted to the casual clothes and hip 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	While sales remain very strong, the Reynoldsburg, Ohio-based  
retailer said sales at stores open at least a year, also known as 
same-store sales, had risen 12 percent so far this quarter. That 
was at the low end of some forecasts. The company said its October 
sales promotion wasn't as successful as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it expects to meet analysts' profit  
expectations of 31-cent-a-share for the third quarter. Some 
forecasts, however, ranged as high as 33 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Abercrombie incident comes as the Securities and Exchange  
Commission looks for ways to narrow the gap between large financial 
institutions and small-time investors. Federal regulators want to 
prod companies to share information that until now has been 
reserved for Wall Street analysts.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Says Bite Comment Was Hype </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson's bark sometimes seems worse than  
his bite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just talking smack, just hyping the fight,'' Tyson said  
when asked about a Los Angeles Times story in which he indicated he 
wouldn't hesitate to bite an opponent again in certain situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just blowing off hot air,'' the former undisputed  
heavyweight champion said Wednesday at a news conference for his 
10-round fight against Orlin Norris on Saturday night in the MGM 
Grand. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was disqualified and had his license revoked for biting  
Evander Holyfield's ears in the third round June 28, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would do it again under those circumstances. (Referee) Mills  
Lane wasn't protecting me (from head butts). He didn't handle the 
situation appropriately,'' Tyson said in the Oct. 3 story in the 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to sell some tickets,'' Tyson said. ``The Nevada  
State Athletic Commission knew I wasn't serious. They knew the 
trauma that I went through. I won't do that in the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Ratner, executive director of the commission, said what  
Tyson said was ``what we call newspaper talk. What he does in the 
ring is the only thing we can judge him on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Steele of Las Vegas will be the referee Saturday night.  
The judges, all of Las Vegas, will be Dave Moretti, Dalby Shirley 
and Art Lurie. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Norris said he is concentrating on Tyson's  
punch, not his bite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm expecting an action kind of fight,'' said the former WBA  
cruiserweight champion with a 50-5 record, with 27 knockouts. ``I 
know he's going to hit me and I'll hit him. I just have to avoid 
the big punch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm bringing some pain,'' said the 33-year-old Tyson (46-3, 40  
knockouts), who will be fighting for the first time since he 
knocked out Francois Botha with a right to the jaw in the fifth 
round Jan. 16. Botha had won the first four rounds on two official 
cards and won three of four on the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't a good experience,'' Tyson said, ``but it was a  
sensational ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the victory over Botha, Tyson was jailed in Maryland  
for assaulting two motorists after a fender-bender. He was released 
from jail May 24 after serving 3 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson made a comeback in 1995 from three years in an Indiana  
prison on a rape conviction and again this year after being idle in 
1998. His license had been revoked because of the Holyfield fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not too many people could start over as many times as I did,''  
Tyson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be shown live on Showtime, with the telecast to  
begin at 11 p.m. EDT. Roberto Garcia's IBF junior lightweight title 
defense against Diego Corrales also will be televised live, and 
taped highlights of a heavyweight bout between David Tua and Shane 
Sutcliffe earlier on the card will be shown. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's fight could be delayed until the first game of the World  
Series ends, but Jay Larkin of Showtime said the latest the bout 
will begin is midnight EDT.

<HEADLINE> Study: Atomic Tests Link to Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Higher death rates for nasal and prostate  
cancer among soldiers who took part in atomic tests were 
unexpected, according to a new study that also found increases in 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased death rates for nasal and prostate cancer had not  
been reported before, but the higher leukemia rates have been found 
in other studies, according to the new analysis released Wednesday 
by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deaths from prostate cancer were 20 percent higher among test  
participants than the comparison group, and even higher for nasal 
cancer,'' said Susan Thaul, who directed the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that higher prostate cancer rates have not been  
consistently seen in other studies of people exposed to radiation 
and ``are therefore difficult to interpret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The nasal cancer finding is even harder to interpret,'' Thaul  
said, ``in part because this is the first study of atomic test 
participants to look specifically for that cause of death. To date, 
nasal cancer has not been among the cancers considered to be caused 
by radiation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These leukemia findings do not resolve the debate over whether  
participation is associated with leukemia mortality,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, the set of leukemia findings is consistent with the  
results of other studies of military participants in nuclear tests 
and is broadly consistent with a hypothesis that these are 
radiation effects,'' Thaul said. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing a group of servicemen who took part in the tests in  
Nevada and the Pacific with similar service members who did not 
participate, the analysis found no difference between the two 
groups in overall death rates or in total deaths from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	For leukemia, those taking part in the tests had a 14 percent  
higher death rate than those in the comparison group, an increase 
the report said is small enough that it could be due to chance. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when the researchers broke down the service members  
into regional groups they discovered that ``land-based participants 
-- those in the Nevada desert -- had a death rate from leukemia that 
was 50 percent higher than military personnel in similar units who 
did not take part in atomic tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, sea-based test participants in the South  
Pacific did not have a higher death rate from leukemia than 
servicemen who did not take part in the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern about higher cancer rates in nuclear test participants  
was first voiced in 1976 when a veteran of a 1957 nuclear test in 
Nevada claimed he developed leukemia as a result of his exposure to 
the radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than 200,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and  
marines participated in atmospheric nuclear tests between World War 
II and the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study looked into the causes and rates of death among  
the nearly 70,000 service members who participated in at least one 
of five groups of atmospheric nuclear tests chosen for examination. 
</P>
<P>
	These servicemen were present at tests conducted in the Nevada  
desert or in the South Pacific; some 30 percent have since died. 
The causes of death were compared to a group of nearly 65,000 
military personnel serving at the same time but not involved in the 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not examine differences in nonfatal disease or injury.  
</P>
<P>
	The study was funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency of  
the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute of Medicine is part of the National Academy of  
Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress to advise 
the government of scientific matters.

<HEADLINE> Congressman Wants Reno Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee chairman wants Attorney  
General Janet Reno to order protesters removed from the U.S. Navy 
bombing range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, saying she is 
endangering their lives by letting them stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I understand the nature of the ongoing political  
protest, I have grave concerns that the presence of the protesters 
presents risk of terrible tragedy,'' Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said 
in a letter to Reno that was made public Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, said  
the protesters are trespassing in an area full of dangerous 
munitions. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department spokeswoman said Reno would answer the  
letter but would not make a public statement before her response. 
Kara Peterman said department officials were closely monitoring 
activities on Vieques, ``but it would be inappropriate to comment 
on any potential law enforcement action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters, including children, have set up four encampments on  
the range. The protests began several months ago when the Navy 
declared a moratorium on its use while officials consider whether 
to heed Puerto Rican demands that the military return its training 
grounds to the commonwealth for civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential panel has recommended that the Navy resume  
live-fire training, including bombing on the inhabited island, but 
at a scaled-down rate for five years until a new Navy training 
ground can be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen plans to consult with those  
affected before passing along his own recommendation to President 
Clinton, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Wednesday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Honolulu Paper Stays Open -- For Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- A federal appeals court Wednesday denied an  
emergency request from The Honolulu Advertiser and Honolulu 
Star-Bulletin to let them shut down the Star-Bulletin next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The three judges in San Francisco rejected an emergency motion  
by Gannett Pacific Corp., Liberty Newspapers Limited Partnership 
and the Hawaii Newspaper Agency to stop enforcement of a 
preliminary injunction issued in Honolulu last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That injunction by U.S. District Judge Alan Kay blocked the  
scheduled Oct. 30 closure of the 117-year-old Star-Bulletin while 
the courts consider whether the shutdown violates antitrust laws, 
as the state of Hawaii claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Kay also cited the public interest in keeping separate editorial  
voices. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty, which owns the Star-Bulletin, announced last month that  
it planned to shut down the afternoon daily because of declining 
circulation and revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Liberty would be paid $26.5 million by Gannett,  
which owns the morning Advertiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The two papers have a joint operating agreement in which they  
share advertising, business and circulation departments while 
maintaining separate newsrooms. That agreement was set to expire in 
2012.

<HEADLINE> Dole Missed Opportunities in Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Not too long ago, Elizabeth Dole looked  
delightedly at the networks she'd built in Iowa, New Hampshire and 
other early primary states. ``We're going to have everything in 
place by Christmas. We're in really good shape,'' she thought. 
</P>
<P>
	That was then. After recalling this once-sunny outlook  
Wednesday, Dole folded her presidential campaign, saying it was 
futile to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	She started out in February, a political celebrity, hot on  
George W. Bush's heels and basking in public fascination with the 
possibility that a woman could become president. 
</P>
<P>
	But the story from there is a tale of missed opportunities.  
</P>
<P>
	Dole blamed the Texas governor's ``preexisting network of  
political supporters,'' built ``quietly but effectively'' from his 
office, starting in 1996, while she was at the American Red Cross 
meticulously guarding the organization's nonpartisan status. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's bandwagon -- he's raised a historic $57 million -- crippled  
her fund raising, said Dole, who nonetheless accepted that she 
stepped onto the campaign trail as an unprepared first-time 
candidate without even a staff in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what she'd do differently, Dole offered a singular  
prescription: ``Leave the Red Cross earlier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican strategist Mary Matalin, a Bush ally, scoffed,  
``What's the implication? That she didn't have a network? That's 
ridiculous, the wife of a former senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole also had sought the GOP presidential nomination three  
times. 
</P>
<P>
	A nontraditional campaign was Dole's stated aim. In practice,  
however, that meant a campaign so polite and cautious and 
deliberative that it plodded itself underfoot of this year's 
juggernaut through a compressed primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the summer, Dole essentially put fund raising on hold while  
she furiously concentrated her legwork in Iowa, where her strategy 
for pulling off an impressive finish in an August straw poll was to 
personally invite each of the 3,410 Iowans who turned out to vote 
for her. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of victorious television interviews Dole  
retreated with her husband for a week's vacation in New Hampshire. 
Aides said at the time they didn't have the heart to deny the tired 
candidate time off. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Iowa straw poll took place, it was expected maybe  
that this would translate into money,'' Dole said. ``What it 
translated into was a lot of strong organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But they were no good without the fund raising. ``You can't  
starve an army, organizations need support,'' said Dole's pollster, 
Linda DiVall. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole tried to make up for lost time by scurrying to dozens of  
events around the country in September, but they were mostly 
drawing women. And the vast majority of women political 
contributors -- about 75 percent -- give under $200 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Squeamish about looking unseemly or opportunistic, Dole put off  
a scheduled get-tough-on-drugs speech at the end of August when 
Bush, the GOP front-runner, was at the height of his tangle with 
unfounded allegations that he once used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	When she finally delivered a toned-down version two months  
later, she picked a spot on the Mexican border so remote that few 
reporters covered the address. 
</P>
<P>
	Her back-to-school speech on education reform was twice  
postponed -- once because she didn't feel prepared, then again 
because of a hurricane -- only to pale in comparison to the detail 
and scope of Bush's education agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	She was slow to make decisions, one supporter said, a personal  
trait exacerbated by the fact that her shoestring operation of just 
30 or so aides lacked the manpower to soundly research every 
``pro'' and ``con'' for the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said all along that a negative campaign was not in Dole's  
nature. Besides, she saw how her husband, the 1996 GOP nominee, was 
weakened by rival Steve Forbes' attack ads -- and how Forbes 
suffered a backlash. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican consultant Alex Castellanos faulted her for not  
drawing sharp distinctions and giving voters cause to select her 
over Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only difference was she was a female candidate and that is  
not enough,'' Castellanos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Daffron, Dole's campaign manager, worried mostly  
Wednesday night about finding new jobs for Dole's earnest young 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always can look back and say there are things you could  
have done differently,'' Daffron said. ``But given the strength 
Bush showed both financially and politically, I don't think it 
would have materially changed the outcome.''

<HEADLINE> IBM Profits in Line, Stock Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM's third-quarter profit grew 14 percent as  
the e-commerce explosion drove demand for computer software and 
services, but the company's stock plunged after a stern warning 
that hardware sales are being hit hard by Y2K fears. 
</P>
<P>
	International Business Machines Corp. posted an operating profit  
of $1.69 billion, or 90 cents per share, for the July-September 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Those figures exclude a $366 million gain from the sale of the  
company's Web services unit to AT&AMP;T Corp. and other one-time 
factors that gave IBM a net profit of $1.76 billion, or 93 cents 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, IBM earned $1.49 billion or 78 cents a share in the  
year-ago period, when there were no one-time factors. 
</P>
<P>
	The operating profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 was in  
line with analyst forecasts, according to a survey by First 
Call/Thomson Financial, marking the 14th straight quarter IBM has 
met or exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, however, were quickly unsettled by a new warning that  
customers are delaying purchases of IBM's powerful network and 
database servers amid worries the Year 2000 date change may cause 
widespread computer failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting drop in sales, 40 percent compared with the third  
quarter of 1998, has been greater than anticipated and is expected 
to continue through the fourth quarter and into January, IBM said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is more apparent that many customers had bought ahead to  
accommodate Y2K testing'' of their existing computer systems, and 
``slowed the deployment of more complex systems ... until after the 
millennium,'' said Doug Maine, IBM's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine noted that 70 percent of the world's business data is  
managed by IBM servers. Those machines, including banking and 
airline reservations systems, ``simply cannot go down,'' he said. 
But, Maine added, ``once we get past these lingering Year 2000 
effects, we should see an acceleration of demand'' related to the 
soaring growth of Internet-related commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's stock soared to $112.75 on the New York Stock Exchange in  
advance of the report, released after the regular close of that 
market. But as word of the IBM warning spread, the stock sank on 
regional markets affiliated with the NYSE, closing at $107. Then, 
in after-hours trading, the stock plunged to about $102, raising 
the possibility of a sharp market drop at Thursday's open. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10-point drop by IBM, one of the 30 companies that make up the  
Dow Jones industrial average, would equate to a 50-point drop by 
that market measure at the start of Thursday's regular session. The 
Dow jumped 187 points on Wednesday as a strong profit report from 
Microsoft overshadowed the disappointment over a weak showing from 
Intel last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, IBM's third-quarter revenues rose 5 percent to $21.14  
billion, up from $20.10 billion a year ago. Most of that gain came 
from the systems management unit, IBM Global Services, where 
revenues rose 12 percent to $7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM said its third-quarter results were also hurt by shortages  
of flat-panel displays for monitors on ThinkPad laptop computers, 
as well as price competition in the market for computer harddrives. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, IBM's net profit totaled  
$5.61 billion or $2.99 per share, including a one-time gain of $750 
million from the AT&AMP;T deal and other one-time factors. In the same 
period a year ago, IBM earned $3.97 billion, or $2.05 a share. 
Nine-month revenues totaled $63.37 billion, up 12 percent from 
$56.54 billion tallied at the same point last year.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Sign Brian Shaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Brian Shaw, a 10-year NBA veteran who  
was one of six players traded for Scottie Pippen earlier this 
month, signed a contract with the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, a 6-foot-6, 200-pound swing man, was traded by Portland to  
Houston along with Kelvin Cato, Stacey Augmon, Walt Williams, Ed 
Gray and Carlos Rogers for Pippen. Shaw was later released by the 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, 32, played in one game for the Trail Blazers last season.  
Before that, he played with the Boston Celtics, Miami Heat, Orlando 
Magic, Golden State Warriors and Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw had his best season in 1990-91 when he averaged 13.8  
points, 4.7 rebounds and 7.6 assists for the Celtics. He has career 
averages of 8.2 points, 3.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	A first-round draft pick of the Celtics in 1988 after playing at  
UC Santa Barbara, Shaw played in Italy in the 1989-90 season before 
returning to Boston.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Approves Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate began acting Wednesday on a measure  
to renew a batch of popular, expiring tax breaks through 2000 
without drawing from politically touchy budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Capitol, the House Ways and Means Committee put off  
consideration of a $35 billion tax relief package designed to 
offset the costs to businesses of a $1 increase in the minimum 
wage. Republicans remained unable to agree on that legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee voted unanimously for an $8.5  
billion measure that would extend several business tax credits 
through Dec. 31, 2000, including the research and development 
credit that expired June 30. The bill also would ensure that 
millions of average taxpayers who claim personal credits do not 
become entangled in the complex alternative minimum tax in 1999 and 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, sponsored by the committee chairman, Sen. William  
Roth, marked a retreat from the $75 billion measure he introduced 
two weeks ago. That proposal would have made permanent the research 
credit and the alternative minimum tax fix. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats objected to that version because it would have used  
some of the non-Social Security surplus in future years. The 
trimmer bill pays for the tax break extensions through a variety of 
revenue offsets that mainly affect business. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here is not perfect, but it is a fair  
compromise,'' said Roth, R-Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth indicated he would try to move the package through the  
Senate under a unanimous consent agreement, preventing any 
crippling amendments and avoiding a filibuster that would require 
60 votes to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill differs sharply from a $23.3 billion version  
pending in the House that would renew the business breaks for five 
years and permanently correct the alternative minimum tax problem. 
That bill would use some of the budget surplus in four of its five 
years, drawing a veto threat from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Senate version contains several provisions opposed by  
the House. One would expand an existing credit to cover electricity 
produced from poultry waste, which would benefit poultry farmers, 
including those in Roth's home state. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Department officials indicated preference for the  
Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the differences, lawmakers of both parties said they  
expect some version of the bill to pass. High-tech businesses and 
manufacturers are lobbying fiercely for renewal of the research 
credit and no politician wants an estimated 1 million average 
taxpayers to face higher taxes in an election year due to the 
alternative minimum tax problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a serious matter if we didn't have an extenders  
package,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	On the minimum wage, Republicans were having difficulty reaching  
agreement between the moderate and conservative wings of the GOP on 
whether to phase the $1 increase in over two or three years -- or 
abandon it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, members of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee  
raised questions about whether some items should be in the tax 
package, such as a tax credit for low-wage workers employed by 
independent film producers. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee vote scheduled for Thursday was postponed  
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have the kind of unity'' needed to proceed, said  
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``It's in a state of 
discussion.''

<HEADLINE> McDonnell Douglas Corp. Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China today denied charges that sophisticated  
machinery imported from the United States for civilian use ended up 
in a missile factory, in violation of U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges threaten to add new complications to China-U.S.  
relations. In a statement, China's Foreign Ministry warned that 
ties with Washington could be harmed if the case is not resolved 
``appropriately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry was responding to the indictment Tuesday of  
McDonnell Douglas Corp. and China National Aero-Technology Import 
Export Corp., or CATIC, a state-owned Chinese aerospace firm, on 
charges that they tried to circumvent U.S. export controls and ship 
sophisticated machine tools to China for use in military 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment of McDonnell Douglas and CATIC, the first Chinese  
government entity ever charged with violating U.S. export controls, 
also threatens to overshadow visits to China next week by Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers and Undersecretary of State Thomas 
Pickering. 
</P>
<P>
	The case follows earlier accusations of Chinese nuclear  
espionage that the FBI is still investigating. Those allegations 
have angered Beijing, which has repeatedly denied stealing U.S. 
nuclear weapons secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	In its written statement denying wrongdoing, the Chinese Foreign  
Ministry warned that the atmosphere for China-U.S. ties had already 
been ``seriously poisoned'' by the espionage accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the United States should handle the machine tool case  
cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese side asks the American side, proceeding from  
overall China-US relations, to seek truth through facts in dealing 
with this problem and resolve this case appropriately so as not to 
impact the improvement and development of China-US relations,'' 
said the statement faxed to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves McDonnell Douglas' sale in 1994 of 19 surplus  
machine tools to the Chinese company for $5 million. The U.S 
government licensed the export of the tools only for use in a joint 
Chinese-McDonnell Douglas program to build 40 McDonnell Douglas 
civilian airliners in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the machines were diverted, in violation of license  
restrictions, to the Nanchang Aircraft Corp., where China makes 
Silkworm missiles and A-5 attack aircraft. According to U.S. 
officials, the diversion was discovered before the tools were ever 
actually misused, and the devices have since been consolidated at a 
factory in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
	Before they were shipped to China, the machines had been used to  
bend and shape steel for the U.S. B1 bomber and the Peacekeeper and 
Titan missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese Foreign Ministry denied that the tools' end-user was  
a Silkworm missile factory, saying such reports were ``fabrications 
with ulterior motives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said the tools were secondhand, made in 1983, ``not at all  
technologically advanced and can be bought on the international 
market without limitations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new dispute comes as Beijing and Washington are struggling  
to settle differences over how far China should open its markets 
before it is allowed to join the World Trade Organization, the

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Outlines Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Without uttering his name, Hillary Rodham  
Clinton laid out Wednesday her stark differences with Republican 
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on a raft of national issues -- 
from the minimum wage to health care and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at a labor union convention, the first lady assailed  
her likely opponent in next year's Senate race and Republicans in 
Congress ``who want to turn the clock back and return us to the 
days when a lot of what we enjoy was not even thought possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Democrats worried about the socially moderate mayor's  
potential to sway non-Republican voters, Mrs. Clinton sought to 
point out his alignment with his more conservative brethren. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Giuliani has praised former President Reagan's  
supply-side economic policies. He also has declined to support a $1 
increase in the $5.50 minimum wage or endorse House-passed 
legislation giving patients more power in dealing with health 
maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever does represent the working people of New York ... has  
to be willing to stand against any effort to take a U-turn to the 
past,'' Mrs. Clinton told cheering delegates of the 54,000-member 
New York State Public Employees Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some who believe that we should go back to the era  
of trickle-down, supply-side economics,'' she said, drawing a 
chorus of boos. ``There are some who believe that we should stop 
putting police on the streets and taking assault weapons off the 
streets, even though it has worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the ``unfinished business of the 20th Century,'' she  
added, is ``making sure that public education is strong and 
available, and providing a quality education to every child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani had no immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was interrupted during the half-hour address by  
chants of ``Run, Hillary, Run.'' She has indicated she plans to 
formally announce her candidacy early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will have more to say about my plans after the first of the  
year. But I guarantee you will be seeing a lot of me,'' she said to 
more cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo predicted Wednesday  
that Mrs. Clinton will be New York's next U.S. senator. Cuomo, the 
son of the state's former Democratic governor, declined earlier 
this year to run for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe, when all is said and done, Hillary is going to  
win,'' Cuomo told reporters at a White House briefing. ``When the 
votes are counted, Hillary will win. She will be a phenomenal 
senator for the state of New York.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Sewage Spill Closes Beaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida authorities issued a health  
advisory and closed beaches after a main pipe burst, spilling more 
than 8 million gallons of sewage into the Indian River. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-inch pipe broke open Monday at a wastewater treatment  
plant about 115 miles north of Miami. The spill was less than two 
miles from the ocean, which allowed the sewage to spread along the 
Atlantic coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaches were closed Tuesday in Indian River, St. Lucie and  
Martin counties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to monitor these beaches and advise local  
officials when they are safe to reopen,'' said Department of Health 
Secretary Robert Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility officials said the 36-inch pipe had been leaking for 36  
hours before it finally broke from the stress caused by rainfall 
from Hurricane Irene. It released a stream of waste into the lagoon 
Monday at a rate of 625,000 gallons an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Plant officials said they stemmed the leak by Tuesday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	St. Lucie County Administrator Doug Anderson flew over the  
region in a helicopter Tuesday. ``You could smell the sewage spill 
from the air,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Dawson May Miss Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- All-Pro center Dermontti Dawson didn't  
practice Wednesday because of the first serious in-season injury of 
his 12-year career and may miss the Pittsburgh Steelers' game 
Monday against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson couldn't run and even his walk was much slower than  
usual, the result of a pulled hamstring in the first quarter of 
Sunday's 17-3 victory in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson did not rule himself out -- he is listed as questionable --  
but backup Roger Duffy inadvertently suggested that Dawson's streak 
of 170 consecutive starts might end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I can hold down the fort for a couple of weeks so we can  
get him back and healthy for a run at the end of the year,'' said 
Duffy, who was given a game ball for his play in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Steelers have an off week following Monday's game,  
they might prefer that Dawson sit out the Atlanta game and take two 
full weeks off before a Nov. 6 game in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do right now is rest it,'' Dawson said. ``It's day  
to day. I keep getting treatment, and that's all I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson's streak is the second-longest currently in the NFL and  
the third-longest in team history. Dawson, voted the All-Pro center 
the last five years, has never failed to start since succeeding 
Hall of Famer Mike Webster late in Dawson's rookie season in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The only streaks longer in Steelers history were by Dawson's  
predecessors, Ray Mansfield (182 games) and Webster (177). The 
three are the only starting centers the Steelers have had for the 
last 30 years, although Jim Clack spelled Mansfield occasionally 
late in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	None of his teammates could recall seeing Dawson miss more than  
an occasional play here or there. Dawson played the second half 
against Denver in 1991 on a badly sprained ankle, and missed only 
two plays despite hyperextending an elbow in Jacksonville in the 
final regular season game last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year I was in there for just a couple of plays at center  
and he was running back out there with his arm taped,'' Duffy said. 
``He hates missing time, but, unfortunately, it's a little more 
severe than anticipated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Cowher said, ``When he comes off the field, you know  
it's a significant injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is the second for the 34-year-old Dawson this season.  
He sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee on the 
first day of training camp and missed most of the contact work in 
camp, yet still took part in a workout against the Washington 
Redskins several days later -- without a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to make sure we're cautious with him, because he  
always wants to play,'' Cowher said. ``If we leave it up to him, 
he'll come back before he's ready.''

<HEADLINE> Warrick Plea Bargain Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick's legal case goes to a  
judge Thursday. His future at Florida State now appears to be in 
the hands of the school's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick's lawyer postponed a plea agreement hearing Wednesday  
after Florida State president Sandy D'Alemberte balked at a 
proposed deal that could have had the player back on the field 
Saturday at Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alemberte, silent on the Warrick case since the player's  
arrest Oct. 7 on a felony grand theft charge, said Wednesday he 
would have the final say on the player's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the court's decision comes, Dave Hart, our athletics  
director, and I will confer and then announce our decision,'' 
D'Alemberte said. Hart and Florida State general counsel Alan 
Sundberg spoke with D'Alemberte by phone Wednesday about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny received a postponement on Warrick's plea agreement,  
giving him time to speak with Sundberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some concern that he had regarding the  
administration at FSU,'' said Warren Goodwin in the Leon County 
State Attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, who decided against turning pro last year to play his  
final year in college, was willing to spend a month in jail after 
the holidays to get a chance to get back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State does not let its athletes compete if they have  
been charged with a felony, but they can take part if the charge is 
a misdemeanor. Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, who goes after his 
300th career victory Saturday at Clemson against son Tommy, says 
Warrick has already been severely punished. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick and former teammate Laveranues Coles were charged with  
buying more than $400 of designer clothes Sept. 29 for $21.40 from 
a store clerk, who is also charged. A security camera recorded the 
transaction. Coles, who was already on probation with Bowden, was 
kicked off the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's scheduled hearing on Warrick's agreement with  
prosecutors, which included 30 days jail time, was moved to 
Thursday after D'Alemberte said he had questions about the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel very good about somebody having a sentence  
hanging over them and playing,'' he told the Tallahassee Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	That agreement would have required Warrick spend 30 days in jail  
in addition to paying retail price for his clothes, pay court costs 
and serve a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, who has missed the Miami and Wake Forest games, was  
considered the leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy when he was 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is he's still the best player in the country,''  
Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke said. ``I think he's 
suffered enough. He deserves to be on the football team and I can't 
wait for his return.''

<HEADLINE> Citadel Sex Bias Suit To Go Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A judge has ruled that The Citadel can be  
held liable if it is proven that five former students harassed a 
female cadet at the state-supported military college. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joseph Anderson ruled Tuesday that The  
Citadel can be tried for sexual discrimination since schools that 
receive federal funds can be sued under Title IX if one student 
sexually harasses another. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanie Mentavlos, one of four women admitted to the formerly  
all-male school in 1996, sued five former cadets, alleging she was 
hazed and harassed before she dropped out after one semester. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentavlos, of Charlotte, N.C., also alleges that Citadel  
officials violated her civil rights by failing to act against male 
upperclassmen who were hostile about the admission of women. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge dismissed about half of her 34 complaints and ruled  
that the former cadets should be tried separately from the school. 
Anderson said there was evidence The Citadel may have covered up 
the allegations, but did not say what that evidence was. 
</P>
<P>
	The former cadets are scheduled to go to trial first, on Nov.  
12. Anderson said he does not want testimony from The Citadel to 
taint the jury's decision against the men. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cadets had nothing to do with the cover-up by the  
school,'' he said. Anderson said he will make a written decision on 
claims against the school pending the outcome of the former cadets' 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims Ms. Mentavlos suffered ``insults,  
indignities, physical assault and humiliating treatment which went 
far beyond any need to toughen, strengthen or acclimate plaintiff 
to the rigors of military discipline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Dawes Cooke, who represents The Citadel, said Mentavlos  
has presented ``a shotgun blast of numerous types of things.'' But 
Mentavlos' attorney, Dick Harpootlian, said he can prove a pattern 
of harassment that the school did nothing to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Citadel cadets prey on those who are different,''  
Harpootlian said. ``Everything that was done was not because she 
couldn't cut it, it's because she was a woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mentavlos, who graduated from Queens College in Charlotte, N.C.,  
and is teaching sixth grade, had said earlier she looked forward to 
a jury trial, but referred comment to her attorney after Tuesday's 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon Faulkner became the first female cadet when she entered  
The Citadel under a court order in 1995. She dropped out after less 
than a week, citing the stress of the court fight and her isolation 
in the corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Messer, another female cadet admitted with Mentavlos in  
1996, settled a lawsuit against The Citadel last year for $33,750. 
In May, Nancy Mace became The Citadel's first female graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the second beating incident at The Citadel in a week  
has resulted in an injured cadet leaving the military school 
Tuesday with 14 stitches over one eye and an injured head. 
</P>
<P>
	Another incident this month led to aggravated assault and  
battery charges against James Edward Trabert, 23, of Bellefontaine, 
Ohio, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to affidavits filed by four alleged victims , Trabert  
allegedly punched them in the ribs and kidneys, slapped in their 
face and hit them with a broom. Two were burned with a cigarette, 
one on his back, the other on his hand.

<HEADLINE> Telmex Reports 42 Pct. Income Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Telefonos de Mexico SA reported Wednesday  
that growth in its cellular business and foreign-exchange gains 
fueled a 42 percent increase in third-quarter net income. 
</P>
<P>
	Telmex, as Mexico's dominant phone carrier is known, reported  
134.5 percent annual cellular subscriber growth to 4.1 million, 
adding 897,000 subscribers during the third quarter alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Telmex reported net income of 5.85 billion pesos ($610 million),  
or 0.78 pesos (80 cents) a share, on revenue of 24.09 billion pesos 
($2.5 billion) during the three months ended Sept. 30. That 
compares to net income of 4.1 billion pesos (then $411 million), or 
0.53 (53 cents) a share, on revenue of 22.56 billion pesos ($2.256 
billion) during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Per-share earnings got a boost from share buybacks. Telmex had  
7.492 billion outstanding shares at the end of the quarter, down 
from 7.783 billion last year.

<HEADLINE> Makers of Boxed Wine Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It's a brawl that has been fermenting for  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Makers of inexpensive boxed wines have drawn the wrath of grape  
growers who don't like the fact that the vino is being watered down 
under labels that bear premium grape variety names. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is one of consumer confusion,'' said Barry Bedwell,  
president of Allied Grape Growers. ``Consumers are being misled 
into purchasing a product without knowing what's in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grape growers are concerned for obvious reasons. If  
manufacturers in the $200 million boxed-wine industry dilute their 
product, they need fewer grapes. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's another issue, perhaps more important to those who  
produce the bottles that sell for $10, $20 and more -- a loophole in 
government regulations allows the makers to use treasured varietal 
names such as merlot and cabernet sauvignon on the boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry, and grape growers in particular, have invested  
hundreds of millions of dollars developing varietal vineyards,'' 
said Bedwell, whose group represents 550 wine grape growers in 
California. ``The integrity of these grapes is at issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &AMP; Firearms regulations say  
that if a varietal name is used on the label of a bottle of wine -- 
defined as having an alcohol content of between 7 percent and 14 
percent -- at least 75 percent of the wine must have been made from 
that variety of grape. 
</P>
<P>
	The wine industry complains that boxed wine giants like E&AMP;J  
Gallo, Franzia and New York State's Canandaigua Brands, which 
produces 30 million cases of boxed wine annually under the Almaden 
label, slip through that loophole because the regulations don't 
apply to formula wines. 
</P>
<P>
	To gain federal approval, they say, the makers provide a  
``formula'' or recipe, which can include such things as ``natural 
flavors,'' industry shorthand for sugar, water and other 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, they contend, just enough alcohol is added to keep the  
wine under the 7 percent figure, so the product isn't considered 
wine. The boxes may carry the varietal label if 75 percent of the 
wine in the box came from that kind of grape -- even if the wine is 
only a small percent of the contents. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1997, the San Francisco-based Wine Institute asked  
the ATF to prohibit the use of varietal names on so-called 
``formula'' or ``other than standard'' wine products. 
</P>
<P>
	Renewed industry complaints have prompted the agency to take  
another look at the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute wants the ATF to require that such terms as  
``flavored wine product'' and ``with natural flavors added'' be put 
on box wine packages if such terms apply. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no objection to the sale of such products,'' said  
Wendell Lee, the institute's attorney. ``We just want them to be 
more adequately labeled than they currently are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from the ATF did not return messages from The  
Associated Press seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Sands, executive vice president of Canandaigua Brands and  
acting president of the company's wine operation, disagrees with 
the industry opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are obviously quite strongly opposed to that point of  
view,'' he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, we don't think consumers are confused about the formula  
wines,'' he said. ``We have significant research that shows 
consumers know what they are buying, and they feel they are 
receiving a value ... because of the obvious difference in price 
they are paying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``Is our product watered down? No. Is water used in  
the processing of the product? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that a bad thing? No.''

<HEADLINE> Makers of Boxed Wine Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a land where wine is worshipped, there's  
growing concern about the makers of cheap wine in boxes watering 
down the vino while using premium grape variety names on the label. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is one of consumer confusion,'' Barry Bedwell,  
president of Allied Grape Growers, said Wednesday. ``Consumers are 
being misled into purchasing a product without knowing what's in 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilfred Wong, a wine buyer for Beverages &AMP; more!, a 16-store  
California retail chain, said customers who buy the boxed wines are 
generally satisfied and enjoy the relatively low-price, but some 
aren't quite sure how it differs from bottled wine. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're usually older people,'' he said. ``I have had a couple  
of people ask, 'What's the other stuff they put in this thing?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bedwell's group, which represents 550 wine grape growers in  
California, has an obvious cause for concern. If manufacturers in 
the $200 million boxed-wine industry can water down their product, 
they need fewer grapes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an estimate that 7 percent of the wine business is  
boxed wines,'' he said. ``That amounts to literally thousands of 
tons of grapes no longer needed, at a time when we are increasing 
the grape supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there's another issue, perhaps even more important to those  
who produce the bottles that sell for $10, $20 and more -- a 
loophole in government regulations allows the makers to use 
treasured varietal names such as merlot and cabernet sauvignon on 
the boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry, and grape growers in particular, have invested  
hundreds of millions of dollars developing varietal vineyards,'' 
Bedwell said. ``The integrity of these grapes is at issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute has been fermenting for about two years.  
</P>
<P>
	In September of 1977, John A. De Luca, president of the San  
Francisco-based Wine Institute, asked the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco &AMP; Firearms to prohibit the use of varietal names on 
so-called ``formula'' or ``other than standard'' wine products. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, BATF regulations say that if a varietal name is used  
on the label of a bottle of wine -- defined as having an alcohol 
content of between 7 and 14 percent -- at least 75 percent of the 
wine must have been made from that variety of grape. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry complaints have prompted the BATF to take another look  
at the issue, and may consider forcing some brands to make changes 
in their labels. 
</P>
<P>
	The wine industry complains that boxed wine giants like E&AMP;J  
Gallo, Franzia and New York State's Canandaigua Brands, which 
produces 30 million cases of boxed wine annually under the Almaden 
label, manage to slip through a loophole in those regulations 
because they don't apply to formula wines. 
</P>
<P>
	To gain federal approval, they say, the makers provide a  
``formula'' or recipe, which can include such things as ``natural 
flavors,'' industry shorthand for sugar, water and other, 
unspecified ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, they contend, just enough alcohol is added to keep the  
wine under the 7 percent figure, so the product isn't considered 
wine. The boxes may carry the varietal label if 75 percent of the 
wine in the box came from that kind of grape -- even if the wine is 
only a small percent of the contents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wine Institute has renewed its request for help. In a March  
resolution, the group's board of directors asked the BATF to 
require that such terms as ``flavored wine product'' and ``with 
natural flavors added'' be required on box wine packages if such 
terms apply. 
</P>
<P>
	BATF representatives did not return a request by The Associated  
Press for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no objection to the sale of such products,'' said  
Wendell Lee, the institute's attorney. ``We just want them to be

they are buying, and they feel they are receiving a value ... 
because of the obvious difference in price they are paying,'' said 
Sands. 
</P>
<P>
	He also disputed the industry's description of the regulations.  
He said that because of labeling rules, more than 50 percent of the 
contents of a boxed Canandaigua wine is made from the grapes on the 
label. 
</P>
<P>
	What about allegation the product is watered down?  
</P>
<P>
	``Water is routinely added to wine,'' he said. ``Is our product  
watered down? No. Is water used in the processing of the product? 
Yes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that a bad thing? No.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Lauds Texas Cleanup Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A former soil-testing lab cleared for use as a  
center for the homeless is a prime example of how government and 
business can team up on environmental problems, Gov. George W. Bush 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush visited the cavernous facility with Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk  
and federal and state regulators. He lauded the program and the 
work that allowed the site to get a clean bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, sites such as this were closed to development  
because of wrong logic, bad regulation and legal liability,'' said 
Bush, a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is one of 965 enrolled in the Texas Voluntary Cleanup  
Program, approved by the Legislature and Bush in 1995 to provide 
incentives to develop potentially contaminated sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other sites involved are former dry cleaners, shopping  
centers, warehouses and industrial businesses. Any property owner 
may enter the program unless the government has already ordered a 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	When a property owner has finished the cleanup, the Texas  
Natural Resource Conservation Commission files a document shielding 
future owners from responsibility. That removes a major obstacle to 
developing such sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility Bush visited was a former environmental lab  
operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Sludge and wastewater 
lines had to be removed from the site, but now ground and water 
below the building have been tested and approved for residential 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has donated the building to Dallas' Union Gospel  
Mission, which plans to use it to expand its services for the 
homeless.

<HEADLINE> Kramer To Start for Chargers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Not even four interceptions in one half could  
send San Diego Chargers quarterback Erik Kramer to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer doesn't exactly have the hottest hand, but he has led the  
Chargers to three straight wins and the AFC West lead, so he'll 
remain the starter for Sunday's home game against the Green Bay 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing dramatic about that except the fact that we  
have got a little momentum,'' coach Mike Riley said Wednesday. ``I 
think we've made some improvement and I don't want to break that 
momentum up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer stepped in after Jim Harbaugh sustained two cracked ribs  
and a bruised throwing elbow in the first quarter against Kansas 
City on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	He rallied the Chargers from a 14-0 deficit to a 21-14 win in  
that game, then led the Chargers to a 20-10 win at Detroit and a 
13-10 victory over Seattle last Sunday that gave San Diego a 4-1 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he hasn't thrown a touchdown pass since the Kansas City  
game, and the offense, ranked 28th in the NFL, has scored just one 
touchdown in each of the last two games. Kramer has thrown six 
interceptions to just two TD passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer was intercepted on San Diego's first four possessions in  
the second half of the Seattle game, then went 6-for-6 for 85 yards 
on the final two drives, which John Carney capped by kicking the 
tying and winning field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to San Diego's defense, which has come up big in all four  
victories, Seattle scored just seven points off Kramer's four 
interceptions. Riley said only one of the pickoffs resulted from a 
bad decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, he moved our team, had a very efficient  
throwing day and made some big plays,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer promised that fans would soon see ``more of an effective,  
efficient offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty pleased overall with the decisions I've made,''  
said Kramer, who joined the Chargers the night before training camp 
opened. ``It's a growing process. It's a process that's building in 
the right direction. I have every confidence things are going to 
get untracked here, soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he'll probably decide the starter on a weekly basis,  
``out of respect to both guys. They're both real good guys to have. 
Both of them have started for this team and I feel good about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh, who was available if needed in the last two games,  
said he's healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	`We've won three straight games and everybody's thrilled about  
that,'' Harbaugh said. ``Coach Riley said he didn't want to make a 
change and I kind of expected that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, who used to play for the Detroit Lions and Chicago  
Bears, is 2-6 against the Packers, including six straight losses. 
He missed both of Chicago's games against Green Bay last year due 
to injuries.

<HEADLINE> Vaccine May Fight Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Researchers have developed an experimental  
vaccine that appears to fight prostate cancer by revving up the 
body's immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	``This same concept could be applied to breast cancer or other  
cancers,'' Jonathan Simons, who led the study done by researchers 
at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, said Wednesday. ``This is not 
a cure, but this is a whole new door to walk through to get to 
curing prostate cancer using the immune system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in the October issue of the journal  
Cancer Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers tricked the human immune system into recognizing  
cancerous prostate cells as foreign invaders by genetically 
engineering patients' own cells and injecting them back into the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	While the approach has been tried before, the researchers at  
Johns Hopkins were able for the first time to activate the body's 
entire immune system to fight prostate cancer, Simons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers used a gene, called GM-CSF, that activates the  
immune system, attached it to a common virus and implanted it 
inside cancerous cells of 11 prostate organs surgically removed 
from patients. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight cases, researchers were able to grow a culture of the  
modified, cancerous cells in the laboratory. The cells were then 
irradiated, which kept them alive but stopped them from multiplying 
any further. 
</P>
<P>
	After the vaccine was injected, the immune system of all eight  
patients produced antibodies that identified foreign invaders as 
well as immune cells that attack and kill infectious cells, Simons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine not only recognized the injected cells as foreign  
but apparently told the immune system to recognize cancerous 
prostate cells remaining in the body as foreign, Dr. John Gutheil, 
clinical research director at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center in 
San Diego, said of the research. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good stuff, if they've really had immune response,''  
Gutheil said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our immune system doesn't see cancer as being that much  
different from our normal tissue, a situation we refer to as immune 
tolerance,'' he said. ``What you're seeing here is people are 
trying to use GM-CSF to actually override this immune tolerance 
that we have for our own tissues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death  
among men, behind lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still too early to tell what impact this is going to have  
on the disease,'' said Dr. Charles Myers, director of the 
University of Virginia Cancer Center. He has been diagnosed with 
prostate cancer. ``I think it's an important step in the 
development of prostate cancer immunotherapy, but it doesn't look 
to be the final step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simons said it is also unclear whether the vaccine would  
convince the immune system to attack normal prostate tissue in 
patients with cancer of the prostate who have not had the organ 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chances are the immune system would attack the normal prostate  
as well, but that's not a big deal because the prostate is not a 
life-sustaining organ,'' Gutheil said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said he believes the vaccine technology can  
eventually be improved enough so the immune system only targets 
cancerous cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Simons said while the study dealt with whether it could produce  
the immune response, further research is under way to determine 
whether the immune system can fight cancer in patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in the field for decades and people have been  
skeptical about whether the immune system could ever see prostate 
cancer,'' Simons said. ``What's truly novel about this paper is not 
only can the immune system see prostate cancer, but you can 
activate all the appropriate anti-cancer killing arms.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Enjoys Best Week Since Mid '98 / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Clearly, television viewers like the looks of  
Alan Alda with fake bloodstains on his clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	The erstwhile ``M A S H'' surgeon, starting a brief stint as a  
doctor on ``ER,'' boosted the popular medical drama's ratings and 
led NBC to its best week since the network televised Michael 
Jordan's final games in mid-1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Alda began working in the emergency room of ``ER'''s Cook County  
General Hospital in Chicago last Thursday. The well-publicized 
appearance increased the show's audience by 2 million people over 
the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was easily last week's most-watched show, with nearly 9  
million more viewers than its closest competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's 11.0 rating and 18 share won Nielsen Media Research's  
weekly ratings race. It was the network's biggest weekly audience 
since June 1998, when NBC covered Jordan's last games in the NBA 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sport -- baseball -- helped NBC last week. The New York  
Mets' 15-inning victory over the Atlanta Braves Sunday in the 
National League Championship Series was the highest-rated league 
championship game with an afternoon start since 1987, perhaps 
because it stretched to nearly 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	It enabled NBC to do well on a night that CBS normally wins, and  
postpone a TV movie on disc jockey Alan Freed that had received 
poor reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS finished second for the week with a 9.2 rating and 15 share.  
Fox, also buoyed by baseball coverage, finished third with a 7.6 
rating and 13 share and ABC had a 7.2 rating and 12 share. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB had a 3.1 rating and 5 share, improving UPN had a 2.8  
rating and 5 share and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race  
with a 7.5 rating and 16 share. The ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 7.4 
rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.4 
rating and 14 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Oct. 11-17, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' NBC, 20.4; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 13.8; ``Friends,'' NBC,  
13.8; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 12.3; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 12.2; ``National League Championship Series: Atlanta 
vs. N.Y. Mets,'' NBC, 12.0; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 11.7; ``Judging 
Amy,'' CBS, 11.7; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 11.7; ``CBS Sunday Movie: 
Silk Hope,'' CBS, 11.4.

<HEADLINE> Wentworth Out As Denison Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRANVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- Bill Wentworth is out as football coach  
at Denison University after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletics director Larry Scheiderer said Tuesday that Denison  
president Dale Knobel has accepted the faculty's recommendation 
that Wentworth not be brought back. 
</P>
<P>
	Wentworth, who came to Denison in 1993 after two seasons as an  
assistant at Washington, has not had a winning season. He is 
21-44-1 and the Big Red are 2-4 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheiderer did not give specific reasons for the firing, but did  
say Wentworth's record was a factor.

<HEADLINE> US Airways, TWA Report Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	US Airways and Trans World Airlines reported third-quarter  
losses Wednesday, saying earnings were hurt by labor problems and 
Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	United and American airlines reported earnings for the quarter,  
but their results were down from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways reported a worse-than-expected loss of $85 million  
after a profitable third quarter in 1998. TWA, meanwhile, said its 
loss of $59.5 million widened from $11.2 million in the third 
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines reported an 11.6 percent earnings drop and  
American Airlines reported that earnings fell by a third. Both 
blamed flight cancellations due to bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is a look at the companies' results:  

</P>
<P>
                            *US Airways    	
</P>
<P>
	US Airways reported a worse-than-expected third-quarter loss of  
$85 million, or $1.19 per share, compared with $142 million, or 
$1.51 a share, for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline said profits were hurt by labor problems and the  
cancellation of about 1,500 flights during Hurricane Floyd in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	The results fell below analysts' expectations for a loss of 35  
cents per share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways also reported a 4.5 percent drop in revenues to $2.1  
billion from $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline also had to ground flights because of labor  
problems, which included pilot training courses that fell behind 
schedule and delays in airplanes being returned from maintenance. 
The maintenance problems cropped up as the airline negotiated with 
its 7,500 mechanics, airplane cleaners and maintenance workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers came within 48 hours of a strike earlier this month  
before voting to accept a new contract with the Arlington, 
Va.-based airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher fuel costs added to the problems, the airline said.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, US Airways earned $278  
million, or $3.65 per share, compared to $428 million, or $4.40 per 
share over the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue dropped to $6.46 billion from $6.57 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	US Airways stock fell $1.81 1/4 to $26.31 1/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                        *Trans World Airlines    	
</P>
<P>
	TWA said labor problems contributed to its loss of $59.5  
million, or 87 cents per share, compared to a loss of $11.2 
million, or 18 cents per, share a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting a $33.5 million charge from the ratification of the  
labor agreement and a $16 million gain from selling stakes in 
Priceline.com Inc., the company lost $36.2 million, or 61 cents a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Those results fell below analysts' expectations of a loss of 52  
cents per share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 1.5 percent to $876.4 million from $863.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	TWA said labor uncertainty preceded the July 22 ratification of  
its contract with employees represented by the International 
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. During that time, 
high-paying business travelers switched to other airlines, TWA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA stock fell 25 cents to $3.43 3/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, TWA lost $99 million, or $1.47 per  
share, on revenues of $2.5 billion. That's up from a loss of $58.9 
million, or 98 cents per share, on revenues of $2.5 billion in 
1998. 

</P>
<P>
                          *United Airlines    	
</P>
<P>
	The parent of United Airlines reported an 11.6 percent drop in  
third-quarter profit, blaming flight disruptions from Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL Corp. reported net earnings of $456 million, or $3.75 a  
share, down from $516 million, or $4.02 a share, for the same 
period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a penny lower than Wall Street's expectation of $3.76  
per share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter were up 1.5 percent over the 1998  
period, to $4.85 billion from $4.78 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides storm-related cancellations, UAL said earnings were also  
influenced by the effects of a 1998 pilots' strike at rival 
Northwest Airlines, which temporarily pumped up profits in the 
third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based company said 750 Floyd-related  
cancellations cost it $15 million, wiping out much of the gains 
from earlier in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	United's stock was down $1.31 1/4, at $61, on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, net earnings increased to  
$1.4 billion, or $11.56 a share, from $1.2 billion, or $8.93 a 
share in 1998. Those results include a 1999 second-quarter sale of 
stock in the international reservations system Galileo -- a one-time 
gain of $669 million. Revenues rose over the same period to $13.5 
billion from $13.3 billion. 

</P>
<P>
                         *American Airlines    	
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines' parent company said its third-quarter  
earnings were down more than one-third from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Worth-based AMR Corp. reported net earnings of $279  
million, or $1.76 per share, down from $433 million, or $2.49 a 
share, for the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	That easily beat the $1.69 estimate of analysts surveyed by  
First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR, which operates the American Eagle commuter airline in  
addition to American, the nation's No. 2 carrier, reported 
operating revenue of $5.15 billion in the quarter, an increase of 
2.1 percent from a year ago. Revenue from American's passengers 
grew less than 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits were hampered this quarter by a 14 percent increase in  
fuel prices over a year ago, as well as double-digit increases for 
aircraft rentals and airport landing fees, the company said. 
Hurricane Floyd also disrupted many flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Donald J. Carty also said last  
year's third quarter was especially profitable because American 
picked up extra business from two carriers that were on strike. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, AMR said net earnings were  
down 38 percent from the same period in 1998, from $1.13 billion to 
$705 million. Total operating revenue was virtually flat -- $14.64 
billion, or 0.3 percent higher than the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR's shares closed down 6 1/4 cents, at $54.56 1/4, in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Study: Exercise Combats Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A study of more than 70,000 women found that  
exercise -- even brisk walking -- can reduce the risk of developing 
adult-onset diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of women participating in the Nurses Health Study  
found that moderate to vigorous exercise was associated with a 46 
percent lower risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers were led by Dr. Frank B. Hu of the Harvard  
School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical  
Association, is in line with previous research on both men and 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National  
Institutes of Health recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate 
exercise a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes occurs when the body is insulin-deficient, becomes  
impaired in its capacity to use insulin, or both.

<HEADLINE> Braves Back in World Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The World Series may seem like a letdown for the  
Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Andruw Jones walked with the bases loaded in the 11th inning,  
giving the Braves a stunning 10-9 victory over the New York Mets in 
Game 6 of the NL Championship Series on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy as hell I'm not pitching tomorrow,'' said Tom  
Glavine, whose scheduled appearance in Game 7 became a moot point 
when the Braves won the best-of-7 series 4-2. ``I'm thankful to be 
going to the World Series -- especially after that series. It was 
gut-wrenching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta did its best to squander a 3-0 lead in the series and a  
5-0 lead in the final game. In the end, they showed the resiliency 
of a champion, just as they had all year. 
</P>
<P>
	When cleanup hitter Andres Galarraga was lost for the season  
because of cancer, the Braves found a way to survive. When Kerry 
Ligtenberg, Javy Lopez, Odalis Perez and Rudy Seanez succumbed to 
season-ending injuries, the Braves came up with players to plug the 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys like Eddie Perez made this team go,'' said manager Bobby  
Cox, referring to the catcher who took over for Lopez and wound up 
as MVP of the NLCS. ``Part-timers who got a chance to get in there 
and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed Atlanta would finally be able to do things the easy  
way in Game 6, scoring five runs in the first inning to knock out 
Mets starter Al Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so fast.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, as was their custom all season, fought back in  
dramatic fashion to tie the game at 7, then take leads of 8-7 and 
9-8. Both times, the Braves bounced back themselves when everything 
seemed to be going New York's way. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who was 10-for-20 with two homers and five RBIs in the  
series, got his final hit in the eighth, a one-out single. He left 
the game for pinch-runner Otis Nixon, who stole second, went to 
third on a throwing error and came home with the run that evened 
the score at 8. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Mets went ahead again in the 10th, third-string  
shortstop Ozzie Guillen answered with a pinch-hit single to right. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the Braves won the game with two more unlikely people  
playing key parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Springer, thrust into a prominent role out of the bullpen,  
pitched a scoreless 11th and Gerald Williams, a full-time player 
for the first time, led off the bottom half with a double into the 
left-field corner against Kenny Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are situations where people put labels on you,'' said  
Williams, who mainly played a platoon role until this year. ``But 
you have to have the opportunity to play. I'm just thankful Mr. Cox 
saw fit to put me in the lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Williams was bunted to third by Bret Boone, the Mets  
walked the next two hitters, Chipper Jones and Brian Jordan. That 
brought up Andruw Jones, the outfielder who hit two World Series 
homers at Yankee Stadium while still a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have to do anything so dramatic this time. Now a  
patient 22-year-old, Jones kept watching pitches until Rogers 
delivered a fastball high and outside with a 3-2 count. Williams 
danced across home and Jones pounced on first with both feet before 
being engulfed by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just exhilarating, exhilarating,'' said general manager  
John Schuerholz, whose team is making its fifth World Series 
appearance of the decade but first since 1996. ``What a year! What 
a game!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the Braves had secured one last chance at their second  
World Series title of 1990s. Game 1 against the AL champion Yankees 
is Saturday at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe by then, the Braves will have recovered from this one.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Death Row Inmate To Sue Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man who spent 15 years on death row before his  
conviction was thrown out with the help of college journalists has 
asked the state to pay him for his prison time, and plans to sue 
city police for millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Porter, 44, could get $144,000 or more, said his  
attorney, Daniel Sanders. He said that wouldn't cover the agony of 
sitting on death row waiting to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt that you could ask anybody to go into that situation  
for $140,000,'' Sanders said Wednesday after filing papers with the 
Court of Claims, part of the executive branch of state government. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois law limits how much former inmates can collect for  
wrongful imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said, however, that he will sue the Chicago police  
within weeks, accusing them of framing Porter. He said winning that 
case could result in damages of ``several million'' dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter spent 15 years behind bars for a double murder in 1982.  
He was released in February after another man, Alstory Simon, 
confessed to the killings under questioning by a private 
investigator working with a Northwestern University journalism 
class.

<HEADLINE> Budget Talks Off to Rocky Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Budget talks at the Capitol between the  
Clinton administration and Congress got off to a rocky start 
Wednesday, with White House officials accusing Republicans of 
ignoring a pact to stop attacking each other over Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-hour meeting between leaders of the House and Senate  
Appropriations Committees and White House budget director Jack Lew 
got nowhere, participants from both parties said. Lew complained 
that GOP leaders had violated an understanding they reached Tuesday 
at a White House budget session with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Lew objected to a press release distributed Wednesday by House  
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, depicting a Social Security 
card with ``Clinton/Gore Charge Card'' written on it. Over that was 
stamped the word ``REJECTED,'' a reference to GOP charges that 
Clinton wants to pay for new programs with Social Security 
surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lew also complained about a press conference at which House  
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, made a similar point. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how Wednesday's meeting had gone, Senate Appropriations  
Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said, ``Not exactly well. 
We discussed who was guilty of rhetoric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey spokeswoman Michele Davis said the two sides had agreed to  
not attack each other, but Armey was merely repeating an argument 
he has used for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how you can commit to save Social Security, and  
not be allowed to say so,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though it was unclear when the two sides will meet again, the  
clash was unlikely to completely derail the two sides' effort to 
complete unfinished spending bills for the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the episode underlined how the political victor in this  
fall's budget fight may ultimately be determined less by whose 
spending priorities are adopted than by whether Republicans can 
convince the public that they have kept their pledge not to tap 
Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	On the surface, Clinton wants several billion dollars more than  
Congress has provided for teachers, police, foreign aid and other 
programs. The president wants to kill provisions helping the oil, 
mining and other industries that the administration considers 
anti-environmental, while Republicans want to give states more 
control over money for schools and other programs than Clinton 
prefers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree those disputes can be resolved and that savings  
to pay for the extra spending will be found. That probably will not 
happen by Tuesday, the deadline Clinton and congressional leaders 
have set. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there is a politically more significant dispute over whether  
the underlying spending bills -- without Clinton's requests for more 
money -- tap the Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	With each side citing analyses by the nonpartisan Congressional  
Budget Office, Democrats say the bills already eat into the pension 
system's surpluses, using gimmicks like delayed spending to mask 
that fact. Republicans say the final versions of the bills will not 
touch the Social Security money. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the two sides have agreed not to use Social Security  
funds, they disagree over whether the underlying bills obey that 
principle. If that dispute persists when they complete their work, 
both parties will launch public relations blitzes: The GOP will say 
it honored the promise and Democrats will contend Republicans broke 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, both parties have used Social Security's surpluses  
to cover spending without diminishing the system's benefits. But 
looking ahead to next year's elections, each party is eager to cast 
itself as a defender of the massive pension program for the elderly 
and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Clinton signed the sixth of the 13 annual spending  
bills for fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1. It was a $99 billion 
measure financing housing, veterans and environmental programs. An 
earlier round of bargaining between lawmakers and Lew produced an 
added $7 billion to earlier House-approved levels for housing, 
space and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has veto threats against five of the bills because of  
disputes over spending or policy. They cover the departments of 
Education, Interior and five other Cabinet level agencies, plus 
foreign aid the District of Columbia's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	If those fights are not resolved by Tuesday, White House  
officials are threatening a veto of a sixth measure, a $268 billion 
defense bill. The administration hopes to use that threat for 
leverage because a veto would add it to the bills from which 
savings could be pulled to pay for other spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would make him look irresponsible,'' House  
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said of that 
veto threat. Referring to U.S. troops in Kosovo and elsewhere, 
Young said, ``He sent those people there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Congress sent Clinton a $39 billion measure financing  
the departments of Commerce, Justice and State. The House approved 
it by 215-213, while the Senate used a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	It is one of those facing a veto threat because it provides less  
than Clinton wants for hiring police officers. But Republicans are 
eager to push all remaining bills to Clinton so they cannot be 
accused of not having finished their work.

<HEADLINE> Swissair Parent Buys Into LOT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Swissair parent SAirGroup plans to  
buy a 37.6 percent stake in the state-owned Polish airline, LOT, 
but is still discussing the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	SAirGroup said today it has been ``selected by the Polish  
government as a strategic partner'' for LOT in a plan that calls 
for it to complete the deal by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	LOT should become a member of the Qualiflyer Group Alliance,  
which includes Swissair, Sabena, TAP Air Portugal and Turkish 
Airlines, in January, SAirGroup said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the deal wasn't disclosed. ``Negotiations on the  
concrete form of the cooperation are ongoing,'' SAirGroup said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our new partner has substantial market potential and LOT's  
Warsaw hub ideally enhances the Qualiflyer Group's position in 
Eastern Europe,'' said SAirGroup chief executive Philippe 
Bruggisser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polish airline generated operating revenue last year of $568  
million, the Swiss company said. It has 4,150 employees and 28 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	In Warsaw, Treasury Ministry spokeswoman Beata Jarosz confirmed  
the government decision to choose Swissair as LOT's strategic 
partner, pending final negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Swissair was picked from a short list for the airline's  
privatization which also included British Airways and Lufthansa.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Major Leaguer Ray Katt Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas (AP) -- Former major league catcher Ray  
Katt, known for his compassion and competitive spirit while coach 
at Texas Lutheran, has died at age 72 of lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way coach Katt carried himself you would never know that  
he played with guys like Willie Mays and Stan Musial,'' said 
current TLU baseball coach Bill Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``He coached for all the right reasons -- for the players,''  
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katt played for the New York Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals  
from 1952 to 1959, and finished with a .232 career average with 32 
home runs and 120 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the Leo Durocher-managed Giants that swept  
the Cleveland Indians in the 1954 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He also coached for St. Louis and Cleveland before retiring from  
the professional ranks in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	After coaching high school baseball in his native New Braunfels,  
Katt was the head coach at Texas Lutheran from 1971 to 1992, 
compiling a record of 502-362-2. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife of more than 50 years, Melba, and two  
children, Bruce Katt of Georgetown and Sandra Serold of Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
	Services will be held at 2:30 p.m. Friday at the St. Paul  
Lutheran Church in New Braunfels.

<HEADLINE> Preserved Mammoth Flown to Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- A woolly mammoth preserved in ice has  
been excavated in Siberia and airlifted by helicopter to a cave 
where it will be kept frozen and studied by scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists, including Northern Arizona University mammoth  
expert Larry Agenbroad, recently excavated the nearly perfectly 
preserved adult male mammoth from the permafrost. 
</P>
<P>
	The mammoth was found in 1997 by a 9-year-old nomadic reindeer  
herder. By studying its teeth, scientists determined the 
11-foot-tall mammoth to have been 47 years old. The lifespan of a 
mammoth is about 60 years, 
</P>
<P>
	Encased in an ice block, the mammoth was flown 200 miles by  
helicopter Sunday from the Taimyr Peninsula in Siberia to the city 
of Khatanga. The Discovery Channel, which is covering the 
expedition, released footage of the transport on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mammoth will be kept frozen there in an underground tunnel.  
Besides analyzing dirt, pollen, and even its stomach contents, a 
primary task is to extract DNA for cloning. 
</P>
<P>
	After studying the fossilized remains of mammoths for more than  
30 years, Agenbroad called the experience of petting the hair of 
the mammoth ``fantastic.'' He said it may take months to determine 
cloning prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scientists not involved in the project have said it is  
unlikely the cloning will succeed.

<HEADLINE> Webber Now Enjoying Sacramento </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chris Webber thought about leaving even before he  
got to Sacramento last season. 
</P>
<P>
	It was, after all, a small-market team that hadn't won for 15  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was my low point,'' he said Tuesday before the Kings  
played the Chicago Bulls. ``That's the lowest point I think I've 
ever been, and not just because of being in Sacramento. It was the 
culmination of things that had happened to me in that year, and 
Sacramento was the final chapter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then a funny thing happened. Webber started enjoying himself.  
</P>
<P>
	Led by Webber and Jason Williams, a flashy shooter with a spotty  
past of his own, the Kings were the surprise of the NBA, finishing 
with a 27-23 record and making the playoffs. Webber had a coach who 
trusted him and didn't care about his previous problems. And with 
fans showering him with love, Sacramento turned out to be a 
wonderful place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know it was going to be a new beginning,'' said  
Webber, who led the league in rebounding last season and was a 
second-team All-NBA. ``I thought it was going to be the 
continuation of things being bad. I'm glad it turned around and 
things are good, 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just that I love living in Sacramento. It's more so  
that these guys on the team, they make it enjoyable to go to work 
every day. It's almost like I'm not even working. It's more like 
we're playing hard every day. The fans supported the team when the 
team wasn't good at all, so it's easy for them to support a team 
that's halfway good. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it's fun being in that situation and being with young guys  
and young talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's never been any question that Webber, a former No. 1  
pick, can play. He's averaged 20-plus points or better every year 
except his rookie season, when he averaged 17.5. He's averaging 10 
rebounds per game. Kings coach Rick Adelman calls him one of the 
best passing big men in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But he had a career's worth of off-the-court troubles in his  
first six seasons. He's on his third team -- fourth if you count the 
Orlando Magic, who traded him to the Golden State Warriors on draft 
day. His last season with the Washington Wizards was marred by 
marijuana offenses, traffic violations and accusations of sexual 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was traded to Sacramento, he was so unhappy his agent  
hinted he might refuse to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard throughout the off-season how he may not want to be  
in Sacramento, but after seeing the pieces of the puzzle they were 
putting together, I knew with the success we'd have that he'd 
change his mind,'' Kings forward Corliss Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't tell,'' if he was unhappy. ``He's a cool person.  
He doesn't let anything off the court affect his play on the court 
or his relationships with his teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the way it's always been. No matter how bad things get  
off the court, basketball has always been Webber's refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basketball part is the only thing that keeps me sane,'' he  
said. ``The pressure on the court, I've loved that. It's made me 
play better, kept me goal-oriented while all of the distractions 
are going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Webber showed up at training camp last January -- he skipped  
the first day -- he promised Adelman that, no matter what, he'd 
always play hard. Adelman, in return, promised a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	That vote of confidence, as well as the freedom Adelman gives  
his players on the floor, made a huge difference. Webber started 
the first month of the season strong, taking the Kings along for 
the ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he approached the season last year, he had choices,''  
Adelman said. ``He could have sulked and he chose to go out and 
play. I think he's changed the perception of Chris Webber around 
the league. Probably to who he really is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After some bumpy growing pains, Webber is at peace now. He's  
happy with his life and his work. The wide smile that lights his 
face comes easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad everything's cleared up,'' he said. ``When the smoke  
clears, as long as you're the same person, I think everything turns 
out pretty good.''

<HEADLINE> 2000 Increases in Medicare Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Health and Human Services Department announced Tuesday that  
out-of-pocket health care costs for the 39 million Americans 
covered by Medicare, the national health insurance program for the 
elderly and disabled, will be as follows: 
</P>
<P>
	--Premiums for Medicare ``Part B'' coverage for doctor's office  
visits and other out-of-hospital treatment will remain at $45.50 a 
month. Most beneficiaries have this amount deducted automatically 
from their Social Security checks. 
</P>
<P>
	--The annual deductible for hospital care will rise to $776 from  
$768. 
</P>
<P>
	--Co-payments for hospital stays longer than 60 days will rise to  
$194 a day from $192. 
</P>
<P>
	--Co-payments for hospital stays longer than 90 days will rise to  
$388 a day from $384. 
</P>
<P>
	--Co-payments charged after the first 20 days of care in a  
nursing home will rise to $97 a day from $96. Medicare covers up to 
100 days of nursing home care following hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	--The 365,000 Medicare beneficiaries who must pay a monthly  
premium for ``Part A'' coverage of hospital care will get a break 
in 2000 as it drops to $301 from $309. Retirees who spent less than 
7 1/2 years in the work force, along with people who have lost Social 
Security disability coverage because of earnings from work, must 
pay the monthly charge. Retirees who contributed Medicare payroll 
taxes for 7 1/2 to 10 working years must pay $166 a month. There is no 
monthly premium charged to retirees who paid Medicare payroll taxes 
for more than 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Ohio School Appeals Voucher Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Ohio has asked the Supreme Court to overturn a  
federal judge's order that temporarily bars new students from 
participating in Ohio's school voucher program. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Betty Montgomery made the request  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. is presiding over a  
lawsuit brought by civil liberties groups and others who say the 
program violates the constitutional separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, he said only previous recipients of vouchers could  
obtain financial help from the state until he rules on the 
program's constitutionality. Children new to the program could not 
get the tuition grant. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver has set a Dec. 13 trial date.  
</P>
<P>
	The state appealed Oliver's injunction to the 6th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals on Aug. 30, but never received a response. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are simply perplexed why the Court of Appeals has not  
issued any ruling (or even an explanation of its inaction),'' 
Montgomery wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who handles emergency  
matters from Ohio for the nation's highest court, today asked those 
who sued to respond to the state's request by Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens has the authority to act on the request himself, or he  
can refer it to the full court. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Benen, spokesman for Americans United for Separation of  
Church and State, said the action ``reeks of desperation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this shows they aren't confident that they will win  
their case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 students from kindergarten through sixth grade  
have signed up for as much as $2,500 in tuition vouchers for 
private schools in Cleveland. Most of the 56 schools are religious 
institutions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Meet Barak in Oslo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Resuming Middle East diplomacy, President  
Clinton will meet next month in Norway with Prime Minister Ehud 
Barak of Israel and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to spur talks 
on an overall settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim is to conclude an agreement on the future of Jerusalem,  
Palestinian statehood aspirations and several other thorny issues 
by next September -- four months before Clinton leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no greater priority for this president,'' Sandy  
Berger, his assistant for national security, said Wednesday in 
announcing Clinton would meet separately and then together with 
Barak and Arafat on Nov. 2 in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has suffered a number of foreign policy setbacks of  
late. Among them were the Senate's rejection of a treaty to ban 
nuclear weapons tests and passage of a foreign aid bill that 
sharply cut several overseas programs. He vetoed it this week and 
denounced conservative Republicans who engineered his defeats as 
``new isolationists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three leaders will be in Norway to commemorate the 1993 Oslo  
accords, which put Israel and the Palestinians on the negotiating 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said talks between the two sides had reached ``a moment  
of truth,'' and while he seemed cautiously optimistic they would 
reach a settlement, Berger pointed out the clock is ticking. 
</P>
<P>
	One marker is the pledge Barak and Arafat took to complete the  
framework of an accord by February. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is planning to spend only a day or two in Oslo, which  
contrasts with the nine mostly sleepless nights he needed last 
October to hammer out a West Bank accord between then-Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Arafat in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Berger said ``this will be a serious meeting'' and the  
United States intends to play a central role in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the Israel Policy Forum, a private group that backs  
U.S. peacemaking efforts, Berger said ``a Middle East that is 
stable and at peace is critical to America's interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1993 Oslo accord, followed by another in 1995, marked a  
turning point in Israel's stance toward the Palestinians. It 
recognized Arafat as a negotiating partner and started a process of 
Israeli withdrawal on the West Bank, with territory being turned 
over to the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most of the land remains under Israeli control, and  
Arafat wants all of it to establish a state with its capital in 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has endorsed Palestinian ``aspirations,'' without  
specifically saying he backs statehood, declared Palestinian 
refugees have a right to live wherever they wished and blocked a 
law to transfer the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving the embassy, which Clinton said he favored when he was a  
presidential candidate, would have strengthened Israel's 
determination to hold on to an undivided Jerusalem as the eternal 
capital of the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger, in his speech, praised Barak and implicitly criticized  
Netanyahu. He said the Palestinians and Israel had to speak to each 
other through the United States when Netanyahu was prime minister, 
but now have the trust in each other to negotiate directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Barak we see someone with the determination, the vision and  
the electoral mandate,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on the Arab world to support peacemaking and said the  
question was whether ``tomorrow's leaders will bear the traits of 
King Hussein or Saddam Hussein,'' referring to the late Jordanian 
king who made peace with Israel and the president of Iraq who 
opposes a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the Middle East be a region in which Israel will feel  
welcome or threatened by neighbors who challenge their right to 
exist?'' Berger asked. 
</P>
<P>
	By promoting peace, he said, the United States is boosting a new  
generation of Arab leaders. And by protecting Israel's security it 
is protecting two-thirds of the world's oil resources, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Judith Kipper, director of the Middle East forum at the Council  
on Foreign Relations, a private group, said resolving the 
Arab-Israeli conflict is crucial, but it will not resolve the 
larger threats in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	She praised Berger and the administration for putting the peace  
process in the context of regional problems, though.

<HEADLINE> Times Mirror Earnings Rise in 3Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Times Mirror Co. reported higher  
third-quarter earnings Wednesday, reflecting strong gains in 
advertising and lower newsprint costs for its newspaper publishing 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Mirror earned $56.9 million from continuing operations in  
the third quarter, or 73 cents per share, compared to $55.2 
million, or 58 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 9 percent to $739.7 million from $677.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits from the company's newspaper publishing and  
professional information units each rose 20 percent and included 
advertising gains at the company's flagship newspaper, the Los 
Angeles Times, as well as East Coast papers such as The Baltimore 
Sun and Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings per share topped the 69 cent forecast of analysts  
surveyed by First Call/Thompson Financial. Times Mirror shares rose 
$2.12 1/2 or 3 percent to $70.12 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had a one-time gain a year ago of $1.08 billion, or  
$12.17 per share, on the disposal of discontinued operations, 
including legal publishers Matthew Bender and Shepard's. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month earnings from continuing operations were $180.9  
million, or $2.24 per share, excluding a nonrecurring gain on the 
sale of an online venture. That compares with $171 million, or 
$1.74 per share for the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Several businesses that have been put up for sale were reported  
as discontinuing operations. Those subsidiaries include 
AchieveGlobal, a professional training company; Allen 
Communication, which produces interactive software and job training 
programs; and StayWell, a health information company. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Mirror also is selling The Sporting News, but it did not  
qualify as a discontinued operation, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Bells Meet Forecasts, Sprint Misses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Third-quarter profits met expectations at BellSouth and Bell  
Atlantic, driven again by the e-commerce explosion, but Sprint and 
its PCS mobile phone unit came up short with their latest results. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth, the local phone company in the Southeast, edged most  
Wall Street forecasts as revenues grew 9.5 percent. Bell Atlantic, 
the local phone company for much of the East Coast and a major cell 
phone player, posted a 5 percent gain in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's third-quarter profit shrank more than expected despite  
an 18 percent improvement in revenues for the three-month period, 
which ended just days before the company agreed to be acquired by 
MCI WorldCom for a record $115 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS posted a larger-than-expected loss amid continued  
heavy spending to expand its wireless network. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Bell Atlantic    	
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic earned $1.20 billion, or 76 cents a share in the  
third quarter, excluding continuing expenses for the merger with 
Nynex's operations. Those costs left Bell Atlantic with a net 
profit of $1.17 billion or 74 cents a share for the period. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, the New York-based company had an  
operating profit of $1.09 billion or 69 cents, excluding various 
one-time costs that resulted in a net loss of $8 million or 8 cents 
a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenues totaled $8.30 billion, rising from $7.91  
billion a year ago. Core telephone and Internet services revenue 
rose 2.9 percent to about $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results were right in line with what analysts were  
expecting, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial, 
but Bell Atlantic's stock retreated 12 1/2 cents a share to $63.81 1/4 in 
Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	More than the financial results, Bell Atlantic officials touted  
what an eventful quarter it was: specifically, a new wireless 
alliance with Vodafone AirTouch and a request to sell long distance 
in New York that's expected to gain federal approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a watershed quarter for Bell Atlantic,'' said Ivan  
Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive. He also noted the 
company's accelerated deployment of high-speed Internet services 
and progress toward the pending acquisition of GTE, a deal expected 
to close in the first quarter of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Bell Atlantic posted a net  
profit of $3.5 billion or $2.24 per share. That compares with $1.91 
billion or $1.21 a share a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose to $24.57 billion from $23.49 billion.  

</P>
<P>
                            *BellSouth    	
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth reported a third-quarter operating profit of $972  
million, or 51 cents a share. That excludes one-time investment 
gains of $118 million and a $75 million loss related from currency 
fluctuations that gave the company a net profit of $1.02 billion or 
53 cents for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, Atlanta-based BellSouth earned  
$814 million, or 41 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenues grew 9.5 percent to $6.42 billion, up  
from $5.87 billion a year earlier. Revenues from data, Internet and 
other digital services rose 31 percent to $698 million. Domestic 
wireless revenues grew 16.1 percent to $815 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expected a per-share operating profit of 50 cents for  
the just-ended quarter, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. The company's stock rose 93 3/4 cents a share to $43.56 1/4 in 
Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the first nine months of 1999 totaled $2.61  
billion or $1.36 per share, up from $2.52 billion or $1.27 per 
share in the same period last year. Those figures include the 
one-time impact of investment gains and currency losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues were $18.54 billion, up from $16.96 billion  
a year earlier. 

</P>
<P>
                              *Sprint    	
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's FON Group, which includes traditional calling services  
and the newer Sprint ION data unit, reported a third-quarter profit 
of $359 million, or 41 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 1 cent shy of forecasts, according to First  
Call/Thomson Finanacial, and 13 percent below the net profit of 
$415 million or 47 cents a share from the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the just-ended quarter totaled $4.34 billion, up 7  
percent from $4.04 billion in last year's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Sprint FON Group earned  
$1.51 billion or $1.33 per share, compared to $1.13 billion, or 
$1.31 per share in the same period a year earlier. Nine-month 
revenues improved to $12.76 billion from $11.88 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS, the mobile calling operation that became a separate  
unit late last year, lost $615 million or $1.31 per share in the 
third quarter, including spending of $608 million to expand the 
wireless network. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was wider than the $1.23 a share expected by most  
analysts and larger than 1998's third-quarter loss of $176 million 
or $1.04 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The wireless unit's third-quarter revenues totaled $844 million,  
up from $320 million a year ago -- before Sprint PCS bought back 
ownership interests held by Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. 
and Cox Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The company didn't provide an early update on the new Wireless  
Web, a new service providing limited Internet access that was 
launched during the final month of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS' nine-month loss totaled $1.79 billion, or $3.92 per  
share. That compares with $474 million, or $2.99 cents per share, 
in the same period of 1998. Nine-month revenues increased to $2.18 
billion from $788 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the disappointing results, shares of both Sprint units  
rose in Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange: Sprint 
FON rose $1.12 1/2 to $64.93 3/4 and Sprint PCS rose 50 cents a share to 
$74.

<HEADLINE> Mamet, Osborne Revivals Not Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Both ``Look Back in Anger'' by John Osborne and  
``The Water Engine'' by David Mamet are tough-minded plays -- 
``Anger'' an instant classic since it demolished genteel British 
drawing-room drama more than 40 years ago, and ``Engine,'' a dark, 
yet nostalgic look at a particular moment in 1930s America. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet neither is well served by new productions which surfaced  
recently off-Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look Back in Anger'' arrives with the added burden of its  
legendary reputation. Its lead character, an embittered young man 
named Jimmy Porter, is an unrepentant heel -- and a whale of a good 
role for an ambitious actor. Abusive and unfaithful to his wife, 
belligerent to his good friends and contemptuous of upper-crust 
society, Jimmy puts on quite a show, all the while suffering under 
his own ill-tempered ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, an actor can go overboard with it. Reg Rogers, in  
a production at the Classic Stage Company, does just that. He adds 
a layer of affectation to the snarls with which the frustrated 
Jimmy rails against the world. It creates an artificiality at odds 
with the other actors on stage. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a problem this self-conscious production doesn't need,  
directed at a slow pace by Jo Bonney and underlined by a throbbing 
jazz score and a surreal backdrop of a bare bed, stripped of 
linens. 
</P>
<P>
	The bed is a not very subtle symbol of Jimmy's empty marriage, a  
union the man denigrates and readily dismisses. Jimmy lashes out 
most harshly against his wife, Alison, played here with wan dignity 
by Enid Graham. The rest of Bonney's cast, particularly Angelina 
Phillips as the woman who replaces Alison in Jimmy's bed, are fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look Back in Anger'' deserves to be re-examined, but this  
revival is more missed opportunity than fully realized production. 
</P>
<P>
	Missteps also plague ``The Water Engine,'' the first in a  
season-long celebration of Mamet at the Atlantic Theater Company. 
Seen off-Broadway and briefly on Broadway during the 1977-78 
season, the play usually is done in conjunction with a 20-minute, 
one-man effort called ``Mr. Happiness.'' Both are set in radio 
studios in the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Atlantic, ``Mr. Happiness'' comes off better. As an  
unctuous dispenser of advice to his listeners, Bob Balaban oozes 
solutions to a variety of domestic and extramarital problems. 
Balaban captures the man's smarminess without mugging. A rare 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The title play is an indictment of corporate greed that is done  
as a radio play within the play. It's a nifty device, conjuring up 
a time when the radio was the centerpiece of family evening 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mamet sets his film-noir-style drama in Chicago during the 1933  
Chicago World's Fair and its Century of Progress. Hope is on the 
horizon, particularly for young inventor Charles Lang. He has 
invented an engine that runs on water, and now big business and 
other corporate interests want it. In the end, they ruthlessly win. 
</P>
<P>
	The playwright has an obvious affection for Chicago and its  
colorful history. The play is rich in atmosphere about a time when 
things seemed simpler. Yet the revival doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
	Directed by Karen Kohlhaas, the production feels unfinished and  
the actors seem uneasy. Only the art deco radio studio setting by 
Walt Spangler conveys the sure sense of the past that Mamet is 
trying to convey.

<HEADLINE> Man Accused in Reno Plot To Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the  
government to release a Palestinian accused of plotting to kill 
Attorney General Janet Reno, ruling he had been unconstitutionally 
detained for 19 months by secret evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William H. Walls is the first federal judge  
to reject the government's longstanding practice of detaining or 
deporting immigrants based on evidence it refuses to share, lawyers 
who follow immigration say. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's argument ``ignores the axiomatic,  
constitutional premise that aliens, once legally admitted into the 
United States, are entitled to the shelter of the Constitution,'' 
Walls wrote Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cole, the Georgetown law professor who represents Hany  
Kiareldeen, called the ruling ``a substantial victory, not only for 
all immigrants, but for fairness in government proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walls ordered the immediate release of Kiareldeen, 31, of  
Passaic, who was arrested for overstaying a student visa, then 
detained on suspicion of plotting to kill Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Immigration and Naturalization Service obtained a stay  
of Walls' order Wednesday evening from a federal appeals court. 
Arguments were scheduled for Thursday and Kiareldeen remained in 
federal custody for another night at the Hudson County Jail 
</P>
<P>
	``We've maintained all along that he is a danger,'' INS  
spokesman Bill Strassberger said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiaraldeen, who has been jailed since March 1998, was never  
charged with a plot on Reno's life. But the government has detained 
him and has been trying to deport him based on the secret evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Summaries of the evidence given to immigration judges said  
Kiareldeen made a ``credible threat'' to kill Reno because of her 
role in prosecuting the bombers of the World Trade Center and that 
he is a suspected member of an unnamed terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen has testified that he does not know any of the men  
convicted in the Trade Center bombing and did not know who Reno was 
until he was arrested.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Push Voucher Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moderate Republicans appear to be balking at  
supporting a private-school voucher plan that could jeopardize 
legislation on education programs for poor students. 
</P>
<P>
	House conservatives worked to gather votes today for the voucher  
plan, which would give poor students $3,500 private school vouchers 
if their public schools are failing academically or deemed unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	``These parents don't need another federal mandate. They need a  
chance to escape from a nightmare,'' said Rep. John Boehner, 
R-Ohio, who added that more than 100 of the nation's schools have 
been on the Education Department's list of troubled schools for 
more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Those arguments haven't swayed moderates who want to keep  
private school choice out of the $8 billion Title I program, which 
is designed to boost the academic achievement of poor children. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee  
planned to oppose the provision. ``The main focus of this program 
is to improve Title I,'' said Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., a 
former school superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans split on a smaller issue as the House ended the  
first day of debate Wednesday by voting to keep a Democrat-backed 
gender equity program in the Title I bill. 
</P>
<P>
	After several speeches by many female lawmakers, more than 100  
Republicans joined the Democrats in restoring the $3 million 
program, which provides teachers and others information on ways to 
encourage girls to participate in science and math classes 
dominated by boys. It was cut by Republican critics on the 
education committee who argued that girls often do better in their 
studies and don't need special attention over boys. 
</P>
<P>
	In the larger debate over Title I, Democrats sought to further  
target funding so it goes to the poorest of the nation's 50,000 
schools. Republicans want more flexibility for schools complaining 
of cumbersome federal rules and paperwork associated with a program 
that accounts for less than 10 percent of their total budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came as the House debated the renewal of an  
$8.3 billion federal education bill that governs programs for 
nearly 11 million of the nation's impoverished and failing 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering modest changes to Title I, the  
34-year-old law designed to raise the historically low achievement 
of poor children. After Title I's last overhaul in 1994, it became 
a high standards program, shifting from its remedial focus. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent series of reports from civil rights groups and  
conservatives has criticized the program, citing remaining gaps in 
the test scores and college attendance of poor and rich children. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers also approved proposals to require parents of children  
in bilingual education to sign consent forms for the instruction 
and allow students with limited proficiency in English to be taught 
completely in their native languages instead of partially in 
English. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Report: NBA Suspends Drug Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA's new drug testing program was  
temporarily suspended last week after union leaders complained of 
confidentiality leaks in the first weeks of the program, The New 
York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The players' association claimed a major component of the drug  
testing agreement was compromised because an unnamed reporter 
learned about six players had tested positive for marijuana during 
the first week of testing earlier this month, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA officials agreed to cease testing late last week, and on  
Tuesday met with Billy Hunter, executive director of the players' 
association, and other union leaders. During the meeting they 
agreed to resume testing, but did not disclose when. 
</P>
<P>
	Two informed sources told the newspaper last week that about six  
of 120 players had tested positive for marijuana. Both the union 
and the league have informed their employees of their displeasure 
over the disclosures, and were trying to uncover who leaked the 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a feeling that this whole matter could end up blowing  
up the drug agreement,'' a basketball official, speaking on the 
condition of anonymity, told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug testing was a major part of the collective bargaining  
agreement reached in January, with marijuana and steroids added to 
the league's banned substances list. All players were to be tested 
when training camps opened earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Confidentiality is an important component of the agreement, as  
not even the teams are supposed to be informed when players test 
positive for marijuana the first or second time. The idea is for 
the league to encourage players to seek treatment and counseling.

	Hurricane Jose Rips Through Antigua  
</P>
<P>
	ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) -- Hurricane Jose ripped roofs from  
houses, tore down a newly built church and flung debris through 
deserted streets Wednesday as it hit Antigua head-on and threatened 
a string of other Caribbean islands. Storm-weary islanders in 
neighboring St. Kitts, where a few homes remained roofless from 
last year's devastating hurricane season, braced themselves as Jose 
bore down packing 100 mph winds and drenching rain. In a television 
broadcast, acting Prime Minister Sam Condor told the people of St. 
Kitts and Nevis to ``prepare for the worst.'' There was a strong 
chance the storm would not reach the U.S. East Coast, a 
meteorologist said.

	Louisiana Republicans Moves Up Caucus Date

<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Louisiana Republicans have changed the date  
of their 2000 presidential caucuses to Jan. 15 -- nine days before 
Iowa's traditionally first-in-the-nation caucuses. And Louisiana 
officials say the date would be changed again -- even to New Year's 
Day -- in the unlikely event that Iowa reschedules its Jan. 24 
caucuses. It's unclear whether major candidates will campaign in 
Louisiana. Iowa last week moved its caucuses to Jan. 24 after New 
Hampshire refused repeated appeals to reschedule its Feb. 1 
presidential primary.

	CDC Panel Urges Meningitis Warnings  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A group of federal health officials is  
recommending that colleges make meningitis vaccines readily 
available and that they warn students of the risks of the disease. 
But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel today 
stopped short of recommending that all college students be 
vaccinated. CDC officials say they didn't go further in 
recommendations because current meningitis vaccines are no more 
than 90 percent effective and don't work on all strains. A CDC 
study of 83 reported meningitis cases in college students from 
September 1998 through May 1999 indicated a rate of 1.4 cases per 
100,000 freshmen, and 3.8 cases per 100,000 freshmen living in 
dormitories.

	7 Dead of Dengue Fever in Mexico  
</P>
<P>
	MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) -- Dengue fever has swept across northern  
Mexico near the Texas border, killing at least seven people and 
making thousands of others ill, local officials said today. About 
5,500 people in Nuevo Leon state have been diagnosed with the 
painful, mosquito-borne disease this month alone. Of those, about 
150 have come down with the serious, sometimes-deadly form known as 
hemorrhagic dengue. Dengue is characterized by headaches, rashes, 
cramps and severe muscle and bone pains. It usually last about two 
weeks after infection, and treatment is given mostly to relieve 
symptoms.

	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- An 87-year-old man accused of robbing a  
bank was already on probation for a similar crime in Mississippi, 
and may be the nation's oldest bank robbery suspect, authorities 
said. J.L. Hunter Roundtree pleaded guilty in August to a bank 
robbery in Biloxi, Miss., and placed on three years unsupervised 
probation when he tried his luck again Monday in Pensacola, police 
said. Police said that on Monday Roundtree walked unarmed into a 
NationsBank office and handed a note to a teller demanding cash. 
Customers tackled him in the parking lot after he tried to flee on 
foot.

prostituting a 12-year-old girl to male students at a Detroit high 
school, officials said. The Cooley High School girls, ages 14 and 
15, were charged as adults with first-degree criminal sexual 
conduct, authorities said. One boy has been charged as an adult 
with one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.

<HEADLINE> Jose Mesa Search Is Ruled Valid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Seattle Mariners pitcher Jose Mesa might  
have to return to a Cleveland courtroom to face a charge of 
carrying a concealed weapon, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled 6-1 that Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge  
Patrick Curran erred when he ruled in 1997 that police in the 
Cleveland suburb of Lakewood had no right to search an unlocked 
compartment in a car driven by Mesa, then with the Cleveland 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakewood police found Mesa's 9mm handgun Dec. 27, 1996, after he  
was arrested in Cleveland on sex abuse charges based on allegations 
of two women he had met Dec. 22. A jury acquitted Mesa of charges 
in the case of rape, gross sexual imposition and theft. Curran also 
dropped a felony assault charge against Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial court ruled that the Lakewood policy covering searches  
was vague. The Supreme Court disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We find that the policy is not ambiguous,'' Justice Andrew  
Douglas wrote for the majority. ``Rather, the only restriction 
imposed by the policy involves those compartments that are 
locked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Paul Pfeifer, in a dissenting opinion, said the Lakewood  
policy does not deal with closed but unlocked departments. 
</P>
<P>
	George Sadd, who argued the case for the county prosecutor's  
office, and Gerald Messerman, a lawyer representing Mesa, did not 
return telephone calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Northrop Grumman Earnings Up 10 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Northrop Grumman Corp. said Wednesday its  
third-quarter earnings rose 10 percent on stronger sales in its 
information technology unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of the B-2 bomber earned $128 million, or $1.83 per  
share, compared to $116 million, or $1.67 per share, in the third 
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Northrop's results were significantly higher than the $1.63 per  
share reached in a consensus of analysts, according to First 
Call/Thomson Financial. The company's stock fell 43 3/4 cents to 
$54.87 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were partly boosted by $92 million in pension  
income, $25 million more than the company received a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the just-ended quarter came to $2.1 billion, down from  
$2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The high point for the quarter came from Northrop's information  
technology subsidiary Logicon, which had record sales of $376 
million in sales, up 46 percent from $258 million in the third 
quarter of 1998. Logicon produces information systems for the 
military and civilian government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Logicon sales offset declines in the sale of aircraft  
structures and military and aerospace electronic systems. Northrop 
purchased Logicon in 1997 as part of a campaign to increase its 
information technology business in the wake of declining defense 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our strategy to be a premier provider of leading edge defense  
and information technologies is on track,'' said Kent Kresa, 
Northrop's chairman, president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Northrop earned $329 million, or  
$4.73 per share, from $197 million, or $2.83 per share, in the same 
period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $6.5 billion from $6.4 billion.

<HEADLINE> Presidents Cup Switches to 4 Days  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The next Presidents Cup will have 32 matches and one extra day.  
</P>
<P>
	Exactly year before the matches are played at the Robert Trent  
Jones Club in Virginia, the PGA Tour announced Wednesday that the 
2000 Presidents Cup will be played over four days instead of the 
traditional three. 
</P>
<P>
	The Presidents Cup, biennial matches between the United States  
and international players from outside Europe, already was 
different from the Ryder Cup in that the first two days included 
five matches -- not four -- of best ball and alternate shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Tour officials said the latest move is designed to make the most  
out of limited daylight in October, allow for the potential of rain 
delays and reduce some of the stress packed in over the three days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very pleased,'' said U.S. captain Ken Venturi. ``Starting  
Thursday is a marvelous idea. We'll have the opening ceremony in 
the morning, lunch with the team and then play foursomes. We'll be 
able to show golf that afternoon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of foursomes (alternate shot) and fourballs in the  
morning and afternoon of the first two days, the new format will 
have foursomes Thursday afternoon, fourballs and foursomes on 
Friday, another round of fourballs on Saturday, and then the 12 
singles matches on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The International team won the Presidents Cup for the first time  
in December at Royal Melbourne in Australia, a 20 1/2-11 1/2 margin that 
represented the Americans' worst loss in match play. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 matches will be Oct. 20-22 at the RTJ Club in  
Gainesville, Va., where the United States has won two previous 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Venturi and PGA Tour officials also are hopeful of one other  
distinction from the Ryder Cup -- gallery behavior. Tickets for the 
Presidents Cup, which went on sale Wednesday, are being limited to 
22,000 for the general public. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets also were limited to that number in Australia, although  
that was as much as Royal Melbourne could logistically take because 
of the routing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to restore tradition to the gallery,'' Venturi  
said. ``We want to set a trend for all matches to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venturi also said Wednesday that Paul Marchand, a prominent  
Houston teaching pro whose students include Fred Couples and former 
President George Bush, will be his assistant captain.

<HEADLINE> Stayner Charged in Yosemite Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIPOSA, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman who investigators say  
confessed to killing three Yosemite National Park sightseers in 
February was charged Wednesday with their murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner, 38, was charged with three counts of murder that  
could bring the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Stayner confessed in late July to killing  
Carole Sund, 42, her daughter Juli Sund, 15, and their Argentine 
friend Silvina Pelosso, 16, while the three were visiting the park 
in Februrary. 
</P>
<P>
	He also allegedly confessed to beheading Joie Ruth Armstrong, a  
26-year-old Yosemite naturalist, on July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunds and Pelosso were last seen alive at the Cedar Lodge  
motel where Stayner worked. Stayner was also charged with burglary, 
robbery, forcible oral copulation and attempted rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner was arrested at a nudist camp two days after Ms.  
Armstrong's slaying and was later charged with her murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they waited to charge Stayner in the  
sightseers' slayings until ruling out the possibility that he had 
accomplices.

<HEADLINE> Defector Informs US of Russian Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia may have destroyed what was once the  
world's largest stockpile of biological weapons, but it retains the 
capability to produce them again, a former Soviet weapons scientist 
suggested Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There still remains doubt that Russia has completely  
dismantled the old Soviet program,'' Kenneth Alibek, who defected 
to the United States in 1992, told a House Armed Services Committee 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Alibek, who was deputy director of the Soviet's civilian  
biological weapons program, said Russia still has at least three 
plants capable of producing biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia insists it has strictly complied with the 1972 Biological  
Weapons Convention, which bans the development, production and 
stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Alibek also testified that many of his former colleagues now  
live and work abroad. ``Many of these scientists live in the United 
States and in Great Britain,'' he said. ``It's absolutely clear 
some of them are working in Iran now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. government experts on biological and chemical weapons  
didn't shed much light on what might be going on in Russia. But 
Hans Mark, director of the Pentagon's Chemical and Biological 
Defense Program, told the panel that ``the chemical and biological 
weapons threat is potentially increasing in diversity and 
frequency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 20 countries may now have biological weapons  
capability, Mark said. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. armed forces must improve their chemical and biological  
warfare defense capabilities,'' said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., 
chairman of the Armed Services military procurement subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Alibek told the panel that he doesn't have much specific  
information on what has happened to Russia's weapons programs over 
the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	But he called the program ``incredibly huge'' when he fled in  
1992 about the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Alibek said that from about the time the United States halted  
its biological weapons program in 1969 until 1992, the Soviet Union 
developed the largest and most sophisticated biological weapons 
program in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow had no fewer than 70 ``different agents in biological  
weapons,'' including new strains of smallpox and plague, Alibek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin acknowledged the  
existence of a Soviet biological weapons program, and since then 
has issued several decrees declaring that biological weapons 
activities are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Russia and the United States continue conduct research on  
programs to defend themselves against biological attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	As witnesses were telling the Armed Services panel of increasing  
threats, other witnesses were telling another panel that fears of 
terrorists using such weapons within the United States might be 
overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	``In most cases, terrorists would have to overcome significant  
technical and operational challenges...to kill or injure large 
numbers of people without substantial assistance from a state 
sponsor,'' Henry Hinton, a national security analyst with the 
General Accounting Office, told a House Governmental Reform 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO is an investigatory branch of Congress.  
</P>
<P>
	Raymond A. Zilinskas, a biologist and international health  
expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, told the 
subcommittee it seems more likely that lower-grade ``biological 
attacks'' might occur, including deliberate food or water 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unprotected, unmonitored salad bars and other food displays  
have become ubiquitous throughout the United States,'' Zilinskas 
said, adding that the number of persons with at least a modicum of 
training in microbiology is ``increasing.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Defense Official Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A high-ranking defense official resigned Wednesday  
after his suggestion that Japan should consider acquiring nuclear 
weapons ignited a firestorm of criticism at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Shingo Nishimura, a parliamentary vice minister for defense,  
also came under fire for comparing nuclear deterrence to rape laws: 
``If men did not face any punishment for raping women, then all men 
-- including myself -- would be rapists,'' he was quoted as saying in 
Tuesday's issue of Weekly Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said it was ``extremely  
inappropriate'' for Nishimura to voice his personal opinions in a 
magazine article. 
</P>
<P>
	Nishimura handed his resignation to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,  
an official at the premier's office said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	His most inflammatory quote was that Parliament ``should  
consider the fact that Japan may be better off if it armed itself 
with nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weekly Playboy, a pornographic magazine, is not related to the  
U.S.-based Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Nishimura has been at the center of controversy before. He  
angered activists in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in 1997, when he 
made a trip to a disputed island in the East China Sea and planted 
a Japanese flag there. 
</P>
<P>
	The topic of nuclear weapons is a sensitive one in Japan. The  
United States dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki during World War II in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's U.S.-written constitution forbids offensive military  
action, and many people take any suggestion of Japanese development 
of nuclear weapons as a sign of resurgent militarism. 
</P>
<P>
	The turn-of-the-century period, when Japan sought to rule much  
of Asia, has left others in the region wary of any militaristic 
impulses. 
</P>
<P>
	Both in Japan and beyond, Nishimura's remarks were condemned.  
</P>
<P>
	``The remarks run counter to Japan's constitution and trample  
the wishes of the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,'' said 
Shigetoshi Iwamatsu, the head of the Japan Congress Against Atomic 
and Hydrogen Bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 200,000-member New Japan Women's Association called his  
remarks ``abusive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong Democratic Party lawmaker Albert Ho said Nishimura's  
reflected a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are emerging political forces in Japan that are pushing  
the country toward rearmament and towards building a military 
empire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, South Korea, about three dozen people, mostly women  
forced to serve as sex slaves for the Japanese military during 
World War II, pumped clenched fists in the air and chanted, ``We 
protest Nishimura's reckless remarks!''

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Blames Outage on AT&AMP;T </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- Bell Atlantic says a door left open at  
an AT&AMP;T switching station caused floodwaters from Tropical Storm 
Floyd to knock out telephone service to more than a million people. 
</P>
<P>
	A basement double-door was propped open while a crew was  
completing air conditioning repairs, Bell Atlantic said in a report 
to the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the report, submitted Oct. 15, was obtained by The  
Record of Hackensack, which carried a story on it today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The open doors permitted the water to flow into the basement  
at a rate beyond the capacity of the pumps,'' Bell Atlantic 
officials wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands in northern New Jersey had no phone service at all for  
three days, while 1.07 million lost long-distance service and AT&AMP;T 
wireless users also suffered disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T spokesman Dave Johnson said the report ``does not agree  
with the facts as we see them.'' He said water was rushing in from 
many sources, including plumbing, and reached a depth of six feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic leases the space from AT&AMP;T.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials and state utility regulators have held  
hearings to determine how such a disruption could have happened. 
AT&AMP;T representatives said the Rochelle Park location had not been 
declared a 100-year flood zone until 1980, after the phone center 
already was in business. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic's report to the FCC outlined plans to prevent a  
similar incident, including moving power equipment upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T officials have promised to move their wireless operations  
out of the Rochelle Park center within one year.

<HEADLINE> Diplomats Reminded of Real America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUTNAMVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Hog farmer Keith Berry welcomed the  
chance to show a U.S. diplomat just how much work goes into making 
bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	And James Bullock, most recently a public affairs counselor of  
the U.S. Embassy in Rabat, Morocco, was eager for the opportunity, 
after spending so much time abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spent 17 of the last 20 years being a foreigner, so it's  
nice to come home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 40 years, the Senior Seminar program has brought  
midcareer U.S. diplomats home to remind them of the diverse land 
they represent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock is one of 30 diplomats, military officers,  
national-security employees and FBI agents who visited Indiana this 
week as part of the nine-month program, designed to reconnect them 
with ``the real America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock questioned Berry nonstop Tuesday as they walked through  
barns thick with the ammonia odor of penned hogs and shared the 
cramped cab of a combine for an afternoon of corn harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the stuff you don't get looking at statistics,''  
Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Senior Seminar group already has visited Microsoft  
and Boeing corporate headquarters in the Seattle area and spent 
time with native Alaskans. After leaving Indiana today, they'll 
head to Chicago for a look at public housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous members of the group have ridden along with police  
officers in Los Angeles, sailed on Navy submarines and learned 
parachute jumping from Army airborne instructors at Ft. Bragg, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say it's the best leadership training that we have in the  
U.S. government,'' said Aurelia Brazeal, dean of the Senior 
Seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazeal, a former deputy assistant secretary of state and U.S.  
ambassador in Kenya and Micronesia, said her participation in the 
program from 1986-87 gave her a sharper sense of the emerging 
global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can speak firsthand to foreign officials'' about America,  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The link with the global economy prompted Berry to volunteer as  
a host for the program. About 30 percent of his sales depend on the 
export market -- something he said is essential for any U.S. farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``My biggest concern is being able to access the market with my  
product,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, 54, has been farming in the gentle rolling land of  
southern Putnam County all his life. His parents were farmers, as 
were some of his grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	He said prying a living wage out of his 1,400 acres of corn and  
soybeans and his barns holding more than 2,000 hogs takes more than 
just long hours after years of low crop prices. Ingenuity and 
business skills are required, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good life, but it's a tough life,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bullock's visit to Berry's farm was more than just an eye-opener  
-- it was a homecoming. The 49-year-old Evansville native, who grew 
up in the Chicago suburbs, has spent most of the past two decades 
in places such as Moscow and Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Tuesday, farm life to him was something his grandparents  
talked about, or it was the miles of corn he would see through the 
car window while traveling down U.S. 41 from Chicago to Evansville. 
</P>
<P>
	Munching on a fresh-picked apple, Bullock said he now can  
appreciate the emotional ties between farmers and their land. It's 
a new experience he can add to his understanding of America's 
diversity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not all good news. We see things that are a shame,'' he  
said. ``But it's our country and we're getting paid to represent 
it, so we've got to know it all.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Filibusters Campaign Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Republican presidential candidate John  
McCain, the Senate's latest debate on campaign finance legislation 
may turn out to be a something of a mixed blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's signature issue -- a bill to curtail the role of money  
in campaigns -- is dead for the fourth straight year at the hands of 
a filibuster by fellow Senate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the spokesman for the Arizona senator's presidential  
campaign claims the four-day debate coincided with a surge in 
interest, judged, at least, by his campaign Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hits went from a trickle basically ... up to about 22,000  
in one day,'' said Howard Opinsky, McCain's spokesman. ``Literally 
thousands and thousands of Americans who are now accessing our Web 
site ... learning about the impact of soft money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation received a formal burial today when the Senate  
voted 52-48 to move on to other business. The doomed measure would 
have banned soft money -- the unlimited campaign contributions that 
unions, corporations and individuals give to political parties. It 
also would have curtailed organized labor's ability to use 
non-union members' mandatory dues money for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the soft money ban amounted to an  
unconstitutional infringement on the freedom of speech. ``It's a 
horrible piece of legislation,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. 
``It deserves to be defeated and the Senate did the country a 
favor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is hardly the first to use his Senate seat to advance a  
presidential bid -- Republican Sens. Phil Gramm of Texas and Bob 
Dole of Kansas both tried at various stages of the 1996 campaign, 
for example. 
</P>
<P>
	And as is the custom, McCain never referred explicitly to his  
political ambitions during occasionally barbed debate. But he drew 
a connection in comments to reporters Tuesday just off the Senate 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at 21 (percent) in New Hampshire and what am I campaigning  
on? I'm campaigning on reform,'' he said, referring to recent 
polling in the nation's first primary state that put him a distant 
second behind front-runner George W. Bush, but ahead of other 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	It fell to other senators to refer to McCain's use of the issue  
in his presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell and others complained that McCain's Web site drew a  
link between soft money donations and corruption. Repeatedly, they 
demanded McCain provide evidence by naming senators who had been 
corrupted by the receipt of soft money donations. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain turned aside those calls, insisting only that the  
appearance of corruption had been created. 
</P>
<P>
	But his latest bid for campaign finance changes effectively  
ended Tuesday when supporters failed on two separate test votes to 
get the 60 needed to overcome the Republican-led filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's dead for the year,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats objected, and spent several hours arguing for the  
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was irony in their plans for the evening -- a Senate  
Democratic fund-raiser at the home of Sen. Jay Rockefeller, 
D-W.Va., with President Clinton on the guest list. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Clinton issued a statement saying that, ``Once  
again, a minority in the Senate has blocked bipartisan campaign 
finance reform.'' Filibusters killed campaign finance legislation 
in 1996, 1997 and last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks on the Senate floor, McCain vowed, ``we will  
persevere,'' and laid blame for the setback at the feet of both 
political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the two votes cast Tuesday, the first was on a broad set of  
campaign finance changes the House passed last month and that 
McCain and Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold had backed a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That vote was 52-48, eight short of the 60 needed. Voting in  
favor were all 45 Democrats, as well as McCain and Republicans John 
Chafee of Rhode Island; Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine; 
James Jeffords of Vermont; Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Fred 
Thompson of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The second vote came on a slimmed down bill that McCain and  
Feingold brought to the floor in hopes of thwarting the filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	On that 53-47 vote, Republican Sens. Sam Brownback of Kansas;  
Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas and William Roth of Delaware joined 
Collins, Jeffords, Snowe and Thompson to vote with McCain and all 
45 Democrats. Specter and Chafee sided with GOP opponents.

<HEADLINE> Defense Contractor Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- General Dynamics said its acquisition  
of Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. helped boost third-quarter profits 
14.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contractor reported Wednesday it had earnings before  
one-time items of $182 million, or 90 cents per share, up from $159 
million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time items included an $81 million gain related to the  
reversal of a pension tax reserve, and charges totaling $79 million 
related to the Gulfstream acquisition and a revaluing of reserves 
in the company's coal operations. When the items are included, 
General Dynamics had net earnings in the latest quarter of $184 
million, or 91 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were a penny higher than Wall Street analysts'  
expectations, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter, which ended Oct. 3, rose 23 percent to  
$ 2.22 billion from $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its Gulfstream aerospace business, which  
General Dynamics acquired on July 30, had a 23 percent gain in 
operating earnings from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics said its information systems and technology  
group had a 67 percent increase in operating earnings. The marine 
systems group, which includes the company's submarine and ship 
building business, had a 21 percent operating earnings increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The combat systems segment, whose products include Abrams tanks,  
suffered a 5 percent operating earnings drop due to the completion 
of the government's Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio 
System. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, General Dynamics reported  
profits of $682 million, or $3.38 per share. That was up 59 percent 
from the first nine months of 1998, when net earnings were $429 
million, or $2.12 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month sales came to $6.3 billion, up from $5.19 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of General Dynamics rose $4.18 3/4 to $56.43 3/4 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Agreements in Monsanto Seed Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Monsanto Co. has reached agreements with  
Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. and Cargill Inc. resolving 
disputes arising from its purchase of Cargill's international seed 
business a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto said Wednesday it has resolved a lawsuit filed by  
Pioneer in February, alleging that Monsanto had purchased germplasm 
-- the reproductive tissue of seeds -- from Cargill that had been 
improperly taken from Pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, Monsanto said the genetic materials  
improperly obtained from Pioneer are being destroyed. Other terms 
of the settlement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Monsanto reached an agreement with Cargill that  
compensates Monsanto for lost germplasm and other expenses 
associated with the problems uncovered in the seed business sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill, one of the world's largest privately owned companies,  
did not disclose terms of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis-based Monsanto acquired Cargill's international seed  
business last October for $1.4 billion. Pioneer already had a 
lawsuit against Cargill, but then filed another one against 
Monsanto after its seed purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill discovered the problems during an investigation into  
allegations by Pioneer, which is based in Des Moines, Iowa, that 
Cargill had wrongly obtained some Pioneer genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been very open and forthright with Pioneer and  
Monsanto from the moment we discovered the problem and have worked 
with both companies to remedy the situation,'' said Fritz Corrigan, 
president of Cargill's agriculture and biosciences group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Cargill and Monsanto have thoroughly investigated the  
problem to ensure that any material that should not be for sale has 
been removed from our research program and the market,'' Corrigan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto's settlements do not resolve pending litigation between  
Pioneer and Cargill. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto makes agricultural products, pharmaceuticals and food  
ingredients. Pioneer produces seeds and grain additives. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill, which is based in Minnetonka, Minn., processes, sells  
and distributes agricultural, food, financial and industrial 
products.

<HEADLINE> Tips on Kids' Online Privacy Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tips from experts about children being asked personal questions  
on the Internet: 
</P>
<P>
	--Youngsters never should give out their full name, address or  
phone number to anyone they do not know without a parent's 
permission, says Lawrence Magid, a computer industry columnist who 
also runs the Safekids Web site, www.safekids.com. ``Everything 
about you ... is your private information,'' Magid advises. ``You 
don't have to give that information to just anyone who asks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Parents should explain why it is important their children do  
not volunteer their personal information to companies -- not just be 
ordered against doing so, says Stephen Savitzky, a Silicon Valley 
software scientist who runs the site, 
http://interesting.places.to/Browse with links to safe areas for 
children. ``Asking for your phone number can be a sneaky way of 
finding out where you live, and they may call your parents trying 
to sell them stuff,'' Savitzky tells youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	--Parents should find and read a Web site's privacy policy to  
find how any personal information might be used. The new law, which 
takes effect in April, requires companies to allow parents to 
review and delete their child's information, and to refuse to allow 
further collection or use of those types of details. 
</P>
<P>
	--Parents should warn children that even reputable-looking Web  
sites might not be what they appear, according to Get Net Wise, at 
www.getnetwise.org, a Web site with warnings about kids and 
privacy. ``Software tools exist to restrict sensitive personal 
information from being transmitted online,'' the organization says. 
</P>
<P>
	--Companies on the Internet should not entice children younger  
than 13 to disclose personal information with games or contests, 
according to the Online Privacy Alliance, www.privacyalliance.org, 
an industry trade group.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise in Quiet Trading / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices inched higher in quiet  
trading Wednesday as dealers looked ahead to next month's meeting 
of Federal Reserve policy-makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was listless amid uncertainty over whether the Fed will  
raise rates for a third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32  
point, or $2.81 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 6.33 percent from the two-year high 
of 6.35 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were mixed, ranging from a decline of 1/32 point to a gain of 1/32 
point, and intermediate maturities were up 1/32 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.12 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point from Tuesday to 4.98 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.23 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 
percentage point to 5.02 percent. One-year yields were 5.45 percent 
as the discount was unchanged from late Tuesday at 5.16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.88 percent from 5.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 7/32 to 108 9/16 . The average yield to 
maturity rose to 6.13 percent from 6.12 percent.

<HEADLINE> Administration Defends Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration on Wednesday  
defended its handling of a wave of mergers in the agriculture and 
food industries that has brought criticism from Democrats and 
proposals for a freeze on more deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any significant transactions ... are going to get a very  
careful look,'' said John Nannes, a deputy assistant attorney 
general for the Justice Department's antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	He also told the House Judiciary Committee that existing  
antitrust laws are adequate for ``policing and enforcing our 
nation's concerns about the ability of markets to operate 
competitively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of companies now control many segments of the  
agriculture and food industries, including meat processing and 
grain shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department is doing what it can, including  
expanding its economics and legal staff, to ensure that meatpackers 
treat livestock producers fairly, said Enrique Figueroa, USDA's 
deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, several Senate Democrats who believe the  
administration's antitrust enforcement has been lax said they 
intend to force a vote on an 18-month moratorium on further mergers 
of agricultural or food companies. The administration would be 
required to do a study of the industries during the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm economy is in its worst downturn since the mid-1980s,  
and although economists blame it on overproduction of crops and 
livestock, many lawmakers have been pointing to agribusiness 
mergers as a culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Justice Department allowed Cargill Inc.,  
North America's second-largest grain trader, to acquire the grain 
operations of Continental Grain, provided the companies sold some 
of their facilities. Congressional critics of the department do not 
think the deal ever should have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the department forced Monsanto to spin off some corn  
technology interests before it could acquire DeKalb Genetics Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Those actions ``ought to be an indication that we are watching  
market trends very carefully in the agricultural marketplace,'' 
Nannes said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the latest deals before the department, Smithfield  
Foods Inc. of Smithfield, Va., the biggest pork processor as well 
as the largest hog producer, is seeking the department's approval 
to acquire No. 2 producer Murphy Family Farms of Rose Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress should consider tightening antitrust laws to curb the  
consolidation, said Rep. John Thune, R-S.D 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should act deliberately, but also with broad and bold  
strokes,'' Thune said. ``The net result should be a system that 
fosters true competition for all those participating in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation was introduced last week to ban Smithfield and other  
meatpackers from owning livestock. A recently approved agricultural 
spending bill would require meatpackers would require them to start 
reporting the prices they pay for cattle and hogs. Producers say 
that it will make it easier for them to bargain with the packers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hails AmeriCorps' 5th Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling AmeriCorps ``an indispensable force  
for change in America,'' President Clinton on Wednesday marked the 
national service program's fifth anniversary by declaring an end to 
the bitter political struggle over its survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``After years of fights over funding and purpose in AmeriCorps,  
peace is breaking out all over in Washington,'' Clinton told 
hundreds of people celebrating the anniversary at a ceremony under 
a large tent on the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did five years ago, Clinton assembled members of the  
current AmeriCorps class and had them recite a pledge to serve 
their country. ``Faced with apathy, I will take action. Faced with 
conflict, I will seek common ground. Faced with adversity, I will 
persevere,'' the volunteers promised. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton led the crowd in a rendition of ``America the  
Beautiful,'' singing loudly, with his head held high, on the first 
verse and following printed lyrics he shared with first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton for subsequent verses. 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriCorps is essentially an at-home version of the Peace Corps.  
Participants work with nonprofit groups in areas such as education, 
health and human needs, the environment and public safety. For 
their effort, they get $4,725 each to put toward their education. 
</P>
<P>
	After five years, 150,000 people have taken part in AmeriCorps,  
spending a year building houses for the poor, teaching children to 
read, working with police on domestic violence and gang 
intervention in exchange for a few thousand dollars to pay for 
college or student loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that you are now an indispensable force  
for change in America,'' Clinton said. ``AmeriCorps volunteers 
prove daily they're one of the best and smartest investments our 
country ever made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriCorps is one of several programs that the White House  
considers part of Clinton's presidential legacy. This year's class 
has 40,000 participants, the largest number ever. Clinton asked for 
$546 million for AmeriCorps in fiscal 2000; the House voted to 
eliminate it. A compromise was reached with the Senate to fund 
AmeriCorps at $439 million, a $3 million increase over fiscal 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress repeatedly have tried to kill  
AmeriCorps, despite its popularity with governors and other 
officials in their party. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., a Peace Corps volunteer from  
1968-1970, says the desire to kill AmeriCorps lingered because of 
``incredible dislike some people have'' for Clinton; they don't 
want to embrace something widely viewed as one of his pet projects. 
Also, Shays said, there are those who reject AmeriCorps as just 
another bureaucracy that wastes money -- and pays people to do 
volunteer work, as some Republicans have put it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They fail to recognize that the Republicans have been asking  
for years that we involve young people in meaningful work,'' Shays 
said. ``There is a part of me that says OK, the president should 
just give Republicans their wish. If he wanted to play politics, he 
should just let the Republicans kill the program. I think a lot of 
people would say, 'What are these Republicans doing?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady were joined at Wednesday's ceremony  
by retired Gen. Colin Powell; Utah Republican Gov. Michael Leavitt; 
Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow, Coretta Scott King; and Sargent 
Shriver, creator of AmeriCorps' predecessor, Volunteers in Service 
to America, or VISTA.

<HEADLINE> 10-Year-Old Kansas Girl Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) -- About 600 people filled a church  
Wednesday to remember a 10-year-old girl who was killed after being 
snatched by a stranger while roller-skating in front of her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Pamela Butler's mother stood near the spot where her  
daughter was about to be buried, kissed a purple balloon and 
released it into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love you Pammy. Goodbye.''  
</P>
<P>
	Seconds later, about 200 more purple balloons followed, released  
by mourners who had come to support the family and say goodbye to 
Pamela. Bagpipes played ``Amazing Grace,'' as her mother, Cherri 
West, and others watched the balloons float away. 
</P>
<P>
	The burial service was the end of a week of extraordinary  
attention paid to Pamela since she was abducted Oct. 12 while 
roller-skating in front of her Kansas City, Kan., home. Her body 
was found in a field last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A suspect, Keith D. Nelson, 24, remained in federal custody on a  
kidnapping charge. 
</P>
<P>
	After up to 2,000 people attended her wake Tuesday night, about  
600 more -- many of whom did not know Pamela or her family -- filled 
the CrossRoads Church for a funeral service on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three local television stations interrupted regular programming  
to carry the 75-minute service. 
</P>
<P>
	Speakers did not dwell on Pamela's death, but chose to remember  
the girl's constant smile, laughter and ability to make those 
around her feel better. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Pamela's stepsisters, Amanda West, broke down crying as  
she told mourners how Pamela had made a mess at her house the night 
before she disappeared. Before she left, Pamela told Amanda, '' 
'Tomorrow, I'll come back to help you (clean up). Is that OK?' That 
day never came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. R. Joe Smith praised the community for its outpouring  
of support for Pamela's family. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my 31 years of being a pastor here, I have never seen such  
an outpouring of love,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Girls, Suspects Ordered Separated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Four teen-age girls being held as material  
witnesses were ordered into shelters and youth homes after staying 
in the same juvenile jail as the suspects who allegedly abducted 
and raped them. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by District Judge Norma Dotson on Tuesday granted  
the four girls $50,000 personal recognizance bonds and new 
placements. 
</P>
<P>
	M. Jon Posner, the lawyer for the eldest girl, said his  
17-year-old client would be released from the Wayne County Juvenile 
Detention Facility and placed in a shelter where she could receive 
counseling. While at the jail, she had not received counseling and 
had to wear a uniform, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only was she there with her assailants, she was being  
treated as a detainee,'' Posner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other three girls, ages 14, 15 and 16, will be moved within  
the county's youth home system, said assistant Wayne County 
prosecutor Doug Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the girls are from Wisconsin. Authorities have cited  
safety concerns in keeping the girls in Detroit since police 
arrested five suspects two weeks ago and charged them with multiple 
counts of rape. 
</P>
<P>
	``These witnesses had all run away from home before,'' Baker  
said. ``There was no adult to release them to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said the girls were abducted at gunpoint and brought  
to Michigan, where they were held for more than two weeks and 
repeatedly raped by as many as a dozen boys and young men. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said he was aware of the perception that the girls were  
being held in an unpleasant situation, but said he had little 
choice to ensure the girls would testify, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One has to keep in mind that in order to hold accountable  
those who did these horrible crimes, this was the only way to do 
it,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four teen-age boys and a 20-year-old man are charged as adults  
and are being held on $1 million bonds. A preliminary hearing for 
them is set for Friday.

<HEADLINE> Matsuura Nominated for UNESCO Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Koichiro Matsuura, a Japanese diplomat, was  
nominated Wednesday to become the director of UNESCO. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and  
Cultural Organization selected Matsuura following a campaign for 
the post that laid bare some regional rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
	Matsuura, Japan's ambassador to France since 1994 and current  
head of the U.N. World Heritage Committee, is almost certain to be 
confirmed as UNESCO's director-general by the agency's General 
Conference on Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	His main U.N. experience was with the heritage committee, which  
designates and seeks to protect areas of historical and natural 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	Matsuura was picked from a field of four candidates in a third  
round of voting by the Paris-based UNESCO board. He got 34 of 58 
votes, winning out over contenders from Asia, the Middle East and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The other finalists included Ghazi Algosaibi, Saudi Arabia's  
ambassador to Britain and Ismail Serageldin of Egypt, vice 
president of the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those candidates created Web sites to promote their  
views on issues ranging from human rights to the empowerment of 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	Outgoing UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor had said he  
wanted to see somebody who was independent lead UNESCO. But he also 
told reporters that qualified candidates from Asia, the Arab world 
or eastern Europe would have preference. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the past seven directors have been from Europe. Mayor's  
predecessor, Senegal's Amadou Mahtar M'Bow, was the first African 
to head a major U.N. organization. 
</P>
<P>
	UNESCO was founded in 1945 after World War II to fight  
intolerance and racism. It has 185 members, including Britain which 
rejoined last year after a 10-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States quit UNESCO in the mid-1980s, claiming  
corruption and gross mismanagement, and has not returned.

<HEADLINE> Few Small Businesses Bank Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When it comes to exposure for the smallest of  
small business owners, the Internet is fast becoming an 
indispensable tool. 
</P>
<P>
	Where else can someone working out of the family kitchen or den  
gain ready access to a global marketplace, locate the least 
expensive goods or services in an instant, or spy on the 
competition? 
</P>
<P>
	Yet while business owners have been quick to recognize the many  
virtues of the Internet for growing their companies, fewer feel as 
comfortable handling company finances online. At least that's the 
conclusion of a new survey commissioned by Chicago-based Bank One 
Corp., one that echoes past surveys on Internet banking and small 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 6 percent of the 300 owners of small businesses -- that is,  
businesses with 10 or fewer employes -- questioned by telephone this 
summer said they banked through the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven percent said they planned to begin online banking in the  
next 12 months. However, with a margin of error of plus or minus 
six percentage points, that's nothing to bank on right now. 
</P>
<P>
	The folks at Bank One, and at other financial institutions,  
think all that will change in the next decade -- just as customers 
have grown readily accustomed to using Automated Teller Machines 
since the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you use an ATM card, you're already banking online  
basically,'' said Bill Schumer, national small business banking 
marketing manger for Bank One, which recently launched a new line 
of small business products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once small businesses get up to speed (with online usage),  
they'll be doing their banking online, too. If small businesses 
adopt online banking at the rate they say they will, this will be 
explosive growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is reason for bankers to be optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	The potential is certainly there. Nearly half of all small  
businesses already have online access, the Bank One poll also 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-one percent regularly use e-mail to conduct business,  
while about 20 percent have their own Web sites. In addition, 16 
percent regularly use the Internet to buy products while 12 percent 
sell online. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, 60 percent of the small business Internet users  
said they saw an increase in profits by going online. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most small businesses use the Web for marketing; it's a  
24-hour billboard for their business,'' said Jane Applegate, who 
runs a small business consulting firm in Pelham, N.Y., and has 
written several books on small business. 
</P>
<P>
	``A small company can now do business globally and compete with  
a big company because no one has to know how small you are. Your 
business is based on talent rather than size of your office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest draw of online banking, Applegate says, will be the  
convenience -- in tracking accounts, transferring funds or paying 
bills without leaving the office. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, the small businesses surveyed by Bank One said that  
if they had more time on their hands, they would be better able to 
expand their operations and attend their customers. Eighteen 
percent said their most time-consuming task was trips to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banks are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to protect  
the system and be better prepared,'' said Applegate. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, though, have been criticized for failing to adequately  
address small business' needs online. 
</P>
<P>
	A study last year by the Cambridge, Mass., advisory firm  
Mainspring found that while the top 25 banks have undertaken more 
than 1,000 Internet initiatives, most still didn't deliver what it 
deemed sufficient value. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no clear industry standard for packaging and pricing  
online banking services, according to the Mainspring study. The 
amount banks charge small businesses for online services range from 
no fee to $35 per month, and while some banks give away personal 
computer banking software, others charge as much as $99, it said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates Late-Term Abortions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate began an emotional debate Wednesday  
on a bill that would ban some late-term abortions, reopening a 
volatile political issue and setting the stage for another 
presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats denounced the legislation as unconstitutional and  
designed to boost GOP election prospects next year at the expense 
of women. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know ... this is the third time the president will veto  
this bill,'' said its chief opponent, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. 
``Why go through this if not for politics?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans shot back that they were trying to protect fetuses  
from a medical practice that brutalizes ``the most vulnerable 
members of our society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about infanticide,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.,  
chief sponsor of the bill. ``This is a baby who is all but born and 
then killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate almost immediately focused on the argument over the  
definition of viable life and at which point a fetus should be 
considered born. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure in question involves the partial, feet-first  
delivery of a fetus and the draining of its skull contents. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum's bill, the ``Partial Birth Abortion Act of 1999,''  
would make it a felony punishable by a fine and/or a two-year 
prison term unless it the procedure is ``necessary to save the life 
of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, 
illness or injury.'' The mother could not be prosecuted under the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the legislation provides for lawsuits against the  
physician by the father of the fetus and by the mother's parents, 
in certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., proposed an alternative supported by  
some Democrats and Republicans that would not ban a specific 
abortion procedure. It would stop all abortions after fetuses can 
survive outside the womb except in cases where doctors certify that 
a woman's life was at risk or she faced ``grievous injury'' to 
physical health. Similar language has been defeated in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans called the amendment a broadly worded attempt to  
permit abortions in almost all cases, since pregnancy can easily be 
considered a threat to a woman's health. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has little chance of becoming law. Senior Senate  
Republican aides who spoke on condition of anonymity acknowledged 
that even if Santorum's bill passes, it would probably fall short 
of the two-thirds majority required to override Clinton's expected 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	It has sparse support in the courts. Thirty states have passed  
late-term abortion bans, but lower courts in two-thirds of those 
states have struck down or prevented the activation of those laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., planned to have a  
final vote on the bill Thursday. But angered by his decision to 
bring up the legislation a few days shy of the anniversary of the 
unsolved murder of abortion provider Barnett Slepian near Buffalo, 
N.Y., Democrats threatened to extend debate into an array of 
women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could be on this bill for a couple of weeks,'' said Sen.  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a time frame that 
would take it well beyond current plans to wind up the session for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1692.

<HEADLINE> McCain: Campaign Finance Is an Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Back on the hustings a day after the defeat of  
his campaign finance reform legislation, Sen. John McCain vowed 
Wednesday to continue the fight and said it already has become an 
issue in the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republican said Elizabeth Dole's decision to drop  
out of the race for the GOP presidential nomination hours earlier 
was the latest sign that money is ``corrupting'' the political 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	In her departure speech, Dole said ``the bottom line is money,''  
and to continue with her campaign when she had raised just 
one-tenth of the $57 million raised by front-runner George W. Bush 
would ``be futile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking by car phone from New Hampshire, where he is continuing  
his own campaign for the presidency, McCain added: ``People feel 
that bucks are becoming more important than the ballot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More cryptically, McCain said campaign reform legislation is not  
officially dead for the year on the Senate floor. He pledged to try 
some ``parliamentary tactics'' in the coming weeks to ensure a vote 
up or down on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., McCain has been  
pushing legislation that would have banned ``soft money'' donations 
and allowed non-union members to stop labor unions from spending 
their mandatory dues on political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft money is unlimited donations that unions, corporations and  
some individuals give to the Republican and Democratic parties. 
While the money doesn't flow directly to a candidate, the parties 
often use it in ways to help their campaigns, such as advocating 
their pet issues. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to get the Senate to pass similar legislation last  
year, McCain and Feingold made a tactical decision. They decided to 
strip away a key element of last year's bill, a provision to 
restrict so-called ``issue ads.'' They are thinly veiled attacks on 
candidates paid for with soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., rallied opposition to the  
bill. He contends a ban on unlimited soft money violates the 
Constitution's free speech protections. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the measure died when the Senate twice fell short of  
the 60-vote majority needed to overcome a filibuster led by 
McConnell. All 45 Senate Democrats supported both efforts to free 
the measure, joined by a shifting group of Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Chase Manhattan Earns Up 42 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp.'s profits jumped 42  
percent in the third quarter as higher fees from investment banking 
and money management services offset lower income from trading 
assets and securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-largest bank on Wednesday posted net income  
of $1.19 billion, or $1.37 a share, for the three months ended 
Sept. 30, beating Wall Street's average estimate by a nickel. Chase 
earned $837 million, or 94 cents a share, in the third quarter last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I liked about (the results) was that in a period of  
heightened uncertainty, they delivered,'' said Henry ``Chip'' 
Dickson, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. ``And I think that 
helps longer term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have been concerned that Year 2000 computer problems  
and a rise in bad loans could hurt the banking industry. Chase's 
quarterly numbers were encouraging to some investors, who sent 
shares of Chase up nearly 7 percent, or $4.68 3/4 to $75.81 1/4 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Chase had total assets of $371 billion on Sept.  
30, and returned 22 percent on shareholder equity. 
</P>
<P>
	Noninterest revenue jumped 50 percent to $3.02 billion led by an  
increase in fees from advising companies on mergers and 
underwriting bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	These gains overshadowed an 2 percent drop in net interest  
income, which totaled $1.77 billion in the third quarter. 
Provisions for loan losses increased 46 percent to $398 million, 
and overdue loans rose 31 percent to $2.02 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dina Dublon, chief financial officer for Chase, said much of the  
problems are are in Asia, adding, ``We are comfortable that the 
portfolio as a whole is not showing deterioration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Internet changes the way people bank and invest, Chase is  
moving more of its services to the Internet. The bank will spend 
$100 million this year, and another $250 million next year to 
develop its Web site and make traditional systems e-compatible. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Chase earned $3.75  
billion, or $4.30 a share, a 42 percent gain over the $2.64 
billion, or $2.93 a share, in year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest income was $14.9 billion vs. $16.85 billion.  
Noninterest income was $9.4 billion compared with $7.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Amgen Earnings Up 36 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Amgen on Wednesday reported that  
earnings rose 36 percent in the third quarter on stronger sales of 
its flagship Epogen and Neuprogen drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings rose to $300 million, or 56 cents per share, on  
revenues of $847.2 million. That compares to earnings of $221 
million, or 42 cents per share, on revenues of $700.9 million in 
the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results include $49 million, or 6 cents per share, that  
previously had been held in reserve to settle a royalty dispute 
with Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which sells anemia-fighting drug Epogen 
under a different brand name. 
</P>
<P>
	The results easily topped a 49-cent-per-share estimate by  
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Epogen sales rose 28 percent to $449 million, while sales of  
Neuprogen, which stimulates the growth of white blood cells in 
cancer patients, increased 9 percent to $313 million during the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen also announced plans for a two-for-one stock split and a  
$2 billion buyback of the company's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Amgen earned $814.8 million,  
or $1.59 per share, on revenues of $2.4 billion. For the year-ago 
period, the company earned $624.6 million, or $1.22 per share, on 
sales of $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen shares rose $2.18 3/4 to $86.112 1/2 in trading on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> ATM Surcharge Ban at US Bases Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon, moving to help financially  
strapped military personnel, has proposed banning ATM surcharges on 
all U.S. military bases, both in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department issued the proposal for public comment in  
August, and the comment period ended last Tuesday. A decision is 
expected within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal ``is a nuclear bomb that spells the beginning of  
the end of the ATM fee rip-off,'' Jon Golinger, consumer program 
director for California Public Interest Research Group, said in a 
statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His group is among several organizing a Nov. 2 ballot  
proposition banning ATM surcharges in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks levy the highly unpopular surcharges for the use of their  
automated teller machines by people who are not their customers. 
The fees come on top of any charges by the ATM users' own banks for 
using ATMs operated by other banks. The surcharges now average 
$1.20 at banks and $1.15 at savings and loans, according to a 
report the Federal Reserve submitted to Congress this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups oppose the surcharges, which are banned in  
Connecticut and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry generally defends them, insisting that ATM  
fees are clearly disclosed and are warranted for the 24-hour 
convenience ATMs give customers.

<HEADLINE> BMW Sales Rise 4.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- BMW posted a 4.8 increase in group sales  
Wednesday for the first nine months of 1999 despite continued 
sluggish sales at its British unit, Rover. 
</P>
<P>
	The German automaker said sales revenue rose to $26.7 billion in  
the January-September period although overall vehicle deliveries 
declined 1.2 percent to 895,932 units. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it still forecasts that 1999 will be a record  
year for sales of BMW models. It said worldwide delivery of BMW 
cars rose 10 percent for first three quarters, to more than 
568,000, boosted by especially strong sales in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Rover models fell 30 percent during the nine months, to  
176,528 units, from 253,810 for the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW noted, however, that Rover's market share in Britain rose in  
September to 5.8 percent from 3.4 percent.

	Trade Deficit Narrows Slightly  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit narrowed slightly to  
$24.1 billion in August as improving economies in Asia boosted the 
fortunes of America's struggling manufacturers and farmers. The 
Commerce Department reported today that the August deficit edged 
down 3.2 percent from the all-time record of $24.9 billion set in 
July. But even with the $791 million improvement, the August 
imbalance was still the third worst monthly performance in history 
and left the deficit for the entire year running at an annual rate 
of $252 billion, 53 percent higher than last year's record $164.3 
billion deficit.

statement, China's Foreign Ministry warned that ties with 
Washington could be harmed if the case is not resolved 
``appropriately.'' The ministry was responding to the indictment 
Tuesday of McDonnell Douglas Corp. and China National

Chinese aerospace firm, on charges that they tried to circumvent 
U.S. export controls and ship sophisticated machine tools to China

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. profits jumped 30 percent in the  
first quarter, thanks to strong demand for personal computers 
equipped with its Windows operating system and for the company's 
Office 2000 and other business software. The results announced 
after markets closed yesterday easily beat Wall Street 
expectations. The company reported net earnings of $2.19 billion or 
40 cents a share for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with 
profits of $1.68 billion or 31 cents a share a year earlier.

	Dow Rises Following Inflation Report

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rose yesterday after a report  
of moderate inflation calmed investors' fears of higher interest 
rates, but their renewed optimism failed to lift technology stocks, 
which slumped following a profit warning from Dell. The Dow Jones 
industrial average rose 88.65 to close at 10,204.93, extending its 
gain of 96.57 on Monday. The index fell back from an earlier gain 
of 219 points. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 rose 7.19 to 1,261.32, and the technology-dominated 
Nasdaq composite index fell 0.97 to 2,688.18.

<HEADLINE> Japan Wants WTO Ruling on Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan will take the United States to the World  
Trade Organization over its rulings against imports of Japanese 
steel, Japan's trade minister said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's decision to limit imports of hot-rolled steel  
products from Japan goes against WTO trade regulations, said 
Takashi Fukaya, the minister of international trade and industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steel imports from over 20 countries have been the subject of  
the U.S. anti-dumping procedures,'' the minister said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This widespread and frequent use of anti-dumping procedures,  
and their use to exclude steel imports from the U.S. market, is a 
cause for serious concern,'' he said, suggesting that the intention 
is protectionism. 
</P>
<P>
	An official submission of the complaint will be made to WTO  
headquarters in Geneva around mid-November, a ministry official 
said on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky  
told reporters that if Japan does file a WTO challenge, ``We will 
of course defend the decisions taken in that case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States decided in June to impose antidumping duties  
ranging from 17 percent to 67 percent on certain hot-rolled steel 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. steelmakers say the help other nations give their steel  
industries has built up more steel-making capacity than the 
worldwide market needs. That makes it difficult for American 
companies to command the prices they desire, and led last year to 
five bankruptcies and about 10,000 layoffs in the United States.

<HEADLINE> FCC To Act on Spectrum Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Radio systems that warn drivers of an icy  
bridge ahead or enable emergency vehicles to change stoplights to 
green are just some ways the airwaves could help make the nation's 
highways safer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission was expected to act today  
on a request to allocate spectrum for such futuristic electronic 
systems, designed to alleviate traffic congestion and improve road 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers already can see at least one application of this  
technology in play: automatic toll booths in which cars zoom 
through and have their fare deducted from an electronic tag. The 
Dulles Toll Road in northern Virginia just outside Washington has 
such a system in place now. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation officials and industry groups say this is just  
the tip of the iceberg for uses of short-range communications 
between vehicles and roadside equipment. But squeezing them into 
the existing bandwidth could limit the scope of uses, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Intelligent Transportation Society of America, a  
nonprofit group created at the request of Congress in 1991, asked 
the FCC last year to set aside spectrum so companies and public 
officials would have capacity to develop more applications. 
Consumers could begin benefiting in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is a bridge to the future,'' said John Collins,  
president of the society. The group includes companies such as 
Motorola Inc. and Microsoft Corp., state transportation officials 
and trade associations. ``There are applications we can't even 
dream about out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Collins envisions the current passes that are used  
by cars to glide past tool booths functioning as ``wireless credit 
cards.'' Parking lot charges, gas fill-ups or even fast food from 
drive-thrus could all be billed to the same card, instead of the 
driver digging around for money to pay on site. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, the FCC was expected today to:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Begin a process to devise technical standards for digital  
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Increase federal subsidies that help keep phone service  
affordable in rural and other expensive-to-serve areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department was authorized by Congress to  
develop a program for so-called intelligent transportation systems 
in 1991. Already some of this technology is being used, such as 
fiber optic communication systems that can monitor traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
	The airwaves space from the FCC will make it possible to develop  
more short-range systems in the next few years, said Bill Jones, 
technical director of the Transportation Department's Intelligent 
Transportation System joint program office. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said tests show that new applications could coexist with  
satellite communications systems and military radars that already 
use this spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
	One application could enable ambulances approaching a stoplight  
to change it to green or prolong the green -- rather than having to 
run through a red light -- to minimize accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones envisions this happening in the next two to four years.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question the technology is here to do it,'' Jones  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Already some state transportation departments have ice detectors  
installed in their bridges to alert crews if they freeze over. 
These same detectors could send out a short-range signal to 
oncoming vehicles. The car's radio receiver then could get the 
signal and alert the driver with an audio message. 
</P>
<P>
	Other services under development include a collision avoidance  
system that warns drivers of dangers when approaching an 
intersection or railroad crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole idea is that we can have problems on the highway  
that can be communicated to people inside their cars,'' said 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Automobile manufacturers already are developing cars with  
capabilities to receive these communications. Jones said the 
Intelligent Transportation System program is developing standards 
for this technology, so that one device installed in a car could be 
used for a number of purposes.

<HEADLINE> Nets Sign Sherman Douglas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Nets signed veteran  
point guard Sherman Douglas to a multiyear contract Wednesday. 
Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1 Douglas averaged 8.2 points and 4.1 assists a game  
for the Nets during the 1997-1998 season, but couldn't come to an 
agreement last season and instead signed with the Los Angeles 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm delighted that we can add Sherman to our backcourt  
rotation,'' Nets coach Don Casey said. ``Sherman is a quality 
veteran that responds well to pressure, and his addition adds to 
the depth of our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas will back up star point guard Stephon Marbury, who  
averaged 21 points and eight assists last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, 33, has averaged 11.6 points and 6.4 assists a game for  
a career that includes stints in Miami, Boston and Milwaukee.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Stock Up on Profit News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. profits jumped 30 percent in the  
first quarter, thanks to strong demand for personal computers 
equipped with its Windows operating system and for the company's 
Office 2000 and other business software. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, which easily beat analysts' expectations, sent  
Microsoft shares rising more than 5 percent today and bolstered 
optimism on Wall Street, where stocks were rising broadly. 
Microsoft was up $4.62 1/2 at $90.93 3/4 a share this afternoon on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond, Wash.-based company reported after markets closed  
Tuesday that net earnings of $2.19 billion or 40 cents a share for 
the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with profits of $1.68 billion 
or 31 cents a share a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting a gain of $156 million from the sale of the city  
entertainment guide portion of the MSN Sidewalk online guide, 
Microsoft earned 38 cents a share for the three months ended Sept. 
30. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had projected 
earnings of 34 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly revenue rose 28 percent, from $4.19 billion to $5.38  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maffei, chief financial officer, said there was healthy  
corporate demand for Office 2000, the latest version of the suite 
of business applications introduced in June. Sales of Windows NT 
Server and BackOffice software also did well. 
</P>
<P>
	He told analysts in a conference call that he expects a strong  
second quarter with brisk holiday sales, more demand for Office 
2000 and even some year-end spending by corporate computer managers 
who have gotten their Year 2000 plans squared away. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Maffei had cautioned that sales could be off as  
companies devoted all their resources to stomping out 21st century 
computer bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, ``We don't see a massive deterioration of business,''  
he said. ``We expect that Y2K is not going to be a major problem 
any more than it has been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of personal computers continued to grow, especially in  
Asia, and Microsoft expects that trend to stretch into the December 
quarter, he said. Microsoft's Windows operating system is shipped 
on about 90 percent of all personal computers sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from Asia climbed 82 percent to $593 million, because of  
the region's improved economy and the launch of localized versions 
of Office 2000, particularly in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very pleased with the results in Asia,'' said Carla  
Lewis, director of investor relations. ``That seems to be 
definitely coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for new PCs has stayed strong, even as competition and  
pricing pressures among computer makers has intensified, Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from Microsoft's Windows products grew 17 percent to  
$2.25 billion in the quarter, thanks to strong increases in the 
number of programs shipped with new computers. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped offset less revenue from retail packaged versions of  
Windows 98, the operating system for home and small business 
computers. Retail demand for Windows 98 was especially strong last 
year, when the product was launched in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft still plans to begin manufacturing final versions of  
its long-delayed Windows 2000 operating systems for business and 
corporate use by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei would not give a definite shipping date and told analysts  
not to expect significant revenues from Windows 2000 until after 
the middle of next year.

<HEADLINE> Gay Retirement Communities Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Targeting an older generation open about its  
sexuality and thinking about its golden years, some developers are 
looking to build gay-friendly retirement communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to create something that mirrors the life they're  
living now,'' said Boston real estate agent John Goode, part of a 
group planning an urban homosexual retirement community in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	In generations past, societal pressures forced many gays and  
lesbians to keep their sexual orientations under wraps. Today, 
developers think those who helped pave the way for vibrant gay 
communities will want to continue living in gay communities after 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the mainstream aging community, there is the assumption  
that everyone is straight,'' said Terry Kaelber, executive director 
of the New York-based Seniors Active in a Gay Environment. ``We 
have a place that does not assume that. In fact, it assumes that 
old people can be attracted to old people of the same gender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaelber's group is working with a real estate development  
company to locate a site and investors for a 100-unit, mixed-income 
assisted living facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Current options for gay- and lesbian-themed retirement housing  
consist primarily of a handful of mobile home parks and small 
resorts in Florida and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Goode's group of seven partners wants to build a 75- to 100-unit  
retirement community somewhere in urban Boston. They have completed 
a feasibility study they say shows many older gays and lesbians are 
interested in living in such a community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of community to us is very important because we've  
had to create our own from the 1970s on,'' Goode said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, called Stonewall Communities, is named after a gay  
bar in New York City where a 1969 police raid sparked what many say 
is the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Other entrepreneurs across the country also have begun thinking  
about how the gay and lesbian baby boomers pushing into their 50s 
will want to spend their retirement years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking for the active retirement market,'' said Peter  
Lundberg of San Francisco, who is trying to round up capital to 
build a gay retirement community in California. ``It's essentially 
a Sun City for gays and lesbians, without the golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gay retirement housing options will likely increase dramatically  
in the coming years, said Laura Connolly, who chairs the Lesbian 
and Gay Aging Issues Network for the San Francisco-based American 
Society on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will grow over the years,'' she said. ``They will  
be in a variety of configurations, from the more affordable trailer 
park options on up to the more upscale and expensive models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goode's group, which hopes to gather financing, locate a site  
and begin construction in the next several years, wants to stress 
urbanity with its project. 
</P>
<P>
	``What distinguishes Stonewall Communities is that we want to  
live in the city,'' said David Aronstein, one of Goode's partners. 
``We're of the mind that not everybody wants to live in the Sun 
Belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The community would include amenities such as a wellness center,  
gardens, a restaurant and a business center for people who want to 
continue doing some kind of work after they retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg said he ultimately would like to build resort-like  
communities -- called ``Our Town'' -- on the outskirts of major 
metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think that people would like to be with their own  
kind,'' he said.

<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- NASCAR announced Wednesday that Todd  
Parrott, crew chief for the Dale Jarrett's Robert Yates Racing 
Ford, has been fined $5,000 for use of improper language. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine is the result of comments made during the broadcast of  
last Sunday's Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR said Parrott's comments violated a rule which states, in

to NASCAR ... use of improper language'' may be fined or otherwise 
penalized.

<HEADLINE> Gospel Singers Honor Secular Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sandi Patty is a fan of Barbra Streisand. Kathy  
Troccoli is a fan of Judy Garland. So it's not surprising that on 
``Together,'' their new CD, Patty sings ``Happy Days Are Here 
Again'' and Troccoli sings ``Get Happy'' as a duet. 
</P>
<P>
	Streisand and Garland sang those songs together.  
</P>
<P>
	Patty and Troccoli met and became friends in 1992 when they were  
on a ``Young Messiah Tour.'' Music from Handel's ``Messiah'' was 
used, with updated arrangements. Various Christian music artists 
were on the tour, which played in arenas around the country during 
the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Patty invited Troccoli to perform on a cruise that she  
was planning. Patty organized concerts for some of the ship's 
passengers who were interested in Christian music. 
</P>
<P>
	Troccoli had a clip from a TV variety show that Garland hosted.  
``Barbra Streisand and Garland sang `Get Happy' and `Happy Days.' I 
thought, `Who could do this duet with me?' I'm a huge Garland fan. 
Sandi is a Streisand fan. I sent the clip to Sandi with a note, 
`Give a listen to this. Would you be interested in doing this with 
me on the cruise?' 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked it up and it brought down the house.''  
</P>
<P>
	Patty has won five Grammy Awards, including best female gospel  
singer and best pop gospel album. She records for Word Records and 
has made some 17 CDs and records. Troccoli, who is on the Reunion 
label, has recorded nine CDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Monarch Records hired Patty to sing ``By Strauss'' and ``Someone  
to Watch Over Me'' on a Gershwin tribute album. Troccoli was hired 
to sing ``I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good'' on Monarch's 
``Ultimate Ellington'' album. 
</P>
<P>
	The record company asked the two gospel singers if they would be  
interested in doing something together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said, `Well, we've been doing this little duet,''' Patty  
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	They sing three duets on ``Together.'' Patty sings four songs by  
Gershwin. Troccoli sings four songs that Garland sang. They each 
sing a new song, including ``I Remember,'' co-written by Troccoli. 
</P>
<P>
	Patty has been asked why she sings secular music at pops  
concerts with symphony orchestras. She replies that while her 
entire life is about faith, singing gospel music is only part of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	She calls the songs that make up most of her repertoire gospel  
or contemporary Christian. ``Predominately, it is what is going on 
with life and faith now that I want to communicate. They're like 
popular tunes with a Christian lyric to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Troccoli said churches are using new songs like ``Great Is the  
Lord'' by Michael W. Smith and ``Awesome God'' by Rich Mullins, 
adding that she calls them worship songs instead of hymns. 
</P>
<P>
	Patty is writing her first song, ``Step Into the Joy.'' The song  
echoes one of her main messages, which is to concentrate on the 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very easy for me to lapse into a `life is hopeless, I'm  
never going to get on top of this' feeling. I think that joy is a 
matter of choice, in a way. We can choose to walk away from it or 
to step into it. My days are much better when I step into it.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates Late-Term Abortions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate, reopening an emotional debate on a  
bill that would ban some late-term abortions, rejected an 
alternative Wednesday that offered a broad exception for women 
whose pregnancies endangered their health. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the stronger bill argued that the alternative,  
defeated by a 61-38 vote, would permit late-term abortions in 
virtually any circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about infanticide,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.,  
chief sponsor of a stricter version. ``This is a baby who is all 
but born and then killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats contended Santorum's bill was unconstitutional and  
designed to boost GOP election prospects next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know ... this is the third time the president will veto  
this bill,'' said its chief opponent, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. 
``Why go through this if not for politics?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House issued a statement Wednesday saying Santorum's  
bill ``contains the same serious flaws'' as the bills Clinton 
vetoed in 1996 and 1997 and that the president will veto this one 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate almost immediately focused on the argument over the  
definition of viable life and at which point a fetus should be 
considered born. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure in question involves the partial, feet-first  
delivery of a fetus and the draining of its skull contents. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum's bill, the ``Partial Birth Abortion Act of 1999,''  
would make it a felony punishable by a fine and/or a two-year 
prison term unless the procedure is ``necessary to save the life of 
a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness 
or injury.'' The mother could not be prosecuted under the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the legislation provides for lawsuits against the  
physician by the father of the fetus and by the mother's parents, 
in certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative offered by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., would have  
stopped all abortions after fetuses can survive outside the womb, 
except in cases where two independent doctors certify a woman's 
life was at risk or she faced ``grievous injury'' to physical 
health. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the proposal was a broadly worded attempt to  
permit abortions in almost all cases because pregnancy easily can 
be considered a threat to a woman's health. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has little chance of becoming law. Senior Senate  
Republican aides who spoke on condition of anonymity acknowledged 
that even if Santorum's bill passes, it would probably fall short 
of the two-thirds majority required to override Clinton's expected 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	It has sparse support in the courts. Thirty states have passed  
late-term abortion bans, but lower courts in two-thirds of those 
states have struck down or prevented the activation of those laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., planned to have a  
final vote on the bill Thursday. But angered by his decision to 
bring up the legislation a few days shy of the anniversary of the 
unsolved murder of abortion provider Barnett Slepian near Buffalo, 
N.Y., Democrats threatened to extend debate into an array of 
women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could be on this bill for a couple of weeks,'' said Sen.  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a time frame that 
would take it well beyond current plans to wind up the session for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1692.

<HEADLINE> Rose To Be on Field for Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Despite his lifetime ban from baseball, Pete Rose  
is scheduled to be on the field before Game 2 of the World Series 
on Sunday as part of baseball's All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans voted for the century's top 25 players, including nine  
outfielders, and Rose was consistently ninth in the voting, which 
ran from July 13-Sept. 19. His election was confirmed Wednesday by 
a baseball official familiar with the final vote totals, speaking 
on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig decided in August that Rose  
could participate in the All-Century team if he was elected. Rose, 
however, was not invited to a luncheon prior to the All-Star game 
that honored the living members among the 100 on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, then manager of the Cincinnati Reds, agreed on Aug. 23,  
1989 to a lifetime ban from baseball following an investigation 
into his gambling, a deal announced the following day by 
commissioner Al Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's career hits leader applied for reinstatement in  
September 1997. While Selig hasn't formally ruled on the 
application, he's made clear numerous times that he has no 
intention of lifting the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Century team, which includes five people overlooked by  
fans and added by a special panel, will be announced Saturday and 
honored the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as he's banned, Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame.  
No person ever permanently banned has ever been reinstated.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Bookstore Fights Amazon.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The owners of a feminist bookstore involved  
in a trademark infringement dispute with Amazon.com want the online 
company barred from asking about their sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon Bookstore said that such matters are irrelevant and that  
its owners should not have to answer such questions, which were 
posed during pretrial depositions last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were outraged by it,'' said Barbara Wieser, the store's  
general manager. ``What does our sexual preference have to do with 
a trademark case? Nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bookstore sued Amazon.com in April over its use of the name  
Amazon, saying it creates confusion in the public mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com says it intends to demonstrate that Amazon Bookstore  
caters to lesbians, while the Internet company has a 
general-interest audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not in the same business, the likelihood of  
confusion declines dramatically,'' said Amazon.com spokesman Bill 
Curry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amazon Bookstore, which has been part of the Minneapolis  
literary community since 1970, claims rights to the trademark 
through its 30 years of use.

<HEADLINE> Reno: P. Rican Terrorists a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just a month after President Clinton offered  
clemency to 16 Puerto Rican separatists, a report from Attorney 
General Janet Reno said that the nationalist groups they had been 
aligned with posed an ``ongoing threat'' to national security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Factors which increase the present threat from these groups  
include ... the impending release from prisons of members of these 
groups jailed for prior violence,'' Reno's September 1999 report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report -- the Justice Department's Five Year Interagency  
Counterterrorism and Technology Crime Plan -- was made public at a 
U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing today on the controversial 
grant of clemency Clinton made to Puerto Rican separatists, most of 
them associated with the terrorist group FALN. The FALN was 
responsible for a wave of bombings in the late 1970s and early 
1980s that left six dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Also unveiled at the hearing was the transcript of a phone  
conversation one of those freed from prison by Clinton had while he 
was incarcerated, in which he appeared to show little remorse. The 
April 1999 conversation was taped as part of routine inmate 
monitoring by the federal Bureau of Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	```I don't have to ask for forgiveness from anybody,'' Adolfo  
Matos said. ``I have nothing to be ashamed of or feel that I have 
to ask for forgiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matos did not mention violence specifically, but added that his  
resolve for his cause had grown while in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``My desire has gotten stronger, to the point where I want to  
continue. Continue to fight and get involved with my people, 
because I love them,'' Matos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators at the hearing and the lone Democrat in  
attendance, ranking minority member Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, 
scolded the Justice Department for failing to contact victims of 
FALN violence, either to gather their input on the potential offer 
of clemency or to even inform them that the prisoners were being 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we could do a better job ... getting in touch with  
victims,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder said it was likely that Justice Department officials  
would ``tinker'' with internal regulations to make it a requirement 
that direct input from victims be obtained as part of the clemency 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers also said that before the prisoners were released,  
Justice Department officials should have attempted to obtain 
information from the jailed militants about violent fugitives from 
their groups still at large, some still on the FBI's Most Wanted 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to offer clemency, the least law enforcement  
people should do is to ask them for help finding some of the 
fugitives at large'' Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch, 
of Utah, said.

<HEADLINE> Madonna and Child Stamp Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The traditional Madonna and Child Christmas  
stamp was issued Wednesday by the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The stamp, featuring a painting by 15th century Venetian artist  
Bartolomeo Vivarini, was released in ceremonies at the National 
Gallery of Art. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Madonna and child symbolize hope, renewal, and family;  
values we cherish most at this season of the year,'' said Mary S. 
Elcano, general counsel of the post office. 
</P>
<P>
	Designed by Richard Sheaff of Scottsdale, Ariz., the stamp has  
the word ``Christmas'' in capital letters across the top. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Madonna and Child stamp, the Postal Service  
will also issue several other holiday stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	At a ceremony in Rudolph, Wis., Wednesday the agency issued the  
Holiday Contemporary-Deer stamp. That stamp features a stylized 
antique-gold deer set against one of four different, deeply colored 
backgrounds, red, green, purple or blue. The word ``greetings'' 
appears in gold capital letters along the bottom of the stamp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service also reissued the Holiday Celebration  
Hanukkah stamp Oct. 8 and will issue the Holiday Celebration 
Kwanzaa stamp Oct. 29.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 187.43 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks broke out of their slump  
Wednesday after Microsoft's better-than-expected earnings report 
raised hopes that demand for computers will remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 187.43 to close at  
10,392.36. The Nasdaq composite index, which lists many of the 
world's leading technology companies, was up 99.95 at 2,788.13. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indicators also rose, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
gaining 28.11 to 1,289.43. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq benefited most directly from Microsoft's announcement  
late Tuesday that profits jumped 30 percent in its fiscal first 
quarter on strong demand for personal computers equipped with its 
Windows operating system. Microsoft also reported strong sales of 
its Office 2000 and other business software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft soared 5 15/16 to 92 1/4, lifting many technology stocks  
that were battered over the past week as investors worried about 
disappointing profit reports from Intel and Dell. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rumor was out that corporate earnings would be good, but  
Microsoft really offered the first evidence of it,'' said Bob 
Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at Dain Rauscher 
Wessels in Minneapolis. ``And Microsoft is such an important 
bellwether for the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rage for technology stocks extended to the Dow, where IBM  
rose sharply throughout the trading day on expectations it would 
post solid earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after the close of trading in New York, IBM said its  
earnings matched expectations but that sales of certain products 
slowed due to Year 2000 concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Its shares gave up nearly all their ground as trading continued  
on other exchanges. IBM finished down 1/8 at 107, and in after-hours 
trading on Instinet, sank to 102. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan rose 4 11/16 to 75 13/16 after reporting profits  
jumped 42 percent in the third quarter due to higher fees from 
investment banking and money management services. Chase earned 
$1.19 billion, or $1.37 a share, beating Wall Street estimates by 5 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Robust earnings growth has helped investors shrug off worries  
about higher interest rates. But analysts warned that as long as 
fears of rising rates keep investors on guard, the market may not 
tolerate many earnings disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are in a show-me mode,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior  
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``The strong earnings from 
Microsoft energized the market and brought back a number of 
fence-sitters, but it's not yet clear whether the rally has staying 
power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Airline stocks were mostly lower Wednesday after Trans World  
Airlines and US Airways Group reported losses for the quarter. Both 
airlines struggled with labor disagreements, and rising fuel prices 
cut into profits. TWA fell 1/4 to 3 7/16, and US Airways fell 1 13/16 
to 26 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	While many stocks have rebounded in recent sessions from  
crushing losses last week, the bond market has not yet recovered. 
Wednesday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slipped to 6.33 
percent from 6.35 percent, but yields remain near the highest 
levels since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market's rise was underpinned by news that America's  
trade deficit narrowed slightly to $24.1 billion in August as 
improving economies in Asia boosted demand for U.S. manufactured 
goods and farm exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The August deficit edged down 3.2 percent from the all-time  
record of $24.9 billion set in July, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The imbalance was still the third worst monthly performance in  
history and left the deficit for the entire year running at an 
annual rate of $252 billion, 53 percent higher than last year's 
record $164.3 billion deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 917.50 million shares, compared with 900.07  
million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.01 to 413.94.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.6 percent.  
Germany's DAX index was down 0.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 
0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.3 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> NYC's AIDS Background Checks Halted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A New York City policy that required people  
with AIDS to go through special anti-fraud checks to obtain welfare 
benefits has been struck down by the state's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 7-0 decision, the Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that using  
``eligibility verification review'' (EVR) procedures for the ill 
New Yorkers is incompatible with a 1997 city law requiring poor 
people with the HIV virus and AIDS to get welfare benefits as 
easily as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a major defeat for the Giuliani administration  
and a major victory for New Yorkers living with AIDS and HIV,'' 
said Michael Kink, a spokesman for Housing Works, a group which 
represented HIV-infected plaintiffs in the lawsuit. ``It says that 
the courts won't stand for the mistreatment of people with 
disabilities, even if local governments will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the administration of New York City Mayor  
Rudolph Giuliani said the eligibility verification reviews will 
continue, with some modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic purpose of EVR is to verify eligibility ... and to  
ensure that eligible people actually receive the services,'' said 
Debra Sproles, of the city's Human Resources Administration. ``It 
weeded out fraud, so that people who aren't eligible to receive 
services don't receive them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the EVR process, introduced in 1995, the city requires  
welfare recipients to apply for benefits in their home boroughs in 
addition to a separate appearance for the eligibility review. The 
EVR process allows city inspectors to make home visits to collect 
further information from recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS advocates said the eligibility reviews were onerous to  
people who are ill and often in need of immediate eligibility for 
welfare so they can get medical treatment or food. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main goal of the review is to remove people from the rolls  
and to save the city dollars,'' said Joe Pressley of the New York 
AIDS Coalition. ``Unfortunately, these services are vitally 
important to many people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kink estimated that about 25,000 people a year with AIDS or HIV  
qualify for benefits under the city's Division of AIDS Services 
Income Support program.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Study Raises Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Researchers seeking clues about the high rate of  
breast cancer among wealthy women have found potential 
environmental factors, including professional lawn and dry-cleaning 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Focusing on the Boston suburb of Newton, the researchers found  
women in areas hit hardest by the disease used such services more 
often than those in less-affected neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, neither money nor schooling cause breast cancer,''  
said Dr. Nancy Maxwell, the lead researcher. ``With the Newton 
study we tried to see if there might be environmental factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell cautioned there is no definitive evidence that chemicals  
or pesticides cause cancer. But she said the research points to the 
need for further investigation of possible connections. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of breast cancer in Newton was 13 percent higher than  
the statewide rate between 1982 and 1992, state health officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study ``has taken us one step further in trying to  
understand why socioeconomic status is a factor,'' said Suzanne 
Condon, director of environmental health assessment at the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The department funded 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers from Silent Spring Institute, a nonprofit  
research organization, randomly questioned 1,350 women -- not 
necessarily cancer patients -- ages 35 to 75. 
</P>
<P>
	The study showed that women in neighborhoods with higher rates  
of breast cancer typically had higher incomes and education levels 
than women in areas with lower breast cancer rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Known risk factors for breast cancer, such as delayed  
childbearing and family history of the disease, accounted for only 
a small part of the difference between areas with high and low 
rates of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the survey did suggest possible environmental factors.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, 65 percent of the women in the area with higher  
breast-cancer rates had used a professional lawn service, compared 
with 36 percent of the women in the low-incidence neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, 30 percent of those in the high-incidence area  
reported routine use of pesticides, compared with 23 percent in the 
low-incidence sector. And 45 percent of those in the high-incidence 
area used dry cleaning at least once a month, compared with 32 
percent in the less-affected neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for a national association of pesticide  
manufacturers stressed that studies have shown no conclusive links 
between breast cancer and environmental chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are concerned, however,'' said Chris Klose, a spokesman for  
the American Crop Protection Association in Washington, D.C. ``We 
want people to use pesticides correctly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call seeking comment to the International Fabricare Institute,  
a trade association for dry cleaners, was not returned.

<HEADLINE> IBF May Suspend Promoter Top Rank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The International Boxing Federation said  
Wednesday it plans to suspend the registration of promoter Top Rank 
for withholding a $450,000 fee and not following the sanctioning 
body's rules. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the latest in an ongoing feud between Robert W. Lee,  
president of the East Orange-based IBF, and Bob Arum, president of 
Las Vegas-based Top Rank, promoter of Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, fighters and promoters have been swindled by  
believing that (the IBF is) a nonprofit organization,'' Arum said 
Wednesday night. ``In fact, the money has been siphoned off by a 
for-profit company owned by Bob Lee and other people. This is an 
outrage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After World Boxing Council champion De La Hoya lost a Sept. 18  
world title bout in Las Vegas to IBF champion Felix Trinidad, Top 
Rank did not deduct the $450,000 fee from De La Hoya's purse for 
the IBF supervisor at the fight. De La Hoya reportedly paid an 
identical sanction fee to the WBC supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said he won't pay the IBF fee because he learned of the  
organization's for-profit status. 
</P>
<P>
	``This appears to be a brazen attempt on Bob Arum's part to use  
the present federal investigation for his own financial benefit,'' 
Lee said in a statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Senate subcommittee and a federal grand jury in New  
Jersey are investigating whether boxing's three major sanctioning 
bodies -- the IBF, WBC and the World Boxing Council -- have committed 
fraud, specifically by selling rankings, which can determine the 
significance of a bout. Arum and at least one manager have publicly 
said they paid sanctioning bodies to have their fighters moved up 
in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Nevada Athletic Commission announced it plans to  
investigate IBF's for-profit status, reportedly after Arum 
requested the probe. Lee told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that his 
organization has been a for-profit operation since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``What difference does it make to the Nevada Commission?'' Lee  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said he expects the Nevada commission ``is going to have a  
hearing to revoke the IBF's license.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the IBF is suing Top Rank and De La Hoya in federal  
court in Nevada over the unpaid fee, and Arum said he plans to 
countersue, probably next week. Arum said he would seek punitive 
financial damages and may ask the court to put the IBF into 
receivership. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will ask the court to enjoin the IBF from taking any action  
against Top Rank,'' such as suspending the company's registration, 
pending a decision in the Nevada lawsuit, Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said in his statement that IBF will give Arum 10 days to  
request a hearing on the registration suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he chooses to ignore it and De La Hoya does not pay the  
fees that are owed, Top Rank will be precluded from promoting IBF 
fights in the future,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said he doesn't plan to do either one.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're damned if we're going to put this money into the pocket  
of an individual,'' he said, adding the $450,000 was deposited in 
De La Hoya's bank account. ``Oscar's good for the money.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bishops Offer Voter Pamphlet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The nation's Roman Catholic bishops want parishioners to know  
that voting is not just a civic responsibility, but a moral one. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, they are issuing a guide for America's 60 million  
Catholics, encouraging them to ponder where their candidate stands 
on issues such as abortion, immigration and the rights of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The document is intended to help Catholics ``look at issues  
through the lens that reflects our belief in God's revelation'' but 
is not a voting guide, said Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles. 
``There are no lists of candidates,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The guide, ``Faithful Citizenship: Civic Responsibility for a  
New Millennium,'' is due next month in parishes throughout the 
country, and includes 10 questions to help Catholics assess 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	They include ``How will we protect ... innocent, unborn  
children?'' and ``How will we address the 35,000 children dying 
every day of the consequences of hunger, debt and lack of 
development around the world?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. bishops have issued such guides during every  
presidential election year since the mid-1970s. The guides 
summarize Catholic teachings on public life and various moral 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The main topics include abortion, euthanasia and capital  
punishment. This guide is the first to focus on such contemporary 
issues as debt reduction, school violence and land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	Deal Hudson, editor of the conservative Catholic magazine  
Crisis, called the approach evenhanded, noting ``a very conscious 
attempt on the bishops' part that this document should not be 
politicized in a partisan way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Roberts, editor of the liberal Catholic weekly, National  
Catholic Reporter, agreed: ``It's an extremely valuable rundown on 
what American Catholics should be concerned about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bishops also address affordable health care, religious  
liberty, foreign aid, a more liberal immigration and refugee

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks on Fund-Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday that  
Elizabeth Dole's departure from the Republican presidential race 
highlights the problem other candidates will face against Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush's fund-raising juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who has raised $57 million dollars for his presidential  
bid, has refused federal matching funds and thus is not bound by 
federal limits on spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was urged to do the same in the 1996 campaign  
``but I decided it wasn't fair, and I didn't think it was the right 
thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes, however, said Clinton's advice  
will not sway them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate the president's thoughts on the matter, but we  
don't intend to use him as a model for how Gov. Bush will raise 
money or lead the nation,'' Hughes said.

<HEADLINE> Football Player Dies of Head Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Joseph Barajas, a 15-year-old high  
school football player, died three days after injuring in his head 
in a collision with another player and a month after a concussion 
in another game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials listed cause of death as ``traumatic brain  
injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barajas, a sophomore at San Jose's Pioneer High School,  
collapsed on the sidelines Saturday after slamming into another 
player during a junior varsity game, said Maureen Davidson, 
spokeswoman for the San Jose Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered a blood clot on the brain and had been hospitalized  
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in four weeks that Barajas, who played  
linebacker and guard, was injured on the field. A concussion 
sidelined him for weeks until he was cleared by a doctor to resume 
playing, coach Tim Lugo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The young player's death comes as San Francisco 49ers  
quarterback Steve Young ponders his own future after four 
concussions in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Concussions are caused when a blow rotates and twists the brain  
in the skull, damaging brain tissue. They can cause swelling and 
other damage and in some cases lead to long-term cognitive 
dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 63,000 high school varsity athletes participating  
in any of 10 sports suffer a concussion every year, according to a 
nationwide study published last month in the Journal of the 
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	It is hard to tell if Barajas' first injury contributed to his  
death, said Dr. Martin Holland, director of the brain and spinal 
cord injury program at the University of California, San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the flag was lowered to half staff at Pioneer High  
School, where principal Ardith Heinrich called Barajas a classy 
young man. He played tenor sax in the school band and was 
considered a top student. His twin brother, Christian, also played 
on the junior varsity football team. Their brother Adrian is a 
junior.

<HEADLINE> Casualties Up in Invisible Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the invisible primary, the visible  
casualties are piling up. Elizabeth Dole, the latest to quit the 
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, couldn't 
afford to wait for the voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is money,'' she said, and the odds against her  
in that competition were insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamar Alexander and Dan Quayle had come to the same conclusion,  
and the same early exits. Two even longer-shot candidates dropped 
out before them, on different grounds although they were 
cash-starved, too. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been early campaign casualties before, but not so  
many so far in advance of the voting, which begins in Iowa on Jan. 
24, with New Hampshire next on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	And Pat Buchanan, who scared a president and stalled a  
front-runner in separate campaigns as a Republican, is bolting the 
GOP next week to seek nomination in the Reform Party, which could 
deliver him money to campaign next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush dominates the narrowing field, with  
Sen. John McCain and Steve Forbes the closest of five challengers -- 
and not very close. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole was running a distant second to Bush in most national  
surveys, about 10 percent to his 60 percent in the two latest 
polls. McCain was in the same bracket, although gaining in polls of 
early primary states. Forbes can campaign on his own money, and has 
spent about $16.3 million so far, out of a total of $20.8 million 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
	As she dropped out, Dole described the Catch-22 of campaign  
cash: Without enough money for staff, travel and advertising, a 
candidate can't gain the headway that will attract more 
contributors, and the campaign stalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Quayle said, for him, ``the political  
reality set in when I looked at the money and the calendar.'' He 
clung to the belief that he could have run strong in New Hampshire, 
but even then, he said, there wouldn't have been time to replenish 
his treasury to be competitive in the decisive primaries that 
almost certainly will settle the nomination by March 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, the former Tennessee governor and Cabinet member,  
lamented the impact of money when he ended his second bid for the 
nomination Aug. 16. ``If we are not careful we'll end up with only 
a race between the rich and the already famous,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, none of the dropouts could criticize Bush for convincing  
people to contribute to his campaign, under the same limits that 
applied to them. The governor says his funds have come from more 
than 135,000 contributors so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Author Arthur Hadley wrote ``The Invisible Primary'' before the  
1976 campaign. It was his phrase for the advance contest for 
campaign money, with the premise that it can be decisive. 
</P>
<P>
	No candidate ever has led that race by the margin Bush has now.  
</P>
<P>
	He's got 19 times as much campaign cash on hand as either of his  
closest bankroll rivals, McCain and Forbes. And about 43 times as 
much as Dole had available when she ended her campaign Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve Forbes has unlimited resources,'' she said. ``Gov. Bush  
has raised over $60 million and has about $40 million on hand ... 
</P>
<P>
	``These rivals would enjoy a 75 or 80 to 1 cash advantage,''  
Dole said. ``The odds are overwhelming ... The bottom line remains 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's campaign bank account actually is second to Bush's,  
just over $2 million in the latest report. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign finance reform is one of his lead issues, and he said  
it is helping him gain headway in New Hampshire. ``I'm campaigning 
on reform,'' McCain said after losing his annual attempt to get it 
though the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	That wouldn't have affected the rules for primary campaign fund  
raising, in which contributions are limited to $1,000 from 
individuals, $5,000 from political action committees. The only 
changes even suggested in that system have been for increases in 
the donation limits, unchanged since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	With his record bankroll, Bush had opted not to take the federal  
campaign subsidies the candidates can get next year. The federal 
money comes with strings -- state by state spending limits, which 
won't apply to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	That avoids a handicap against Forbes, who can write his own  
checks, as he did for television ads against his rivals in the 1996 
primaries. It also means Bush's spending won't be limited next 
spring, should he clinch the nomination in the early primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said Wednesday that he'd been advised to skip  
the matching funds to avoid the limits in 1996, ``but I decided 
that it wasn't fair and I didn't think it was the right thing to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, it was to his advantage to take the money and use it on  
a head-start campaign against Bob Dole, who was broke after the 
Republican primaries.

<HEADLINE> Nissan, Renault Plan Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKUHARI, Japan (AP) -- Japan's Nissan Motor Co. and France's  
Renault SA expect to be making vehicles using the same basic 
framework by the year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies made the projection today as carmakers gathered  
from across the globe for the Tokyo Motor Show and said the shared 
car platform would save huge costs in manufacturing as well as 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2003, Nissan's European lineup will be totally replaced.  
</P>
<P>
	The cooperation between the two automakers follows Renault's  
purchase of a 37 percent stake in Nissan this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault officials say the alliance with Nissan will help push  
their brand in Japan, a notoriously difficult market where Renault 
had been a relative unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Nissan announced a series of cost-slashing moves,  
including closing down three assembly plants, cutting the number of 
suppliers by half and trimming the work force by 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Motor Show conducted previews for the media today  
ahead of its opening to the public Saturday.

<HEADLINE> 'Canes Clicking Without Primeau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The hole in the Carolina Hurricanes' lineup  
caused by the absence of Keith Primeau has been closed 
significantly in the first two weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, there doesn't seem to be a gap at all.  
</P>
<P>
	The defending Southeast Division champions are off to a 3-1-2  
start without the team's All-Star center and two-thirds of the way 
through an NHL record-tying nine-game season-opening road trip. The 
Hurricanes play the seventh game of the road trip tonight at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the Los Angeles Kings have more road wins (4) than Carolina  
as Primeau, the team's leading goal-scorer last year, sits out in a 
contract squabble with management. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about the fact until the situation gets resolved,  
we can't just sit around and wait for it to happen,'' said Ron 
Francis, who replaced Primeau as the team's captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to everyone to go out there and elevate their game,  
and everybody try and pitch in and make that hole that has been 
created by Keith's absence a little bit smaller. That's all we've 
tried to do as a hockey club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far it has been mission accomplished.  
</P>
<P>
	``More than our record, I'm happy with the style of game we're  
playing and the way the guys are really committed to each other,'' 
coach Paul Maurice said this week. ``You win a few games, everybody 
is in a good mood to come to the rink, but there seems to be an 
underlying confidence there that we had hoped we could generate 
early in the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to missing Primeau's 30 goals, the Hurricanes let  
aging linemate and unrestricted free agent Ray Sheppard and his 25 
goals go. But scoring hasn't been a problem so far for Carolina, 
which still prides itself on a pesky forechecking style of hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked before the season about guys knowing what their  
roles were and accepting their roles and working hard at it,'' 
Francis said. ``For six games, we've had 20 guys step on the ice 
that have played as hard as they possibly can and put the team 
first. That's why we've had the results that we've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leadership and playmaking ability of Francis, who signed a  
$20 million free agent contract with the team last season, have 
also been keys. The center and linemates Sami Kapanen and Bates 
Battaglia each lead the NHL with a plus-9 rating. The trio have 
combined for nine of the team's 16 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron Francis has had a big impact on that locker room,''  
Maurice said. ``Now, he is not walking in and observing anymore. He 
knows the players, he knows their personalities. That makes a big 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, who won two Stanley Cups in Pittsburgh, said the team's  
young players learned a lot from the franchise's first playoff 
berth since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our guys took a lot of steps forward last year,'' said  
Francis, who is closing in on his 1,500 career point. ``I think 
they came a long way in learning what it takes to be successful 
come April, May and June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw how tough it was in the playoffs. It was kind of an  
eye-opener for some guys. Guys have worked really hard from Day 
One. I think it sort of just carried over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes close their lengthy road trip with games this  
week at Buffalo and Pittsburgh before returning home to open their 
new 18,711-seat arena Oct. 29 against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of (our success) is everybody is just in a better mood  
because they know we're playing at home this year,'' said Maurice, 
referring to a two-year stint in Greensboro waiting for the 
completion of the Raleigh arena. ``You are looking forward to the 
season with optimism. It's not like, `Geez, only 82 more games.' 
That can sometimes be tough.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Futures Tumble on Export News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell sharply Wednesday on the Chicago Board of  
Trade as a sale of U.S. wheat to Egypt turned out to be smaller 
than expected, underscoring the tough competition in the world 
export market. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, coffee slipped further below the $1-a-pound  
mark and gold continued its fall toward $300 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat tumbled 2 percent after leading importer Egypt bought  
165,000 tons of U.S. hard red winter wheat, the kind used in bread 
making and flour, in a deal investors thought would be more 
lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculative buying in recent days by investors anticipating a  
big export transaction for U.S. wheat had driven the price up 
artificially, said Dale Gustafson, a grains analyst for Salomon 
Smith Barney in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase didn't meet those expectations, and futures sales  
ballooned after specifics of the deal became known. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those buy-a-rumor, sell-the-fact type deals,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Nosker, a grains analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St.  
Louis, said low market prices enable importing nations to pick and 
choose at the last moment before buying. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who have wheat to export -- the U.S., Canada, France  
and others in Europe -- are pounding each other over the head to 
sell it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason, he said -- a tightening world market.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat acreage has been reduced for three straight years because  
the low prices provide less incentive to growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you reduce acreage again, I think we'd see a very tight  
situation worldwide,'' Nosker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 5 1/4 cents to $2.57 3/4 a bushel.  
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans, influenced by wheat, fell sharply while other grains  
also were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	December corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.00 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell  
1/4 cent to $1.09 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 6 3/4 cents to $4.88 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures sank again on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa  
Exchange amid forecasts for continued rain in key producing regions 
of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was some debate among investors as to whether the  
precipitation -- only showers, and not widespread -- would be enough 
to offset damage to the crop from a weeks-long drought in the 
world's top coffee-producing nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dry weather is forecast again throughout the region Thursday and  
Friday, with scattered showers returning for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee for December delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to 95.40 cents a  
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures, after soaring higher earlier this fall, dipped to  
their lowest closing level in about two weeks on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors said the metal, which had been rising while stocks and  
the dollar stumbled in recent weeks, was hurt as Wall Street and 
the dollar rallied sharply Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	December gold fell $2.20 for a second straight day, settling at  
$305.80 a troy ounce.

<HEADLINE> Navy Medics Charged in Wife's Death </HEADLINE>

<P>
	CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (AP) -- A man and a woman who are both  
Navy medics are charged with committing adultery, killing his wife 
and trying to cover up the crime by claiming she ran away to Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty Officer 3rd Class Andrea Bart, 28, was charged Tuesday  
with murder, adultery and conspiracy in the military legal system 
in connection with the death of Cynthia L. Tate. In July, Mrs. 
Tate's husband, Petty Officer 2nd Class David Tate, was charged 
with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Tate reported his wife missing Feb. 16 from their home on the  
base. He told authorities she had left three days earlier and left 
a note that said she was going to Las Vegas with friends to see a 
boxing match. 
</P>
<P>
	Her remains were found July 8 near a reservoir on the base.  
</P>
<P>
	Tate remains in the brig at Camp Pendleton, a 125,000-acre base  
30 miles north of San Diego. Bart, a hospital medic who joined the 
Navy in 1991, is being held at the brig at Miramar Naval Air 
Station in San Diego. Both are being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Bart and Tate were medics assigned to the Headquarters and  
Service Battalion, 1st Force Service Support Group at Camp 
Pendleton.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures tumbled Wednesday after a  
much-anticipated purchase of U.S. wheat by Egypt turned out to be 
for a smaller amount than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans, influenced by wheat, fell sharply while other grains

at their highest level since 1987 due largely to low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures were little changed, with a dearth of fresh news to

<HEADLINE> Administration Defends Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Existing antitrust laws are adequate to  
protect the interests of farmers and consumers as agriculture and 
food processing companies go through a wave of mergers and 
acquisitions, according to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations provide the ``appropriate framework for policing  
and enforcing our nation's concerns about the ability of markets to 
operate competitively,'' said John Nannes, a deputy assistant 
attorney general for the department's antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that any  
significant mergers ``are going to get a very careful look'' from 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm economy is stuck in its worst downturn since the  
mid-1980s, and although economists blame it on overproduction of 
crops and livestock, many lawmakers have been pointing to 
agribusiness mergers as a culprit. A handful of firms now control 
many segments of the agriculture and food industries, including 
meat processing and grain shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, several Senate Democrats who believe the  
administration's antitrust enforcement has been lax said they 
intend to force a vote in the Senate on an 18-month moratorium on 
further mergers of agricultural or food companies. The 
administration would be required to do a study of the industries 
during the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawmakers told the committee Wednesday that Congress  
should consider tightening antitrust laws to curb the 
consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should act deliberately, but also with broad and bold  
strokes,'' said Rep. John Thune, R-S.D. ``The net result should be 
a system that fosters true competition for all those participating 
in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the department allowed Cargill Inc., North  
America's second-largest grain trader, to acquire the grain 
operations of Continental Grain, provided the companies sold some 
of their facilities. Congressional critics of the department don't 
think the deal ever should have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the department forced Monsanto to spin off some corn  
technology interests before it could acquire DeKalb Genetics Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Those actions ``ought to be an indication that we are watching  
market trends very carefully in the agricultural marketplace,'' 
Nannes said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the latest deals before the department, Smithfield  
Foods Inc. of Smithfield, Va., the biggest pork processor as well 
as the largest hog producer, is seeking the department's approval 
to acquire No. 2 producer Murphy Family Farms of Rose Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department is doing what it can, including  
expanding its economics and legal staff, to ensure that meatpackers 
treat livestock producers fairly, said Enrique Figueroa, USDA's 
deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs.

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Researchers have developed an experimental  
vaccine that appears to fight prostate cancer by revving up the 
body's immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	``This same concept could be applied to breast cancer or other  
cancers,'' Jonathan Simons, who led the study done by researchers 
at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, said Wednesday. ``This is not 
a cure, but this is a whole new door to walk through to get to 
curing prostate cancer using the immune system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in the October issue of the journal  
Cancer Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers tricked the human immune system into recognizing  
cancerous prostate cells as foreign invaders by genetically 
engineering patients' own cells and injecting them back into the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	While the approach has been tried before, the researchers at  
Johns Hopkins were able for the first time to activate the body's 
entire immune system to fight prostate cancer, Simons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers used a gene, called GM-CSF, that activates the  
immune system, attached it to a common virus and implanted it 
inside cancerous cells of 11 prostate organs surgically removed 
from patients. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight cases, researchers were able to grow a culture of the  
modified, cancerous cells in the laboratory. The cells were then 
irradiated, which kept them alive but stopped them from multiplying 
any further. 
</P>
<P>
	After the vaccine was injected, the immune system of all eight  
patients produced antibodies that identified foreign invaders as 
well as immune cells that attack and kill infectious cells, Simons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine not only recognized the injected cells as foreign  
but apparently told the immune system to recognize cancerous 
prostate cells remaining in the body as foreign, Dr. John Gutheil, 
clinical research director at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center in 
San Diego, said of the research. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good stuff, if they've really had immune response,''  
Gutheil said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our immune system doesn't see cancer as being that much  
different from our normal tissue, a situation we refer to as immune 
tolerance,'' he said. ``What you're seeing here is people are 
trying to use GM-CSF to actually override this immune tolerance 
that we have for our own tissues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death  
among men, behind lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still too early to tell what impact this is going to have  
on the disease,'' said Myers, who has been diagnosed with prostate 
cancer. ``I think it's an important step in the development of 
prostate cancer immunotherapy, but it doesn't look to be the final 
step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simons said it is also unclear whether the vaccine would  
convince the immune system to attack normal prostate tissue in 
patients with cancer of the prostate who have not had the organ 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chances are the immune system would attack the normal prostate  
as well, but that's not a big deal because the prostate is not a 
life-sustaining organ,'' Gutheil said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said he believes the vaccine technology can  
eventually be improved enough so the immune system only targets 
cancerous cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Simons said while the study dealt with whether it could produce  
the immune response, further research is under way to determine 
whether the immune system can fight cancer in patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in the field for decades and people have been  
skeptical about whether the immune system could ever see prostate 
cancer,'' Simons said. ``What's truly novel about this paper is not 
only can the immune system see prostate cancer, but you can 
activate all the appropriate anti-cancer killing arms.''

<HEADLINE> Sun Life of Canada To Go Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Sun Life of Canada plans to go public, joining a  
wave of mutual insurance companies restructuring to transfer 
ownership from policyholders to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto-based company, which makes its U.S. headquarters in  
Wellesley, said today it plans to offer more than 1 million 
policyholders around the world shares of stock in a new company to 
be called Sun Life Financial Services of Canada Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada joins other insurers,  
including Boston-based John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., 
Newark, N.J.-based Prudential Insurance Co., and New York-based 
Metropolitan Life Insurance, moving ahead in the complicated 
process known as ``demutualization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it wants to go public to raise capital to  
compete and make acquisitions in a rapidly consolidating financial 
services industry. 
</P>
<P>
	As a mutual insurance company, Sun Life is currently owned by  
its policyholders. It plans to issue stock, which policyholders can 
keep or sell. The plan will not affect the policies themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Life estimates its current market value at between $3.8  
billion and $5.7 billion, meaning the 400 million shares it wants 
to issue each would be worth between $9.52 and $14.28. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to 160,000 U.S. policyholders, Sun Life has  
policyholders in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Philippines and 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is still subject to approval by regulators and  
policyholders. Sun Life said it hopes to complete its initial 
public offering in the spring.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Provided for Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Steve Haase sees his new company as the next  
Lloyd's of London, which got is start protecting businesses 
entering the new frontier of overseas trading. Haase's company 
wants to do the same for Internet's shipping lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	INSUREtrust.com is one of the first insurance firms to indemnify  
companies doing business on the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based firm provides liability coverage for all  
aspects of computer operations -- whether they come as a ``crash'' 
caused by a software/hardware breakdown, or a hack from an outside 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been three major movements within business --  
waterborne trade, the Industrial Revolution and the Information 
Age,'' said Haase, chief executive officer for the year-old company 
considered the first to cater entirely to computer risk-management. 
``It really looks like we're doing something that's really cutting 
edge, but we're really applying old concepts to a new medium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	INSUREtrust.com protects companies against anything from  
computer crashes or malfunctions to ``hacks'' into networks from 
outside invaders and the loss of data or money due to any of the 
above. 
</P>
<P>
	Policies can also protect against potential copyright  
infringements on Web sites and lawsuits from customers whose 
shipments were lost or whose privacy was violated, or against 
losses incurred if a disgruntled employee shuts down the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Joanne Orfanos of the National Association of Independent  
Insurers said several companies have begun offering piecemeal 
Internet protection policies, but INSUREtrust.com is the first 
company to specifically cater to e-businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they've done is taken a step toward legitimizing the  
Internet and making it safer,'' said Blaine Burnham, a former 
National Security Administration computer security specialist who 
now heads Georgia Tech's Information Security Center. 
</P>
<P>
	But there remains a degree of perhaps healthy insecurity. While  
INSUREtrust.com has signed up with at least a dozen companies, 
several declined interview requests, fearing the publicity of being 
``insured'' would make them likely targets for hacker attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of big name companies out there -- household  
names, mind you -- who don't want the publicity of a hack,'' said 
Spence Hoole, an executive with Aon Risk Management, which has 
bought INSUREtrust.com policies for clients. ``That's why 
INSUREtrust.com, or at least a form of it, will be around for a 
while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For an annual premium of between $5,000 to $250,000, companies  
can buy coverage of up to $25 million a year. But INSUREtrust.com 
goes further than financial protection. 
</P>
<P>
	A company's computer network security system must pass muster  
before INSUREtrust.com will take it on. A former Pentagon computer 
expert helps conduct the inspections, and Haase said they have 
turned down potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	For those that do pass, the company offers consulting on how to  
improve network security, and those that take the advice can lower 
their premiums. A lot of companies need a lot of work, said Rick 
Davis, who co-founded INSUREtrust.com with Haase. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to be surprised by the levels of insecurity and  
noncontrol when it came to networks at the corporate level,'' said 
Davis, a former insurance agent who is now the company's 
information and development officer. ``It was quickly obvious to us 
and is now becoming obvious to anyone in the industry that risk 
management is sorely lacking in e-business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haase said the privately held company is at about the break-even  
point, and expanding rapidly, hiring 13 new employees since August. 
He said the company continues to target emerging technology firms -- 
``so we can be involved in the full life cycle of an e-business,'' 
Haase said, adding other potential customers include hospitals, 
Internet service providers, data entry and storage firms as well as 
anyone selling anything over the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a movement toward offering warranties that certain  
security measures work, or a transaction is completely safe, or 
whatever,'' Haase said. ``What we can do is validate those 
warranties. And that will take e-business one step closer to the 
legitimacy it really needs right now.''

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Rockers Hire Hughes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Dan Hughes, who as interim coach led Charlotte  
to the WNBA's Eastern Conference finals last season, was hired 
Tuesday as coach of the Cleveland Rockers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes replaces Linda Hill-McDonald, fired in August after the  
Rockers went 7-25 and failed to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, an Ohio native, took over at Charlotte last season after  
Marynell Meadors was fired. The Sting went 12-12 under Hughes and 
beat Detroit in the first round of the playoffs before losing to 
New York in the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, 44, said he turned down an opportunity to stay in  
Charlotte to return to his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The right place for us was right here in Cleveland,'' Hughes  
said. ``Just the fact that I've spent most of my career in Ohio 
made it easy to come home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got to make some improvements,'' he said.  
``Hopefully, we can add some personnel through the draft and build 
on the players we already have. We've got a long way to go, but I 
think we can close the gap quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes was an assistant women's coach at Toledo before joining  
the Sting. He also was an assistant on the men's staff at Toledo, 
Mount Union, Baldwin-Wallace and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill-MacDonald coached the Rockers since the WNBA's inception in  
1997. She was 42-48, including a 20-10 record and an Eastern 
Conference championship in '98.

<HEADLINE> Kevin Williams in Intensive Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While doctors work to figure out just what is  
ailing Kevin Williams of the New York Jets, his agent believes the 
team has abandoned the defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is hospitalized in an intensive care unit and on a  
respirator for what originally was diagnosed as strep throat. But 
Williams, 24, has been sedated for most of this week and has 
undergone three surgical procedures to clear fluid from his throat 
and around his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he's listed in guarded condition, but I have not  
been able to speak to him in four days,'' said Jerome Stanley, 
Williams' agent. ``He's in a sedated state and not able to talk or 
communicate. He's not conscious more than 10 minutes at a time and 
has been on a heart monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors are concerned about a virus penetrating the organs,  
the heart, then they wouldn't know what to do. That was what caused 
the red alert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lenox Hill Hospital has honored a family request to withhold  
information on Williams' condition. The Jets will not elaborate 
until coach Bill Parcells meets with the media today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets cornerback Aaron Glenn said team officials advised the  
players not to visit Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told us it wouldn't be wise to go see him,'' Glenn said.  
``He's having trouble breathing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' mother and other family members traveled from Arkansas  
last week to be with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very, very sick young man,'' Parcells said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams had been in and out of the hospital for two weeks. Jets  
team doctor Elliott Pellman has been updated daily by the hospital. 
Williams also has been examined by a heart specialist and an 
infectious disease physician. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley said he is upset the organization has not contacted  
Williams' family. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a job or business in America that would treat an  
employee like this. Nobody offered the family any communication or 
anything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley also said the Jets placed Williams on the reserve,  
non-football injury list so they wouldn't be required to continue 
paying him. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent believes Williams' condition was exacerbated by his  
returning to the lineup for a game in Denver on Oct. 3 and should 
be on injured reserve. On that list, teams must pay a player's full 
salary when he is sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have talked to medical people,'' Stanley said, ``and the  
fact it had become so difficult to diagnose was a direct result of 
playing in the high altitude in Denver. This is not a 
non-football-related situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said today the team would be paying Williams half of  
the salary still due. Williams has a base salary of $180,000 this 
year, which means he will collect close to $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said Williams also would get credit for a full season  
by being on the roster for six games. That is significant when 
Williams reaches the free agency requirements of three seasons 
(restricted) or four seasons (unrestricted). 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets are known as an organization that does not abandon its  
players. When Dennis Byrd was partially paralyzed in 1992, the team 
paid his medical bills even after he retired.

<P>
	WEXFORD, Ireland (AP) -- Sean Cloney, a Catholic farmer whose  
marriage to his Protestant childhood sweetheart engulfed a rural 
community in sectarianism, died Tuesday of pneumonia. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of Cloney and his wife, the former Sheila Kelly, was  
made into an Irish film last year called ``A Love Divided,'' which 
reflected deep-rooted religious divides and the sway of the 
Catholic clergy in rural Ireland in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cloney's decision to educate her daughters at home instead  
of a Catholic school in the village of Fethard-on-Sea, in County 
Wexford, prompted a parish priest to orchestrate a 1957 boycott of 
Protestant businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The boycott ended when the Kelly family and the local lawmaker,  
a Catholic, made a joint appeal and a priest bought a pack of 
cigarettes from a Protestant-owned shop. Mrs. Cloney continued to 
educate her children at home.

	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Ralph Grey, a former colonial administrator of  
the Bahamas and the last governor of Northern Ireland, died Sunday. 
He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Grey served as governor of Northern Ireland from 1968 until  
1973, when Prime Minister Edward Heath abolished the province's 
Protestant-dominated parliament and imposed direct rule by the 
central government. 
</P>
<P>
	Grey was the last man to hold the title of governor in Northern  
Ireland. Subsequently, many of those powers were assumed by the 
Northern Ireland secretary, a member of the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Grey was appointed deputy governor-general in Nigeria in 1957,  
serving until 1959. From 1959 to 1964 he was governor of British 
Guiana, then was governor of the Bahamas from 1964 to 1968 and 
governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands from 1965 to 1968.

<HEADLINE> Rain-Soaked Fans Cheer Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox didn't win the World Series, an  
AL pennant or even finish first in the division. In this 
long-suffering town, that's no reason to cancel the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could be a long wait'' until the Red Sox win the World  
Series, said Anthony Macchiavelli, a lifelong Red Sox fan who works 
next to City Hall Plaza, where the mayor held a rally for the team 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred fans braved the rain to cheer for the Red Sox  
two days after they lost in the American League Championship Series 
to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Macchiavelli had to skip the rally because he was  
working, those who did attend wouldn't let the weather or the 
team's early exit from the playoffs dampen their mood. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity to show how proud I am of the team,'' said  
Stephen Roache, of Charlestown. ``It's been a great season, and I'm 
counting the days until April.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox lost star slugger Mo Vaughn last winter and were  
expected by most to finish near the back of the pack. But they won 
94 of 162 regular-season games to finish second in the AL East and 
earn a wild-card berth into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing the first two games of their first-round series  
against the Cleveland Indians, the Red Sox won the last three to 
set up a dream matchup against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	New York won that best-of-7 series in five games, finishing the  
Red Sox off on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We say thank you to a team that ... confounded all the  
experts,'' Mayor Tom Menino said. ``They said they couldn't do it. 
But they did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox CEO John Harrington, general manager Dan Duquette and  
manager Jimy Williams also spoke to the crowd, as did players Bret 
Saberhagen, Nomar Garciaparra and Pedro Martinez, who were among 
the handful of players on the dais. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected to have a World Series championship, but we fell a  
little short,'' Saberhagen said. ``We're a little disappointed 
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All promised that next time, the party would be bigger.  
</P>
<P>
	``Next year, you will have a parade in this town,'' Martinez  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd sang ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' and chanted  
``M-V-P!'' for both Garciaparra and Martinez. Even Wilton Veras, a 
little-used infielder, got a big hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised,'' Garciaparra said. ``The way this town  
supports us so much, this was great. It doesn't make it any easier 
(to lose), but it's definitely nice to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Walsh, 25, who has been going to Red Sox games since age 5,  
said he didn't see anything wrong with having a rally for a team 
that fell short of its goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they did today was pretty mellow,'' he said. ``If they  
ever won the World Series, the city of Boston would be upside 
down.''

<HEADLINE> Kasparaitis Suspended Two Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANONSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Darius  
Kasparaitis was suspended for two games Wednesday for elbowing 
Jean-Pierre Dumont of Chicago in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis was ejected from Saturday's game, his first of the  
season after sitting out four games for conditioning reasons. 
Dumont was knocked out, and later was diagnosed with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL ruled the elbowing as intentional.  
</P>
<P>
	``The hit delivered by Mr. Kasparaitis was deliberate,'' NHL  
vice president Colin Campbell said. ``His opponent was not in 
possession of the puck nor in a position to defend himself. This 
type of hit is dangerous and warrants disciplinary action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins coach Kevin Constantine said Kasparaitis did not  
purposely try to injure Dumont. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that they're trying to protect the players, and  
that's admirable,'' Constantine said. ``But he didn't run him, not 
with the play near the boards like it was, and he didn't try to 
hurt him. He just happened to get hurt on the play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis said, ``He had his head down. That's why he got  
hurt. I didn't try to hurt him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis is considered one of the NHL's top hitters and  
agitators, but the suspension was the first of his eight-year 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always try to play within the rules,'' he said. ``I play  
hard and I hit hard. But I don't try to hurt anybody, and I didn't 
try to hurt him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the NHL's collective bargaining agreement,  
Kasparaitis must forfeit two game checks, which based on his annual 
average salary would be $15,626.

<HEADLINE> South Poll Doctor Has Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Nearly five months after she found a lump in  
her breast, a doctor rescued from the South Pole confirmed that she 
has cancer and she will undergo treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerri Nielsen, 47, continued to shy away from international  
attention, saying she would not grant any interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The diagnosis of breast cancer has been confirmed and I will  
undergo treatment. My spirit is strong,'' Nielsen said Tuesday in 
her first public statement since returning to the United States on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be back with my family and friends in the United  
States,'' she said in the statement issued through the National 
Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, of the Youngstown, Ohio area, treated herself with  
chemotherapy until she was rescued Saturday from the Amundsen-Scott 
South Pole Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The only doctor among the 41 researchers at the station, Nielsen  
discovered a lump in her breast in June. She had medical supplies 
dropped to her a month later during a daring mercy mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplies allowed her to perform her own biopsy and begin  
self-treatment with chemotherapy. She e-mailed photographs of slide 
samples of the tumor to doctors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her illness, Nielsen kept busy with her duties up until  
she left the South Pole, said her sister-in-law, Diana Cahill. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's rescue from the coldest place on Earth was possible  
only after the Antarctic winter relented slightly, making it warm 
enough -- 58 degrees below zero -- to risk the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the rescue operation was possibly the earliest  
ever post-winter flight to the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	In her statement, Nielsen thanked those who rescued her and  
helped with her treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heartfelt thanks go out to my South Pole friends,  
colleagues and the general public for their encouragement and best 
wishes during my ordeal,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Rockies Name Buddy Bell Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Describing himself a player's manager who will  
emphasize defense and team chemistry, Buddy Bell was hired 
Wednesday as the Colorado Rockies' new manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, 48, who managed the Detroit Tigers from 1996-98, becomes  
the third manager in the Rockies' seven-year history, succeeding 
Jim Leyland, who retired after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who worked for the Cincinnati Reds for the past year, most  
recently as director of player development, signed a three-year 
contract believed to be worth about $2.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan O'Dowd, hired as general manager a month ago, called Bell  
``the perfect fit for this ballclub. He knows the game. He knows 
how it should be played, and he will demand that from each and 
every one of our players. He understands the importance of creating 
an atmosphere where every player has the potential to play to the 
best of his ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd also promised that Bell will be surrounded with talent  
``to give Buddy the chance to put the kind of product on the field 
to realize our mission: having a championship-contending ballclub 
each and every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell didn't have those assurances in Detroit, where he guided  
the Tigers back to respectability but was fired late in his third 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished runnerup in the 1997 AL Manager of the Year  
balloting after leading the Tigers to a 79-83 record, a 26-game 
improvement over the previous year. But the Tigers cut their 
payroll for 1998, and Bell was fired on Sept. 1, 1998, after a 
52-85 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``My run in Detroit was great as long as it lasted,'' Bell said  
during a news conference. ``I think it taught me I could manage. It 
also taught me about getting along with people in the organization, 
how important scouting and player development are, the business 
side of things. Everybody has to work together. When you're a 
player, you don't necessarily understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the best fielding third basemen of his generation, Bell  
played 18 seasons in the majors for Cleveland, Texas, Cincinnati 
and Houston. A five-time All-Star, he hit .279 for his career with 
201 homers and 1,106 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell worked with O'Dowd when they were in the Cleveland  
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``My initial appeal for this job, obviously, was because of Dan  
O'Dowd,'' Bell said. ``I trust Dan's leadership, I enjoy his 
aggressiveness and I understand his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Dan O'Dowd is not the only reason that I'm here. I had  
other opportunities. I am not going to pick up my family and move 
to Colorado if I didn't think this was a great move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the negotiating process over Bell's contract, one of the  
final pieces to fall into place was Bell's willingness to move to 
Denver from his home in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies, who finished 72-90 this season, want to avoid a  
repeat of this summer when Leyland lived in the Colorado clubhouse 
while his family stayed in Pittsburgh. The Rockies also want their 
new manager to be more involved in the community and to have input 
in trade discussions and free-agent decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like players,'' Bell said. ``I prefer to give them the  
benefit of the doubt. I can be demanding at times, but I also 
understand how hard this game is to play. And I think that gives me 
a little edge on some other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said getting adjusted to the high-altitude dangers of Coors  
Field will take some time, but he has some theories. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an offensive ballpark,'' he said. ``Defense has to be  
a priority. You can't walk people, you can't make errors, you can't 
give up the extra base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is expected to retain Rockies hitting coach Clint Hurdle  
and third base coach Rich Donnelly from Leyland's staff. The team 
also has had discussions with Marcel Lachemann about becoming the 
pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need good people around me,'' Bell said. ``There are some  
guys I want to bring over here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said chemistry ``is a major part of any successful team. Look  
at the Yankees. They might not have the best talent, but they have 
the best team because they have guys who can play together. It's 
not necessarily the most talented team. I prefer that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd held interviews with several other candidates, including  
Arizona bench coach Carlos Tosca, Cincinnati coach Ken Griffey and 
Florida minor league manager Lynn Jones. O'Dowd also spoke with New 
York Yankees coach Willie Randolph by phone.

<HEADLINE> NY High School Is TV Show Setting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even for a well-adjusted homecoming king and  
queen, high school can be an emotional minefield. An acne outbreak 
that coincides with the prom, a rejection letter from your favorite 
college, friends who mock your fashion sense -- all can precipitate 
a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Now imagine those moments filmed and televised across the  
country to millions of viewers in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	Since their school was chosen as the setting for ``High  
School,'' a TV series airing on Fox next year, students in a 
Chicago suburb will have that unique experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameras are following the teen-agers through their senior year,  
and documentarian R.J. Cutler will craft their stories into a 
13-episode drama series. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutler envisions a nonfiction version of ``My So-Called Life,''  
the short-lived ABC series from 1994 that starred Claire Danes. 
While high school has long been a setting for sitcoms and dramas, 
from ``Happy Days'' to ``Dawson's Creek,'' this is something 
different. This is real life. With real kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, we had concerns,'' said Susan Benjamin, an assistant  
superintendent responsible for Highland Park High School, which is 
featured in the show. ``We wanted to make sure that he wasn't out 
to expose anyone in a negative way, to humiliate anybody. We were 
very concerned about that. He did convince us. We hope it's true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From a television standpoint, ``High School'' was inevitable. TV  
executives crave young viewers, so they're creating more shows with 
young characters. At the same time, reality-based television, like 
MTV's ``The Real World,'' is a voyeur's delight. It was only a 
matter of time before the two forms collided. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutler, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker who created ``The War  
Room,'' about President Clinton's first campaign, was looking for a 
way to combine cinema verite with a drama series. A high school 
seemed like the perfect place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that real dramas are compelling because they are real  
dramas,'' he said. ``People will recognize themselves in these 
characters far more than they recognize themselves in fictional 
dramas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cutler wanted a Midwestern school with some diversity to appeal  
to a wide audience. To woo their cooperation, he held meetings with 
Highland Park's senior class, parents and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't hurt that he promised to arrange for an independent  
study course in documentary filmmaking, taught by a college 
professor. Cutler has distributed video cameras to several students 
to help them record what's going on in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin did her own background checks to determine that Cutler  
was not a schlock filmmaker. She called former Clinton aide George 
Stephanopoulos, who raved about Cutler's work. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the students were enthusiastic, although now that a  
camera crew has been filming for a month, some have changed their 
mind -- either wanting in or wanting out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the parents were dying for their kids to get in,''  
Benjamin said. ``There were a few who thought it would be too much 
of an invasion of privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She believes the series can be an educational experience, and  
not just for her budding documentarians. It could show teen-agers 
everywhere that others share their experiences, and could reassure 
older people about what high school is like in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that what it shows is that high school is not a  
dangerous time in students' lives,'' she said. ``I think we're 
concerned that when people think of high school, they think of 
Columbine, and we don't want that image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin is wary about the impact sudden fame may have on  
Highland Park students. That's why she insisted that the focus be 
on seniors, who will have graduated by the time the series is 
aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox may be another warning sign. The network, home of the sultry  
``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' is known for its capacity to shock. This 
fall, Fox scheduled a fictional high school series, ``Manchester 
Prep,'' with a scene notorious for the suggestive language of a 
teen-age girl. It was canceled before it made the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin trusts that Cutler will turn out a classy product. ``I  
think he'd be very uncomfortable if he hurt one of the kids or 
humiliated one of the kids,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	They talk constantly, putting Benjamin in the odd position of  
learning from a TV producer in Los Angeles about the details of 
life in her school, such as the competitiveness between girls in 
the junior and senior classes. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the problems have hardly seemed insurmountable: Benjamin  
was worried that a helicopter hired for filming the homecoming 
football game would make it hard for fans to hear the marching band 
at halftime. Cutler said he's trying his best to record, but not 
intrude upon, Highland Park life. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't expect the subject matter -- the failed romances, the  
winning touchdown passes -- to surprise anyone who has been in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of coming of age is an extremely complex one and  
one I feel that is fertile ground for storytelling,'' he said. 
``Kids are very open and eager to have their stories told and the 
school was wise in sensing that it was a great opportunity to teach 
other people about what it is like to be a teen-ager today.''

<HEADLINE> Dole's Departure Frames GOP Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole's departure leaves a swiftly  
shrinking Republican presidential field with a trio of top-tier 
candidates: The front-runner. The millionaire. And the senator. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of other Republicans are seeking the White House, but  
they will struggle to compete with George W. Bush's fund-raising 
machine, Steve Forbes' personal wealth and Sen. John McCain's 
compelling prison-of-war story. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line remains money,'' said Dole, embittered by the  
cold reality of today's politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 12 Republicans who sought the presidency this year, five  
already have given up. Soon it will be six; Pat Buchanan's advisers 
say he will bolt the GOP on Monday to seek the Reform Party 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave Bush, Forbes, McCain and:  
</P>
<P>
	--Gary Bauer, a little known Washington activist who is giving  
Forbes a run for his money in the race to solidify the party's most 
conservative voters. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, a late-entry who is given little  
chance of breaking through. 
</P>
<P>
	--Broadcaster Alan Keyes, an inspiring speaker who is also a  
marginal candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a game of musical chairs, another chair has been taken  
away,'' said Republican consultant Alex Castellanos of Alexandria, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Dole's decision focuses more attention on the  
remaining candidates and we're getting closer to the inevitable 
two-way matchup. We'll have to see who it is. George W. vs. Steve 
Forbes? Or George W. vs. John McCain?'' said Castellanos, who 
worked on the 1996 presidential campaign of Dole's husband, former 
Senator Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``The contest now begins for No. 2 --the alternative to Bush,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor is likely to inherit most of Dole's  
supporters, though their number was not large enough to keep her in 
the race. Dole campaign manager, Tom Daffron, said internal polls 
showed that Bush was the second choice of her backers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could he lose? Sure,'' Daffron said. ``Is it likely? No.''  
</P>
<P>
	Yet this was not welcome news to Bush supporters, some of whom  
had quietly urged Dole to remain in the race. Her celebrity status 
helped to dilute the media's attention from the cautious 
front-runner, and her candidacy further divided anti-Bush votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor does not want to be put in the same position as  
Vice President Al Gore, who has one rival -- Bill Bradley -- sucking 
up every non-establishment vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dole getting out doesn't change the batting order of the race,  
but my sense is Bush would probably rather have four people chasing 
him than three people chasing him. The more diffuse the field, the 
harder it is for any of them to get traction,'' said Ed Gillespie, 
who worked for John Kasich until the Ohio lawmaker dropped out of 
the presidential race in July and endorsed Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Forbes will try to take advantage of the firmer  
footing. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizona senator and former prisoner of war, has  
narrowed Bush's lead in polls for New Hampshire's initial primary. 
He also is benefiting from the publicity generated by his 
best-selling autobiography and the failed fight to pass campaign 
finance reform legislation in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Money could be a problem for McCain, who has raised about $7.5  
million. Bush has raised about $57 million and Forbes has spent 
nearly $20 million of his own money, raising questions about the 
senator's staying power after the early primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	He has enough money, however, to raise alarms in the Bush  
campaign. They view him as a threat in New Hampshire and South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being outspent is one thing. Having enough money is another,''  
said New Hampshire consultant Dave Carney. With his momentum, 
McCain has enough cash to compete in a three-way race, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain hopes to benefit from an expected ad war between Bush and  
Forbes, who has a history of going negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has yet to convert his money into widespread support. The  
wealthy conservative is stuck in low single digits in national 
polls. He draws second-tier support in New Hampshire polling. 
</P>
<P>
	A multimillion-dollar advertising campaign has helped Forbes in  
Iowa, where he is a clear second to Bush in polls. He also is 
pushing a blizzard of proposals, including a major economic plan 
this week, to stand in contrast with what he considers to be a 
shallow front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the celebrity, star-quality candidacy getting out of the  
race, we're allowed some serious running room to get our message 
out,'' said senior adviser Greg Mueller. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes may be distracted, however, by the sidebar competition  
for conservatives. Bauer has raised $5.3 million and is not doing 
any worse than Forbes in national polls. Nearly half of his 
contributions have come from women, the highest percentage in the 
field and a sign that he is more likely than Forbes to pick up 
Dole's conservative supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you spent millions and millions of dollars and it hasn't  
gotten you anywhere in the polls, I don't understand why a guy like 
Forbes would be in the first tier,'' said Bauer's campaign manager, 
Frank Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer may be that Dole is right: Money is the bottom line  
in modern politics. ``Money does become the message,'' Dole said in 
her farewell address. ``And when that happens, it makes it pretty 
tough.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up, Tokyo Stock Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar gained against the yen in Tokyo today,  
boosted by new data that eased fears of inflation in the United 
States. Tokyo stocks rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 106.36 yen on the Tokyo foreign  
exchange market at 5 p.m. (4 a.m. EDT) today, up 1.00 yen from its 
level of 105.36 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 105.17 yen and 106.60 yen during the  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 280.54  
points, or 1.63 percent, to 17,534.71. On Tuesday, the average 
closed down 21.16 points, or 0.12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, concerns over inflation in the United States were  
eased by data showing the September U.S. consumer price index rose 
0.4 percent, with the core up 0.3 percent, largely in line with 
market expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar benefitted from the data, though some traders  
cautioned against taking the U.S. CPI data as a sign that the 
greenback would be firm over the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Concerns about inflation in the U.S. aren't totally gone,''  
said Takuma Kurosawa, senior dealer at Mitsubishi Trust and 
Banking. He added that lingering worries over the U.S. inflation 
outlook would limit the dollar's rise against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency traders were also eyeing the release of U.S.  
international trade data for August, which was due out later today. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 114.83 yen, up from  
114.06 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In the stock market, investors regained confidence in Japanese  
shares following Wall Street's rise Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York gains have prompted short covering and bargain  
hunting of Tokyo stocks, particularly high-technology issues,'' 
said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying by newly established investment trust funds also  
supported prices, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in brokerage companies -- namely Nomura, Nikko, and Daiwa  
Securities -- posted some of the biggest gains today ahead of their 
release of July-September earnings results Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed up 35.51 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,507.31. 
The TOPIX closed up 11.57 points, or 0.79 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 535.77 million shares, up from 486.46 million shares 
Tuesday. Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 777 to 422, while 
138 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose  
88.65 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,204.93, supported in part by 
the latest consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.8400 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.7750 percent. Its 
price fell 0.55 point to 98.80.

hunting for gophers and skunks when they were 9 or 10 years old. He 
taught the hunting safety course they needed to get their first 
big-game licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	But Christensen, the local power company manager, is also head  
of the school board. This summer, in the wake of the Columbine 
school massacre, he helped pass a resolution to use search dogs in 
the school parking lot to sniff out hidden drugs, alcohol -- and 
gunpowder. Students with a firearm face expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this caused an uproar. The possibility of expelling kids  
with a hunting rifle in the pickup didn't go over well in rural 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	The madness of Columbine, where 13 were killed in April by two  
student gunmen who then killed themselves, shocked parents and 
administrators nationwide. Many schools have cracked down on 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Conrad, a farm community of 2,900 some 50 miles north of  
Great Falls on Montana's high plains, guns are just part of growing 
up. School administrators, parents and teachers are grappling with 
how to mesh the new reality of school violence with the 
longstanding culture of hunting and guns. 
</P>
<P>
	It has not been an easy fit.  
</P>
<P>
	While hunting may be on the decline in much of the country, it  
remains strong in Montana. Of the state's nearly 900,000 residents, 
about 225,000 hold big-game licenses. Thousands will take to the 
field this weekend for the opening of Montana's big-game hunting 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,000 kids a year go through the hunter education classes.  
There are more hunters and anglers here per capita than in any 
other state -- 47 percent of men and 10 percent of women. 
</P>
<P>
	A Montana kid often owns a gun long before he's trusted with a  
car. Jody Calbas, who runs the local hardware store, said the 
typical Conrad kid may get a .22-caliber rifle, costing from $100 
to $200, at the age of 9 or 10. 
</P>
<P>
	They can plunk varmints without a license. And at age 12, after  
hunter safety class, they can go after big game with more powerful 
weapons. The first big hunting trip with dad is a traditional rite 
of passage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dangers of the outside world are intruding on Conrad,  
and the school is responding. Besides the searches, it has added 
intruder and bomb-threat drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're only as safe as our most unstable child,'' said high  
school Principal Orlen Zempel. 
</P>
<P>
	Students hanging out in front of the IGA grocery store at lunch  
in late September on Homecoming Week showed little concern, and 
said they haven't quit carrying guns. They've just quit parking in 
the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Jared Robinson, 16, a junior, said a regular group of five boys  
park at his house and walk to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do it to avoid the hassle,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Llew Jones, a parent with three boys in high school, agrees with  
the kids and calls the searches pointless. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you wanted to go into Conrad High with a gun, you could,''  
said Jones. ``They could get guns from any of a thousand places. If 
you go downtown at noon, you'd see 30 unlocked pickups with guns in 
the gun racks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people around here drive around with guns in their  
trucks, but it doesn't seem like that big a deal,'' agreed senior 
Sandra Waite, 17. ``It's so easy to get a gun around here and no 
one would think anything of it. If someone actually wanted to plan 
something, we wouldn't be suspicious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some teachers also have trouble taking the threat seriously.  
Steve Lockyer, a biology teacher for 10 years, said as he stands 
before a class, he finds it nearly inconceivable that one of the 
students could vent some hidden rage on school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not concerned. Perhaps I should be,'' he said. ``It's the  
mentality that `We're Conrad. That doesn't happen here.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But others are torn.  
</P>
<P>
	Janice Farkell, a special education teacher, said she's not  
worried about whether the dogs will zero in on her son's or 
daughter's vehicle. She expects it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live out in the country,'' she said. ``I shoot gophers out  
of the truck window myself with the .22, so there may be empty 
shell casings on the floor. That's not a big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the same breath, fear emerges.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unnerving, very emotional,'' she said. ``I know it  
could happen here. Things have changed.''

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Man Trapped in Work Elevator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nicholas White was trapped at work all weekend --  
in the office elevator. 
</P>
<P>
	The Business Week production manager said he left his office in  
the 51-floor midtown corporate tower late Friday for a cigarette 
break. A voltage dip lasting one-tenth of a second stalled his 
elevator just above the 13th floor for the next 40 hours, a 
spokeswoman for the company that runs the building said today. 
</P>
<P>
	White, 32, wasn't freed until Sunday afternoon, after a building  
employee spotted him on a security camera, said the spokeswoman, 
Sandy Manley of Rockefeller Center Management Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still a little shaky,'' White said from his second-floor  
apartment -- a walk-up -- where he was resting Tuesday. ``Of course, 
I'm relieved to be out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking only briefly about his experience, White said he  
screamed, banged on walls, pushed every button and tried to escape 
through the elevator ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Manley said she could provide no details about what happened  
in the elevator. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was freed, he refused medical attention ``and said that  
he just wanted to go home,'' Ms. Manley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller Center officials were trying to figure out how White  
could have remained unnoticed for so long.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana GOP Moves Up Caucus Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Louisiana Republicans have changed the date  
of their 2000 presidential caucuses to Jan. 15 -- nine days before 
Iowa's traditionally first-in-the-nation caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	And the date would be changed again -- even to New Year's Day --  
in the unlikely event that Iowa reschedules its Jan. 24 caucuses 
earlier in the political calendar, said Louisiana Republican 
Chairman Mike Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just keep hopping,'' Francis said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear whether major candidates -- such as the GOP  
front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush -- will campaign in 
Louisiana and eliminate criticism that the caucuses could turn into 
another embarrassment for the state. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the only candidates that participated in Louisiana's  
caucuses were Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, conservative columnist Pat 
Buchanan and conservative commentator Alan Keyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan won, but other GOP hopefuls -- including former Senate  
Majority Leader Bob Dole and publishing heir Steve Forbes -- 
boycotted in deference to Iowa's traditional leadoff role. 
</P>
<P>
	The only candidates who have campaigned in Louisiana this year  
are Buchanan, Forbes and conservative Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa last week moved its caucuses to Jan. 24 after New Hampshire  
refused repeated appeals to reschedule its Feb. 1 presidential 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Republicans had voted to hold theirs on a Saturday at  
least one week before Iowa's. Louisiana does not have to seek 
national party approval to change the dates. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unlikely that Iowa will change the date of its caucuses  
again, said Iowa Republican Chairman Kayne Robinson. ``Everyone 
seems to be pretty comfortable where we are,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Gain on Calif. Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- One wildfire was close to extinction  
while firefighters said they were gaining ground on several other 
blazes burning in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire that burned more than 26,000 acres and destroyed 69  
houses, 59 mobile homes and 300 outbuildings in Northern 
California's Shasta County, was expected to be extinguished today, 
said Don Ohrt, a spokesman for the California Department of 
Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire broke out early Saturday in a rural area near Redding,  
about 180 miles north of Sacramento. Investigators said a campfire 
may have sparked the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	In Yolo County, about 50 miles northwest of Sacramento,  
authorities said a fire that has burned at least 40,000 acres and 
destroyed one house, one cabin and five outbuildings was about 60 
percent contained. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Rumsey fire was expected to be fully contained  
today, said Bob Foley, a forestry department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fires that had scorched thousands of acres in Northern  
California also were near containment Tuesday, fire officials said.

<HEADLINE> Paint Sales Lift DuPont's Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- DuPont Co.'s third-quarter earnings rose  
11 percent, driven by an increase in sales of industrial and 
automotive paint. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest chemical company reported Wednesday that it  
had earnings from continuing operations of $625 million, or 59 
cents per share, compared with $610 million, or 53 cents per share, 
in the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The report for the July-September quarter met Wall Street  
expectations. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial 
predicted earnings of 58 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on a strong and continuing recovery in our Asian  
business and an improving outlook for Europe, we remain confident 
of double-digit earnings growth next year,'' said Charles O. 
Holliday, Jr., DuPont chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, DuPont stock slid $1.56 1/4 cents a share, or 2.5 percent,  
to $61.87 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, DuPont recorded net income of $7.5 billion for the  
quarter, an overwhelmingly majority of which was due to the 
company's successful spinoff of its energy subsidiary Conoco. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest gains for DuPont were in its Performance Coatings  
division, a new branch of the company created after the $1.9 
billion acquisition in March of Herberts, a leading German 
manufacturer of automotive and industrial paint. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont had sales of $1.6 billion in specialty coatings and  
polymers, an increase of 51 percent from the $1.07 billion in sales 
during the third quarter last year. Excluding Herberts, sales in 
the division jumped 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge in specialty paint sales helped overcome drops in  
sales of agricultural and nylon products. Agricultural sales fell 
19 percent from the year-earlier quarter to $461 million, and sales 
in nylon declined 4 percent to $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Modest gains in other segments -- pigments, polyester and  
pharmaceuticals -- helped the company post a 7 percent overall gain 
in sales to a total of $6.5 billion. Excluding Herberts, sales were 
essentially flat, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in Asia increased 26 percent, a third-quarter record for  
DuPont and a sign that the region is starting to shake off its 
economic woes, said John Himes, senior vice president for DuPont. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings from continuing operations for the first nine months of  
the year was $2.26 billion, the company said, up about 1 percent 
from the $2.23 billion for the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the first nine months this year totaled $19.8 billion,  
compared with $18.67 billion a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Fleet Boston Profit Up 41 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fleet Boston Corp. reported a 41 percent increase  
in third-quarter profits, and boosted its dividend, as Fleet 
Financial Group and BankBoston reported combined financial results 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet completed its takeover of BankBoston on Oct. 1, making the  
united bank the eighth largest in the country with 185 billion in 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet Boston earned $711 million, or 74 cents a share, beating  
analysts' expectations by a penny, according to a survey by First 
Call Corp. The strong performance was driven by growth in Latin 
American operations, investment banking fees, and interest-earning 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston-based bank earned $506 million, or 52 cents a share,  
in the third quarter last year. The year-ago results have been 
restated to reflect the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This quarter's results clearly demonstrate the diversification  
and power of Fleet Boston,'' Terrence Murray, Fleet Boston's 
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm's capital markets revenue doubled to $471 million,  
driven by robust gains in venture capital investments and fees from 
advising other companies on mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment services revenue increased 22 percent to $363  
million, led by strong commissions at Quick &AMP; Reilly, a stock 
brokerage and clearing house. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the bank named Peter Manning, a vice chairman. He  
will advise on strategic business development issues. Manning, 60, 
previously was head of mergers and acquisitions. He will be 
replaced by Brian Moynihan, 40, who was promoted to executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 was $3.4  
billion, up almost 20 percent from $2.84 billion for the year-ago 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	To reward investors, Fleet Boston raised its quarterly dividend  
by 11 percent to 30 cents a share to shareholders of record on Dec. 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading, shares of Fleet Boston were rose 43 3/4  
cents at $38 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, net income totaled $2.07  
billion, or $2.15 a share, up almost 22 percent from $1.70 billion, 
or $1.76 a share, for the first nine months of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was $10.11 billion vs. $8.57 billion.

	MIAMI (AP) -- The more Ricky Martin moved his hips, the more the  
thousands of cheering admirers roared. 
</P>
<P>
	The Latin pop star opened his North American tour Wednesday at  
Miami Arena by dancing on top of a silver convertible being driven 
in front of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, he encouraged fans to shake their hips, too,  
saying anyone can do it: ``It doesn't matter who you are, it 
doesn't matter where you come from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Introducing the song ``I Am Made of You,'' Martin discussed how  
he deals with the ``energy and euphoria'' of sudden stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	``My medicine is a higher power,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin's solo career has soared since his eye-catching  
performance of ``Livin' la Vida Loca'' at the Grammy Awards last 
February. The song was the first single from his first English 
album, now a bestseller on the U.S. charts. 
</P>
<P>
	His tour is scheduled to wrap up in Cleveland on Dec. 6.

<HEADLINE> Gore Plans Deadbeat Dad Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore urged fathers on  
Wednesday to ``step up to their responsibilities'' and pay child 
support or risk losing welfare benefits or damaging their credit 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	If they are unable to pay, the Democratic presidential candidate  
said he would seek to expand welfare programs to help them find and 
keep work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Way too many children are living without the influence of  
their fathers,'' Gore said at the Congress Heights United Methodist 
Church. ``There are too many mothers who are struggling because of 
fathers who will not step up to their responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Children and mothers are not the only ones who can benefit from  
increased paternal involvement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outside of a genuine religious experience, there is hardly  
anything that is more transforming in the life of a man than 
getting involved with his children,'' Gore said. ``It can change 
his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore laid out his ``responsible fatherhood'' package one day  
before Bill Bradley, his Democratic presidential rival. Bradley 
travels to New York on Thursday to unveil what his spokesman called 
``a comprehensive package to make a major move against child 
poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the vice president's plan also was designed to attack  
child poverty by remedying two of its biggest causes: financial and 
emotional abandonment by fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proposed giving federal child-support funds only to states  
that require all non-custodial parents -- mainly fathers -- who owe 
child support to get a job and pay up, or go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	If elected president, Gore said he also would require fathers to  
sign ``personal responsibility contracts,'' in which they would 
acknowledge paternity and pledge to work to pay child support, as a 
condition of getting aid from the Welfare to Work program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Gore's plan, the government would provide credit card  
companies with data on ``deadbeat dads'' who have not paid child 
support and urge lenders to deny them new credit cards or line of 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also referred to another group he calls ``dead broke dads''  
-- those who don't pay because they can't afford to -- his plan would 
broaden regulations allowing states to use federal welfare money to 
help them find and keep jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 welfare reform law moved millions of families off  
welfare, Gore said, but there are still many left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to lead the next generation of welfare reform that will  
ask fathers to step up to their responsibility,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also offered measures to help ensure children grow up in  
two-parent homes, including new grants to community and religious 
groups to ``help couples prepare for and strengthen their marriage, 
become better parents and reduce domestic violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president routinely pre-empts Bradley's speeches. Days  
before the former New Jersey senator unveiled an ambitious and 
expensive plan last month to provide near-universal health 
insurance, Gore rushed together a more limited health plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley press secretary Eric Hauser said it was a matter of Gore  
``agreeing with our agenda'' and lacking his own new ideas. ``The 
depth and significance of our proposals to solve big problems are 
far greater than his. That's even more clear given that a 
significant part of the announcement today are initiatives that the 
vice president already proposed,'' Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane fired back with a reference to  
Bradley's vote in the Senate in favor of President Reagan's 1981 
spending cuts. ``Al Gore's interest and commitment to strengthening 
families dates back ... to 1981 when he stayed and fought against 
the Reagan budget cuts that devastated programs for working 
families and the poor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore reached out Wednesday to key primary states even while  
campaigning in Washington. He made calls to reporters in New York 
in which he criticized Texas Gov. George W. Bush's environmental 
record. In the key state of California, a new Field Poll showed 
Gore maintaining a wide lead over Bradley among likely Democratic 
voters, 45 percent to 17 percent. That was about the same as his 51 
percent to 18 percent advantage in the same poll in August, given 
the error margin of plus or minus 6.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also spoke Wednesday with reporters in Iowa, saying an  
increasingly competitive race with Bradley wouldn't force him out 
of the political center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to cause me to change my views,'' Gore said.  
</P>
<P>
	He also assailed the Republican-controlled Congress during  
remarks at a fund-raiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
Committee, which raised $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not worthy to run the Senate. They are an  
embarrassment to the United States,'' Gore told about 1,200 party 
faithful. ``They are headed in the wrong direction -- completely -- 
on every issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president also crowed when he introduced Miss America  
Heather Renee French and announced that she had switched her voter 
registration from Republican to Democrat on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Times Mirror Earnings Rise in 3Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Times Mirror Co. reported higher  
third-quarter earnings Wednesday, reflecting strong gains in 
advertising and lower newsprint costs for its newspaper publishing 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Mirror earned $56.9 million from continuing operations in  
the third quarter, or 73 cents per share, compared to $55.2 
million, or 58 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 9 percent to $739.7 million from $677.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits from the company's newspaper publishing and  
professional information units each rose 20 percent and included 
advertising gains at the company's flagship newspaper, the Los 
Angeles Times, as well as East Coast papers such as The Baltimore 
Sun and Newsday. 
</P>

	Earnings per share topped the 69 cent forecast of analysts  
surveyed by First Call/Thompson Financial. Times Mirror shares rose 
$2.12 1/2 or 3 percent to $70.12 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had a one-time gain a year ago of $1.08 billion, or  
$12.17 per share, on the disposal of discontinued operations, 
including legal publishers Matthew Bender and Shepard's. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month earnings from continuing operations were $180.9  
million, or $2.24 per share, excluding a nonrecurring gain on the 
sale of an online venture. That compares with $171 million, or 
$1.74 per share for the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Several businesses that have been put up for sale were reported  
as discontinuing operations. Those subsidiaries include 
AchieveGlobal, a professional training company; Allen 
Communication, which produces interactive software and job training

</P>
<P>
	Times Mirror also is selling The Sporting News, but it did not

<HEADLINE> 3rd Day of Racing in America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Dennis Conner, sailing in his  
eighth America's Cup, won both of his races today on the third day 
of the America's Cup challenger series. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's America True also had a notable victory after an  
intense tacking duel with Hawaii's Abracadabra 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Killer whales frolicked in Auckland's inner harbor as northerly  
wind on the two challenger courses further out on Hauraki Gulf 
increased from 10 knots in the morning to more than 20 in the 
afternoon, the most consistent breeze in the competition so far. 
</P>
<P>
	In the morning races, Prada defeated the Spanish challenge by 1  
minute, 2 seconds; Stars and Stripes defeated Nippon by 1 minute, 
14 seconds; Young America defeated Le Defi Francais by 2 minutes, 4 
seconds; America True defeated Abracadabra by 26 seconds; and Young 
Australia defeated Fast 2000 by 12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, AmericaOne defeated Le Defi Francais by 1  
minute, 26 seconds; Nippon defeated Young Australia by 1 minute, 52 
seconds; the Spanish challenge defeated Abracadabra by 43 seconds; 
Prada defeated America True by 1 minute, 25 seconds; and Stars and 
Stripes defeated Fast 2000 by 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	In a morning of tight racing for all but the top favorites,  
America True, with the only woman skipper of the competition in 
Dawn Riley, and Abracadabra 2000 tacked more than 60 times on the 
second windward leg before the San Franciscans scraped over the 
line for their second victory of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Conner's Stars and Stripes, with half the budget and half the  
number of boats of his rival, led the $20 million, two-boat Nippon 
team at all four marks in a close race in the morning, crossing the 
line more than one minute ahead. The San Diego team then beat the 
struggling Swiss syndicate in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon had two penalties in its race against Conner, and bowman  
Toshiki Shibata was badly injured the afternoon race when a clip on 
a spinnaker pole sprang open, sending the heavy beam crashing down 
on his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was knocked unconscious straight away,'' skipper Peter  
Gilmour said. ``It appears he has a broken nose and lost several 
teeth, possibly a broken jaw and, we're hoping, no spinal 
injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian Prada team and the New York Yacht Club's Young  
America again had easy victories, while Australia, with the 
youngest team, smallest budget and oldest boat, posted its first 
victory of the series, also over the Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada has six victories in as many starts. Paul Cayard's  
AmericaOne and Ed Baird's Young America also were perfect, each 
5-for-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars and Stripes finished the day with 3 points, tying  
Abracadabra behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races over four months, the 11 challenger teams  
score one point for each victory in the first of three 
round-robins, four points in the second and nine in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of a finals series will meet Team New Zealand in a  
best-of-9 regatta starting in February 2000 for sailing's most 
prized trophy, the America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Trade Dykhuis to Montreal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers on Wednesday traded  
defenseman Karl Dykhuis to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for 
future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Flyers this week signed Ulf Samuelsson and had a  
surplus of defensemen, the team sent Dykhuis to Montreal and placed 
defenseman Luke Richardson on waivers, general manager Bob Clarke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykhuis, 27, had one assist and six penalty minutes in five  
games with the Flyers this season. In 227 NHL games with the 
Flyers, Dykhuis had 13 goals, 41 assists for 54 points and 211 
penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykhuis was acquired from Tampa Bay last December in exchange  
for Petr Svoboda.

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Louisiana Republicans have changed the date  
of their presidential caucuses to Jan. 15, so the contest that was 
an embarrassment in 1996 takes place nine days before Iowa's 
traditional first-in-the-nation caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	And the date could be changed again in the unlikely event that  
Iowa reschedules its Jan. 24 caucuses even earlier, said Louisiana 
Republican Chairman Mike Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just keep hopping,'' Francis said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Iowa last week moved its caucuses to Jan. 24 after New Hampshire  
refused to reschedule its Feb. 1 presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The change had Iowa before Louisiana, but Louisiana Republicans  
had voted to hold their contest on a Saturday at least one week 
before Iowa. Louisiana does not have to seek national party 
approval to change caucus dates. 
</P>
<P>
	It remained unclear whether major candidates, such as Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush, will campaign in Louisiana and eliminate criticism 
that the caucuses could turn into another embarrassment for the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	The only candidates who participated in 1996 were Texas Sen.  
Phil Gramm, commentator Pat Buchanan and anti-abortion candidate 
Alan Keyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan won, but other GOP hopefuls, including former Senate  
Majority Leader Bob Dole and publisher Steve Forbes, boycotted in 
deference to Iowa's traditional leadoff contest. 
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley  
on Wednesday said the Navy should stop using the Puerto Rican 
island of Vieques for live-fire testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The humanitarian and environmental destruction caused by naval  
activities on Vieques is unaccpetable,'' said Bradley, a former 
senator. ``And economic development of the island has become 
impossible to sustain as a result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential panel recommended Monday that the Navy be allowed  
to resume live-fire training on the island, but that it abandon the 
range in about five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley previously has said he was ``troubled'' by the training  
on Vieques, but would await the panel's recommendation before 
taking a stand on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, campaigning for a possible  
Senate bid in New York, called Monday for an ``immediate and 
permanent end'' to training on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- As his good friend abandoned her bid for  
the presidency, former President Gerald Ford said he was bothered 
by the cost of seeking elected office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It costs much too much to run,'' Ford said after a speech at  
Ohio State University on Wednesday -- the same day Elizabeth Dole 
said she was giving up her bid for the Republican presidential 
nomination, citing insufficient funds to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Elizabeth Dole made a strong effort,'' said Ford,  
who picked Dole's husband Bob as his running mate in 1976. 
``Unfortunately, she didn't catch fire, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gathered she looked at the polls and surveys, saw the money  
she needed, and said as a realist that she had no choice but to 
withdraw,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said that until the Supreme Court rules declares limits on  
campaign spending constitutional, there isn't much Congress can do 
about the cost of running for office.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Two-time AL batting champion Edgar Martinez, who  
was eligible for free agency, agreed Wednesday to a $5.9 million, 
one-year contract with the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old designated hitter, who made $3.5 million this  
year, gets a $150,000 signing bonus and a $5.25 million salary next 
season. The Mariners have a $5.5 million option for 2001 with a 
$500,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez has led the Mariners in batting six times, including  
the past three years. He finished fourth in the league this season 
with a .337 average, raising his career mark to .320. 
</P>
<P>
	He has spent his entire career with Seattle, since signing as a  
free agent in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martinez is a true professional hitter,'' Mariners manager Lou  
Piniella said. ``He hits to all fields, he hits for power, he 
drives in runs and he gets on base. He's a key part of our offense 
and I'm pleased to have him back.''

<HEADLINE> Giants Sign Kicker Blanchard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Giants signed former  
Jets kicker Cary Blanchard on Wednesday, two days after Brad 
Daluiso tore a knee ligament on the final play of a game against 
the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanchard has played eight years in the NFL, most recently with  
the Washington Redskins last season, where he made 11 of 17 field 
goal attempts and 30 of 31 extra point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, Blanchard has made 131 of 170 field goals.  
His longest field goal is 54 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Blanchard kicked for the Jets during the 1992  
and 1993 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm used to the stadium,'' said Blanchard, ``but I'm a little  
bit more mature now since it was my first couple of years in, so I 
have to do better than I did back then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blanchard tried out for the team Wednesday under windy and rainy  
conditions. He beat out three other kickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went real good out here, considering the weather,''  
Blanchard said. ``I think that's one of the reasons why they had me 
in here because I had dealt with the stadium before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blanchard said also tried out for Chicago last week.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Daluiso kicked a 22-yard, game-winning field goal to  
lead the Giants to a 13-10 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. But 
Daluiso tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while 
trying to make a tackle on a kickoff to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is that I walked off the field, got into the tunnel  
and was told I needed an X-ray,'' Daluiso said on Wednesday. ``I 
don't know why I just didn't sit there because it hurt like crazy, 
but I didn't think I knew what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daluiso is scheduled to have surgery in the next few weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Blanchard said he was happy to get the opportunity to play for  
the Giants, but felt bad about what happened to Daluiso. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Brad, he's a good friend of mine, and I've known him  
for quite a long time,'' said Blanchard. ``But we've got 10 games 
left in the season, so let's get to the playoffs. I'll do my job 
now and make my field goals.''

<HEADLINE> Investors Win in Online Trade Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors are emerging as the winners in an  
increasingly competitive race on Wall Street to provide low-cost, 
online brokerage services. 
</P>
<P>
	One after another, the big name brokerage houses are scrambling  
to offer a wide range of online services to compete with discount 
firms that offer Internet stock trading at a small fraction of 
traditional brokerage commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is that fees are being restructured -- mostly downward  
-- to cater to a growing variety of investor trading practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Easy access via personal computers to both online stock trading  
systems and market information has unleashed a wave of competition 
that has helped reduce brokerage fees, said John Markese, president 
of the American Association of Individual Investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The success of Charles Schwab and other online discount  
brokerages has overwhelmed the full-service brokerage industry,'' 
said Markese. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors who once relied on a broker for advice on which stocks  
to buy -- and paid him hundreds of dollars for every trade -- can now 
do themselves it on the Internet for $10 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this trading revolution, the full-service firms have  
moved slowly into online trading for fear of cannibalizing their 
lucrative brokerage businesses -- up until now. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., the second  
largest United States brokerage firm, became the latest 
full-service firm to unveil a tiered fee system for its customers 
who want to trade online, but also may sometimes want the advice 
and service of a traditional stock broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley will charge $29.95 for each unassisted online  
trade, and $39.95 for online trades assisted by a broker. Customers 
can also choose to pay a flat annual fee -- based on the size of 
their trading account -- and get an unlimited number of trades. Or, 
they can continue to pay traditional fees for full brokerage 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the plan, Morgan Stanley's existing Discovery  
Brokerage Direct discount unit will be blended into the firm's new 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online business. The new services begin 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Salomon Smith Barney Inc., Prudential  
Securities Inc. and PaineWebber Group have all either announced or 
begun offering similar services with comparable fee structures. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the names are impressive, analysts say these firms are  
merely playing catch-up to independent brokers and financial 
planners who have offered low-cost, do-it-yourself plans for years 
-- even before the Internet allowed individual investors to with the 
click of a mouse button. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, independent brokers have offered flat annual fees  
since the early 1990s. In addition, the independents have slashed 
their own commissions by using discount trading services such as 
Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity Investments instead of the big 
Wall Street brokerage houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Pomeranz, an independent investment adviser in Boca  
Raton, Fla., said it is no longer practical for a broker to provide 
investing advice to clients who don't want or need it. Information 
on stocks can all be found on the Internet and so many investors no 
longer rely on a broker for trading decisions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly five years Pomeranz has charged his clients a flat  
annual fee -- about 2 percent of a client's account assets -- for 
stock trading. Those who want his advice pay extra. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of separating fees for advice and trading is now  
spreading to the large Wall Street firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big brokerage houses are being forced into this kicking  
and screaming by competition,'' said William Berg, president of 
Sigma Investment Management, a Portland, Ore., investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of their strategy to capture online customers, the big  
Wall Street firms are now undercutting the flat annual fees charged 
by independent brokers. Salomon Smith Barney, for example, charges 
between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent of a customer's account assets 
for unlimited trading, as opposed to the 2 percent charged by most 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fees charged by independent brokers are about to come  
under attack,'' said Steve Galbraith, a brokerage firm analyst at 
New York investment bank Sanford Bernstein. ``It was a good gig 
while it lasted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which means the costs to investors will continue to fall, as the  
independents scramble to keep pace with their competitors on Wall 
Street.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier Heads to S. Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- With Russian forces closing in on  
Chechnya's capital, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin headed to a 
neighboring region today for a closer look at the military 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin, who has seen his popularity soar since Russia sent troops  
into Chechnya last month, first visited an air force base to meet 
pilots carrying out airstrikes in Chechnya, Russian news agencies 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister said the effective air campaign meant that  
the Russians did not have to expose large number of ground troops 
to attack in Chechnya. His itinerary called for stops in the 
southern towns of Krasnodar and Mozdok, both to the west of 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister also planned to discuss the refugee crisis in  
southern Russia. More than 160,000 people have streamed out of 
Chechnya since the fighting started three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the refugees are camping out in Ingushetia, which  
borders Chechnya to the west, and local authorities have pleaded 
for more assistance before winter sets in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The position of the refugees is disastrous,'' Yuri Yezhov, of  
the Russian Red Cross, told the ITAR-Tass news agency. Yezhov 
accompanied a shipment of 3,500 winter jackets for the refugees, 
but said the most critical shortage was a lack of tents. 
</P>
<P>
	As refugees continued to flee Chechnya, Russian forces  
consolidated positions outside the capital and kept up bombing 
raids throughout the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian warplanes flew 15 combat missions over the previous 24  
hours, the military said today. The military claimed that about 50 
rebels were killed, but the figures could not be independently 
confirmed, and both sides routinely exaggerate the casualties 
suffered by their enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian troops are concentrated to the north and west of the  
capital, and are as close as 10 miles to Grozny, with units perched 
on a ridge overlooking the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have indicated that they are not planning to storm  
Grozny, a move that resulted in heavy casualties during the 1994-96 
war in Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians say their operation has two main aims -- to create a  
security zone around Chechnya and eliminate militants who invaded 
the neighboring territory of Dagestan this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin called top government officials to his  
country residence today to discuss Russia's military action in 
Chechnya. Spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin declined to give any details 
of the meeting, which took place at Yeltsin's retreat north of 
Moscow, where the president is still recovering from the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian forces entered Chechnya on Sept. 30, quickly seizing the  
northern third of the breakaway region, and have been building up 
their forward positions near Grozny over the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
	The outnumbered militants are concentrated around Grozny and did  
not put up heavy resistance when Russian armored columns rolled 
across the open plains of northern Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the militants are skilled guerrilla fighters, and  
repeatedly inflicted heavy losses on the Russians in the previous 
war during street fighting in the cities, and in the hills and 
forests in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	While the previous war was hugely unpopular in Russia, the  
Russian public has generally been supportive of the current 
campaign, which was launched after a series of apartment bombings 
in September that left 300 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians blame Islamic militants for the bombings, but  
Chechen warlords have denied any involvement in the attacks.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Suit on Police Frisking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge on Wednesday refused to toss out  
a class action lawsuit alleging that police officers in the city's 
Street Crime Unit subject people in high-crime areas to frisks 
based on their race or ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed on behalf of six black and Hispanic men  
between the ages of 23 and 31, seeks to eliminate frisks that occur 
without probable cause. It also seeks unspecified monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
	It was filed after four police officers were accused of fatally  
shooting an unarmed East African immigrant 19 times outside his 
home in February during a search for a rape suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin said Wednesday that the  
police department's ``pervasive pattern of unconstitutional stops 
and frisks has allegedly affected tens of thousands of New York 
City residents, most of whom have been black and Latino men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the city did not immediately return a call seeking  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorean Currency Value Sliding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- This small Andean nation watched with  
alarm Wednesday as the value of its currency continued to spiral 
against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of Ecuador's sucre opened Wednesday at 18,250 to the  
dollar, down from 17,500 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago, the sucre's value stood at 10,500 to the  
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a group of businesses that are thinking about closing  
until the situation improves,'' said Francisco Alarcon, president 
of the Industrial Chamber of Guayaquil, a coastal city that 
constitutes Ecuador's financial hub. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have received hundreds of calls from affiliates in recent  
days complaining because they are losing enormous sums of money,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuadorean Central Bank President Pablo Better blamed the  
devaluation on ``political speculation,'' and said the sucre's true 
value should be about 12,500 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial analysts said the currency's tumble was primarily  
caused by Congress' refusal to approve President Jamil Mahuad's 
budget proposal for next year, which includes austerity measures 
and tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement with the International Monetary Fund, expected to  
trigger $1.25 billion in international aid, hinges on Ecuador's 
ability to get a handle on its spiraling economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial experts also blamed the currency fall on Ecuador's  
crushing foreign debt and its struggle to reach an accord with 
foreign creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing it's worst economic crisis in decades, the nation of 12  
million people became the first country ever to default on its 
Brady bonds on Sept. 28 when it missed a $44.5 million interest 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady bonds, named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas  
Brady, were created to resolve the Latin American debt crisis of 
the 1980s. The plan repackaged defaulted bank loans into 
publicly-traded bonds, some backed by the U.S. Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Creditors last month rejected Ecuador's pleas for more time to  
renegotiate its $6 billion in partly U.S.-guaranteed Brady bond 
debt and instead demanded immediate repayment of $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahuad's government is still trying to negotiate a debt  
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's total public debt is $13 billion and is expected to  
top 117 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Trump's Divorce: A Campaign Issue? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was once just tabloid fodder, but Donald  
Trump's divorce with Marla Maples could become a thorny political 
issue if the billionaire developer decides to run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for both sides were in court Tuesday over Trump's threat  
to withhold a $1.5 million alimony payment over Maples' statements 
in a London newspaper that she'll tell the world ``what he is 
really like'' if Trump seeks the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump's lawyers contended Maples violated an agreement that  
barred her from speaking publicly about the details of the 
marriage. But a judge declined to consider the motion, and Trump 
agreed to pay the alimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump attorney Jay Goldberg said the developer did not intend to  
withhold the payment, but wanted to send a message that ``she was 
playing close to the fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump added that, ``Nothing she could have said would have hurt  
me politically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sniping came as Trump considers having his name placed on  
the March 7 California primary ballot as a Reform Party 
presidential candidate. The state has a Nov. 1 deadline -- one of 
the earliest in the nation -- for would-be candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Maples' attorney, William Beslow, said Trump's  
lawyers were simply trying to silence his client. 
</P>
<P>
	``One has to ask, 'Why now are Mr. Trump's representatives  
maligning Ms. Maples?' and the truth is clear,'' Beslow said. 
``They're hoping to discredit Ms. Maples ... so that if she chooses 
to say anything in the future, Mr. Trump can shrug it off as the 
words of an angry person whose intelligence should be questioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump's lawyers called Maples a vengeful woman who wasn't smart  
enough for Trump and is exploiting her ties to him in hopes of 
gaining money and attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 15 minutes of glory ended when she left Donald's side,''  
Goldberg said. ``So this is a perfect way to attract publicity. ... 
All of her actions stand for the proposition 'Hell hath no fury 
like a woman scorned.'''

<HEADLINE> French LVMH Expands Watch Holdings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton has bought Swiss  
watchmaker Ebel and prestigious Parisian jeweler Chaumet, further 
expanding its portfolio of watches, the French luxury goods group 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH did not disclose terms of the deal. It had been the  
front-runner in the race for Ebel after rival Swiss watch company 
Swatch Group dropped out of the race because it found the asking 
price too high. 
</P>
<P>
	The French group bought Ebel and Chaumet from the Anglo-Bahraini  
investment fund InvestCorp. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault had expressed his desire to take  
the French luxury goods group into watches. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase of Ebel and Chaumet follows LVMH's decision to  
launch a friendly takeover bid for the Swiss sports watchmaker Tag 
Heuer International. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals are the latest elements of a buying spree at LVMH that  
last week included the purchase, along with Italian fashion group 
Prada Holdings, of a majority stake in Fendi, the Rome-based furs 
and handbags house. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH is thought to have edged out a number of other potential  
suitors for Ebel and Chaumet. As well as Swatch, investment group 
Vendome was said to have been interested in Ebel. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in the Swiss town of Chaux-de-Fonds, Ebel produces around  
120,000 watches a year, both under its own name and on behalf of 
Paris-based jeweler Cartier. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaumet, a jeweler-watchmaker based in Paris, has its own shops  
in London and Monte Carlo as well as in the French capital. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, LVMH director-general Myron Ullman said that the  
purchase of Ebel and Chaumet will strengthen the company's position 
in the jewelry-watchmaking sector. 
</P>
<P>
	InvestCorp is thought to have favored the LVMH bid for Ebel  
because the French firm was ready to bid simultaneously for 
Chaumet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anglo-Bahraini investment fund has owned Ebel since 1994 and  
Chaumet since 1987.

<HEADLINE> Solution to N.D. Scab Problem Eyed / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- Researchers have successfully crossed  
varieties of durum wheat with wild grasses to produce fertile, 
scab-resistant durum hybrids. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the research is a significant step in finding a  
long-term solution to the region's scab problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a very significant, important development toward  
breeding for scab resistance,'' said Prem Jauhar, a research 
geneticist at Fargo's Northern Crop Science Laboratory. ``But I 
must caution that as exciting at it is, we are far from ready to 
release (resistant varieties). We have a lot more work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fusarium head blight, commonly known as scab, is a fungal  
disease that has caused an estimated $2.6 billion in lost crops 
between 1991 and 1997. Scab shrivels kernels of wheat and barley. 
The disease also produces toxins that can make the grain unsuitable 
for food and animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauhar, who is heading a team through the U.S. Agriculture  
Department's Agricultural Research Service, said researchers found 
two wild grasses, both distant relatives of wheat, that are 
naturally resistant to scab. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main idea of our research was to see if we could transfer  
that resistance to the durum,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To do so, researchers crossed two commercial durum varieties,  
Lloyd and Langdon -- neither of which is resistant to scab -- with 
the wild grasses. Jauhar said some of these crosses produced high 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Those hybrids were then crossed again with durum, producing  
fertile, scab-resistant hybrids that carry all the important 
chromosome characteristics of the original durum. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauhar said additional research is under way to ensure that the  
resistance will be transferred to the next generations of the 
hybrid. 
</P>
<P>
	Elias Elias, a durum breeder at North Dakota State University,  
said that while Jauhar's research is encouraging, commercially 
available durum varieties derived from the research could be a 
decade away or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next step would be to ensure the quality of the durum is  
there,'' he said.

	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Many farm families who lost their livelihood  
during the farm crisis of the 1980s showed signs of emotional and 
financial recovery within about four years, an Iowa State 
University study found. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the researchers said the study, to be featured early next  
year in the journal ``Rural Sociology,'' can send a positive 
message to today's financially strapped farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the displaced farm families had an incredible rate of  
recovery,'' said Fred Lorenz, an ISU professor in sociology and 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers studied 450 families from eight counties in  
west-central Iowa. The families all had two children and included 
families that had been displaced from a farm, families that were 
still farming and rural families whose livelihoods did not depend 
on the farm, Lorenz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The families were studied from 1989 to 1992, and again in 1994.  
Of the 450 families studied, about 60 had lost their farms in the 
crisis, Lorenz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after losing the farm, the displaced families had  
the highest level of stressful events, such as marital problems and 
trouble with their children, and depressive symptoms, Lorenz said. 
That group also had the lowest income level, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the researchers revisited the families each year over the  
next three years, the number of stressful events and depressive 
symptoms dropped off, Lorenz said. And in 1994 -- the last year the 
families were studied -- the income of the displaced farm families 
was up to the average of the non-farm families in the study, and 
depressive symptoms and negative events were on average lower than 
the other groups in the study, he said.

<HEADLINE> CONGRESS NOTEBOOK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats expect Hillary Rodham Clinton to  
raise millions of dollars to finance her still-unannounced campaign 
for a Senate seat from New York. Now Republicans are hoping she'll 
help raise some money for them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Republican Senatorial Committee recently unveiled a  
new feature on its Web site devoted to casting the first lady in an 
unfavorable light -- and seeking campaign contributions to ``Stop 
Hillary Now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said that given  
the Republicans' negative reaction to her potential candidacy, 
``I'm surprised it took them so long to get into cyberspace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using the image of a well-known political figure of the opposing  
party isn't a new technique for fund-raisers. With Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy, D-Mass., as their foil, Republicans have solicited 
contributions for years. Democrats used former Speaker Newt 
Gingrich to raise millions for their own causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, in fact, appeared on the GOP's Hillary Clinton Web  
page. A photograph showed the two of them smiling at one another at 
a recent joint appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate formally buried campaign finance legislation  
Wednesday, voting 52-48 to move on to other business. Supporters of 
the measure didn't give up easily, though. They forced a second 
roll call on the subject that failed to reverse the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate, which lasted several days, underscored for the  
fourth consecutive year the difficulty of passing legislation 
curtailing the role of money in politics over the objections of the 
GOP leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, supporters posted 52 votes on an attempt to choke  
off a GOP filibuster. This year, they whittled down their bill in a 
concession designed to peel away Republicans. On the key vote 
Tuesday, they had 53 votes, one more than a year ago. Three 
Republicans joined them, but two of last year's supporters jumped 
off the bill, saying it didn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle launched an attack  
Wednesday on Republicans, accusing the GOP of ``anti-minority 
sentiment'' of historic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle, D-S.D., cited as evidence the Senate's rejection of  
Ronnie White, a black nominated to a judgeship; a disputed 
provision in pending banking legislation designed to protect 
minorities; the Senate's refusal to allow a vote on a Hispanic 
judicial nominee, Richard Paez, for more than three years; and a 
looming fight over former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun's nomination to 
be ambassador to New Zealand. Moseley-Braun is the only black woman 
ever elected to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never seen a party become this defiant when it comes to  
protecting minority rights in my time in public life,'' Daschle 
said at his regular news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In rebuttal, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., noted the Senate had confirmed three judges in the past 10 
days. ``They've been approved based on the content of their 
character and their record, and not on the color of their skin,'' 
said the aide, John Czwartacki, paraphrasing Martin Luther King 
Jr.'s memorable 1963 speech on civil rights delivered at the 
Lincoln Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing politics with race doesn't heal any wounds. It only  
reopens them,'' Czwartacki added. In a reference to Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas' bitter confirmation battle, he said he 
found the Democratic attack ironic, coming from a party ``that 
attempted a high-tech lynching of the Supreme Court's only African 
American justice.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Death Row Inmate To Sue Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man who spent 15 years on death row only to  
have his conviction erased by a college journalism class 
investigation asked the state Wednesday to pay him for his prison 
time, and plans to sue city police for millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Porter, 44, could get $144,000 or more, said his  
attorney, Daniel Sanders. He said that wouldn't cover the agony of 
sitting on death row waiting to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt that you could ask anybody to go into that situation  
for $140,000,'' Sanders said after filing papers with the Court of 
Claims, part of the executive branch of state government. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois law limits how much former inmates can collect for  
wrongful imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said, however, that he will sue the Chicago police  
within weeks, accusing them of framing Porter. He said winning that 
case could result in damages of ``several million'' dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter spent 15 years behind bars for a double murder in 1982.  
He was released from prison in February after another man, Alstory 
Simon, confessed to the killings under questioning by a private 
investigator working with a Northwestern University journalism 
class.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Sales Up 12 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG's automobile sales rose 12  
percent to $79 billion for the first nine months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In a simultaneous announcement in Stuttgart, Germany, and a  
motor show in Tokyo, the company said Wednesday it sold 3.2 million 
cars, minivans, sport-utility vehicles and pickups from January 
through September. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Karl Malone Says He's Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone will play through pain, not  
when he's hurt. Right now, Malone is hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Jazz forward, out with a lower back strain sustained  
Oct. 6 during training camp, made the distinction in a story in 
Wednesday's Deseret News. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season's NBA MVP wouldn't say if he would be back before  
Utah's regular-season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I can come back, I'll come back,'' Malone said Tuesday,  
hours before the Jazz left without him on a three-game exhibition 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can play with pain. I have all my career. But I'm not gonna  
play hurt. It's like anything else. A lot of times you think you're 
Superman and you can do everything. I think after a while you get 
smarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hurting his back, Malone continued to practice at training  
camp. He played in a scrimmage Oct. 9 but hasn't returned, missing 
practice and three exhibition games since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the Jazz said Malone would play in the first  
exhibition game. Malone said he has ignored subsequent speculation 
that his injury was worse than disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone has missed only three games because of injuries during  
his 14-year NBA career. He hasn't sat out with an injury since 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials have classified his back inury as a muscle strain  
but Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, called it a swollen disc. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone was asked if it's in his best interest to practice or  
play in exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kills me not being with my teammates,'' he said. ``It kills  
me not going to games. It kills me for a lot of reasons. But you 
also want to have a healthy, normal life when this is over with, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, 36, signed a four-year, $67 million contract in August.

<HEADLINE> Few Small Businesses Bank Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When it comes to exposure for the smallest of  
small business owners, the Internet is fast becoming an 
indispensable tool. 
</P>
<P>
	Where else can someone working out of the family kitchen or den  
gain ready access to a global marketplace, locate the least 
expensive goods or services in an instant, or spy on the 
competition? 
</P>
<P>
	Yet while business owners have been quick to recognize the many  
virtues of the Internet for growing their companies, fewer feel as 
comfortable handling company finances online. At least that's the 
conclusion of a new survey commissioned by Chicago-based Bank One 
Corp., one that echoes past surveys on Internet banking and small 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 6 percent of the 300 owners of small businesses -- that is,  
businesses with 10 or fewer employes -- questioned by telephone this 
summer said they banked through the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven percent said they planned to begin online banking in the  
next 12 months. However, with a margin of error of plus or minus 
six percentage points, that's nothing to bank on right now. 
</P>
<P>
	The folks at Bank One, and at other financial institutions,  
think all that will change in the next decade -- just as customers 
have grown readily accustomed to using Automated Teller Machines 
since the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you use an ATM card, you're already banking online  
basically,'' said Bill Schumer, national small business banking 
marketing manger for Bank One, which recently launched a new line 
of small business products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once small businesses get up to speed (with online usage),  
they'll be doing their banking online, too. If small businesses 
adopt online banking at the rate they say they will, this will be 
explosive growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is reason for bankers to be optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	The potential is certainly there. Nearly half of all small  
businesses already have online access, the Bank One poll also 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-one percent regularly use e-mail to conduct business,  
while about 20 percent have their own Web sites. In addition, 16 
percent regularly use the Internet to buy products while 12 percent 
sell online. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, 60 percent of the small business Internet users  
said they saw an increase in profits by going online. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most small businesses use the Web for marketing; it's a  
24-hour billboard for their business,'' said Jane Applegate, who 
runs a small business consulting firm in Pelham, N.Y., and has 
written several books on small business. 
</P>
<P>
	``A small company can now do business globally and compete with  
a big company because no one has to know how small you are. Your 
business is based on talent rather than size of your office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest draw of online banking, Applegate says, will be the  
convenience -- in tracking accounts, transferring funds or paying 
bills without leaving the office. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, the small businesses surveyed by Bank One said that  
if they had more time on their hands, they would be better able to 
expand their operations and attend their customers. Eighteen 
percent said their most time-consuming task was trips to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banks are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to protect  
the system and be better prepared,'' said Applegate. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, though, have been criticized for failing to adequately  
address small business' needs online. 
</P>
<P>
	A study last year by the Cambridge, Mass., advisory firm  
Mainspring found that while the top 25 banks have undertaken more 
than 1,000 Internet initiatives, most still didn't deliver what it 
deemed sufficient value. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no clear industry standard for packaging and pricing  
online banking services, according to the Mainspring study. The 
amount banks charge small businesses for online services range from 
no fee to $35 per month, and while some banks give away personal 
computer banking software, others charge as much as $99, it said.

<HEADLINE> Restorers Work on Elgin Marbles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Restorers began a three-year project  
Wednesday to preserve parts of a Parthenon frieze whose other 
sections are being sought from Britain to reunite the marble 
figures that once adorned the 2,500-year-old temple. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 15 blocks on the original 528-foot western frieze  
known as the Panathenaic Procession, which includes depictions of 
the gods favoring Athenians who defeated Persian forces at the 
Battle of Marathon in 490 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the frieze's sections were taken in the early 19th  
century by Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman 
Empire, and are now on display at the British Museum in London. 
</P>
<P>
	The return of the blocks and the rest of the British Museum's  
Parthenon antiquities, widely known as the Elgin Marbles, has 
become an issue of national pride for Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	British officials have refused the appeals, but a parliamentary  
committee ``decided in principle'' on Wednesday to look into issues 
involving the return of cultural property. 
</P>
<P>
	During the next two years, the remaining 13 blocks -- which were  
taken off the Parthenon in 1993 and put in the Acropolis Museum -- 
will be cleared of any remnants from past restoration efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The final year of the project will be spent cleaning the  
surface, which has suffered from centuries of erosion and pollution 
damage. Experts will study whether to use state-of-the-art laser 
cleaning techniques or other methods, media reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	A book last year by British historian William St. Clair claimed  
that British Museum workers in the 1930s used metal scrapers in an 
effort to whiten the Elgin Marbles, irreparably damaging the patina 
in places.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Reveals Weapons Locations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon for the first time has revealed  
where it stored nuclear weapons abroad during the Cold War, 
including unarmed submarine-seeking depth bombs in Cuba during the 
1962 missile crisis with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of nine places where bombs or bomb components minus  
their nuclear charges were located between 1951 and 1977 are 
revealed in a newly declassified official Pentagon history. The 
names of 18 other locations were blacked out by government censors 
before the document was released to Robert S. Norris, a private 
specialist on nuclear weapons and author of numerous books on the 
topic. 
</P>
<P>
	Using other documents, Norris and two colleagues said they could  
identify 17 of the 18 unnamed locations, ringing the globe from 
Canada to Iceland to Morocco and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine nuclear weapon locations named in the Pentagon document  
are Cuba, Puerto Rico, Britain, West Germany, the U.S. territories 
of Guam, Johnston Island and Midway, and Alaska and Hawaii, both 
U.S. territories in the early years of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with material blacked out, the ``History of the Custody and  
Deployment of Nuclear Weapons,'' published in February 1978 as a 
top secret document, ``shows a huge expanse of nuclear weapons 
around the globe,'' Norris said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The narrative portion of the Pentagon history makes no reference  
to U.S. nuclear weapons in Cuba, but an appendix listing locations 
outside the continental United States says an unspecified number of 
``non-nuclear depth bombs'' were stored in Cuba between December 
1961 and July-September 1963. The crisis over the Soviet Union 
trying to put surface-to-air nuclear missiles in Cuba was in 
October 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	The term ``non-nuclear'' referred to components, such as bomb  
casings or assemblies, for nuclear weapons, the report said. At 
that time, bomb design technology required that the actual nuclear 
charge, or capsule, be kept separate from the non-nuclear assembly. 
In the event of war, capsules could be flown to bases where they 
would be inserted into the assemblies to make complete bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Depth bombs were weapons dropped from airplanes or helicopters  
to dive into the sea to kill submarines. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham Allison, a former Pentagon official and expert on the  
Cuban missile crisis, said in a telephone interview he was not 
aware that nuclear weapon components had been stored in Cuba. He 
said they probably were at Guantanamo Bay, a U.S. Navy base on the 
eastern tip of the island. During the Cuban missile crisis the Navy 
searched intensively for Soviet submarines in the Atlantic, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Details about locations of American nuclear weapons abroad are  
among the most closely protected Pentagon secrets. Today the only 
remaining full-time U.S. nuclear deployments outside the United 
States are in Europe, where bombs are stored for potential use by 
U.S. Air Force planes based there. The Pentagon also has U.S.-based 
submarines, aircraft and missiles armed with nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who wrote an article about the nuclear weapons history  
to be published this week in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 
with co-authors William Arkin and William Burr, said the three used 
publicly available documentation to determine the names of 17 of 
the 18 censored locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17 were Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Japan, Kwajalein Island,  
Morocco, Okinawa, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, 
Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. It has 
been known that U.S. nuclear weapons were in some of these 
countries, even if not officially acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	The one country that Norris, Arkin and Burr could not identified  
falls, alphabetically, between Canada and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	With the onset in 1950 of the Korean War, the Truman  
administration approved the movement of non-nuclear bomb components 
to Britain, and later that year to Guam, according to the Pentagon 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``By having non-nuclear components readily available to these  
units, the initial strikes against their assigned targets could be 
mounted in a much shorter time, and the time schedule for 
subsequent attacks could be advanced,'' the document said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first overseas movement of nuclear capsules -- the bomb's  
plutonium or uranium core -- came in 1951 when President Truman 
authorized the shipment of nuclear capsules to the Pacific island 
of Guam. Starting in 1956 a wide variety of nuclear weapons and 
their delivery systems were sent to the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Ballet Theater Has Gala Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Ballet Theater's highly accomplished  
dancers made the opening night of its two-week season a true gala 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	ABT presents full-length ballets in the spring at the  
Metropolitan Opera and evenings of short, plotless ballets in the 
fall at the City Center. At the Tuesday opening, artistic director 
Kevin McKenzie said that these dances, many choreographed by 
Americans, ``are at the heart of our artistic identity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The evening began with the ``pioneers pushing westward'' episode  
from Eugene Loring's ``Billy the Kid,'' danced to Aaron Copland 
music. Cynthia Gregory, an audience favorite for 26 years who 
retired eight years ago, reminisced about the scene, which is one 
of the first she appeared in, and about the night at the City 
Center when a contact lens popped out and she heard it crunch under 
another dancer's foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Manuel Carreno and Ashley Tuttle danced the bravura pas de  
deux from Marius Petipa's ``Le Corsaire'' with fire and superb 
classical technique. It was followed by a modern pas de deux, 
``Without Words,'' by Nacho Duato, in which Susan Jaffe and Ethan 
Stiefel looked like angular sculpture in motion. The music was by 
Schubert. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing that the strength of the company extends beyond a few  
top individuals, many dancers glittered in ``Jubilee,'' a new dance 
by John Meehan to Handel music, and ``Jeu d'Esprit,'' choreographed 
by Kirk Peterson. For the latter, Chee-Yun was the on-stage 
violinist with pianist David Lamarche, playing music by Suk, 
Rachmaninov and de Sarasate. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening's high point was Angel Corella, returning from an  
injury, and Julie Kent in Jerome Robbins' ``Other Dances.'' 
Lamarche was on stage, playing Chopin for them. 
</P>
<P>
	As the dance began, Corella was behind Kent and they were  
dancing the same steps as though they breathed as one. They 
performed throughout with elegance and joy. One reason Corella is 
such an appealing dancer is that he takes obvious pleasure in 
partnering. He moved with dazzling steps toward Kent, as though 
intending to please her, not to show off for the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	In her solo variation, Kent seemed to float. In Corella's, at  
one point he paused as though unsure which way to spin. The 
audience laughed, Corella spun and ended where he wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Amanda McKerrow, Yan Chen and Alessandra Ferri danced as three  
18th century ballerina divas in Robert Joffrey's ``Pas des 
Deesses.'' Julio Bocca danced the man who raced around to partner 
all three in one dance. 
</P>
<P>
	Joffrey meant this ballet to be funny. McKerrow and Chen were  
coy and Ferri was grand. But all three, at this performance, 
stressed the beauty of what they were dancing more than the 
excesses of attitude and rivalry.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. Close to UAE F-16 Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- The United States and the  
United Arab Emirates are close to sealing a deal to sell the Gulf 
state 80 F-16 fighter jets for $8 billion, U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said technical issues, which have so far blocked the deal,  
were resolved but some financial issues remain to be ironed out. He 
said the deal might be announced before the annual Dubai Air Show, 
the Middle East's largest arms show, set for mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope we can conclude negotiations before that. If not,  
hopefully shortly after,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Emirates threatened to pull out of the  
deal if the jet fighters, made by Lockheed Martin Corp., were not 
equipped with software codes that would enable them to discern 
whether other aircraft in the skies are friendly or hostile. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States does not allow release of the full codes. With  
them, the Emirates could have a tactical advantage over Israel, 
which has more than 200 F-16 fighters of its own and no diplomatic 
ties with the Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, who is on a tour of nine countries in the region, did not  
say how the dispute was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the requirements the Emirates wanted are very  
advanced,'' he said. ``It took a lot of negotiating because of the 
advanced nature of the technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen spoke to reporters after meeting with President Sheik  
Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan in the capital Abu Dhabi and Defense 
Minister Sheik Mohammed bin Rashed in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	On other matters, he said the United States will not consider  
holding talks with Iran before it stops ``supporting terrorism, 
opposing the Middle East peace process and seeking to acquire 
weapons of mass destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen will next visit Egypt, part of a nine-day tour of eight  
countries in the region.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Naming Building for Ike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the capital's most distinguished  
buildings may soon bear President Eisenhower's name. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Tuesday voted to rename the Old Executive Office  
Building, just west of the White House, as the Dwight D. Eisenhower 
Executive Office Building. The House has not yet considered the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that will touch the heart of every World War II  
veteran, indeed every American who remembers Dwight D. Eisenhower 
as one of America's greatest 20th century leaders in peace and 
war,'' former Kansas GOP Sen. Bob Dole wrote about the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The historic structure, completed in 1888 and originally known  
as the State, War and Navy Building, is currently occupied by the 
vice president and other executive branch staff. 
</P>
<P>
	At times occupied by eight future presidents and 24 secretaries  
of state, the OEOB is known as perhaps the finest example of French 
Second Empire architecture in America. It is located just west of 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	An Army general and native of Abilene, Kan., Eisenhower led the  
Allied invasion of Europe and went on to become the nation's 34th 
president. He served in the building in the early 1930s as an aide 
to Gen. Douglas MacArthur and is credited with saving the building 
from demolition during his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Historian Stephen Ambrose said he was ``about laughed out of the  
room'' when he first proposed, 10 years ago, naming a statue or

<HEADLINE> Kings Fans Impressed by New Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At the opening faceoff, it was immediately  
obvious there was something special going on -- almost all the fans, 
habitually late-arriving Southern Californians, were actually in 
their seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Staples Center, a $375 million, one-million-square foot  
facility that is the most expensive arena ever built, made its 
sports debut Wednesday night with the Los Angeles Kings skating 
against the Boston Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	The sleek building, featuring chrome, airy lobbies and terrazzo  
floors, got mostly good reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of a traditionalist, thought I would prefer the  
Forum, but this is great,'' said Alec Elizondo, standing on a patio 
with a striking view of the LA skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't sure about this, but I'm already a convert. I guess  
that was pretty fast,'' Elizondo said 30 minutes before the game 
started. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzie Oltmann also was impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The sight lines here are very good, much better than at the  
Forum,'' she said. ``And the place is just beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, spotlights panned around the sellout crowd of  
some 18,500, lasers danced wildly on the roof beams, and there were 
some rather dinky fireworks. Broadway star Davis Gaines sang the 
national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everybody was thrilled about the move from the Forum in  
Inglewood, the Kings' home for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent three hours getting here from Torrance; I was 15  
minutes from the Forum. The parking here was atrocious,'' said 
Lonnie Sneed, a hockey dad whose sons both played the game in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only took me about 35 minutes to drive into town, but the  
traffic was really bad on the street and it took me more than an 
hour to get into the lot. Then I had to walk the three blocks and 
get into the arena. And the parking was $15; I paid $7 at the Forum 
and didn't have to walk as far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sneed said his seats were in the third row from the top in the  
arena and cost $18.50, about the same price he paid at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Parking aside, Sneed gave the arena his stamp of approval.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had about the same seats at the Forum as I'm sitting in  
here, but was farther from the ice,'' he said. ``These new arenas 
are much more vertical, and you feel like you're right over the 
ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staples Center also is the new home of the NBA's Los Angeles  
Lakers and Clippers, and will be the site of the Democratic 
National Convention and the Grammy Awards.

<HEADLINE> CDC Panel Urges Meningitis Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A group of federal health officials is  
recommending that colleges make meningitis vaccines readily 
available and that they warn students of the risks of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel on  
Wednesday stopped short of recommending that all college students 
be vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory committee didn't go further in its recommendations  
because current meningitis vaccines are no more than 90 percent 
effective and don't work on all strains, said Dr. Nancy Rosenstein 
of the CDC's meningitis branch. 
</P>
<P>
	``College freshmen have proven statistically to be at a  
moderately higher risk for meningococcal diseases and are a prime 
group for intervention,'' Rosenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	A CDC study of 83 reported meningitis cases in college students  
from September 1998 through May 1999 indicated a rate of 1.4 cases 
per 100,000 freshmen, and 3.8 cases per 100,000 freshmen living in 
dormitories. The rate for all 18- to 22-year-olds was 1 case per 
100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American College Health Association, between  
100 and 125 college students get meningitis each year, and between 
five and 10 die. 
</P>
<P>
	Meningococcal meningitis is an infection of the membranes around  
the brain and spinal cord that is fatal in about 10 percent of 
cases. It can be spread through contact such as kissing, sharing 
kitchen utensils and sneezing. Symptoms include fever, headache, 
nausea and vomiting, neck stiffness and skin rash.

	Wahid Named Indonesian President  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A revered but frail Islamic party  
leader won the first open presidential election in Indonesia's 
troubled history Wednesday, defeating the popular daughter of the 
country's founding father and setting off a wave of violent 
protests by her disillusioned supporters. Abdurrahman Wahid comes 
to power as Indonesia grapples with its worst economic crisis in 30 
years and continuing communal and separatist violence across this 
ethnically diverse archipelago of 210 million people. His election 
gives Islam unprecedented influence in the world's largest Muslim 
nation. In the wake of the vote, gunshots rang throughout the 
capital, Jakarta.

	Opportunities Missed in Dole Run  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Not too long ago, Elizabeth Dole looked  
delightedly at the networks she'd built in Iowa, New Hampshire and 
other early primary states. ``We're going to have everything in 
place by Christmas. We're in really good shape,'' she thought. That 
was then. After recalling this once-sunny outlook Wednesday, Dole 
folded her presidential campaign, saying it was futile to continue. 
Dole blamed the Texas governor's ``preexisting network of political 
supporters,'' built ``quietly but effectively'' from his office, 
starting in 1996, while she was at the American Red Cross 
meticulously guarding the organization's nonpartisan status.

	Hurricane Jose Tears Through Antigua

<P>
	ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) -- Hurricane Jose ripped roofs from  
houses, tore down a newly built church and flung debris through 
deserted streets Wednesday as it hit Antigua head-on and threatened 
a string of other Caribbean islands. Storm-weary islanders in 
neighboring St. Kitts, where a few homes remained roofless from 
last year's devastating hurricane season, braced themselves as Jose 
bore down packing 100 mph winds and drenching rain. In a television 
broadcast, acting Prime Minister Sam Condor told the people of St. 
Kitts and Nevis to ``prepare for the worst.'' There was a strong 
chance the storm would not reach the U.S. East Coast, a 
meteorologist said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government is expected to increase  
the subsidies that make local phone service affordable for 
customers in expensive areas. The Federal Communications Commission 
on Thursday will nearly double the pot of money available for 
telephone companies that serve rural customers and others in 
high-cost areas, industry and government sources said Wednesday. 
Giant phone companies such as the regional Bells and GTE now get 
$207 million in federal subsidies to help make local phone service 
affordable. Of that, $130 million goes to the main phone company in 
Puerto Rico.

	Study: Atomic Tests Link to Cancer

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Higher death rates for nasal and prostate  
cancer among soldiers who took part in atomic tests were 
unexpected, according to a new study that also found increases in 
leukemia. The increased death rates for nasal and prostate cancer 
had not been reported before, but the higher leukemia rates have 
been found in other studies, according to the new analysis released 
Wednesday by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of 
Medicine. ``Deaths from prostate cancer were 20 percent higher 
among test participants than the comparison group, and even higher 
for nasal cancer,'' said Susan Thaul, who directed the study.

<P>
	MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) -- Dengue fever has swept across northern  
Mexico near the Texas border, killing at least seven people and 
making thousands of others ill, local officials said today. About 
5,500 people in Nuevo Leon state have been diagnosed with the 
painful, mosquito-borne disease this month alone. Of those, about 
150 have come down with the serious, sometimes-deadly form known as 
hemorrhagic dengue. Dengue is characterized by headaches, rashes, 
cramps and severe muscle and bone pains. It usually last about two 
weeks after infection, and treatment is given mostly to relieve 
symptoms.

condition Wednesday at Baptist Hospital. ``He was readmitted on 
Sunday after spending several days here last week,'' hospital

one-goal leads to remain winless with an 0-5-4 record, their worst 
start since opening the 1964-65 season with an 0-8-1 mark.

	Reno: Puerto Rican Terror a Threat

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just a month after President Clinton offered  
clemency to 16 Puerto Rican separatists, a report from Attorney 
General Janet Reno said that the nationalist groups they had been 
aligned with posed an ``ongoing threat'' to national security. Most 
of the Puerto Rican separatists were associated with the terrorist 
group FALN, which was responsible for a wave of bombings in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s that left six dead. Lawmakers scolded 
the Justice Department for failing to contact victims of FALN 
violence, either to gather their input on the potential offer of 
clemency or to even inform them that the prisoners were being 
released.

the industry can be held liable for making a deadly product. The 
tobacco industry argued that the issue of punitive damages should

damages in a lump sum. The trial is scheduled to resume Nov. 1.

in 1992, said Russia still has at least three plants capable of 
producing biological weapons. Russia insists it has complied with 
the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the development, 
production and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons.

<HEADLINE> Study: Atomic Tests Link to Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Soldiers exposed to radiation during atomic  
tests in Nevada in the 1950s have had higher than normal death 
rates for leukemia and for prostate and nasal cancer, a new study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased death rates for nasal and prostate cancer had not  
been reported before, but the higher leukemia rates have been found 
in other studies, according to the report from the National Academy 
of Sciences' Institute of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``These leukemia findings do not resolve the debate over whether  
participation is associated with leukemia mortality,'' said Susan 
Thaul, director of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, the set of leukemia findings is consistent with the  
results of other studies of military participants in nuclear tests 
and is broadly consistent with a hypothesis that these are 
radiation effects,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing a group of servicemen who took part in the tests in  
Nevada and the Pacific with similar service members who did not 
participate, the analysis found no difference between the two 
groups in overall death rates or in total deaths from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	For leukemia, those taking part in the tests had a 14 percent  
higher death rate than those in the comparison group, an increase 
the report said is small enough that it could be due to chance. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when the researchers broke down the service members  
into regional groups they discovered that ``land-based participants 
-- those in the Nevada desert -- had a death rate from leukemia that 
was 50 percent higher than military personnel in similar units who 
did not take part in atomic tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, sea-based test participants in the South  
Pacific did not have a higher death rate from leukemia than 
servicemen who did not take part in the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The study characterized the higher death rates from prostate and  
nasal cancer as ``unanticipated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Deaths from prostate cancer were 20 percent higher among test  
participants than the comparison group, and even higher for nasal 
cancer,'' Thaul said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that higher prostate cancer rates have not been  
consistently seen in other studies of people exposed to radiation 
and ``are therefore difficult to interpret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The nasal cancer finding is even harder to interpret,'' Thaul  
said, ``in part because this is the first study of atomic test 
participants to look specifically for that cause of death. To date, 
nasal cancer has not been among the cancers considered to be caused 
by radiation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Concern about higher cancer rates in nuclear test participants  
was first voiced in 1976 when a veteran of a 1957 nuclear test in 
Nevada claimed he developed leukemia as a result of his exposure to 
the radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than 200,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and  
marines participated in atmospheric nuclear tests between World War 
II and the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study looked into the causes and rates of death among  
the nearly 70,000 service members who participated in at least one 
of five groups of atmospheric nuclear tests chosen for examination. 
</P>
<P>
	These servicemen were present at tests conducted in the Nevada  
desert or in the South Pacific; some 30 percent have since died. 
The causes of death were compared to a group of nearly 65,000 
military personnel serving at the same time but not involved in the 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not examine differences in nonfatal disease or injury.  
</P>
<P>
	The study was funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency of  
the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute of Medicine is part of the National Academy of  
Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress to advice 
the government of scientific matters.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Animal Cruelty Video Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to make illegal the  
production and sale of ``crush videos,'' which show the torture and 
killing of small animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed 372-42, would impose sentences of up to  
five years for those trafficking in videos for fetishists who enjoy 
watching women, barefoot or in high heels, crushing insects, 
kittens, hamsters or monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., the measure's chief sponsor, said  
state laws against cruelty to animals are unlikely to stop those 
involved in the interstate or overseas marketing of such videos. 
They are sold frequently through the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	He said more than 2,000 crush video titles sell for as much as  
$300 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``An entire industry has sprung up appealing to these unusual  
sexual fetishes throughout the world,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, 
R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an odious and rather sick practice, and it's  
appropriate that the federal government step in to attempt to stop 
the interstate commerce in these videos,'' said Wayne Pacelle, 
senior vice president of the Humane Society of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill met opposition both from liberals worried about free  
speech rights and conservatives objecting to putting yet another 
federal law on the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not convinced that the bill meets the strict scrutiny  
test for limiting speech,'' said Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallegly responded that the bill was narrowly written, with  
exceptions for any depiction of animals that has ``serious 
religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, 
historical or artistic value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Films on bullfighting or hunting, for example, would not be  
subject to prosecution under the bill. It has yet to be taken up in 
the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gun Buyback Program Has Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A $1.4 million state buyback program  
designed to take illegal assault rifles off the streets hasn't 
found a lot of customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The program has spent only about $80,000 to collect 350 SKS  
Sporters since January. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers gave the Department of Justice enough money to  
purchase 5,000 SKS Sporters from their owners. The state pays $230 
for each weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyback program gives gun owners a year to destroy their  
modified SKS Sporter, take the gun out of state or sell it to the 
state before it becomes illegal Dec. 31. After that date, anyone 
caught with an SKS Sporter with a detachable clip risks having 
their gun confiscated and being charged with a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the money and the amnesty offered, the guns are just  
``trickling in,'' said Janelle Beland, a spokeswoman for state 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer. The turnout may be an accurate 
reflection of how many guns are out there, but nobody knows, she 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales records on rifles, such as the SKS Sporter, erase personal  
information five days after the purchase. That includes names, the 
number of guns and the model, Beland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiautomatic rifle was manufactured in China. The original  
model held 10 shots, but a conversion kit would allow the user to 
attach a 30-round clip. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the National Rifle Association and the California  
Rifle and Pistol Association said the state Justice Department 
isn't seeing results because they aren't letting people know about 
the buyback and the impending deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people out there who become accidental  
felons under this, but if you don't hear about it, you can't do 
anything,'' Chuck Michel said.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Boy To Be Tried for Incest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The 11-year-old Swiss-American boy walked  
into the courtroom with his hands in his pockets, a shy smile on a 
face framed by a neat polo collar and tidy blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
	With his slim build and pleasant features, he might have seemed  
the picture of innocence. But a magistrate ruled there was probable 
cause to arraign the boy on a charge of aggravated incest. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, who has dual citizenship and is known only by his first  
name, Raoul, is accused of making inappropriate sexual contact with 
his 5-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
	His case has grabbed headlines in Switzerland and placed him in  
the center of an international debate over when childhood play 
crosses the line and becomes a criminal act. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had charged the boy in juvenile court with incest,  
and a judge ruled Tuesday that the case can proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he did not speak at Tuesday's hearing, Raoul raised his  
hand as he was led out of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boy continues to want to say that he is not guilty,''  
defense attorney Arnold Wegher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raoul, who was released into foster care, faces a trial and up  
to two years in the juvenile justice system. Wegher said the boy 
will plead innocent at his arraignment scheduled for Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Raoul had been in a juvenile detention center since he was  
arrested at his family's home in Evergreen on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Raoul's parents have fled to Switzerland with the  
5-year-old girl and their two other daughters, ages 12 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Their lawyer, Vincent Todd, said the couple fled because they  
had been threatened by social service workers with losing custody 
of their children because of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement the parents said, ``The rule of law is currently  
suspended in Colorado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their cause has been taken up by the mass-circulation Swiss  
daily Blick, which has clamored for the boy's immediate release and 
gathered thousands of signatures in a petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years ago, a harmless play of `doctor' was considered  
quite normal. But today, the prosecutors label it a crime of 
violence,'' Blick said Monday in an editorial. ``Ten- and 
11-year-old children are imprisoned because prudish and unrealistic 
lawyers want it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation and subsequent arrest of Raoul was prompted by  
neighbor Laura Mehmert, who testified Tuesday that she saw the boy 
fondle his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Jarboe, an incest expert with an independent group that  
interviews alleged child victims for the state Human Services 
Department, testified that the girl said her brother touched and 
kissed her genitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas J. Acierno, a Jefferson County sheriff's investigator who  
interviewed Raoul, testified that the boy told him he was only 
trying to help his sister go to the bathroom and he did not kiss 
her genitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Raoul's supporters say the way the case has been handled has  
been a miscarriage of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel this was totally blown out of proportion,'' said  
Hanspeter Spuhler, president of the Denver-area Swiss-American 
Friendship Society. He was among a dozen Swiss-Americans who 
protested outside the courthouse and then attended the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Switzerland if something like this were to happen, someone  
would talk to the parents and say 'Let's sit down and discuss 
this,''' Spuhler said. ``But to make a federal case out of it, this 
is just unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Davidson, director of the American Bar Association's  
Center on Children and the Law, said people in Switzerland ``may 
regret the idea that an 11-year-old can be locked up, and some in 
the U.S. do, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Courts need to take cases of alleged juvenile sex offenders  
very seriously, because this is the time when we probably do the 
most good in terms of treatment intervention,'' Davidson said.

<HEADLINE> JonBenet Ramsey's Grave Vandalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Someone scrawled ``No Justice in U.S.A.''  
on the grave of JonBenet Ramsey, days after a grand jury declined 
to bring charges in her death. 
</P>
<P>
	The graffiti, in red marker, was reported Monday, Marietta  
police Lt. Rick Townsend said today. He said police have no 
witnesses or leads in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-year-old girl, killed in her family's Boulder, Colo., home  
in December 1996, was buried in St. James Episcopal Church Cemetery 
in Marietta, northwest of Atlanta. Her family now lives in the 
Atlanta area. 
</P>
<P>
	Townsend said the words were written on a marble slab that lies  
on the ground covering the child's grave. The headstone was not 
vandalized, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no plans to increase patrols, but will continue to  
monitor the area -- not just for Ramsey's grave, but for all the 
graves in the cemetery,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury in Boulder investigated JonBenet's death for 13  
months, but adjourned Oct. 13 without indicting anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	David Perkins, a spokesman for the church, said he was aware of  
the vandalism but declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	James Ray, vice chairman of the church's cemetery committee,  
said the church has locked the cemetery gates in the past to 
prevent media and others from getting to JonBenet's grave. But he 
said the gates were later unlocked because people wanted to get to 
other grave sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Colorado's attorney general moved to ensure the  
secrecy of a special panel appointed by the governor to consider 
using a special prosecutor in the Ramsey case by swearing in the 
panel's seven members as assistant attorneys general Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That designation ensures that the attorney-client privilege  
between the attorney general and the governor is protected,'' said 
Ken Lane, a spokesman for Attorney General Ken Salazar. ``These 
deliberations and any comments made there are confidential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Owens announced last week that he would look into  
using a special prosecutor in the case after the grand jury 
investigating the little girl's death ended its work without 
returning an indictment.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Trying To Keep Bank Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Striving to keep afloat major legislation  
reshaping the financial services industries, Treasury Secretary 
Lawrence Summers engaged in daylong, intense negotiations with Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	As the meeting broke up Wednesday evening, Summers told  
reporters, ``There are significant unresolved issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said ``We have  
a proposal on the table.'' He said Summers would have to confer 
with his colleagues ``and look at the proposal and basically decide 
whether the answer is yes or no.'' Neither he nor Summers provided 
details of the proposed accord on community lending rules for 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The marathon closed-door talks at the Capitol between  
administration officials and Gramm and other key Republican 
lawmakers have been going on through much of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides support in principle the legislative package, which  
would lift Depression-era legal barriers and allow banks, brokerage 
firms and insurance companies to merge and sell each other's 
products. House and Senate negotiators have been in the final 
stages of drafting a measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, however, has threatened a  
presidential veto over provisions in the legislation it says would 
weaken the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to 
make loans in low-income and minority areas in which they operate. 
Gramm, who drafted the provisions, is a longtime critic of the 1977 
law and has blocked efforts to extend its reach in the new 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and his advisers appear to have been forced  
into a prickly dilemma by the community lending issue. If Clinton 
abandons his staunch support of the 1977 law, he risks provoking 
the ire of key Democratic constituencies such as blacks and civil 
rights activists like Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Clinton refuses to budge on the lending law, he could  
jeopardize the financial overhaul legislation. Some financial 
industry lobbyists have privately held out the retaliatory threat 
that, if that were to occur, Hillary Clinton might be deprived of 
potential campaign funds from Wall Street and the banking industry 
for her presumed Senate run in New York -- home to both industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial services industries have spent millions of dollars  
in recent years pushing for the overhaul legislation, insisting it 
would help consumers by providing one-stop financial shopping and 
saving them money. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson underlined the high stakes involved in the issue at a  
news conference last Friday where he denounced the financial 
overhaul legislation as ``a major step backwards'' that would gut 
the community investment law. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, consumer advocates and lawmakers pushing for  
stronger consumer privacy protections have criticized the financial 
overhaul legislation as inadequate in that area and put additional 
pressure on Clinton to veto the bill in its current form. It could 
hurt the administration to be perceived by the public as less than 
a stalwart advocate of consumers' privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the cost of moving to the new financial services  
marketplace is that a consumer's most personal financial secrets 
are going to be compromised, then that price is simply too high,'' 
Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., told reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the House and Senate negotiators rejected in a mostly  
party-line vote a Democratic proposal, written by Markey, that 
would have allowed consumers to stop their banks from sharing their 
personal financial data with both affiliated financial firms and 
outside companies such as telemarketers. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers adopted instead a provision -- supported by the  
administration -- that would give consumers that right only with 
regard to outside companies. Their data still could be shared among 
banks, securities firms and insurance companies that are under the 
same corporate ownership.

<HEADLINE> Braves Have Different Look for Yanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The New York Yankees won't be hitting a crucial  
homer off Mark Wohlers in this World Series. Mark Lemke won't be 
making the final out for the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquis Grisson and Fred McGriff aren't going to be introduced  
prior to Game 1 at Turner Field. Ditto for Denny Neagle and Steve 
Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	While it's been only three years since the Braves last played in  
a World Series, a lot has changed since their 1996 loss to the 
Yankees. These days, it's guys like John Rocker, Brian Jordan, 
Kevin Millwood and Gerald Williams playing key roles for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves have been a work in process throughout their decade  
of excellence. Only pitchers Tom Glavine and John Smoltz have been 
part of every team during an unprecedented run of eight straight 
postseason appearances since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't realize how hard it is to get here year after  
year,'' general manager John Schuerholz said. ``They have no 
clue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan is actually two cleanup hitters removed from McGriff, who  
handled the role in '96. Andres Galarraga, who had 44 homers and 
121 RBIs last season, missed the year while recovering from cancer 
in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle was the Braves' fourth starter in the last Series, a role  
now handled -- at least numerically -- by Millwood. Actually, the 
24-year-old right-hander became Atlanta's most consistent starter 
while the Cy Young triumvirate of Greg Maddux, Glavine and Smoltz 
went through assorted struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker is the Braves' third closer in three years. Wohlers, who  
surrendered that Series-turning homer to Jim Leyritz three years 
ago, suddenly forgot how to throw strikes. Former independent 
league pitcher Kerry Ligtenberg saved 30 games last year, but he 
suffered a season-ending elbow injury in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	The leadoff role has passed from Grissom to Williams, who scored  
the winning run in the 11th inning Tuesday night, giving the Braves 
a stirring 10-9 victory over the New York Mets and a 4-2 victory in 
the NL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of Lemke, it's Bret Boone who plays and bats second.  
Jordan is in right field, not Jermaine Dye. Walt Weiss has 
succeeded Jeff Blauser at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	All season, change has been a theme for the Braves. Galarraga  
and Ligtenberg were out before the season began. All-star catcher 
Javy Lopez, middle reliever Rudy Seanez and fifth starter Odalis 
Perez were sidelined with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The character we have, the heart we have in this locker  
room,'' said Jordan, who's been bothered by a sore hand since being 
hit by a pitch in late June. ``We've proved a lot of people 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves have been helped along by fringe players like catcher  
Eddie Perez, who was forced into the lineup by Lopez's injury. 
Perez was a unanimous choice as MVP of the NLCS after hitting .500 
with two homers and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 6 against the Mets, the Braves also got key hits from  
Brian Hunter -- signed in the spring after Galarraga's illness was 
diagnosed -- and reserve shortstops Jose Hernandez and Ozzie 
Guillen. Russ Springer, moving into Seanez's role, was the winning 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what you hope for,'' batting coach Don Baylor said.  
``Those guys spend all that time watching people playing in front 
of them. To see them get out there and have a chance to play really 
makes you feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox hasn't announced his World Series rotation,  
though Maddux or Glavine is likely to pitch the opener Saturday 
night. Maddux last pitched Sunday, working seven innings in Game 5 
of the NLCS, while Glavine hasn't pitched since Game 2 of that 
series Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's hand might be a concern. He was struck again Tuesday  
night with a pitch by Turk Wendell, putting Jordan in obvious pain 
though he remained in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves also must shake off the mental anguish of their  
classic series with the Mets. The last five games were decided by 
one run; the last two encompassed 26 innings and more than 10 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox gave his team the day off Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're drained but we've got a day to rest,'' said Jordan,  
mindful that the Braves won two of three games at Yankee Stadium in 
mid-July. ``We showed them we could beat them.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Drug Policy Criticized in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Athletes, lawmakers and the White House drug  
czar joined Wednesday in concluding that the IOC is not doing 
enough to stop the spread of performance-enhancing drugs at the 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's efforts to crack down on drug use are ``more public  
relations ploy than public policy solution,'' Barry McCaffrey, head 
of the White House drug policy office, told the Senate Commerce 
Committee. The IOC, he said, is ``literally in denial'' in their 
approach to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level playing field of the Olympic Games has now been  
chemically skewed and taking illegal drugs is now the price of 
entry into the competition,'' said Frank Shorter, the gold medalist 
in the 1972 Olympic marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, already under fire over the issue of corruption in  
Olympic site selection, is moving to set up a new body called the 
World Anti-Doping Agency that will be involved in drug research, 
education and prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC says the agency will have equal representation from  
governments, sports bodies and athletes, and will make independent 
decisions. But McCaffrey and others said it would have no power 
beyond making recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC must be prepared to relinquish control of the new  
agency in order to secure its independence,'' said Nancy Hogshead, 
who won three gold medals in swimming in 1984, competing against 
East German women widely suspected of using steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	``The natural tension between doping detection and profit-making  
must be removed from within the IOC,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the committee and a  
presidential hopeful, said there must be an independent agency that 
performs year-round, out-of-competition testing for banned 
substances. All athletes wishing to compete in the Olympics must be 
required to submit to testing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he would introduce legislation to fund U.S. colleges  
to study technologies and strategies for the detection and 
verification of drug use among athletes. Sen. Ted Stevens, 
R-Alaska, said he, too, would pursue legislation dealing with 
performance-enhancing drugs and doping. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Richard Pound, vice president of the IOC, acknowledged  
that ``the effort has not been sufficient to eradicate drug use in 
sports.'' He said the IOC can and does lead by example, but ``the 
IOC alone cannot provide the solution to doping in sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said his office had submitted a series of basic  
principles it hoped the IOC would adopt, including, a truly 
independent and accountable international anti-doping agency, 
testing on year-round, no-notice basis and no statute of 
limitations for penalties against drug users. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States Olympic Committee is taking such steps, said  
its president, Bill Hybl. He said a task force is recommending that 
the USOC set up an independent organization that would be 
responsible for both testing and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the Olympic bid city scandal has captured the majority  
of recent public and media attention, it is drugs in sports that is 
one of the greatest problems affecting the Olympic movement 
today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Going beyond the Olympics, Scott Serota of the Blue Cross and  
Blue Shield Association cited figures estimating that some 500,000 
American youths -- 175,000 teenage girls and 325,000 teenage boys -- 
used steroids during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said one-third of 15- and 16-year-olds know someone  
using performance-enhancing substances and young people report that 
steroids are easily available through their friends and coaches 
despite information that steroid use can cause heart disease, liver 
damage, cancers, sexual development problems and stunted growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doping and drug use in sport are so pervasive that they  
jeopardize the ethics and integrity of athletic competitions,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Testing Calif. Faults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With memories of the 7.1-magnitude Hector  
earthquake still fresh, seismologists in Southern California are 
shaking up the ground themselves to create a portrait of faults and 
hazardous areas in the region's restless underbelly. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of 93 small underground detonations, beginning today  
and continuing through Sunday, is being conducted as sort of an 
ultrasound procedure, aimed at giving scientists a better look at 
the region's fault lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the timing of the tests, beginning days after  
Saturday's Hector quake in the Mojave Desert, was a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been planned for this particular week for two years,''  
said Mark Benthien, a spokesman for the Southern California 
Earthquake Center, which is conducting the study with the U.S. 
Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the blasts will not trigger earthquakes and, if  
felt at all, would resemble the rumble of a passing truck. Similar 
blasting was done in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosives will be set off in boreholes 60 feet deep. The  
holes run in a line from Pacific Palisades inland to the San 
Fernando Valley, then north across the Mojave Desert to the 
Tehachapi Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,400 portable seismographs will collect data that should  
reveal hidden faults and other geologic structures important to 
understanding how future quakes will affect homes and other 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Hector Mine earthquake ripped a miles-long rupture  
across the desert floor but was remote enough to spare urban areas 
from damage. 
</P>
<P>
	It generated a number of moderate aftershocks, including one of  
magnitude 4.6 Tuesday morning and another of 4.0 Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Seismologists said three aftershocks of 5.0 or greater occurred  
shortly after the main shock and up to four more of similar size 
were likely within the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition to the classic aftershock sequence, the earthquake  
has apparently triggered small earthquakes as far south as the 
California-Mexico border,'' the USGS said in a statement. 
``Scientists are monitoring these events carefully, as some of them 
have occurred close to the southern end of the San Andreas fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of aftershocks was a minor concern to the  
researchers. If one occurred at the same moment as a blast it could 
wash out that data, Benthien said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blasts at sites near homes will use about 50 pounds of  
explosives. The largest blasts, at remote sites, will use up to 
2,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Even that amount of explosives cannot cause an earthquake,  
Benthien said. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction in the region routinely involves far bigger blasts,  
such as a dam project near Riverside that has used as much as 
60,000 pounds of explosives at once without causing a quake.

<HEADLINE> Old Murder Case Suspect Exonerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A man suspected for more than 27 years in  
the shooting death of his wife has apparently been exonerated by 
the confession of his former paper boy, now serving time for the 
murder of a college student. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbert Peppin was never charged but was the only suspect in the  
slaying of his 26-year-old wife, Phyllis, who was shot to death 
home on a summer night in 1972. He maintained his innocence, got 
married again and kept working as a barber. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long 27 years,'' Peppin said Wednesday after  
Ramsey County authorities announced the inmate's confession. 
``There is no better thing I could find out at this time in my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Charles Lee LaTourelle, 44, confessed to the  
crime Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner said she is confident the  
confession is legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
	LaTourelle is in prison for the Oct. 27, 1980, murder of  
Catharine John, a St. Cloud State University student stabbed 21 
times, raped and dumped into the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided it was time to talk, and told authorities he entered  
the Peppin home on June 14, 1972, with the intent of raping Phyllis 
Peppin. When she tried to flee, he shot her several times. 
</P>
<P>
	LaTourelle, then 17, was the Peppin's paper boy, and he said in  
a criminal complaint that he was ``obsessed'' with Phyllis Peppin. 
</P>
<P>
	He was never a suspect.  
</P>
<P>
	Peppin said he vaguely remembered LaTourelle, but only after  
being shown a high school photograph. ``I have no idea other than I 
probably paid him a few times for delivering the paper,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	LaTourelle, charged with second-degree murder, will be  
prosecuted as an adult, Gaertner said

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Rodriguez Says No D </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who already has  
declared he won't sign a contract extension with his new team if he 
is traded, will not negotiate with the Seattle Mariners until after 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Scott Boras said Tuesday that Rodriguez, who insists he  
doesn't want to leave Seattle, will take a wait-and-see attitude 
concerning the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just wants to see how the team plays, given a full  
winter,'' to improve its roster, said Boras, who met with Rodriguez 
in Miami last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mariners president Chuck Armstrong said Boras' comments  
wouldn't prevent him from trying to meet with Rodriguez and the 
agent in Miami next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking right past that,'' Armstrong said. ``We look  
forward to sitting down with them and discussing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, 24, a three time all-star who hit .285 with 42 home  
runs and 111 RBIs last season, makes $4 million next year -- the 
last of a four-year, $10.5 million deal. The Mariners are offering 
him an eight-year contract worth more than $15 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners had requested a response to their offer by a  
specific date, believed to be mid-November. Rodriguez has said he 
wants proof the team will make the moves necessary to become a 
contender, after two years of struggling to play .500 ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract of center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. also runs out at  
the end of next season. But Griffey, unlike Rodriguez, has enough 
major league service to veto a trade. Rodriguez emphasized Tuesday 
he wasn't interested in being traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you sign a four-year deal, you don't want to be there  
three years or three-and-a-half years,'' he said. ``The ball's in 
their court, and they have to do what they please, but I want to be 
a Mariner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong and other team officials plan to meet with Griffey in  
November to discuss the team's eight-year offer to him of about 
$135 million -- an average of nearly $17 million per season.

<HEADLINE> Eagles' Douglas Has Shoulder Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Hugh  
Douglas underwent successful season-ending surgery in a New York 
hospital Wednesday to repair a ruptured left bicep tendon and was 
placed on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	To replace Douglas on the roster, the Eagles signed defensive  
end Tyrone Williams, who had been with the team in the preseason 
until the final cut. Williams was signed by the Eagles after 
leading NFL Europe with nine sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas led the team with 12 1/2 sacks last year and had two in  
less than two games this season before being sidelined for a couple 
of weeks with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned for the Oct. 10 game against Dallas, but was injured  
the next Sunday against Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will miss Hugh a great deal,'' said Eagles head coach Andy  
Reid. ``He brings a lot to the field and to our team. He's a 
high-energy player who loves the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas has battled the injury bug the last two seasons. He was  
slowed in 1998 with a groin injury, and his 1999 season was over 
almost before it began. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles said Wednesday night that surgery performed at Lenox  
Hill Hospital in New York involved reattaching the injured tendon 
back to his forearm, near the elbow. The teams hopes the procedure 
will help Douglas regain full motion and strength in his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquired prior to the 1998 campaign in a trade with the New York  
Jets, Douglas is the Eagles' best pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hugh is a great player, a leader on this team,'' safety Brian  
Dawkins said. ``We're all going to have to pick up the slack. We're 
all going to have to make even more plays and get to the ball 
quicker. It's going to be tough to do that.''

<HEADLINE> FSU's Warrick Could Play Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State's Peter Warrick might be  
back on the field Saturday when the top-ranked Seminoles visit 
Clemson. And no one will happier than his quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you have a receiver like that and you're a  
quarterback, you want him on the football team, you want him on the 
football field,'' Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick's return hinges on a Circuit Court judge's decision  
today on a plea agreement reached between the athlete's attorney 
and local prosecutors that would reduce a felony grand theft charge 
to a lesser misdemeanor petty theft charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would require Warrick to spend 30 days in jail,  
donate to charity clothing he acquired in three trips to a 
Dillard's store, pay $295 in court costs, stay away from the 
department store and serve a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Court Judge John Crusoe will review the plea agreement  
reached by Warrick lawyer John Kenny and the Leon County state 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was considered the leading candidate for the Heisman  
Trophy when he was suspended Oct. 7 following his arrest on a 
felony grand theft charge. He has missed the top-ranked Seminoles' 
last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is he's still the best player in the country,''  
Weinke said. ``I think he's suffered enough. He deserves to be on 
the football team and I can't wait for his return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State does not let its athletes compete if they have  
been charged with a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State athletic director Dave Hart Jr. and coach Bobby  
Bowden wouldn't comment Tuesday about Warrick's status, preferring 
to wait until Crusoe acts on the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick and former teammate Laveranues Coles were charged with  
buying more than $400 of designer clothes Sept. 29 for $21.40 from 
a store clerk, who is also charged. A security camera recorded the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted the 30 days to offer a misdemeanor,'' Kenny said  
Tuesday. ``That's pretty standard when looking at felony cases. 
They worked very hard to look at Mr. Warrick not as a football 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick could have avoided jail time, but not if he wanted to  
have a shot at playing again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked at the options of going to trial to prove it was a  
petty theft, but those are not viable options when Peter wants to 
make himself available to the university as quickly as possible,'' 
Kenny said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge still needs to accept it,'' Kenny said Tuesday. ``I  
anticipate he will. It's a fair resolution for the state attorney's 
office and the best resolution for Peter to give him the greatest 
possibility for the university reinstating him and allowing him to 
play football. Now it's in their corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick caught 36 passes for 508 yards and four touchdowns in  
Florida State's first five games. He also threw a touchdown pass, 
ran back a punt for another and ran from scrimmage for a TD. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (7-0, 3-0 ACC) visits Clemson (3-3, 3-1) in the  
first father-son matchup in Division I-A history as Bobby Bowden 
coaches against his son, Tommy. Also, the elder Bowden is trying to 
become just the fifth major college coach to win 300 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick totaled 372 all-purpose yards and scored three  
touchdowns at Clemson two years ago in a 35-28 win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time he's on the field with us, it just makes us that much  
more dangerous,'' Florida State running back Travis Minor said 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Testing Calif. Faults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With memories of the 7.1-magnitude Hector  
earthquake still fresh, seismologists in Southern California are 
shaking up the ground themselves to create a portrait of faults and 
hazardous areas in the region's restless underbelly. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of 93 small underground detonations, beginning today  
and continuing through Sunday, is being conducted as sort of an 
ultrasound procedure, aimed at giving scientists a better look at 
the region's fault lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the timing of the tests, beginning days after  
Saturday's Hector quake in the Mojave Desert, was a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been planned for this particular week for two years,''  
said Mark Benthien, a spokesman for the Southern California 
Earthquake Center, which is conducting the study with the U.S. 
Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the blasts will not trigger earthquakes and, if  
felt at all, would resemble the rumble of a passing truck. Similar 
blasting was done in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosives will be set off in boreholes 60 feet deep. The  
holes run in a line from Pacific Palisades inland to the San 
Fernando Valley, then north across the Mojave Desert to the 
Tehachapi Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,400 portable seismographs will collect data that should  
reveal hidden faults and other geologic structures important to 
understanding how future quakes will affect homes and other 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Hector Mine earthquake ripped a miles-long rupture  
across the desert floor but was remote enough to spare urban areas 
from damage. 
</P>
<P>
	It generated a number of moderate aftershocks, including one of  
magnitude 4.6 Tuesday morning and another of 4.0 Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Seismologists said three aftershocks of 5.0 or greater occurred  
shortly after the main shock and up to four more of similar size 
were likely within the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition to the classic aftershock sequence, the earthquake  
has apparently triggered small earthquakes as far south as the 
California-Mexico border,'' the USGS said in a statement. 
``Scientists are monitoring these events carefully, as some of them 
have occurred close to the southern end of the San Andreas fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of aftershocks was a minor concern to the  
researchers. If one occurred at the same moment as a blast it could 
wash out that data, Benthien said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blasts at sites near homes will use about 50 pounds of  
explosives. The largest blasts, at remote sites, will use up to 
2,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Even that amount of explosives cannot cause an earthquake,  
Benthien said. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction in the region routinely involves far bigger blasts,  
such as a dam project near Riverside that has used as much as 
60,000 pounds of explosives at once without causing a quake.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Use Hoard As Smith's Backup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Leroy Hoard is back in his familiar  
role, not as a part-time short-yardage specialist but as a 
full-time replacement for Robert Smith, who's hurt yet again. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is out for up to six weeks after undergoing a hernia  
operation in Tampa on Tuesday, so Hoard is preparing to carry the 
load for the Vikings (2-4) beginning Sunday against the San 
Francisco 49ers (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
	``He's handled that role many times, been a very effective  
player for us,'' coach Dennis Green said Wednesday. ``He's a very 
physical inside runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoard will be backed up by Moe Williams and David Palmer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Leroy is a very powerful back. Leroy can make someone miss as  
well as run them over,'' Williams said. ``Me, I add maybe a little 
speed to the outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has been bothered by pain all season and struggled through  
four games before finally posting a 100-yard day two weeks ago. He 
still hasn't scored a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	He aggravated the injury on his first carry last week at Detroit  
and decided to undergo an operation that will sideline him from 3-6 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoard isn't completely healthy, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoard bit through his bottom lip in last week's loss at Detroit  
and needed three makeshift stitches without a painkiller to stay in 
the game, then had to have 13 stitches sewn in afterward. He'll 
need plastic surgery eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hoard usually serves as a goal-line or short-yardage  
running back, he's gotten plenty of exposure as the featured back 
in Minnesota's backfield in the last four seasons because Smith is 
so prone to injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is one of the most dangerous backs in the NFL -- when  
healthy. He has a career average of 25.8 yards per rushing 
touchdown, the highest in NFL history among players with at least 
20 TD runs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith, who signed a five-year, $25 million deal before last  
season, has almost never stayed injury-free for an entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	His first four seasons in the NFL included three season-ending  
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in 1997, he set a franchise record with 1,266 yards  
rushing and followed that with 1,187 yards last season. But he 
missed two games both times, with an injured ankle in '97 and a 
sprained knee in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were relatively healthy years by Smith's standards.  
</P>
<P>
	He missed the final seven games in 1996 when he tore a knee  
ligament, forcing the Vikings to sign Hoard, who played six years 
in Cleveland and had stints in Baltimore and Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoard will be one of two new starters in the Vikings' lineup  
Sunday, along with quarterback Jeff George, who was promoted over 
ineffective Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Smith, George shoulders even more of the burden for  
turning around the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just need to step up that much more,'' George said.  
``Robert's a great running back and he's going to be truly missed. 
But we need guys, Leroy and big Moe Williams, whoever's in the 
backfield needs to step up and pick up where Robert left off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith won't begin a rehabilitation program until he's rested for  
two weeks, something he's far too accustomed to doing this time of 
year.

<HEADLINE> Mets Can't Comeback This Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The New York Mets had been rising from dead so  
often and for so long that people had come to expect it, especially 
the players themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why they took the end so hard.  
</P>
<P>
	Any team can fall behind 5-0 when it's just one loss from  
elimination. But to come back and tie it 7-all, take an 8-7 lead 
and blow it, and then take a 9-8 lead in the 10th and blow that, 
too? That's special. 
</P>
<P>
	That's amazin'.  
</P>
<P>
	That's the 1999 New York Mets.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's so typical of what's gone on,'' Al Leiter said early  
Wednesday as players milled about the visitor's clubhouse at Turner 
Field. ``I thought for sure we would win this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't, and winter at Shea Stadium started Wednesday. The  
Mets, the team that just would not die, finally drove a stake 
through their own heart at 12:38 a.m., when Kenny Rogers walked in 
the winning run that gave Atlanta a 10-9, 11-inning win and a 4-2 
victory in the NL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a big boy,'' Rogers said. ``I can handle it. God thinks I  
can handle a lot. He can lay off me now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than an hour later, Mike Piazza finally emerged from the  
showers and talked about the amazin' three weeks -- the seven-game 
losing streak that put them on the verge of wasting a wild-card 
lead for the second straight year, the three-game sweep of 
Pittsburgh on the final weekend that forced a tiebreaker against 
Cincinnati, the first-round upset of Arizona that began with 
Edgardo Alfonzo's ninth-inning grand slam and ended with Todd 
Pratt's 10th-inning homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the Braves' series, losing the first three games  
but clawing back and forcing a return to Atlanta on Robin Ventura's 
15th-inning grand slam-turned-single Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the first inning in Tuesday night's finale, when Leiter  
allowed his first five batters to score, the teams never had been 
separated by more than two runs at any point, in any game. 
</P>
<P>
	And even then, the Mets came back again, with Piazza's two-run  
homer off John Smoltz tying the score 7-7 in a four-run seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it wasn't enough. John Franco couldn't hold an 8-7 lead  
in the eight, and Armando Benitez wasted a 9-8 lead in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gone a lot of miles,'' Piazza said softly in a corner of  
the room. ``There's a lot of guys that matured in here. There's a 
lot of guys that have learned so much, not only about themselves, 
but what it takes to get to a World Series, not only the tangibles 
on the field, but the things that you don't see in a boxscore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Mets showed up at Port St. Lucie, Fla., in February,  
they were an entirely different team. Since then, they've added 
Shawon Dunston, Darryl Hamilton, Orel Hershiser and Rogers. Benny 
Agbayani emerged during the season, and Melvin Mora and Pratt took 
star turns in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this team,'' said Mora, who last year was playing pro  
ball in Taiwan. ``This is a great team. I've never played with a 
team like this before. Now that I know what goes on in this league, 
I'll be better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, acquired just before the July 31 trade deadline,  
talked about how many players ``ran out of gas,'' that they were 
too banged up at this point to perform up to their abilities. 
Piazza and many Mets repeatedly said they ``left it all on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter remembered back to last year, when the Mets went 0-5 in  
the last week and fell one win short of forcing a wild-card 
playoff. That, he said, was a ``flop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This wasn't.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a damn good stepping stone to get to the next level,'' he  
said. ``It's a great group of guys. With a tweak here and there, 
there's no question we can get to the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets know their weak spots: atrocious outfield defense and  
shaky starting pitching. While Leiter is an ace, Ricky Reed, Masato 
Yoshii, Bobby Jones are on and off. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear if Orel Hershiser will be back. First, he wants  
to explore whether Cleveland wants him as its manager. Rogers' 
return also is uncertain, especially after his Game 6 performance. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are few pitching options on the free-agent market,  
with David Cone perhaps the best available starter willing to play 
in New York 
</P>
<P>
	Re-signing John Olerud would appear to be the first priority.  
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, all of that could wait.  
</P>
<P>
	About 1 1/2 hours after the game, nearly half the team was still in  
the clubhouse, most wearing orange Mets' T-shirts, so proud of 
their accomplishments, even in defeat. It seemed like they wanted 
this season to go on and on. 
</P>
<P>
	They had moved the folding chairs set up in front of each locker  
and formed a circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on, have a beer,'' Franco yelled to a teammate across the  
room. 
</P>
<P>
	By now the girlfriends and wives were in, consoling, just  
wanting to be part of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think every guy in this room should be proud of the way we  
handled ourselves,'' Franco said. ``We're champions in our own 
hearts.''

<HEADLINE> House GOP Push Voucher Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House conservatives sought support Wednesday  
for a plan to give poor students $3,500 private school vouchers. 
Democrats battled to save a program aimed at ensuring equality for 
girls in America's classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came as the House debated the renewal of an  
$8.3 billion federal education bill that governs programs for 
nearly 11 million of the nation's impoverished and failing 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering modest changes to Title I, the  
34-year-old law designed to raise the historically low achievement 
of poor children. After Title I's last overhaul in 1994, it became 
a high standards program, shifting from its remedial focus. 
</P>
<P>
	The House ended the first day of debate without passing the  
entire bill, but voting to retain the girls' program. 
</P>
<P>
	After speeches by several female lawmakers, more than 100  
Republicans joined the Democrats in restoring the $3 million 
program, which provides teachers and others information on ways to 
encourage girls to participate in science and math classes usually 
dominated by boys. The program had been eliminated by Republican 
critics on the House Education and the Workforce committee who said 
girls often do better than boys in their studies and therefore 
don't need special attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``This reaffirms our nation's commitment to offer girls an equal  
educational opportunity from the day they start school,'' said Rep. 
David Bonior of Michigan, the House's second-ranking Democrat. 
``That's where the difference has to be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Title I debate, which continues Thursday, will include  
consideration of a voucher plan by the House's second-ranking 
Republican, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas. The proposal would provide 
elementary students in low-performing schools with vouchers of up 
to $3,500 to help pay for tuition at other schools -- public, 
private or parochial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are shifting the focus off the school and onto the  
student,'' Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students in any grade who are victims of a violent criminal act  
at school also can apply for the vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you tell a parent when their child comes home  
injured?'' he said. ``Do you say to a child that you have to go 
back to a school, even if the governor has said it is an academic 
disaster?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate Republicans appeared to offer little support while  
Democrats said the voucher plan could jeopardize the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee  
planned to oppose the provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main focus of this program is to improve Title I,'' said  
Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., a former school superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the larger debate over Title I, Democrats sought to further  
target funding so it goes to the poorest of the nation's 50,000 
schools. Republicans want more flexibility for schools complaining 
of cumbersome federal rules and paperwork associated with a program 
that accounts for less than 10 percent of their total budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent series of reports from civil rights groups and  
conservatives has criticized the program, citing remaining gaps in 
the test scores and college attendance of poor and rich children. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the proposed changes lawmakers were considering Wednesday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Requiring parents of children in bilingual education to sign  
consent forms for the instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowing students with limited proficiency in English to be  
taught completely in their native languages instead of partially in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	--Making it more difficult to hire teacher's aides, in an effort  
to increase the number of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate Republican-backed bill would allow states more  
freedom in complying with Title I and other federal school 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend the Academic Achievement for All Act would turn  
federal education programs into a lump sum that states could invest 
in children who are neither poor nor low-achieving. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP was struggling to win votes for the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill number is H.R. 2.

	Hurricane Jose Thrashes Antigua  
</P>
<P>
	ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) -- Hurricane Jose ripped roofs from  
houses, tore down a newly built church and flung debris through 
deserted streets today as it made a direct hit on Antigua and 
threatened a string of other Caribbean islands. In a television 
broadcast, acting Prime Minister Sam Condor told the people of St.

	Senate Debates Late-Term Abortions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate began debate today on a bill that  
would ban some late-term abortions. Democrats denounced the 
legislation as unconstitutional and designed to boost GOP election 
prospects next year at the expense of women. The procedure in 
question involves the partial, feet-first delivery of a fetus and 
the draining of its skull contents. The bill would make it a felony 
punishable by a fine and/or a two-year prison term unless it the 
procedure is ``necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is 
endangered by a physical disorder, illness or injury.'' The mother 
could not be prosecuted under the measure. 

</P>
<P>
	Senate Bill Would Tax Cell Calls  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cell phone calls would be taxed as if they  
came from a caller's home or office regardless of where in the 
country they were made under a bill introduced in the Senate today. 
Backers of the plan contend it would eliminate a confusing 
patchwork of taxes on calls from mobile phones. Taxation of 
wireless phone calls currently is based on various factors such as 
the relay tower that picks up a phone's signal or the switching 
center that directs the call to its recipient. That means the same 
call could be taxed several times, especially if the caller moves 
through several cities, counties or states while talking.

	Gambling Opponents Eye S.C. Lottery  
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Gambling opponents fresh off victories in  
Alabama and South Carolina are bracing for another battle in South 
Carolina: stopping a proposed lottery. Last week, Alabama voters 
heeded their ministers and rejected the governor's plan for a state 
lottery, and South Carolina's highest court ordered the plugs be 
pulled on video gambling machines. The 737,000-member South 
Carolina Baptist Convention is preparing an anti-lottery resolution 
for its Nov. 8 annual meeting. Gambling opponents say as gambling 
spreads, more cities and towns see a toll in life savings lost and 
families destroyed.

	IBM Profits in Line, Stock Falls  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM's third-quarter profit grew 14 percent as  
the e-commerce explosion drove demand for computer software and 
services, but the company's stock plunged after a stern warning 
that hardware sales are being hit hard by Y2K fears. IBM posted 
profits of $1.69 billion for the July-September period, as opposed 
to $1.49 billion last year. Investors, however, were quickly 
unsettled by a new warning that customers are delaying purchases of 
IBM's powerful network and database servers amid worries the Year 
2000 date change may cause widespread computer failures. IBM's 
stock price fell to about $102 from $112.75 in after-hours trading.

industrial average rose 187.43 to close at 10,392.36. The Nasdaq

companies, was up 99.95 at 2,788.13.

	Rockies Name Buddy Bell Manager  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Rockies named former Detroit Tigers  
manager Buddy Bell their third manager today, succeeding Jim 
Leyland, who retired after the season. One of the best fielding 
third basemen of his generation, Bell played 18 seasons in the 
majors for Cleveland, Texas, Cincinnati and Houston. A five-time 
All-Star, he hit .279 for his career with 201 homers and 1,106 
RBIs. Bell managed the Tigers from 1996-98. Leyland quit after a 
72-90 season.

<HEADLINE> Mets Die, But Not Without Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- They had trouble believing it was over.  
</P>
<P>
	John Franco's eyes were red. Turk Wendell's, too.  
</P>
<P>
	When Kenny Rogers walked over to his locker, Wendell gave him a  
big bear hug. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything you've done in the past, they'll forget about and  
remember this,'' Rogers said Tuesday night after he walked in the 
winning run in the 11th inning, giving the Atlanta Braves an 
unforgettable 10-9 victory over the Mets and a 4-2 victory in the 
NL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' said Rogers, who once pitched a perfect game, `is just  
the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like vampires, these New York Mets refused to die, bouncing back  
again and again after hope had all but vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Al Leiter had nothing left Tuesday night, allowing his  
first five batters to score, and still the Mets came back from a 
5-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so typical of what's gone on,'' Leiter said. ``I thought  
for sure we would win this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York tied the score with three runs in the sixth and four  
more in the seventh, took an 8-7 lead on Melvin Mora's RBI single 
in the eighth and a 9-8 lead on Todd Pratt's sacrifice fly in the 
10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Franco blew it by allowing Brian Hunter's RBI single in the  
bottom of the eighth. And Armando Benitez blew it again in the 
10th, wasting Pratt's sacrifice fly by allowing Ozzie Guillen's 
run-scoring single in the bottom half. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the time Rogers walked Andruw Jones on a 3-2 pitch with  
the bases loaded, the Mets had made their mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a big boy,'' Rogers said. ``I can handle it. God thinks I  
can handle a lot. He can lay off me now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This team will be remembered not for failing to become the first  
team to overcome a 3-0 postseason deficit, but for its spellbinding 
twists and turns, the collapses and comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets had stirred so much hope with their amazin' turnaround  
on the season's final weekend, their tiebreaker playoff win at 
Cincinnati, their upset first-round victory over Arizona, with 
Pratt circling the bases with only the fourth homer that ended a 
postseason series. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came that 15-inning win Sunday on Ventura's  
grand-slam-turned-single, a game that forever will be remembered 
among baseball's best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think every guy in this room should be proud of the way we  
handled ourselves,'' Franco said. ``We're champions in our own 
hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 25 pitches by Leiter, it threatened to all come undone. For  
just the second time in 210 career starts, regular and postseason 
combined, he failed to get a single out. He called it the ``poorest 
start of my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But then the Mets, trying to create the first Subway Series  
since 1956, mounted their most spectacular rise from the dead, 
leaving the shocked Braves wondering what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	After five innings of slumber, Mike Piazza's sacrifice fly and  
Darryl Hamilton's two-run single pulled New York to 5-3 in the 
sixth 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after Jose Hernandez's two-run single off Dennis Cook in  
the bottom half made it 7-3, the Mets pulled even against John 
Smoltz on Rickey Henderson's RBI double, John Olerud's run-scoring 
single and Piazza's two-run homer, just his fourth hit in 23 
at-bats in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Benny Agbayani singled and scored go-ahead runs in the eighth  
and 10th. Pratt hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly. Mora singled in both 
innings and threw out Ryan Klesko at third base in the 10th, 
extending the Mets' life one more inning. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't enough. Gerald Williams doubled leading off the  
11th, advanced on Bret Boone's sacrifice and, after two intentional 
walks, Rogers walked home the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets walked off the field for the last time -- slowly,  
hanging their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gone a lot of miles,'' Piazza said. ``There's a lot of  
guys that matured in here. There's a lot of guys that have learned 
so much, not only about themselves, but what it takes to get to a 
World Series, not only the tangibles on the field, but the things 
that you don't see in a boxscore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one could kill the Mets this year. In the end, they killed  
themselves.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Descend on Calif. Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- Investigators are trying to determine  
why a project involving a laser designed to simulate the power of a 
nuclear explosion could be two years behind and millions of dollars 
over budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators from the General Accounting Office arrived at the  
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on Monday and a team from 
the University of California, which manages the lab under contract 
to the Department of Energy, visited Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Energy is also conducting a review.  
</P>
<P>
	The inquiries were prompted by the announcement last month that  
the project had run into trouble and could be $300 million over 
budget and two years late. 
</P>
<P>
	That was an unpleasant surprise for officials who had been told  
in June that the project, part of the effort to test nuclear 
weapons through computer simulations, was in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the House Committee on Armed Services has asked the  
GAO to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The UC team is interviewing scientist and management to find out  
what's behind the cost and schedule overruns and the delay in 
reporting them. UC expects a report later this year. The GAO report 
is due by February. 
</P>
<P>
	The super laser, called the National Ignition Facility, is a  
football-stadium sized machine described as a cornerstone of 
efforts to test nuclear weapons for reliability without actually 
blowing anything up. With its 192 laser beams, the device will 
shoot a target the size of a BB to simulate temperatures and 
pressures similar to those inside a nuclear explosion or at the 
sun's core. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction on the super laser, which was supposed to cost $1.1  
billion and be completed by 2003, began in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Allstate Profits Plunge 36 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHBROOK, Ill. (AP) -- Allstate Corp. reported its  
third-quarter operating income fell 36 percent due in part to 
competition that has forced auto insurers nationwide to lower their 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate said Wednesday it had operating earnings of $401  
million, or 51 cents a share, down from $625 million, or 76 cents a 
share, for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That was in line with the expectations of analysts surveyed by  
First Call/Thomson Financial. Analysts had lowered their forecasts 
for Allstate after the company warned last month its earnings would 
fall well below the 78 cents per share that Wall Street had been 
expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate stock rose 50 cents to $24.12 1/2 in New York Stock  
Exchange trading Wednesday. The company's shares have lost about a 
quarter of their value since the announcement Sept. 24 that profits 
would fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate said its net earnings, which reflect capital gains from  
asset sales, came to $490 million, or 62 cents per share, down 31 
percent from $713 million, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue came to $6.55 billion, up 1.8 percent from $6.44  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company cited as reasons for its poor showing competitive  
pricing pressure, higher auto claims, catastrophe losses that 
increased to $265 million from $192 million -- partly as a result of 
flooding claims from Hurricane Floyd -- and additional strengthening 
of reserves for asbestos-related losses on past policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Company executives were silent on what changes, including any  
layoffs, can be expected from a review it is conducting of its cost 
structure and prices. Results are to be announced in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed with the results for the quarter, but  
continue to be encouraged by the positive progress in our core 
businesses,'' said Edward M. Liddy, Allstate's chairman, president 
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Allstate reported operating income of  
$1.67 billion, or $2.07 a share, down 13.4 percent from $1.93 
billion, or $2.30 a share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month net income came to $2.3 billion, or $2.84 a share,  
down 9.4 percent from $2.53 billion, or $3.01 a share, a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues came to $19.95 billion, up 2.7 percent from $19.43  
billion.

<HEADLINE> Martha Stewart, WWF Stocks Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Would Martha Stewart stand a chance against  
Stone Cold Steve Austin? It might be a one-sided bout in the 
wrestling ring, but on Wall Street, Martha is proving to be a 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies associated with Ms. Stewart and pro wrestling both had  
hugely successful initial public offerings Tuesday, richly 
rewarding entrepreneurs who have succeeded in capturing devoted 
audiences through TV, magazines, the Internet and merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to imagine those audiences having much in common --  
unless gladiator-esque titans like The Rock start donning aprons 
and baking Christmas cookies -- but investors seem to agree that 
both companies offer tremendous value. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of both World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. and  
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. soared well above their 
offering prices in heavy trading, though both ended off their high 
levels for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stewart rang the opening bell at the New York Stock  
Exchange, a privilege often offered to executives bringing their 
companies public. What followed was a frenzy to buy up shares in 
her company. 
</P>
<P>
	Omnimedia's shares ended at $35.62 1/2, off from their high of  
$49.50 but well over the offering price of $18 per share. The stock 
was the eighth-most traded on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF also had a body slam of an opening. It ended at $30 per  
share after going as high as $35, way over its offering price of 
$17. WWF was the fourth-most traded stock on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The rave reception for both companies marked a ringing  
endorsement for a strategy skillfully employed by both companies: 
delivering a specific niche audience to advertisers and eventually 
dominating the niche completely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pioneered a new media category which is called lifestyle,''  
Ms. Stewart said in an interview on CNBC. ``Nobody else ever did it 
before, and we did it, and we intend to really dominate this area 
for a very long time to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stewart uses two television shows, two magazines, a radio  
show, a syndicated newspaper column and a Web site to dispense 
sensible ``how-to'' information for homemakers on cooking, 
gardening, and keeping homes running smoothly. She has also sold 27 
books. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF, for its part, has a hammerlock on the young, male TV  
audiences coveted so badly by big advertisers. Its main show, Raw 
is War, was the top rated regularly scheduled cable TV program for 
19 weeks through June 1999. WWF also produces 200 live events a 
year, creating story lines for more than 100 wrestling characters. 
</P>
<P>
	Targeting niche audiences is a media strategy used often with  
success by giant conglomerates like Time Warner Inc., where Ms. 
Stewart worked until two years ago. But it's less often that media 
entrepreneurs are able to start new companies from scratch and 
build up multiple media properties around them. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the WWF and Ms. Stewart have grown explosively in the past  
few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF -- which dwarfs its competition World Championship  
Wrestling, owned by Time Warner -- earned $56 million in its last 
fiscal year on revenues of $252 million, up sharply from profits of 
$8.5 million the year before on revenues of $126.2 million. Ms. 
Stewart's Omnimedia had net income of $13 million last year on 
revenues of $180 million, compared to profits of $7 million on 
revenues of $109 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Styponias, a media industry analyst at Prudential  
Securities, says both companies owe their success to doing ``a 
tremendous job building their brands ... If you're able to 
cultivate premier content on its own, broadcasters will seek you 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the down side, both companies rely very heavily on their  
founders for creative and managerial support, and could be 
devastated with their loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after going public, both the WWF and Omnimedia will be  
controlled more than 95 percent by their founders, meaning that 
shareholders won't have much of a say in how the companies are run.

<HEADLINE> Vote on Umpires' Union May Be Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Lawyers involved in the umpires' dispute were close to an  
agreement Wednesday that would set up an election by mail next 
month to determine the fate of the current union and its head, 
Richie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting at the National Labor Relations Board in New York, the  
sides tentatively rescheduled the date of a hearing on the election 
to Oct. 29, but were confident the hearing wouldn't be needed, 
according to one lawyer familiar with the talks who spoke on the 
condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sides agree, the hearing would be canceled and ballots  
would be mailed to umpires in November, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissident umpires angry with Phillips filed a petition last week  
with the NLRB to hold an election to decertify the current union 
and form a new one. Under federal labor law, 30 percent of the 
members of a bargaining unit can force an election, which is then 
determined by a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	There are currently 93 major league umpires, including the 22  
whose resignations were accepted by the American and National 
leagues last month. The dissidents have said they are willing to 
allow all 93 to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Phillips called for all umpires to resign en masse,  
hoping it would cause an early start to negotiations for a labor 
contract to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy backfired when most AL umpires either refused to  
resign or quickly withdrew their resignations. Owners then hired 25 
new umpires from the minor leagues and accepted the resignations of 
the 22. 
</P>
<P>
	While the current union has filed a grievance to regain those 22  
jobs, the date for the start of the hearing has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissident umpires want Ron Shapiro, the agent for Cal  
Ripken, to negotiate their next contract instead of Phillips.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Cos. Shy From Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARKAN, West Bank (AP) -- In this clean, landscaped industrial  
park next to a Jewish settlement, some of Israel's best-known 
companies produce pretzels, steel doors and wine -- but not a single 
multinational is represented. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign companies shy away from the controversy generated by  
investment in settlements, built on land claimed by the 
Palestinians and considered obstacles to Mideast peace by most of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders' trepidations were reinforced recently when  
Arab-American groups threatened to boycott Burger King because the 
U.S. fast-food chain opened a franchise in Maaleh Adumim, the West 
Bank's largest settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Burger King quickly withdrew, and the Miami-based company said  
it had been misled by its Israeli franchise operator who claimed 
the restaurant was in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rome-based textile giant, Benetton, is the latest to shy  
away, after an e-mail boycott drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Keller of the Israel Peace Bloc, a tiny group on the fringe  
of Israeli politics, generated the e-mail blitz against Benetton 
after reading that its subsidiary, Kappa, was considering 
production in the Barkan industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Benetton official, Marco Boglione, wrote that Kappa  
``never had any intention of investing in any manufacturing 
facility, either in Israel or in the territories,'' according to 
the company's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Kappa managing director Roy Hollander, an Israeli, doesn't see  
it that way. He said Kappa is still considering contracting out 
some production to a textile factory in Elkana, a settlement next 
to Barkan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would not be doing anything illegal,'' said Hollander,  
pointing out that most of the workers at the Elkana plant are 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials at the Benetton-affiliated Basic Group, Kappa's  
holding company, said Hollander is at odds with company policy. 
</P>
<P>
	At Barkan, operators say foreign companies staying clear of  
settlement industrial parks hurt Palestinians as much as settlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Driving around the industrial park's wide, clean streets, Barkan  
manager Etti Aloush pointed to Palestinian license plates and said 
half the 5,000 workers at the park are Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 100 small- and medium-sized factories at Barkan have  
international partners, but some entrepreneurs expect that may 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Eyal Holzman, 38, who owns an egg factory, has fielded an  
approach from agents in Israel representing Progress Co. Ltd., a 
Japanese industrial giant, about building a sister factory in 
Barkan. 
</P>
<P>
	Holzman said he declined, for now, because the Japanese company  
was ``a bit too big for us,'' but didn't rule out future 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Aki Yamazaki, coordinator for Progress Co. in Israel, said the  
talks about a new factory were informal and that company officials 
in Japan were not involved at this stage. Yamazaki said there was 
nothing wrong with setting up shop in a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Holzman said he didn't expect Barkan to be uprooted as part of a  
permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians. The park is just 
beyond the so-called Green Line, the former divider between Israel 
and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see why an imaginary line 10 kilometers (6.2 miles)  
from here should affect this factory,'' Holzman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians applaud the boycott. They consider the settlements  
illegal encroachment on their land, where they intend to set up a 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are against plants and branches of international firms in  
settlements, because they give these settlements legitimacy,'' said 
Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian minister for economic development. 
</P>
<P>
	The Peace Bloc boycott infuriates Ron Nahman, mayor of the  
nearby settlement of Ariel, the West Bank's second largest. 
</P>
<P>
	With 15,000 residents, Ariel has no McDonald's, Tower Records,  
Blockbuster Video and other foreign outlets that have sprung up all 
over Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Nahman said he tried to persuade Mc Donald's to open a franchise  
in Ariel, but failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``So what?'' he said. ``We eat falafel.''

	Someone had scrawled ``No Justice in U.S.A.'' in red marker on  
the plain marble slab covering the grave at St. James Episcopal

<P>
	The vandalism was reported Monday, five days after a grand jury  
in Boulder, Colo., ended its 13-month investigation of the killing

</P>
<P>
	The couple has insisted they had nothing to do with their  
daughter's death, although Boulder police have said they remain 
under an ``umbrella of suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Townsend said police are investigating the vandalism at the  
grave, have no leads.

<HEADLINE> Nets Sign Sherman Douglas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Nets signed veteran  
point guard Sherman Douglas to a multiyear contract Wednesday. 
Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1 Douglas averaged 8.2 points and 4.1 assists a game  
for the Nets during the 1997-1998 season, but couldn't come to an 
agreement last season and instead signed with the Los Angeles 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm delighted that we can add Sherman to our backcourt  
rotation,'' Nets coach Don Casey said. ``Sherman is a quality 
veteran that responds well to pressure, and his addition adds to 
the depth of our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas will back up star point guard Stephon Marbury, who  
averaged 21 points and eight assists last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, 33, has averaged 11.6 points and 6.4 assists a game for  
a career that includes stints in Miami, Boston and Milwaukee.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Residents Face More Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Although he is still unable to live in  
his home that was flooded by heavy rains from Hurricane Floyd, 
William Boyd is undaunted in trying to make the house inhabitable 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	His recovery effort was delayed after a brief encounter with  
Hurricane Irene. And there is still the possibility of more 
flooding as rivers crest this week and Hurricane Jose churns in the 
Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boyd remains positive.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've all had it hard,'' the 61-year-old retiree said Tuesday.  
``I think it will be a better town when it's all done because now 
we are looking out for each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping a positive attitude isn't so easy these days for the  
2,100 residents of this proud community founded by freed slaves 
that's now a soggy ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
	The great flood of 1999 that followed Hurricane Floyd drenched  
eastern North Carolina in 20 inches of rain, and put Princeville 
under 15 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not be over.  
</P>
<P>
	The Tar River was expected to crest today 3 feet above flood  
stage. Elsewhere, the Cape Fear and Neuse rivers were expected to 
crest as high as 8 feet above flood stage this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of the flooding is expected to approach the  
catastrophic scale seen from Floyd. Officials say it will be at 
least next year before the town will be fit to live in again -- even 
if no more rain falls in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony to that is plentiful: At a Princeville used-car lot on  
Tuesday, the hoods and doors of cars were opened to air out, and 
workers were rinsing mud from the interiors and engine 
compartments. All the cars bore a yellow tag with the name of an 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, yellow county signs adorned the fronts of many  
Princeville houses, declaring them uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
	At Boyd's home, furniture, clothing, appliances, cabinets were  
among the items heaped in great piles in the back yard. Like other 
residents, they were airing out some clothes on trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd understands why some of his younger neighbors are angry and  
frustrated after more than a month of flooding and evacuations. But 
he says they need to look at the bigger picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just as good to smile as it is to frown,'' he said after  
leading visitors on a tour of his home, where floodwaters rose 
higher than he could reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The small home where he and his wife, Nanny, raised three sons  
is on the verge of being condemned. But not if Boyd can help it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been down before,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Life is sometimes like a rubber ball,'' he added. ``You've got  
to bounce with it and hope you don't get flattened.''

<HEADLINE> KKK Sues New York City Over Permit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Ku Klux Klan group has sued New York City,  
claiming the police department improperly denied them a permit to 
hold a rally and that they have a First Amendment right to wear 
hoods at the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the police denied a Klan branch, the Church of the  
American Knights, a permit to gather this coming weekend because 
the group planned to wear its traditional white robes and hoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The permit was denied on the grounds that the hoods violate a  
state statute that prohibits groups from congregating in public 
places while wearing masks or disguising their faces, except at 
authorized masquerade parties or other entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court on behalf of the  
Klan by the New York Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of the message, the First Amendment says people  
have a right to express their views,'' said NYCLU executive 
director Norman Siegel. ``They have a right to anonymous political 
activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siegel said the statute violates the First Amendment and has  
rarely been used since it went into effect 150 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But a top city lawyer, Daniel Connolly, said the anti-mask law  
is constitutionally valid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to enforce it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Amsterdam News and activist Al Sharpton's National  
Action Network filed friend of the court briefs in support of the 
KKK's constitutional right to rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Amsterdam News believes the message of the Klan is  
repugnant,'' said Elinor Tatum, publisher and editor in chief of 
the black-oriented paper. ``The reason we filed a friend of the 
court brief was not in support of the Klan, but in support of the 
Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tatum noted that her newspaper had supported the right of  
Khallid Muhammad to hold the Million Youth March and of the 
Brooklyn Museum to hold an art exhibit protested by Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani. ``For us not to stand up in this case and for the right 
to protest would be a double standard,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lawsuit, the Klan contends its members wear hoods to  
protect their identities because they've been subject to 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of Klan opponents also sued the city Tuesday, claiming  
the police violated their rights by denying them a permit for a 
counterdemonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cases were expected to be heard Thursday by a two-judge  
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	KKK Grand Dragon James Sheeley of Walden, N.Y., said the group  
chose New York for the rally to promote white pride and to overturn 
the mask law. The Klan has tried to get anti-mask laws overturned 
in various areas of the country.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Joins Eurofighter Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Boeing Co. will jointly develop an air-to-air  
missile for the Eurofighter jet together with France's Aerospatiale 
Matra SA and British Aerospace PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing and its European partners will compete head-to-head with  
Raytheon Co. of the United States for a $1.7 billion contract to 
supply Meteor missiles for the 232 Eurofighter Typhoon jets on 
order by the British government. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Boeing will help integrate the systems of the  
Meteor and the Eurofighter and provide expertise in low-cost 
manufacturing, Jim Schlueter, a spokesman for Boeing's military 
operations, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing will act as an adviser and won't take an equity stake in  
the venture, which will continue to be controlled by the European 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related move, British Aerospace and Aerospatiale Matra have  
agreed with Italy's Finmeccanica SpA to pool their missile 
operations into a single business. The combination, announced 
today, would be the world's second-largest missile business after 
Raytheon. 
</P>
<P>
	The two developments underscore the rapid pace of consolidation  
in the capital-intensive weapons trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of the Cold War a decade ago has left Europe's defense  
companies grabbing for shares of a dwindling arms market and has 
inspired a round of pan-European mergers. More transatlantic deals 
are expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing and British Aerospace have already worked together to  
develop the Harrier jump jet and T-45 naval trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Meteor project takes their relationship ``to the next step  
of real transatlantic cooperation,'' Schlueter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing, which makes the Harpoon anti-ship missile, sees the  
Meteor as an opportunity to expand into the air-to-air side of the 
missile business. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing will market the Meteor in the United States and any other  
markets that the joint-venture may agree upon. Its decision to join 
the project followed years of talks with the British and French 
companies, Schlueter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Meteor missile will have a range of up to 25 miles and the  
companies developing it hope to market it wherever Eurofighters 
might be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace spokesman Simon Raynes said he believed the  
Meteor partners have a big advantage over Raytheon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a European missile because we believe that having an  
American missile could put restrictions on the export of 
Eurofighter to certain countries,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eurofighter jet -- being developed jointly by Britain,  
Germany, Italy and Spain -- is an effort to pool Europe's high-tech 
resources in order to compete more effectively in the 
U.S.-dominated weapons business. 
</P>
<P>
	Raynes said the Meteor is more advanced and probably also more  
expensive than Raytheon's missile. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the three-way cooperation between BAe, Aerospatiale  
Matra and Finmeccanica grew from months of talks between the 
British and Italian companies. 
</P>
<P>
	BAe is seeking to buy the Marconi defense-electronics business  
from Britain's General Electric Co., and Marconi already has a 
joint venture with Finmeccanica's Alenia Difesa unit to develop 
missiles and radar systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Marconi and Finmeccanica have agreed to remove the missile  
operations from that venture, called Alenia Marconi Systems, and 
merge them with Matra-BAe Dynamics -- a separate joint venture 
between BAe and Aerospatiale Matra. 
</P>
<P>
	Finmeccanica will therefore become part of Matra-BAe Dynamics.  
</P>
<P>
	Aerospatiale Matra, BAe and Finmeccanica confirmed their linkup  
at a news conference in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``This move is a natural development in the consolidation of the  
European aerospace and defense industry,'' the chief executives of 
the three parent companies said. John Weston of BAe, Philippe Camus 
of Aerospatiale Matra and Alberto Lina of Finmeccanica said the 
move would also create cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The French and British partners will each have a 37.5 percent  
stake in the new group, while Finmeccanica will hold the remaining 
25 percent. The combination is still subject to regulatory 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Formation of the new group comes just a week after Aerospatiale  
Matra announced that it will merge with DASA, the German aerospace 
unit of DaimlerChrysler, to create the world's third-largest 
aerospace company. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Tuesday, DASA and Aerospatiale Matra announced plans to  
join with Britain's Marconi Electronic Systems to form Europe's 
largest space-technology business, called Astrium.

<HEADLINE> AOL Quarterly Earnings Triple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. reported quarterly  
earnings of $184 million Wednesday as it trumpeted a deal to have 
its Internet software loaded onto computers sold by Gateway Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Gateway, which will receive $800 million over two  
years, will allow AOL to reach even more consumers in a time when 
it continues to expand its global reach, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as AOL released first-quarter earnings of  
15 cents per diluted share. The $184 million was up from $50 
million, or 4 cents per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had been  
expecting earnings of 13 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose to $1.5 billion, a 47 percent increase over last  
year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL added nearly 1.1 million new members worldwide in the period  
ended Sept. 30, giving the world's largest Internet service 
provider 18.7 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive officer Steve Case said the results  
show the growing importance of AOL's products in the lives of 
Internet users. AOL products reach eight of 10 American Internet 
users, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This quarter's results clearly demonstrate America Online's  
leadership and growing earnings power,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dulles, Va.-based company's subscription revenues reached  
$995 million, and the average daily minutes online of its members 
hit 55 minutes, an increase of eight minutes over last year's first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from advertising, commerce and other sources climbed to  
$350 million, up from $175 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	To expand its reach, the company is making its e-mail services  
available on Palm Pilot hand-held computers and last week announced 
an alliance with Motorola that will allow users of AOL's instant 
messaging service to communicate with users of Motorola's wireless 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also continued to broaden its services, signing a  
deal with drkoop.com, the online health care information company 
headed by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. AOL also expanded 
its travel and personal finance offerings during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of America Online rose $2.75 in trading Wednesday to $118  
on the New York Stock Exchange. In after-hours trading, investors 
pushed AOL shares down a bit to $117.50.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal Remains Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor spent a second night in  
the hospital where he is being treated for dehydration and a blood 
clot in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The cardinal hopes to be released today from Memorial  
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said his spokesman, Joe Zwilling. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, 79, who underwent five weeks of radiation treatments  
after having a brain tumor removed in September, was readmitted on 
Monday for treatment of side effects from radiation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors found O'Connor was ``recovering normally from the  
radiation treatments'' but that he was slightly dehydrated and has 
a blood clot in his left leg, Zwilling said. He said the clot is 
being treated with a special filter to keep it from moving. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor had his last radiation treatment Oct. 11. The therapy  
left him so exhausted that he missed Mass the last two Sundays at 
St. Patrick's Cathedral, skipped the Columbus Day Parade last week 
and canceled an appearance at the cathedral Monday.

<HEADLINE>  Indians, Hershiser Discuss Managing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- While Orel Hershiser was trying to pitch the New  
York Mets to the World Series, he learned a new career may be just 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Indians have talked to him about becoming their  
next manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a couple of brief conversations,'' Hershiser said on  
the field Tuesday night before the Mets lost the NL Championship 
Series to Atlanta in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser, who pitched for the Indians from 1995-97, is well  
liked and respected by Cleveland general manager John Hart. The 
41-year-old right-hander went 13-12 with a 4.58 ERA for the Mets 
this year, improving his career record to 203-145. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart fired Mike Hargrove last week after the Indians lost to  
Boston 3-2 in the first round of the AL playoffs. Hershiser said he 
understood he was the top choice on some Cleveland fan Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when this part is over, that is something I would be  
interested in, interested in talking to John about,'' Hershiser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets general manager Steve Phillips said he had not heard the  
Indians had an interest in Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Mets' season extending into late October, Hershiser and  
Hart decided to put off more detailed discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agreed it's not fair to me to talk about it now,''  
Hershiser said. ``We'll talk when this thing is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser allowed one hit in 4 1-3 shutout innings against  
Atlanta during the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser won the 1988 NL Cy Young Award while pitching for the  
Los Angeles Dodgers, ending the regular season with a major 
league-record 59 consecutive scoreless innings. After going 23-8 
during the regular season, he was MVP of the NL championship series 
and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famer George Brett also has been mentioned as a possible  
candidate along with Indians batting coach Charlie Manuel, Davey 
Lopes, Chris Chambliss, Willie Randolph, Don Baylor and Ted 
Simmons.

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Report Raises Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New questions are being raised about the  
Pentagon's decision before the Persian Gulf War to give soldiers an 
experimental drug now suspected as a possible cause of the 
mysterious Gulf War illnesses afflicting thousands of veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon raised the possibility for the first time Tuesday  
of a connection between Gulf War syndrome and the administering of 
pyridostigmine bromide, or PB, to an estimated 250,000 soldiers. It 
said more scientific study is needed before it can either confirm a 
connection or rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
	Rand Corp., a Pentagon-financed research group, examined about  
1,000 published studies on PB and concluded that a possible 
connection ``cannot be dismissed.'' PB has been used for decades to 
treat the neurological disease myasthenia gravis. In the Gulf War 
it was given to troops as protection against potential attack by 
the nerve agent soman, even though there was no evidence to suggest 
that Iraq had soman. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading critic of the Pentagon's investigation of possible  
causes of Gulf War syndrome, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said 
the Pentagon never should have given troops PB in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no evidence that soman was even in Iraq's arsenal,''  
Rockefeller said. ``In my view, the conclusion was inescapable that 
military men and women were being needlessly subjected to a 
possibly unsafe and ineffective treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Rostker, head of the Pentagon's search for possible  
causes of Gulf War syndrome, told a news conference that in the 
future the Pentagon would take more care to substantiate suspicions 
of a soman threat before ordering troops to take PB. The drug is 
ingested in pill form every eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``PB was given when there was a threat of Iraq using nerve  
agents, when there was concern that soman might have been in the 
inventory,'' said Rostker. He suggested that in the future harder 
evidence of a threat would be necessary before commanders would be 
authorized to administer the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatrice Alexandra Golomb, main author of the Rand study, wrote,  
``No evidence uncovered suggests they (the Iraqis) had soman or had 
weaponized it.'' She said the possibility that the Soviet Union, 
which does have soman, might sell some to Iraq caused U.S. 
authorities to order that PB be distributed.

<HEADLINE>  Dole Quits Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, who had hoped to make history  
as the nation's first female president, dropped out of the rapidly 
shrinking Republican presidential race today. She said a lack of 
money doomed her spirited candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is money,'' she said. ``It would be futile to  
continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her departure leaves front-runner George W. Bush, Arizona Sen.  
John McCain and conservative millionaire Steve Forbes in the top 
tier of the GOP field -- a trio of candidates likely to carry their 
fight well into the primary season. She is the fifth GOP candidate 
to drop out this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other candidates are vying for conservative voters,  
including Pat Buchanan, who plans to bolt the GOP on Monday to seek 
the Reform Party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The first woman to mount a top-tier presidential campaign, Mrs.  
Dole's campaign attracted new voters -- particularly young and 
professional women -- to the Republican Party. She finished strong 
in an early political contest -- Iowa's non-binding straw poll in 
August -- and displayed a practiced polish on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
	But the wife of 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole was  
unable to overcome the huge financial advantage of Bush, the Texas 
governor who raised more than ten times as much money in 1999. She 
also was unable to convert the raw enthusiasm of her rallies into 
improved poll ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	She is likely to be considered by the eventual nominee as a  
potential running mate, but Dole said today she has not given any 
thought to a vice presidential nod. She also said she had no plans 
yet to endorse a rival. 
</P>
<P>
	With her husband at her side -- she gave him a peck on the cheek  
at one point -- Dole told supporters that her long career in public 
service is not over. 
</P>
<P>
	``To my friends, I say, `Take heart. We will meet again and  
often,''' she said. ``While I may not be a candidate for the 
presidency in 2000, I'm a long way from twilight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she wanted to help the GOP bring women into the party's  
fold. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Forbes stood to benefit from a narrower field that  
would give them more room to attract attention. Bush advisers had 
hoped Dole would stay in the race to deflect attention and split up 
votes going against the front-running, establishment candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, consultants say Bush is likely to inherit most of Dole's  
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush called her a trailblazer who was an inspiration to women.  
``I'm proud to call her a friend,' the Texas governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he was sorry Dole had decided to withdraw from the  
presidential race, but that she had done so for the ``wrong 
reason'' -- money woes. ``The right reason is because you've lost 
the battle of ideas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spokeswoman, Juleanna Glover Weiss welcomed the smaller  
field. ``Fewer people talking means more of an opportunity for 
Steve to talk about what he believes in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, who has made inroads against Forbes among  
conservatives, said, ``Part of me is pleased when anybody gets out 
and I'm still in. But it's sad to see the first serious female 
candidate have to drop out of the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, President Clinton said he regretted that  
finances kept Dole from competing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's too bad because I think she has the kind of  
experience that's different from that of any other person running, 
in the Cabinet and the Red Cross, and I think it's a loss to the 
Republican Party and a loss to the country that she couldn't go 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His spokesman Joe Lockhart used the news to criticize the GOP.  
``It underscores at least among Republicans how little the ideas 
mean and how much the money means,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said he wished Dole well. ``She is a fine  
person, an experienced leader and I have nothing but respect for 
her,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole sounded embittered by the reality of politics, which found  
her cash-strapped and being outspent 75-to-1. She singled out Bush, 
the son of a former president, and Forbes, a wealthy conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned that the current political calendar and election  
laws favor those who get an early start and can tap into huge 
private fortunes or who have a pre-existing network of political 
supporters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She proudly listed her campaign promises, including a pledge to  
strengthen America's foreign policy, improve education and get guns 
out of schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's race for the White House came to an end just less than  
three months after a surprisingly solid third-place finish in 
Iowa's straw poll. The finish gave her a chance to boost her 
campaign, which was already sagging in polls and money-starved. 
</P>
<P>
	She was unable to capitalize. In the most recent campaign  
spending reports, Dole reported raising more than $1 million from 
July to September. By comparison, Bush raised $20.2 million during 
the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Though second place in many national polls -- hovering around 10  
percent -- she was trailing McCain in New Hampshire and lagged well 
behind Bush elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Dole fought off rumors of the impending demise  
of her campaign by announcing that she would formally kick off her 
presidential bid on Nov. 7. She said she hoped that date will turn 
into the anniversary of her election to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Dole canceled a campaign appearance in  
Indianapolis at the last minute. A campaign official said Dole was 
ill, and a letter faxed to Indiana GOP Chairman Mike McDaniel 
referred to ``unforeseen circumstances'' that prevented her 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, when she formed a presidential exploratory committee,  
Dole explained her reasons for seeking the White House this way: 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe our people are looking for leaders who will call  
America to her better nature. Yes, we've been let down, and by 
people we should have been able to look up to.''

<HEADLINE>  Indians, Hershiser Discuss Managing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- While Orel Hershiser was trying to pitch the New  
York Mets to the World Series, he learned a new career may be just 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Indians have talked to him about becoming their  
next manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a couple of brief conversations,'' Hershiser said on  
the field Tuesday night before the Mets lost the NL Championship 
Series to Atlanta in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser, who pitched for the Indians from 1995-97, is well  
liked and respected by Cleveland general manager John Hart. The 
41-year-old right-hander went 13-12 with a 4.58 ERA for the Mets 
this year, improving his career record to 203-145. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart fired Mike Hargrove last week after the Indians lost to  
Boston 3-2 in the first round of the AL playoffs. Hershiser said he 
understood he was the top choice on some Cleveland fan Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when this part is over, that is something I would be  
interested in, interested in talking to John about,'' Hershiser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets general manager Steve Phillips said he had not heard the  
Indians had an interest in Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Mets' season extending into late October, Hershiser and  
Hart decided to put off more detailed discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agreed it's not fair to me to talk about it now,''  
Hershiser said. ``We'll talk when this thing is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser allowed one hit in 4 1-3 shutout innings against  
Atlanta during the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser won the 1988 NL Cy Young Award while pitching for the  
Los Angeles Dodgers, ending the regular season with a major 
league-record 59 consecutive scoreless innings. After going 23-8 
during the regular season, he was MVP of the NL championship series 
and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famer George Brett also has been mentioned as a possible  
candidate along with Indians batting coach Charlie Manuel, Davey 
Lopes, Chris Chambliss, Willie Randolph, Don Baylor and Ted 
Simmons.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Pet 'Owners' Irked by Label </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a city where some people are as likely  
as their four-legged friends to wear dog collars, the line between 
the species is being blurred even further by pet owners who want to 
be known henceforth as ``pet guardians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Language shapes attitudes, they say, and the word ``owner''  
encourages people to treat pets like disposable property. So they 
are asking that city ordinances be reworded to add ``pet guardian'' 
as an alternative term. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's Animal Control and Welfare Commission is considering  
it and will probably vote on it in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The fur is flying over the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	Supporters liken their cause to abolition and women's suffrage.  
Lots of other people just roll their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love my dog dearly,'' said Jenny Huston, who watched her  
golden retriever, Giacomo, run with other dogs in Duboce Park on a 
recent balmy afternoon. But she added: ``I am not his guardian. I 
bought and paid for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, she asked, ``What's the difference?''  
</P>
<P>
	Legally, nothing, according to the city attorney who drafted the  
changes. Owners and guardians would have the same rights and 
responsibilities, and pets would still be personal property. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea came from Elliot Katz, founder of a 15-year-old  
organization called In Defense of Animals. The proposal is also 
under consideration in Marin County, just north of San Francisco, 
where Katz lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita Carswell, who says she is a ``guardian'' of 10 cats, wore  
a ``primate freedom'' tag to an animal control and welfare 
commission meeting last week and told the commissioners they have a 
duty as officers of this famously liberal city to send the measure 
to the Board of Supervisors for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if this can't happen in San Francisco, where can it  
happen?'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, this is the city that sponsors Pet Pride Day and is  
the home of George, a pet store that sells whole-grain dog biscuits 
for $13 a pound. It is also the city with a $7 million SPCA shelter 
where stray cats and dogs live in private ``condos'' furnished with 
wicker furniture, pillows, framed prints and TVs that play nature 
programs and cartoons. The staff includes six behaviorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate has led to a hissing match on the editorial pages.  
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Finkler of Sunnyvale wrote that if animals have  
rights, they have responsibilities, too. ``Start charging them 
rent,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> AOL, Gateway Form Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- America Online, the world's largest Internet  
service provider, is teaming with Gateway Inc., the country's 
leading seller of made-to-order personal computers, to market and 
distribute each other's products. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the two-year deal the companies announced Wednesday,  
AOL will invest $800 million in cash and equity securities in San 
Diego-based Gateway Inc.; $180 million of that in AOL stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway will spend $85 million to feature and market AOL  
products and services on its PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the Internet fans out into the mainstream ... people are  
looking for technology leaders like Gateway and AOL to drive out 
the complexity and simplify the Internet,'' said Jeff Weitzen, 
Gateway president and CEO. ``This exciting new relationship does 
just that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Pittman, AOL president and CEO, said pairing the companies  
is natural. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gateway was the first PC manufacturer to start its own  
internet service provider, recognizing that the Internet was a 
major reason why people buy PCs,'' Pittman said. ``We're pleased 
they have decided to work with AOL to take this business to the 
next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL will add the 600,000 subscribers to that successful ISP,  
Gateway.net, to its base of 18 million members and another 2 
million subscribers through its CompuServe subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway has 5 million customers and 180 stores nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
	The companies will collaborate on an online software store and  
offer computer and Internet training programs for AOL subscribers 
who own Gateway computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers who buy a Gateway computer will find AOL and  
Gateway.net installed on their PCs, and can choose either one as an 
Internet service provider. AOL will control the operation, billing 
and customer service for both Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials made the announcement after the U.S. markets  
closed in regular trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Dulles, Va.-based AOL reported third quarter net  
income of $184 million, or 15 cents per share, up from $50 million, 
or 4 cents per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway reported a net profit of $113.2 million, or 35 cents per  
split-adjusted share, for the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30. 
That's 40 percent higher than the same period last year, when 
Gateway earned $80.6 million, or 25 cents per split-adjusted share. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL expects to incur a pre-tax charge of $30 million in the  
fourth quarter of this year for costs associated with the deal; 
Gateway will report costs of $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to  
close by year's end.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Joins Eurofighter Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- In another step in previously unheard of  
cross-border cooperation in the arms industry, Boeing Co. is 
teaming up with British Aerospace PLC and France's Aerospatiale 
Matra SA in a bid to arm the Eurofighter jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's move Wednesday intensifies competition to market the  
next generation of air-to-air missiles and demonstrates a marked 
decrease in politicization of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	By bringing U.S. heavyweight Boeing on board, the European  
partners in the Meteor missile project hope to beat out another 
American defense industry power, Raytheon Co., for the $1.7 billion 
contract with Britain's Royal Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years after the end of the Cold War, defense companies are  
grabbing for shares of a shrinking arms market, and competitive 
pressures are inspiring a wave of mergers. The latest round of 
deals would combine European aerospace companies seeking to become 
tougher competitors against the Americans, including Boeing, the 
industry leader. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, more joint ventures are expected between  
European and U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do believe that trans-Atlantic relationships are in the  
best interests of the industry and of customers on both sides of 
the ocean,'' said Jim Schlueter, a spokesman for Boeing's military 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Boeing also wants to help sell the Meteor in the  
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because it will be a pseudo-U.S. project as well, the Pentagon  
should be more sympathetic to the idea of buying Meteor missiles 
for itself,'' said Zafar Khan, an aerospace analyst in London with 
French bank Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related move, British Aerospace and Aerospatiale Matra have  
agreed with Italy's Finmeccanica SpA to pool their missile 
operations into a single business. The combination, also announced 
Wednesday, would be second only to Raytheon in that business. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing and its European partners will compete head-to-head with  
Raytheon to supply missiles for the 232 Eurofighter Typhoon jets 
that Britain has ordered. The Eurofighter is being developed 
jointly by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's decision is crucial for the Meteor's success elsewhere  
in Europe, analysts said. Other European military customers are 
eager to buy the Meteor, but are wary of the high costs of 
developing the missile. If Britain places a big order, it could 
bring down the Meteor's price for all buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing will help make the Meteor's systems compatible with U.S.  
aircraft and other countries. It also will provide expertise in 
low-cost manufacturing, Schlueter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing will act as an adviser and won't take an ownership stake  
in the venture, which will continue to be controlled by the 
European partners through a partnership called Matra BAe Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing and BAe have already worked together to develop the  
Harrier jump jet and T-45 naval trainer. The Meteor project takes 
their relationship ``to the next step of real trans-Atlantic 
cooperation,'' Schlueter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing, which makes the Harpoon anti-ship missile, sees the  
Meteor as a good opportunity to expand into the air-to-air side of 
the missile business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Meteor missile will have a range of up to 25 miles, and the  
companies developing it hope to market it wherever Eurofighters 
might be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	BAe spokesman Simon Raynes said he believed the Meteor partners  
have a big advantage over Raytheon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a European missile because we believe that having an  
American missile could put restrictions on the export of 
Eurofighter to certain countries,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raynes said the Meteor is more advanced and probably also more  
expensive than Raytheon's missile. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no response from Raytheon's headquarters in Lexington,  
Mass., to calls seeking comment on the Boeing deal.

<HEADLINE> No Subway Series for Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They gathered around TV sets, scouting their  
World Series opponent and wondering what mayhem a Subway Series 
would bring. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees knew what would have been in store: demands  
for tickets, screaming front-page headlines, dueling fans on talk 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure would have been excruciating. This, after all, is a  
team whose owner can't stand losing exhibitions to the crosstown 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran the gamut of emotions during that game,'' David Cone  
said Wednesday about Atlanta's 10-9, 11-inning win Tuesday night 
over the New York Mets, setting up a rematch between the Braves and 
Yankees in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking what would a Subway Series be like. I don't  
think any of us could imagine what it would have been like. It 
would have been a once in a lifetime experience,'' said Cone, who 
played six seasons with the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been 43 years since two New York teams played in the  
World Series. After the Dodgers and Giants left New York for 
California following the 1957 season, what once happened seven 
times in a 10-year period hadn't come close to occurring again 
until this season. 
</P>
<P>
	And after the Mets rallied from 5-0 and 7-3 deficits to take the  
lead twice in Game 6 against the Braves, the Yankees were prepared 
for it to happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they pulled ahead I thought we were going to have a  
Subway Series,'' said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, who 
probably would have received the brunt of the criticism from owner 
George Steinbrenner if the Yankees actually lost to the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There certainly would have been a lot more at stake that a  
world championship,'' Cashman said. ``There would have been city 
bragging rights, which would have been a story within a story. Now 
it's just the World Series and that's how it should be. I can't 
fathom what it would have been like in the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Girardi can. The phone wouldn't stop ringing with ticket  
requests. And the road would have offered no escape because there 
would be no road. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a pain in the neck in a way,'' Girardi  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for some, especially former Met Allen Watson, it would have  
been a chance to settle a score. Watson, a New Yorker who signed 
with the Mets last winter, was traded to Seattle this year before 
finally ending up with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson hasn't hid his dislike of Mets manager Bobby Valentine  
and would have reveled in the chance to show the Mets what they 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been excellent to pitch against them,'' Watson  
said. ``I wasn't too happy about the trade. I wanted to show them 
what I've done. I'm here, so I guess it all worked out well for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for all the talk Wednesday about what a Subway Series would  
have been like, the Yankees know their focus must shift to Saturday 
night's opener in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted to see a Subway Series,'' said Ricky Ledee,  
who batted .600 in last year's Series against San Diego. ``It would 
have been exciting for the fans. But the goal is to make the World 
Series. No matter who we play, we have to win four times.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Manager Joe Torre said he won't announce his rotation until  
after the Braves do. Though it is expected that Orlando Hernandez 
will pitch the opener followed by Cone, who would then get five 
days' rest between Games 2 and 6. Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens 
probably will pitch the first two games in New York. ... Torre also 
said he will replace second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who made 26 
errors this season, with Luis Sojo for defense late in games. Torre 
had been hesitant to do that during the season, but talked it over 
with Knoblauch before Game 5 against Boston. ... Paul O'Neill's 
broken rib is less of a concern to the Yankees, meaning postseason 
hero Jim Leyritz might be back on the roster in place of Shane 
Spencer. Leyritz has seven career playoff homers, including the 
momentum shifting three-run shot in Game 4 against Atlanta in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Inflation Rate Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The annual inflation rate in Europe  
held steady at 1.2 percent in September, according to data released 
Wednesday, but sharp increases in some nations were expected to put 
pressure on the European Central Bank to raise interest rates next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures for the 11 nations where the euro currency has been  
adopted indicated that prices crept up in 10 of them. But a sharp 
fall in the Netherlands held the overall rate steady, according to 
the report from the European Union's statistics agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurostat reported inflation growing fastest in Ireland, with 2.6  
percent, and Spain with 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	There was less price pressure in ``core'' nations. The rate in  
Germany rose to 0.8 percent from 0.5 percent in September 1998, and 
France's rate rose to 0.6 percent from 0.5 over the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing inflation gap between the core nations of the  
currency bloc and high-growth economies on the periphery presents a 
dilemma for the European Central Bank, which makes common interest 
rate decisions for all 11 nations. If it raises rates to prevent 
overheating in Spain and Ireland, it risks of stifling the still 
tentative economic recovery in Germany and France. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's top economics official played down inflation fears and  
said the divergence was not yet a cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation figures remain within the objectives set'' for the  
euro zone as a whole, said Pedro Solbes, the EU finance 
commissioner. ``The differences are not so worrying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solbes said growth in the euro zone would be around 2.2 percent  
this year as forecast, but could gather pace next year to exceed 
the European Commission's 2.7 prediction. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Solbes declined to comment on whether the  
central bank should act against inflation, but many analysts expect 
a November rate rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephane Deo, international economist at Goldman Sachs in  
London, believes the central bank will raise its benchmark rate by 
25 basis points to 2.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be a good pre-emptive move,'' he said.  
</P>

	Across the whole 15-nation European Union, inflation also held  
steady at 1.2 percent in September, unchanged from August, the 
latest statistics indicated. EU members Britain, Sweden, Denmark 
and Greece stayed outside the euro currency bloc launched Jan. 1 by 
the other EU nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurostat reported the following September annual inflation rates  
for the 11 euro zone nations, with August rates in brackets: 
</P>
<P>
	France, 0.6 percent (0.5 percent); Austria, 0.6 (0.5); Germany,  
0.8 (0.7); Belgium, 1.3 (0.9); Finland 1.4 (1.3); Luxembourg 1.6 
(1.4); Italy, 1.9 (1.6); Portugal 1.9 (1.8); Netherlands, 2 (2.5); 
Spain 2.5 (2.3); Ireland 2.6 (2.4). 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that in the Netherlands, August's rate had been  
boosted by especially strong summer sales, which fell off in 
September.

<HEADLINE> 3rd Day of Racing in America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Dennis Conner, sailing in his  
eighth America's Cup, won both of his races today on the third day 
of the America's Cup challenger series. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's America True also had a notable victory after an  
intense tacking duel with Hawaii's Abracadabra 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Killer whales frolicked in Auckland's inner harbor as northerly  
wind on the two challenger courses further out on Hauraki Gulf 
increased from 10 knots in the morning to more than 20 in the 
afternoon, the most consistent breeze in the competition so far. 
</P>
<P>
	In the morning races, Prada defeated the Spanish challenge by 1  
minute, 2 seconds; Stars and Stripes defeated Nippon by 1 minute, 
14 seconds; Young America defeated Le Defi Francais by 2 minutes, 4 
seconds; America True defeated Abracadabra by 26 seconds; and Young 
Australia defeated Fast 2000 by 12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, AmericaOne defeated Le Defi Francais by 1  
minute, 26 seconds; Nippon defeated Young Australia by 1 minute, 52 
seconds; the Spanish challenge defeated Abracadabra by 43 seconds; 
Prada defeated America True by 1 minute, 25 seconds; and Stars and 
Stripes defeated Fast 2000 by 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	In a morning of tight racing for all but the top favorites,  
America True, with the only woman skipper of the competition in 
Dawn Riley, and Abracadabra 2000 tacked more than 60 times on the 
second windward leg before the San Franciscans scraped over the 
line for their second victory of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Conner's Stars and Stripes, with half the budget and half the  
number of boats of his rival, led the $20 million, two-boat Nippon 
team at all four marks in a close race in the morning, crossing the 
line more than one minute ahead. The San Diego team then beat the 
struggling Swiss syndicate in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon had two penalties in its race against Conner, and bowman  
Toshiki Shibata was badly injured the afternoon race when a clip on 
a spinnaker pole sprang open, sending the heavy beam crashing down 
on his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was knocked unconscious straight away,'' skipper Peter  
Gilmour said. ``It appears he has a broken nose and lost several 
teeth, possibly a broken jaw and, we're hoping, no spinal 
injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian Prada team and the New York Yacht Club's Young  
America again had easy victories, while Australia, with the 
youngest team, smallest budget and oldest boat, posted its first 
victory of the series, also over the Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada has six victories in as many starts. Paul Cayard's  
AmericaOne and Ed Baird's Young America also were perfect, each 
5-for-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars and Stripes finished the day with 3 points, tying  
Abracadabra behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races over four months, the 11 challenger teams  
score one point for each victory in the first of three 
round-robins, four points in the second and nine in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of a finals series will meet Team New Zealand in a  
best-of-9 regatta starting in February 2000 for sailing's most 
prized trophy, the America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> Strickland Fined for Not Practicing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington Wizards point guard Rod Strickland  
was fined for an unexcused absence from practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland also did not travel with the Wizards to Cleveland,  
where they will play the Cavaliers in an exhibition game Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, general manger Wes Unseld did not mention  
Strickland by name, but said that he and coach Gar Heard ``agreed 
that a total commitment by all involved in the organization is 
necessary for the success of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone in the organization has been made aware of this  
fact,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team didn't release the amount of the fine.  
</P>
<P>
	Strickland has been a high-maintenance member of the Wizards  
since he joined the team in 1996. Aside from routine tardiness at 
practices and games, he has been convicted of drunken driving and 
had a fight with teammate Tracy Murray at a hotel on the road.

<HEADLINE> NBA Resumes Testing Players for Pot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA resumed testing its players for  
marijuana use Wednesday after the league and union met to discuss a 
breach of the confidentiality agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The identities of two players who tested positive for marijuana  
were revealed to The New York Times, although the newspaper did not 
name them in a story about testing being suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of the league's 29 teams have not yet been  
tested, a process that should be completed by early next week. This 
is the first season in which players are being tested for marijuana 
and steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans can only be tested once, unless they produce a positive  
sample. Rookies are tested throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire process is confidential by mutual agreement and it  
needs to remain that way in order to work,'' league spokesman Chris 
Brienza said. ``So we will not be commenting on reports that 
surface or day-to-day operations of the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Hunter, director of the players union, said the  
confidentiality agreement precluded him from discussing the six-day 
hiatus in testing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was clear, however, that the disclosure of the identities of  
two players who tested positive had caused trouble between the 
union and the league. The information is considered highly 
sensitive, and both sides were suspicious that the other had leaked 
the names. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the players themselves did not know they had tested  
positive until a reporter from The Times alerted them. The drug 
agreement says players who test positive will not be told so until 
all the testing is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times report also said that six players had tested positive  
for marijuana during the first week of testing, which began in 
early October. Teams are not notified in advance of the date of 
their tests, and players have typically arrived at practice to find 
representatives from the league and union waiting for them to 
produce urine samples. 
</P>
<P>
	``The press asked for it, the commissioner asked for it, we used  
it during the (collective) bargaining session to get something we 
wanted,'' union president Patrick Ewing said recently. ``We gave it 
up, that's it. No sense crying about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug agreement, technically separate from the league's labor  
agreement, also calls for drug testing of such personnel as 
trainers, coaches and assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner David Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik  
also were tested, Brienza said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union sent a latter to all players in September urging  
anyone who smoked marijuana to come forward and seek treatment if 
they feared they would produce a dirty sample. 
</P>
<P>
	A first-time offender must undergo mandatory counseling, and a  
second positive test would include a $15,000 fine. Subsequent 
positive tests would result in five-game suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They let us know about it, so it shouldn't be a problem,''  
Knicks forward John Wallace said. ``It's just a matter of doing 
what you've got to do to make sure that when the time comes you're 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Allan Houston welcomed the policy, saying it seemed  
overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just disappointed that it is treated so lightly in  
general, not just in our league,'' Houston said, referring to 
marijuana. ``That's the problem, it's not a problem of testing. 
You'd think it wouldn't be a problem because we are professional 
athletes, but the problem is that it's glorified in some areas of 
our culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when I was in high school, I looked at that as  
crack. But now, it's like a cigarette, and I think that's why it 
has become what it is in our league,'' Houston said.

that demand for computers will remain strong. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed up 187.43 at 10,392.26. The Nasdaq 
composite index, which is dominated by high-tech stocks, was up 
97.22 at 2,786.78. The rage for technology stocks extended to the

	Bells Meet Forecasts, Sprint Misses  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Third-quarter profits met expectations at  
BellSouth and Bell Atlantic, but Sprint and its PCS mobile phone 
unit came up short with their latest results. BellSouth edged most 
Wall Street forecasts as revenues grew 9.5 percent. Bell Atlantic 
posted a 5 percent gain in revenue. Sprint's third-quarter profit 
shrank more than expected despite an 18 percent improvement in 
revenues for the three-month period, which ended just days before 
the company agreed to be acquired by MCI WorldCom for a record $115 
billion. Sprint PCS posted a larger-than-expected loss. Bell 
Atlantic earned $1.20 billion, or 76 cents a share in the third 
quarter, excluding continuing expenses for the merger with Nynex's 
operations. BellSouth reported a third-quarter operating profit of 
$972 million, or 51 cents a share. Sprint's FON Group, which 
includes traditional calling services and the newer Sprint ION data 
unit, reported a third-quarter profit of $359 million, or 41 cents 
per share. 

</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan Profits Up 42 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp.'s profits jumped 42  
percent in the third quarter as higher fees from investment banking 
and money management services offset lower income from trading 
assets and securities. The nation's third-largest bank today posted 
net income of $1.19 billion, or $1.37 a share, for the three months 
ended Sept. 30, beating Wall Street's average estimate by a nickel. 
Chase earned $837 million, or 94 cents a share, in the third 
quarter last year. Investors have been concerned that Year 2000 
computer problems and a rise in bad loans could hurt the banking 
industry. Chase's quarterly numbers were encouraging to some 
investors. 

</P>
<P>
	Fleet Boston Profit Up 41 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fleet Boston Corp. reported a 41 percent increase  
in third-quarter profits, and boosted its dividend by 11 cents as 
Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston reported combined financial 
results for the first time. Fleet completed its takeover of 
BankBoston on Oct. 1, making the united bank the eighth largest in 
the country with 185 billion in assets. Fleet Boston earned $711 
million, or 74 cents a share, beating analysts' expectations by a 
penny. The strong performance was driven by growth in Latin 
American operations, investment banking fees, and interest-earning 
assets. 

</P>
<P>
	Eli Lilly Earnings Rise 15 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Sales of the antidepressant Prozac fell  
sharply in the third quarter, but pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly &AMP; 
Co. still had enough strong sales from other drugs to post a 15 
percent increase in operating earnings, the company reported today. 
Excluding one-time gains, Lilly made $679.7 million, or 62 cents a 
share in the quarter, up from $518.2 million or 46 cents a share a 
year ago. Results matched analysts' forecasts. Including the $67.8 
million sale of its U.S. marketing rights for the antibiotic 
Lorabid to King Pharmaceuticals, Lilly earned $732.6 million. 

</P>

	Sun Life of Canada To Go Public  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Sun Life of Canada plans to go public, joining a  
wave of mutual insurance companies restructuring to transfer 
ownership from policyholders to shareholders. The Toronto-based 
company, which makes its U.S. headquarters in Wellesley, said today 
it plans to offer more than 1 million policyholders around the 
world shares of stock in a new company to be called Sun Life 
Financial Services of Canada Inc. The company said it wants to go 
public to raise capital to compete and make acquisitions in a 
rapidly consolidating financial services industry. 

</P>
<P>
	Northrop Grumman Earnings Up 10 Pct  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Northrop Grumman Corp. said today its  
third-quarter earnings rose 10 percent on stronger sales in its 
information technology unit. The maker of the B-2 bomber earned 
$128 million, or $1.83 per share, compared to $116 million, or 
$1.67 per share, in the third quarter of 1998. The figures were 
significantly higher than the $1.63 per share suggested by 
analysts.

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The owners of a feminist bookstore involved  
in a trademark infringement dispute with Amazon.com want the online 
company barred from asking about their sexual orientation. Amazon 
Bookstore, which brought the suit, said that such matters are 
irrelevant and that its owners should not have to answer such 
questions, which were posed during pretrial depositions last month. 
The bookstore sued Amazon.com in April over its use of the name 
Amazon, saying it creates confusion in the public mind. Amazon.com 
says it intends to demonstrate that Amazon Bookstore caters to 
lesbians, while the Internet company has a general-interest 
audience.

	Agreements in Monsanto Seed Cases

<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Monsanto Co. has reached agreements with  
Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. and Cargill Inc. resolving 
disputes arising from its purchase of Cargill's international seed 
business a year ago. Monsanto said today it has resolved a lawsuit 
by Pioneer alleging that Monsanto had purchased germplasm -- the 
reproductive tissue of seeds -- from Cargill that had been 
improperly taken from Pioneer. Under the settlement, Monsanto said 
the genetic materials improperly obtained from Pioneer are being 
destroyed. Other terms of the settlement were not disclosed. 
Separately, Monsanto reached an agreement with Cargill that 
compensates Monsanto for lost germplasm and other expenses 
associated with the problems uncovered in the seed business sale.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Up; Dow Gains 155.14 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today, buoyed by a strong  
profit report from Microsoft that lifted technology stocks from 
their recent slump. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 155.14 at 10,360.07. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 20.74 at 1,282.06, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 73.51 at 2,761.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq, which lists many of the world's leading technology  
companies, benefited from Microsoft's announcement late Tuesday 
that profits jumped 30 percent in its fiscal first quarter on 
strong demand for personal computers equipped with its Windows 
operating system. Microsoft also reported strong sales of its 
Office 2000 and other business software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft rose 5 1/16 today to 91 3/8. The company's good news  
lifted many other technology stocks, which were battered over the 
past week as investors worried about disappointing profit reports 
from Intel and Dell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are in a show-me mode,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior  
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``The strong earnings from 
Microsoft energized the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, a component of the Dow, rose 4 3/4 to 111 7/8 on expectations it  
will post solid earnings growth. The company was scheduled to 
report its third-quarter earnings after the close of trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said IBM faces especially heavy scrutiny this quarter.  
Analysts have warned that lackluster computer hardware sales could 
hurt IBM in the third quarter. Also, IBM said Tuesday it will pull 
its money-losing line of PCs from retail stores in the United 
States and sell them exclusively over the Internet in a drastic 
move to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan rose 3 7/16 to 74 9/16 after reporting profits  
jumped 42 percent in the third quarter as higher fees from 
investment banking and money management services offset lower 
income from trading assets and securities. Chase earned $1.19 
billion, or $1.37 a share, beating Wall Street estimates by 5 cents 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Robust earnings growth has helped investors shrug off worries  
about higher interest rates. While stocks are rebuilding from 
crushing losses last week, inflation-sensitive bonds have not yet 
recovered. Today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slipped to 
6.34 percent from 6.35 percent, but yields remain near the highest 
levels since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks received some support from the news that America's trade  
deficit narrowed slightly to $24.1 billion in August as improving 
economies in Asia boosted demand for U.S. manufactured goods and 
farm exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The August deficit edged down 3.2 percent from the all-time  
record of $24.9 billion set in July, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The imbalance was still the third worst monthly performance in  
history and left the deficit for the entire year running at an 
annual rate of $252 billion, 53 percent higher than last year's 
record $164.3 billion deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 729.57 million 
shares, slightly ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index rose 1.39 to 412.32.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Court OKs Lump Tobacco Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A Florida appeals court reversed itself Wednesday  
and reopened the door to a ruinous, multibillion-dollar verdict 
against the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's 3rd District Court of Appeal said the jury in a big  
class-action case involving 500,000 sick Florida smokers can award 
punitive damages in a single lump sum instead of one smoker at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry lawyer Dan Webb warned the court that damages  
from the case could exceed $300 billion -- which ``would destroy any 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The stakes have suddenly become humongous,'' said Northeastern  
University law professor Richard Daynard, head of an anti-tobacco 
clearinghouse. ``The fate of the industry rests on this jury that 
has already found that the industry has behaved outrageously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daynard said a big award could bankrupt some tobacco companies  
because they would have to post a bond greater than the award 
itself while they appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, tobacco company stocks dropped in afternoon  
trading. Philip Morris was down $1.87 1/2 at $28.87 1/2, R.J. Reynolds 
fell $2 to $23.93 3/4, and Loews Corp., parent of Lorillard, was down 
$1 to $69. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the jury found that the nation's five largest cigarette  
makers had produced a defective and deadly product. The same jury 
is to determine damages in the second phase of the trial, beginning 
Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the appeals court agreed with the industry that  
damages should be decided one smoker at a time. Investors rejoiced, 
figuring the tobacco industry could more easily defend itself 
against lots of small awards than against one big 
multibillion-dollar verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	But the same appeals court withdrew its decision and agreed to  
reconsider. On Wednesday, just hours after hearing arguments from 
both sides, the three-judge panel issued a unanimous, one-paragraph 
ruling without explaining its reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for both sides cannot discuss the case under a gag order  
imposed by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb told the appeals panel that a single award would cause an  
``enormous amount of irreparable harm to the industry.'' But 
Appeals Judge David L. Levy said the appeals court ``cannot 
micromanage what the trial judge does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Brown &AMP;  
Williamson Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, the Liggett Group and the 
industry's Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A and Tobacco 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only  
five times -- twice in Florida and once in New Jersey, Oregon and 
California. The Florida and New Jersey verdicts were overturned on 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The $206 billion national settlement reached with the tobacco  
industry in November bars states from suing to recoup the costs of 
treating sick smokers but doesn't stop lawsuits by individuals.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Narrows Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After setting records for most of the year,  
the U.S. trade deficit narrowed slightly in August as fledgling 
overseas recoveries boosted exports of American farm products and 
factory goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit shrank 3.2 percent to $24.1 billion, still the third  
worst showing in history, but at least below the all-time high of 
$24.9 billion set in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement reflected a 3.7 percent jump in exports of goods  
and services, which climbed to a record $82 billion, helping to 
offset a 2 percent increase in imports, which also set a record at 
$106.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists were encouraged by the upturn in exports,  
which they said reflected the improved outlook of many countries 
whose economies were leveled over the past two years by a spreading 
global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Light appears to be peeking through the end of a long  
tunnel,'' said economist Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the 
National Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall U.S. economy has remained strong with  
unemployment at a three-decade low of 4.2 percent, lost overseas 
markets have cost a half million lost manufacturing jobs in the 
past two years and led to a serious economic crisis for American 
farmers, who sell close to one-third of their production overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the small improvement in August, the trade deficit  
through the first eight months of the year is $167 billion, already 
higher than the record $164.3 billion set for all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street, which suffered its worst week in a decade last  
week, extended its recovery on Wednesday with the Dow Jones 
industrial average rising by 187.43 points. A rebound in technology 
stocks helped lift the Dow to a close of 10,392. 
</P>
<P>
	The worsening trade deficit has translated into major political  
headaches for President Clinton with critics charging it highlights 
the failure of the administration's free trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the loudest criticism has come from the U.S. steel  
industry, which has successfully won a number of ``anti-dumping'' 
rulings that foreign steel from Japan and other countries was being 
sold in the U.S. market at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	New Japanese Trade Minister Takashi Fukaya said Wednesday in  
Tokyo that Japan will bring a case before the World Trade 
Organization alleging that the steel cases involving 20 foreign 
countries are in violation of WTO rules. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky  
promised to defend America's anti-dumping laws. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with Japan, which had set an all-time high in  
July, narrowed slightly to $6.4 billion in August but is still 
running 13 percent higher than in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit with China shot up 8.8 percent in August to $6.9  
billion, a record for a U.S. deficit with any single country. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley, briefing reporters on the  
trade figures, called the widening deficit with China a ``troubling 
story.'' He said Chinese imports into the United States are up 13.7 
percent this year while U.S. exports to China have risen just 1.6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton last week defended his policies of pushing to  
lower barriers and open overseas markets for American producers as 
he laid out America's negotiating strategy for December talks among 
134 nations in Seattle, Wash., to launch a new global round of 
trade liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton has been thwarted by Democrats in his own party who  
are blocking efforts in the House to pass the congressional 
authorization he needs to conduct the new trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. exports to all Pacific Rim countries, the area hardest hit  
by the two-year global financial crisis, climbed by 6.4 percent in 
August, helping to narrow the deficit by 1.8 percent to $17.2 
billion. South Korea, Thailand and other nations in the region are 
reporting rising economic activity this year as they climb out of 
steep recessions caused when their currencies plunged. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit in petroleum rose to $5.9 billion in August as  
the price per barrel of crude oil rose to $17.80, the highest level 
in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports of foreign cars and auto parts hit a record in August of  
$15.8 billion as did imports of consumer goods, which climbed to 
$20.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On the export side, records were set in shipments of  
American-made autos and parts, at $6.7 billion, and exports of 
capital goods at $27.3 billion, reflecting a near doubling in 
August shipments of commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of American farm goods rose $127 million in August to  
$3.9 billion but still lag 4.3 percent below last year's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told Congress on Wednesday  
that in some cases farm prices have fallen to 30-year lows because 
of slumping world demand, leading to a rise in ``anguish and doubt 
among farmers.''

<HEADLINE> Dole To Quit Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former American Red Cross president Elizabeth  
Dole has decided to drop out of the rapidly shrinking Republican 
presidential field, citing an inability to raise enough money to 
compete with front-runner George W. Bush, The Associated Press 
learned today. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources close to Dole, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Dole would announce her departure from the presidential race 
today in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the money becomes the message the process is  
diminished,'' Dole said in a draft of her remarks provided to The 
AP. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not plan to endorse any GOP candidate, the sources said,  
though they did not rule out an endorsement at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
	The first woman to mount a top-tier presidential campaign, Mrs.  
Dole's campaign attracted new voters -- particularly young and 
professional women -- to the Republican Party. She finished strong 
in an early political contest -- Iowa's non-binding straw poll in 
August -- and displayed a practiced polish on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
	But the wife of 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole was  
unable to overcome the huge financial advantage of Bush, the Texas 
governor who raised more than ten times as much money as Dole in 
1999. She also was unable to convert the raw enthusiasm of her 
rallies into improved poll ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Her departure leaves Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain and  
conservative millionaire Steve Forbes in the top tier of the GOP 
field. Four other candidates are vying for conservative voters, 
including Pat Buchanan, who plans to bolt the GOP on Monday to seek 
the Reform Party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he was sorry Dole had decided to withdraw from the  
presidential race, but that she had done so for the ``wrong 
reason'' -- money woes. ``The right reason is because you've lost 
the battle of ideas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss welcomed the narrower  
field. ``Fewer people talking means more of an opportunity for 
Steve to talk about what he believes in,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's race for the White House came to an end just less than  
three months after a surprisingly solid third-place finish in 
Iowa's straw poll. The finish gave her a chance to boost her 
campaign, which was already sagging in polls and money-starved. 
</P>
<P>
	She was unable to capitalize. In the most recent campaign  
spending reports, Dole reported raising more than $1 million from 
July to September. By comparison, Bush raised $20.2 million during 
the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Though second place in many national polls -- hovering around 10  
percent -- she was trailing McCain in New Hampshire and lagged well 
behind Bush elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Dole fought off rumors of the impending demise  
of her campaign by announcing that she would formally kick off her 
campaign on Nov. 7. She said she hoped that date will turn into the 
anniversary of her election to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exactly one year before the first presidential election  
of the new millennium and our selection of that date reflects my 
sense that we will make history,'' Dole said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the Dole family said the former senator ``was  
the last to reach the conclusion'' that she should leave the race. 
He had scoured his network of GOP stalwarts, including many Bush 
supporters, to ask whether she should stay in and to seek help 
raising money. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call with her financial team this morning, Dole  
calculated her odds of winning at 75-to-1. ``I've got to be honest 
with myself and the people on this call,'' she said. ``You simply 
have to have money to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart used the news to  
criticize the GOP. ``It underscores at least among Republicans how 
little the ideas mean and how much the money means,'' he told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Dole canceled a campaign appearance in  
Indianapolis at the last minute. A campaign official said Dole was 
ill, and a letter faxed to Indiana GOP Chairman Mike McDaniel 
referred to ``unforeseen circumstances'' that prevented her 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, when she formed a presidential exploratory committee,  
Dole explained her reasons for seeking the White House this way: 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe our people are looking for leaders who will call  
America to her better nature. Yes, we've been let down, and by 
people we should have been able to look up to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, 63, earned her undergraduate degree from Duke University  
in 1958 and a master's degree in education from Harvard in 1960, as 
well as a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	She married Bob Dole in 1975.  
</P>
<P>
	Dole started in the Democratic Johnson administration as a  
consumer advocate and worked in the Republican Nixon administration 
as a Federal Trade commissioner. When Ronald Reagan was elected 
president in 1980, she was appointed to head the White House Office 
of Public Liasion. The position serves as the link between public 
interest groups and the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, President Reagan appointed Dole transportation  
secretary. She was sworn in by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the 
first woman appointed to the Supreme Court. Dole herself was the 
first woman in Reagan's Cabinet and the first female transportation 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1987, Dole told President Reagan she was resigning  
to help with her husband's 1988 presidential campaign. George Bush 
beat Bob Dole for the Republican nomination and went on to win the 
presidency over Democrat Michael Dukakis. When Bush took office in 
1989, he named Dole his labor secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1990, less than two years after taking office, Dole  
resigned as labor secretary to become head of the Red Cross. News 
reports at the time said she had little clout at the White House 
and most policy decisions were made by Chief of Staff John Sununu. 
Dole denied any frustration.

<HEADLINE> Study: Valium Can Be Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Valium and similar tranquilizers used to treat anxiety and  
insomnia could be reformulated to reduce such side effects as 
clumsiness and memory loss, a study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Changing the drugs might also prevent them from intensifying the  
effects of alcohol, according to the study, reported in Thursday's 
issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, involving genetically engineered mice, was conducted  
by researchers at the University of Zurich, the Swiss Institute of 
Technology and Swiss pharmaceutical giant F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., 
which makes Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the results are quite exciting because there has been  
a lot of talk over the years about whether the therapeutic effects 
of tranquilizers can be isolated,'' said Dr. Patricia Kroboth at 
the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Human and animal brains are wired with receptors for  
gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA, a molecule that regulates mental 
states such as anxiety. Valium, or diazepam, is part of a family of 
drugs called benzodiazepines -- including Halcyon and Librium -- that 
ease anxiety by making the GABA receptors act more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that GABA receptors are found throughout the  
brain, so Valium affects other circuits, such as those that control 
attention and balance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss researchers created genetically altered mice in which  
one kind of GABA receptor was insensitive to benzodiazepines. That 
blocked some of the side effects of Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	Normal mice given Valium became sluggish, relaxed and showed  
poor memory, failing to remember how to avoid an electric shock. 
The gene-altered mice given the same dose remained active and 
avoided the shock. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe they can remake the tranquilizer, instead of  
the receptor, to work only on the specific GABA receptors in the 
brain that control anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	A small change in the chemical formula of Valium could allow  
people to take it without worrying about loss of memory or 
coordination, or possibly even addiction, said Hanns Moehler of the 
University of Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
	GABA receptors are nearly identical in humans and animals and  
work about the same way, Moehler said. But experts said any new 
versions of Valium and other tranquilizers are years off.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Panel Decides on Toxic School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An expert panel recommended Wednesday that  
the Los Angeles school system finish building a half-completed, 
$200 million high school on a former oil field that releases 
dangerous gases. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent commission set up just to decide what to do with  
the nation's costliest high school voted 4-3 to continue building 
the complex. The commission said it would attach conditions on 
dealing with the dangers of the site later. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioners who voted for completing the project said  
starting over at a new site -- if one could be found -- would cost 
far more, push back the opening of a new school many years and 
force thousands of students to be bused from the area to other 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Education had indicated it would follow the panel's  
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal over the Belmont Learning Complex has already  
contributed to the downfall of the superintendent, who last week 
was stripped of day-to-day control in favor of a new chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-acre complex was designed to be a showpiece for the  
nation's second-largest school district. It was to have room for 
5,000 students in a poor neighborhood near downtown and include 
stores, a police station and sports facilities for the community. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction had to be dramatically scaled back this year after  
high levels of explosive methane gas and lesser amounts of hydrogen 
sulfide, a highly toxic gas, were detected. 
</P>
<P>
	As early as 1989, a state Division of Oil and Gas official  
recommended against building on the 100-year-old oil field. But the 
plans moved ahead anyway, and the district now admits that it acted 
after conducting an inadequate environmental assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Wednesday's vote, 150 students marched from the existing,  
overcrowded Belmont High campus to urge that the district complete 
the Belmont Learning Complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ... invested so much money and time into this school, and  
all of a sudden it's not going to be built? I don't think that's 
right,'' said senior Brenda Balles, 17. ``I don't think it's fair 
for our taxes to go into something and just be wasted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the seven commission members -- experts on public health,  
law and science -- disputed that the site was a bad choice. One 
member, David S. Beckman said the site poses a hazard under state 
and federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The initial purchase was a mistake,'' said another commission  
member, Ira H. Monosson. ``It never should have been done.'' But he 
added: ``This site is not as dangerous as some people have been 
trying to characterize. ... I believe that this can be controlled 
and made quite safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The district has already spent $144 million on Belmont. The  
commission concluded that finishing Belmont and adding technology 
to ease the gas problem would boost the cost to about $249 million. 
</P>
<P>
	During earlier commission hearings, experts indicated that the  
possibility of students dying from or being sickened by the gas was 
remote. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts were questioned about potential lawsuits from  
students and faculty members if the school is completed. Monosson 
said he was convinced that such cases would be found to be without 
merit. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, investigators issued a scathing report that  
recommended that several school district officials be punished or 
fired. In addition to the project's environmental problems, the 
report criticized conflicts of interests between those who put 
together the construction deal and ``rudderless'' policies of the 
697,000-student Los Angeles school district. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the School Board appointed Howard Miller chief  
executive of the district and ordered that all departments report 
to him instead of Superintendent Ruben Zacarias. 
</P>
<P>
	Zacarias' removal from day-to-day control of the district led to  
allegations of racism from Hispanic leaders. He is fighting the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Belmont scandal, the district has been beset  
by controversies over low test scores and the possible loss of $900 
million in state bond money for 100 new schools.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Residents Face More Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Although he is still unable to live in  
his home that was flooded by heavy rains from Hurricane Floyd, 
William Boyd is undaunted in trying to make the house inhabitable 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	His recovery effort was delayed after a brief encounter with  
Hurricane Irene. And there is still the possibility of more 
flooding as rivers crest this week and Hurricane Jose churns in the 
Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boyd remains positive.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've all had it hard,'' the 61-year-old retiree said Tuesday.  
``I think it will be a better town when it's all done because now 
we are looking out for each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping a positive attitude isn't so easy these days for the  
2,100 residents of this proud community founded by freed slaves 
that's now a soggy ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
	The great flood of 1999 that followed Hurricane Floyd drenched  
eastern North Carolina in 20 inches of rain, and put Princeville 
under 15 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not be over.  
</P>
<P>
	The Tar River was expected to crest today 3 feet above flood  
stage. Elsewhere, the Cape Fear and Neuse rivers were expected to 
crest as high as 8 feet above flood stage this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of the flooding is expected to approach the  
catastrophic scale seen from Floyd. Officials say it will be at 
least next year before the town will be fit to live in again -- even 
if no more rain falls in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony to that is plentiful: At a Princeville used-car lot on  
Tuesday, the hoods and doors of cars were opened to air out, and 
workers were rinsing mud from the interiors and engine 
compartments. All the cars bore a yellow tag with the name of an 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, yellow county signs adorned the fronts of many  
Princeville houses, declaring them uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
	At Boyd's home, furniture, clothing, appliances, cabinets were  
among the items heaped in great piles in the back yard. Like other 
residents, they were airing out some clothes on trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd understands why some of his younger neighbors are angry and  
frustrated after more than a month of flooding and evacuations. But 
he says they need to look at the bigger picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just as good to smile as it is to frown,'' he said after  
leading visitors on a tour of his home, where floodwaters rose 
higher than he could reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The small home where he and his wife, Nanny, raised three sons  
is on the verge of being condemned. But not if Boyd can help it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been down before,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Life is sometimes like a rubber ball,'' he added. ``You've got  
to bounce with it and hope you don't get flattened.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Trudie Styler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trudie Styler is the lady of Lake House, a role  
that has the ring of royalty to it. But in practice, she is closer 
to being a farmhand. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake House is an estate in rural England (near the small village  
of Wiltshire) that Styler shares with husband Sting and their four 
children. The house has a heritage going back more than four 
centuries and architecture reminiscent of a fairy tale castle. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years ago, Styler was looking for a house in the country  
that the family could use on the weekends. She fell in love with 
the romance and charm of the stone manor that has survived two 
major fires. King Alfonso XIII of Spain was among its many guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``On that clear, cold, late-autumn day when I first saw Lake  
House, I was captivated by the romance of it all,'' Styler writes 
in ``The Lake House Cookbook,'' published by Clarkson Potter. Her 
husband was on tour when she first saw the house. ``I must have 
been very persuasive when I spoke to Sting that day, or maybe he 
could sense my certainty. But whatever it was that convinced him, 
with a tremendous leap of faith he agreed, and our lives were 
changed forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After moving from London, the couple made a conscious decision  
to turn the property into a self-sustaining organic farm. They now 
have more than 60 acres of fruits and vegetables, four types of 
livestock and facilities for making honey and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	``Way back eight years ago, we decided we wanted to take things  
into our own hands and make sure we had food that was safe for our 
children,'' said Styler, who is an actress, film producer, director 
and co-founder of the Rainforest Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Lake House Cookbook,'' which she wrote with family chef  
Joseph Sponzo, is filled with more than 150 recipes and 300 
photographs of Lake House, its surrounding farm and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We enjoy sitting down with people and eating what we've  
produced,'' she said. ``It is most satisfying.'' Styler was 
interviewed at the family's Manhattan apartment, where she spends a 
few months a year. 
</P>
<P>
	1. Why do you feel so strongly about organic food?  
</P>
<P>
	Styler: I feel very angry that consumers just aren't informed of  
the poisonous pesticides that are put into our soil that don't only 
have a negative effect on the animals and environment but also on 
our children. 
</P>
<P>
	2. What is your favorite meal?  
</P>
<P>
	Styler: I could eat Spaghetti al Aglio e Olio (spaghetti with  
garlic and oil) until it comes out of my ears. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Are you partial to any of the animals on the farm?  
</P>
<P>
	Styler: I don't become partial to the ones that are going to  
market or will eventually end up on the table. I'm very real about 
that -- we are running a farm. I do like to eat meat and so do the 
children, so I make sure that those animals are extremely well 
cared for, but we don't go around naming them. That would be too 
difficult. But the kids, as I do, have lots of pets, and the 
milking cows stay a long time, and the goat herd is female, so they 
all have names. 
</P>
<P>
	4. You grew up in a rural town but lived in the city for many  
years. Do you consider yourself a city or country person? 
</P>
<P>
	Styler: I left for the city when I was 17, but by nature I'm a  
country girl. But, you know, you go through that stage when you 
become a teen-ager where you want to fly and spread your wings. ... 
Find stuff out. But I think eventually the pattern of life is that 
you start to return to your roots. You start to think backward. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Lake House is 83 miles from London. What is the hardest thing  
about living away from the city? 
</P>
<P>
	Styler: There's no Gucci store.

<HEADLINE> Judge May Not Approve Warrick Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick will have to wait until  
Thursday to see if a judge approves a plea agreement that will 
allow the Florida State star to play this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick's lawyer postponed a hearing today after the  
university's president expressed concern about the plea. The 
agreement would allow Warrick to play for the No. 1 Seminoles on 
Saturday against Clemson and go to jail next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was a leading Heisman Trophy candidate until his arrest  
on a felony grand theft charge. The wide receiver had hoped to have 
his case reduced to a misdemeanor in county court today. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick's lawyer, John Kenny, asked for the postponement so he  
could speak with school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would require Warrick to spend 30 days in jail,  
donate to charity clothing he acquired in three trips to a 
Dillard's store, pay $295 in court costs, stay away from the 
department store and serve a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel very good about somebody having a sentence  
hanging over them and playing,'' Florida State president Sandy 
D'Alemberte told the Tallahassee Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was suspended Oct. 7 and has missed the Seminoles' last  
two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's suffered enough,'' Florida State quarterback  
Chris Weinke said. ``He deserves to be on the football team and I 
can't wait for his return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State does not let athletes compete if they have been  
charged with a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my understanding that the president and the athletic  
director will certainly confer on this before any announcement is 
made,'' D'Alemberte spokesman Frank Murphy said today. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alemberte, who is out of town, spoke with athletic director  
Dave Hart and the school's general counsel, Alan Sundberg, by phone 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick and former teammate Laveranues Coles were charged with  
buying more than $400 of designer clothes Sept. 29 for $21.40 from 
a store clerk, who is also charged. A security camera recorded the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted the 30 days to offer a misdemeanor,'' Kenny said  
Tuesday. ``That's pretty standard when looking at felony cases. 
They worked very hard to look at Mr. Warrick not as a football 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick could have avoided jail time, but not if he wanted to  
have a shot at playing again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked at the options of going to trial to prove it was a  
petty theft, but those are not viable options when Peter wants to 
make himself available to the university as quickly as possible,'' 
Kenny said. ``The judge still needs to accept it.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Suspends Kasparaitis Two Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Darius  
Kasparaitis was suspended Wednesday for two games for his elbow to 
the head of Chicago Blackhawks forward Jean-Pierre Dumont. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis, who will lose $15,625, was assessed a major penalty  
and a game misconduct for the hit Saturday that left Dumont -- 
carried off the ice on a stretcher -- with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hit delivered by Mr. Kasparaitis was deliberate and his  
opponent was not in possession of the puck nor in a position to 
defend himself,'' said NHL vice-president Colin Campbell, who 
handed down the suspension. ``This type of hit is dangerous and 
warrants disciplinary actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago general manager Bob Murray says Kasparaitis will have  
more than money to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking after things on the ice,'' Murray told the  
Chicago Sun-Times. ``When Mr. Kasparaitis is coming to town to 
play, I hope he'll be a man and drop his gloves. We'll do it 
face-to-face. We won't sucker-punch or cheap-shot anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray does not believe suspensions are effective.  
</P>
<P>
	``Money doesn't mean anything to these guys,'' he said. ``The  
players have to sort this out themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumont said he did not know if Kasparaitis' contact was a ``good  
hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so,'' he said. ``But what can I do?''  
</P>
<P>
	Murray said Dumont will refrain from exercise the next couple of  
days after experiencing nausea and trouble with quick movements.

<HEADLINE> Bulls' Kukoc To Miss Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Toni Kukoc will miss the Chicago Bulls'  
exhibition game Thursday with tendinitis in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, the only marquee player left from the Bulls' championship  
teams, was only 1-of-8 in Chicago's 100-85 loss to the Sacramento 
Kings Tuesday. He didn't play the fourth quarter and said afterward 
the knee ``wasn't good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our trainers and our doctors both think with medicine, it's  
the type of injury that will go away. It won't need surgery,'' 
coach Tim Floyd said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc's knee became inflamed last week. An MRI on Monday  
revealed the tendinitis, and Floyd said some time off might reduce 
the swelling.

<HEADLINE> Tide's Samuels Enjoying Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Someone has to get credit for all the  
yards Shaun Alexander has run up this season, and the Alabama 
tailback is willing to share it. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, it could be that Alexander is simply afraid to rile Chris  
Samuels, his mammoth left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``You run behind him, and he might block one, two or even three  
guys himself,'' said Alexander, who has 934 yards and 17 
touchdowns. ``By the time I get to the line, there's one dead body 
on the ground and maybe two or three badly bruised guys depending 
on what kind of mood he's in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-6, 300-pound senior, Samuels has started 36 straight  
games for No. 10 Alabama and is a semifinalist for the Lombardi 
Award, given annually to the top college lineman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris Samuels, in our opinion, is maybe the best offensive  
lineman in college football,'' said coach Mike DuBose, who often 
compares his left tackle to former Crimson Tide great John Hannah. 
``We have yet to see anyone better than him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Samuels, the recognition is long overdue.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I thought I should've been up in the top five, but  
it didn't work out,'' he said. ``This year, a lot of people have me 
No. 1, others have me second or third. I'm just glad to be up 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samuels anchors the left side of Alabama's line. Through the  
Tide's six games this season (5-1, 4-0 Southeastern Conference), he 
has yet to give up a sack or quarterback pressure from the left 
side. He also has 33 knockdown blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love him,'' quarterback Andrew Zow said. ``To have him  
protecting my blind side, I know I don't even have to worry about 
defenders getting through to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his size, Samuels has surprising speed, agility and  
endurance. He played 732 of a possible 744 snaps last season and 
refuses to come out of a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He runs like a linebacker and he blocks like one, too,'' left  
guard Griff Redmill said. ``He was a good player the last two 
years, but he's taken it to a whole new level now. He covers my 
mistakes and he makes the entire line raise our level of play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he's also helped Alexander raise his numbers. In last week's  
214-yard performance against Mississippi, Alexander gained most of 
his yards running off left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose said Alabama's play-calling grew predictable as the game  
went on, but play-caller Charlie Stubbs said he couldn't go away 
from something that was working so well. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we need a crucial few yards, Chris will come to me and say,  
`I can dominate this defender, I will open this hole for you,' '' 
Stubbs said. ``And he's telling the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samuels, who said the Ole Miss game was his best this season  
because he had eight pancake blocks, wants the play-calling to be 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of selfish because I want them all to be run behind  
me,'' he said. ``But Shaun helps by putting up the numbers he does. 
I can't take all the credit.''

<HEADLINE> Rabid Skunks Bite Two in Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- Two people have been bitten by rabid  
skunks in the past week as the normally mild-mannered creatures bed 
down for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	A toddler was bitten as he played in his yard in Auburn, and a  
50-year-old drifter who went after a skunk with a baseball bat in 
Westboro was found dead, covered with skunk bites. Officials said 
the bites are not considered the cause of his death. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher population of skunks means a higher incidence of  
rabies, said Susan Langlois, wildlife biologist for the state 
Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Still, she called the attacks 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Two consecutive mild winters and an abundant supply of rodents,  
which skunks eat, account for the rise in the skunk population, 
said Dr. Michael McGuill, chief veterinarian for the state 
Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Dignard was found dead outside the van where he lived.  
</P>
<P>
	A skunk believed responsible for the bites on his body was  
killed and tested positive for rabies, but the bites are not 
believed to have caused his death, McGuill said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Auburn, Kimberly Riley and her two children were undergoing  
medical treatment after her 21-month-old son was bitten on the 
wrist and scratched by a rabid skunk Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Rockies Set To Name Bell As Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Rockies are ready to adopt the Buddy  
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies have scheduled a news conference this afternoon to  
introduce Buddy Bell as the third manager in Colorado's seven-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	After two days of meetings, Bell and Rockies general manager Dan  
O'Dowd were finalizing the details of a contract late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just pretty much talking about philosophy more than  
anything. There's still some financial issues, but everything's 
going very well,'' Bell said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``No deal is final yet,'' O'Dowd said. ``There are still issues  
to be resolved. It's not cut and dried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, 48, manager of the Detroit Tigers from 1996-98, met with  
O'Dowd on Monday and Tuesday. He has been considered the favorite 
to succeed Jim Leyland, who retired at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell played 18 seasons with four major league teams and compiled  
a 184-277 record as Detroit's manager before being fired in 
September 1998, with three years left on his annual $550,000 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell previously was bench coach for the Cleveland Indians from  
1994-95. He spent this year as the minor league director for the 
Cincinnati Reds, one of his former teams. 
</P>
<P>
	One negotiating key was Bell's willingness to move from his home  
in Cincinnati. The Rockies want to avoid a repeat of this summer 
when Leyland lived in the Colorado clubhouse while his family 
stayed in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said Monday he is fond of Cincinnati but ``you have to move  
on sometime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's three-year contract will pay him about $2.25 million, The  
Denver Post reported today. He will receive a base salary of about 
$550,000 next season, but a radio and television package will raise 
that to around $750,000, the Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Before meeting formally with Bell, O'Dowd held interviews with  
several other candidates, including Arizona Diamondbacks bench 
coach Carlos Tosca, Cincinnati coach Ken Griffey and Florida 
Marlins minor league manager Lynn Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd also spoke with New York Yankees coach Willie Randolph by  
phone. Randolph did not travel to Denver because the Yankees are 
playing in the American League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies began searching for a manager after Leyland retired  
with two years left on a three-year, $6 million deal. Leyland, who 
led Colorado to a disappointing 72-90 record, could remain with the 
team in a lesser role. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta Braves hitting coach Don Baylor managed the Rockies from  
their inception in 1993 until he was fired after the 1998 season.

<HEADLINE> Watch Thin Markets As Year Closes / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Get your shopping done early -- and avoid the  
lack of crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the advise some financial consultants are giving  
investors who may have some last-minute business to wrap up before 
year's end, whether buying or selling stocks, bonds and other 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our overall goal is to avoid much trading later in the year  
and early next year because we expect thin markets and more 
volatility,'' said Nick Sargen, global market strategist for 
private clients at J.P. Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do your Christmas shopping early ... (and) you're likely to  
get more favorable pricing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets are typically on the thin side toward the end  
of the year anyway, as many individual investors take time off from 
trading during the busy holiday season and institutions close out 
their books. 
</P>
<P>
	But many financial experts expect trading to be quieter than  
usual this year -- and therefore, price fluctuations more 
exaggerated and volatile -- as the world braces for the new 
millennium and the remote possibility of some glitches caused by 
the Y2K computer problem. In fact, some professional traders have 
been instructed not to make transactions that settle during the 
so-called ``red days'' -- Dec. 31, 1999 through Jan. 7, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The fear among some investors is that computers may mistake  
``00'' for 1900 instead of 2000, leaving financial accounts in 
disarray, although the financial institutions and the federal 
government say that's highly unlikely. Most financial professionals 
think computer systems will suffer at most hiccups rather than 
breakdowns over the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in time we feel confident that our entire  
technological infrastructure ... is prepared for the year 2000,'' 
noted Louis Stafutti, J.P. Morgan's vice president for asset 
management services responsible for Y2K preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	With a few weeks to go before the new millennium, 99 percent of  
the nation's federally insured banks, thrifts and credit unions 
successfully completed Y2K preparations, while the same percentage 
of brokerage firms and securities transfer agents were Y2K 
compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	With that being said, the real millennium bug isn't digital,  
it's psychological, many financial experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any insanity is created through investors' minds,'' said  
Andrew Horowitz, president of Horowitz &AMP; Company in Weston, Fla. 
``This is a man-made event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horowitz advises clients to stay a bit more liquid in the weeks  
ahead, with more money placed in cash and Treasuries than earlier 
this year, and to refrain from any major strategic changes in their 
investments, though he also sees some future buying opportunities 
in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the smart people will look at that (Y2K fears) as  
an opportunity, truly an opportunity, as a place where the people 
who have money available can really take advantage of other 
people's insecurities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some time in mid-January people will wake up and say, 'Hey  
this wasn't so bad.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sargen also believes that investors may want to keep an extra  
cash cushion while also being prepared to deploy funds as 
opportunities arise. However, he cautioned against trying to 
``time'' the market or selling solely over Y2K fears. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markets could turn around and you would be left out in the  
cold, plus there are tax consequences in the form of capital 
gains,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We encourage investors to focus on fundamental factors that  
influence the market (such as) ... interest rates and the potential 
for further tightening. Of course, we won't invest in companies not 
well prepared for Y2K.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Grunfeld, first vice president of investments for Merrill  
Lynch, agreed that ``the bumps and grinds are going to happen'' 
from now through the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real advise ... is to take a long term strategic view of  
what you're doing with your investments.''

<HEADLINE> Man Accused in Reno Plot To Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered the government  
to release a Palestinian accused of plotting to kill Attorney 
General Janet Reno, ruling he was unconstitutionally detained for 
19 months. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William H. Walls is the first federal judge  
to reject the government's longstanding practice of detaining or 
deporting immigrants based on evidence it refuses to share, lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's argument ``ignores the axiomatic,  
constitutional premise that aliens, once legally admitted into the 
United States, are entitled to the shelter of the Constitution,'' 
Walls wrote Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walls ordered the immediate release of Kiareldeen, 31, who was  
arrested for overstaying a student visa, then detained on suspicion 
of plotting to kill Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Immigration and Naturalization Service obtained a stay  
of Walls' order Wednesday evening from a federal appeals court. 
Further arguments were scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've maintained all along that he is a danger,'' INS  
spokesman Bill Strassberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiaraldeen, who has been jailed since March 1998, was never  
charged with a plot on Reno's life. But the government has detained 
him and has been trying to deport him based on secret evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Summaries of the evidence given to immigration judges said  
Kiareldeen made a ``credible threat'' to kill Reno because of her 
role in prosecuting the bombers of the World Trade Center and that 
he is a suspected member of an unnamed terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen has testified that he does not know any of the men  
convicted in the Trade Center bombing and did not know who Reno was 
until he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cole, a Georgetown law professor who represents Hany  
Kiareldeen, called Wednesday's ruling ``a substantial victory, not 
only for all immigrants, but for fairness in government 
proceedings.''

<HEADLINE> Son Is a 'Blessing' for Rams QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Zachary Warner tried on his dad's helmet and  
shoulder pads, then smiled broadly as his parents sized him up. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you like that?'' Zachary's mother, Brenda, said. ``Just  
like Daddy wears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to play,'' Zachary said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ten-year-old Zachary is the pride and joy of St. Louis Rams  
quarterback Kurt Warner, his adopted father and the NFL's surprise 
star this season. Zachary's also blind, the result of an accident 
in infancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He means the world to me,'' Warner said of his son. ``He's  
just a true blessing in every sense of the word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Zachary accompanied his parents and several other  
Rams players to the Delta Gamma Center for children with visual 
impairments. Warner passed around the pads and helmets for the 
youngsters to try on, tossed footballs, signed autographs and posed 
for pictures. He even helped out with arts and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all part of the NFL and United Way Hometown Huddle, as  
players from all 31 teams spent the day in a variety of community 
service endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, members of the Ravens served meals to the  
homeless. Some Jacksonville Jaguars players helped students at a 
Boys &AMP; Girls club with their homework. Members of the Cleveland 
Browns helped build a playground for underprivileged kids. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis project was a perfect fit for Warner, who adopted  
Zachary and his sister, Jessie, after marrying Brenda two years 
ago. Another son, Cade, was born last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner met Brenda in 1992 at a country-music club in Cedar  
Falls, Iowa, where Warner played for the University of Northern 
Iowa. The two had an instant connection. But Brenda, divorced with 
a special needs child and a baby, didn't know if it would last. 
</P>
<P>
	``I dated men before that I never heard from again'' once they  
learned of the children, Brenda said. ``Kurt showed up the next 
morning and wanted to meet them. He fell in love with them before 
he fell in love with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family has had plenty of trials and tribulations. Brenda's  
parents were killed in an Arkansas tornado; Kurt bounced from the 
Arena Football League to NFL Europe before finally landing with the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	They've weathered it all with a strong belief in God. Warner  
spoke Friday at Billy Graham's crusade at the Trans World Dome. And 
Zachary, Warner said, has been a constant source of strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Zachary became blind as an infant, when his biological father  
lost his grip while carrying him from a bath. Zachary suffered 
severe brain damage. Doctors feared he would never walk or talk. 
</P>
<P>
	He beat the odds. Today, Zachary can see some items up close.  
Though he falls often, Zachary speaks, walks and talks. He loves to 
wrestle with his dad, even wears his dark hair in a Kurt 
Warner-like crew cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warners clearly felt at home at the center.  
</P>
<P>
	``Seven years ago, I was a single mom in this type of  
environment,'' Brenda said. ``We were on food stamps and needing 
help. Now, we want to give back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner and teammates Adam Timmerman, Joe Germaine, Az-Zahir  
Hakim, D'Marco Farr and Keith Lyle sat with the youngsters and made 
tiles for a ``trailing wall,'' decorated squares that help the 
children feel their way to rooms at the center. For Warner's tile, 
he designed a cross with ``Jesus'' written in the middle, a heart 
and a ``U'' (loves you) at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner makes the NFL minimum of $250,000, but he stands to earn  
much more, based on his performance during the Rams' improbable 5-0 
start. Team officials are already talking about renegotiating the 
contract of Warner, a third-stringer last year who moved to backup 
in preseason and became a starter when Trent Green suffered a 
season-ending knee injury in an exhibition game against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner has more than simply stepped in. He has thrown 15  
touchdown passes and only three interceptions and has an unheard-of 
quarterback rating of 131.4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warners say any raise or endorsement money that comes their  
way this year will go to a southwest Missouri camp that caters to 
children with special needs. Zachary attended the camp in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what it's all about -- to be able to use what we've done  
on the field to help people off the field,'' Warner said.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Foster Parents Win Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An admittedly worried judge has abandoned seven  
months of court efforts to reunite a recovering addict with her 
3-year-old son born with cocaine in his system. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Judith Brawka said Tuesday that the black  
youngster, known as Baby T, has suffered enough, has serious 
problems and should continue to live indefinitely with his wealthy, 
white foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The transition isn't working. ... This court will not force  
more disaster into this child's life,'' Brawka told mother Tina 
Olison, who kicked her cocaine habit and got a job in her battle to 
regain custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Brawka decided Baby T should remain with Edward and Anne Burke,  
who have had custody of Baby T since shortly after his birth. The 
Burkes are among Chicago's Democratic power elite. She is a 
prominent judge and former head of the state's child-welfare 
agency. He is chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ms. Olison nor the Burkes would comment following the  
court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's ruling was a complete turnaround from Brawka's  
decision in March to order a one-year transition to move the boy 
from the foster parents to live with Ms. Olison. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the judge said Baby T should be reunited with his  
mother and older brother and that black culture should be a factor 
in their upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brawka said Ms. Olison has squabbled with therapists and  
social workers. Brawka said trying to get Olison's cooperation at 
times was a task that would have frustrated ``skilled international 
negotiators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cook County Public Guardian Patrick Murphy, who had supported  
Ms. Olison's bid for custody, switched sides last week and said 
Baby T should stay with the Burkes. He cited such problems as 
squabbling between Ms. Olison and a social worker and her refusal 
at one point to attend therapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Brawka was not specific about the problems that Baby T is having  
but said they had to do with building relationships and trusting 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the pressures resulting from the custody fight  
``add to a sum of overwhelming problems for this child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brawka, a suburban Kane County judge brought in to assure that  
the Burkes' political influence would not be a factor, also warned 
Ms. Olison that she also could fail to get custody of her older 
son, identified as Baby B, if she continues squabbling with social 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Baby B is in his grandmother's custody.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Gain on Calif. Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- One wildfire was close to extinction  
while firefighters said they were gaining ground on several other 
blazes burning in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire that burned more than 26,000 acres and destroyed 69  
houses, 59 mobile homes and 300 outbuildings in Northern 
California's Shasta County, was expected to be extinguished today, 
said Don Ohrt, a spokesman for the California Department of 
Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire broke out early Saturday in a rural area near Redding,  
about 180 miles north of Sacramento. Investigators said a campfire 
may have sparked the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	In Yolo County, about 50 miles northwest of Sacramento,  
authorities said a fire that has burned at least 40,000 acres and 
destroyed one house, one cabin and five outbuildings was about 60 
percent contained. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Rumsey fire was expected to be fully contained  
today, said Bob Foley, a forestry department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fires that had scorched thousands of acres in Northern  
California also were near containment Tuesday, fire officials said.

<HEADLINE> ABC Food Lion Verdict Reversed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Wednesday  
reversed a jury verdict that found ABC committed fraud in a 
hidden-camera expose alleging unsanitary conditions at Food Lion's 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out a $315,000  
judgment against ABC over a 1992 ``PrimeTime Live'' story -- an 
award that a judge had earlier reduced from $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in a 2-1 ruling, found that Food Lion did not meet  
the legal standard for fraud under a North Carolina law because the 
chain could not prove it was injured when two reporters lied to get 
hired, secretly recorded store activities and quit weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	While the grocery chain denied the accusations, it did not  
pursue claims of libel or slander. Instead it won a claim of fraud 
seeking damages for the costs of hiring and training the two 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The court reversed, and said the supermarket chain wasn't  
damaged by the reporters' deception -- though it upheld $1 in 
damages against each reporter for breaching their duty of loyalty 
to Food Lion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The enduring message of this opinion is that the press will be  
protected against enormous judgments based on the content of 
articles unless the companies suing can prove that the articles 
weren't true,'' said Floyd Abrams, a New York media lawyer. ``This 
lawsuit was an attempted end run around the First Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also reversed the jury's finding that ABC  
violated North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, 
ruling that the law did not apply because the network and the 
supermarket chain were not in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC said the ruling was a victory for investigative reporting  
while Food Lion said it would review its legal options. 
</P>
<P>
	Two ABC reporters used false resumes to get jobs at a Food Lion  
store, then secretly videotaped employees for a story on 
food-handling practices that accused the grocery chain of selling 
rat-gnawed cheese and rotting meat. 
</P>
<P>
	The report alleged that Food Lion employees ground out-of-date  
beef along with new beef, bleached rank meat to remove its odor and 
redated products not sold before their expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury that found ABC guilty of fraud awarded the supermarket  
chain $5.5 million in punitive damages, but that was cut to 
$315,000 by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Food Lion was also awarded $1,402 in compensatory damages for  
the cost of hiring the two ABC employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Both ABC and Food Lion had appealed.  
</P>
<P>
	The award stunned some because it appeared to open a new line of  
legal attack against the news media and hidden-camera journalism 
that did not center on the veracity of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a victory for the American tradition of investigative  
journalism,'' said David Westin, ABC News president. ``The court 
concluded that, despite Food Lion's attempts to impugn our methods, 
no one at ABC News ever committed fraud or an unfair practice in 
investigating problems at various Food Lion stores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In dissent, Judge Paul V. Niemeyer wrote that there was ample  
evidence to support the jury's finding of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Food Lion said it was disappointed. ``This is a complicated  
legal area, and our lawyers will review the court's decision and 
advise us of our options,'' it said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Paulson, executive director of the First Amendment Center at  
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., said the ruling means 
plaintiffs who would never win a traditional libel suit ``will 
think twice using alternative methods of striking back at news 
media that are reporting in the public interest.''

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Study Raises Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Seeking clues about the high rate of breast cancer  
among wealthy women, researchers have come up with some possible 
leads involving chemical exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Focusing on the Boston suburb of Newton, the researchers found  
women in areas hit hardest by the disease used professional lawn 
and dry cleaning services more often than those in less-affected 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, neither money nor schooling cause breast cancer,''  
said Dr. Nancy Maxwell, the lead researcher. ``With the Newton 
study we tried to see if there might be environmental factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell cautioned there is no definitive evidence that chemicals  
or pesticides cause cancer. But she said the research points to the 
need for further investigation of possible connections. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of breast cancer in Newton was 13 percent higher than  
the statewide rate between 1982 and 1992, state health officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study ``has taken us one step further in trying to  
understand why socioeconomic status is a factor,'' said Suzanne 
Condon, director of environmental health assessment at the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The department funded 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers from Silent Spring Institute, a nonprofit  
research organization, randomly questioned 1,350 women -- not 
necessarily cancer patients -- ages 35 to 75. 
</P>
<P>
	The study showed that women in neighborhoods with higher rates  
of breast cancer typically had higher incomes and education levels 
than women in areas with lower breast cancer rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Known risk factors for breast cancer, such as delayed  
childbearing and family history of the disease, accounted for only 
a small part of the difference between areas with high and low 
rates of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the survey did suggest possible environmental factors.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, 65 percent of the women in the area with higher  
breast-cancer rates had used a professional lawn service, compared 
with 36 percent of the women in the low-incidence neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, 30 percent of those in the high-incidence area  
reported routine use of pesticides, compared with 23 percent in the 
low-incidence sector. And 45 percent of those in the high-incidence 
area used dry cleaning at least once a month, compared with 32 
percent in the less-affected neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for a national association of pesticide  
manufacturers stressed that studies have shown no conclusive links 
between breast cancer and environmental chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	A call seeking comment to the International Fabricare Institute,  
a trade association for dry cleaners, was not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Travelers Take Channel Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The European Union's abolition of duty-free sales  
hurt passenger traffic through the Channel Tunnel and caused retail 
sales to plummet, Eurotunnel said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger traffic fell 12 percent after the June 30 end to all  
internal EU duty-free sales, the British-French tunnel operator 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurotunnel said 853,638 cars and motorcycles were shuttled  
across the tunnel during the three month period to Sept. 30, 
compared with 964,961 in the same period a year earlier. The number 
of bus tours fell from 25,261 to 19,483. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide was in line with declines seen by Channel ferries on  
the rival sea routes, Eurotunnel said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said that revenues from shop sales fell 74 percent, to  
$17.8 million in this year's third quarter from $72.3 million in 
the July-September quarter of the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's airport operator, British Airports Authority, took  
over management of the shops on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, efforts made by Eurotunnel to increase the number of  
trucks using the tunnel apparently paid off. Freight traffic rose 
by 19 percent. Eurotunnel said due to that growth and increased 
prices, operating revenue rose by 1 percent to $229 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if it is too early to draw any firm conclusions, our  
commercial performance in the third quarter has been encouraging 
because we have succeeded in compensating for the disappearance of 
the significant profit realized from duty-free sales, mainly 
through price increases,'' said Patrick Ponsolle, group executive 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``These results are in line with the company's objectives for  
1999 and confirm that our recovery is continuing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eurotunnel also announced that Eurostar, which runs high-speed  
passenger trains between London and mainland European cities, saw 
improved traffic. About 1.9 million passengers traveled through the 
tunnel during this year's third quarter, compared with 1.8 million 
during the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> FCC Proposes Fine Against Qwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing one case in which a man's long-distance  
service allegedly was switched with a ``signed'' authorization by 
his dog Boris, federal regulators are proposing $2 million in fines 
against Qwest Communications International Inc. for violating laws 
against ``slamming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission charged Denver-based Qwest  
on Tuesday with illegally switching telephone service for 30 
consumers without their authorization -- a practice known as 
slamming. The proposed fines are based on customer complaints, 22 
of them in cases involving apparent forgery or falsified letters of 
authorization to switch service. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, according to the FCC, a man reported having his  
long-distance service switched with a ``signed'' authorization by 
his dog. For privacy reasons, the phone was listed in the local 
telephone directory under the dog's name, Boris. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, after Alda Hodgson learned from AT&AMP;T, her  
long-distance carrier, that she had been switched to another 
company, she received a letter addressed to her husband from Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodgson called Qwest to inform the company her husband could not  
have authorized the service to be switched: He had been dead for 7 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how all this happened,'' Hodgson said from her  
home near Riverside, Calif. She eventually had the charges removed, 
and her subscription was returned to AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission found in the other eight complaints that Qwest  
apparently had switched subscribers' long-distance carriers without 
proper authorization, in some cases failing to verify that consent 
was given. 
</P>
<P>
	Under commission rules, a carrier must have authorization to  
switch a subscriber's phone service. This can be given by a signed 
written form or orally if verified by an independent third party. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest has 30 days to pay the fines or show why it should not  
have to. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it would work with the FCC to address each  
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are verifying these complaints identified by the FCC to  
assure that we have already corrected the problems,'' said John 
Taylor, Qwest's senior vice president of consumer markets. ``We 
will take appropriate action against any person responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints involve slamming allegations against both Qwest  
and LCI International Telecom Corp., acquired by Qwest a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has received almost 1,200 written complaints alleging  
slamming by the two companies between Sept. 1, 1998, and Aug. 31, 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Slamming represents the largest area of telephone-related  
complaints at the FCC. The commission has proposed $13 million in 
fines in the past year in connection with the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the FCC adopted rules that give telephone customers  
broader remedies for slamming, including a 30-day period in which 
they can avoid paying long-distance charges to allow time to 
resolve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
indefinitely halted enforcement of the rules at the request of 
long-distance companies, who want the FCC to consider an industry 
plan.

<HEADLINE> Trade-Minded Governor Building Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Promoting California's products and  
services ranging from computers to cinema, Gov. Gray Davis has 
emerged as an international trade ambassador building his own 
relationships with foreign heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Since taking office in January, the Democratic governor has  
talked trade in California with the leaders of China, Japan, Mexico 
and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Davis's two-week overseas trip to promote the state's  
businesses this month, he is sitting down with the British, Israeli 
and Greek prime ministers, the top officials of Ireland and 
Scotland, and Palestinian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting the tone, Davis opened his tour Monday by lobbying  
British Prime Minister Tony Blair to buy California-made Boeing 
C-17 cargo planes for the Royal Air Force. Davis won no formal 
commitment, but reported the matter is under ``active 
consideration'' by the British. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Britain invests more in California than it does in  
any other state in the United States -- $9.4 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	California exports to Britain that year totaled $5.8 billion,  
led by industrial machinery and computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is emerging here is a California foreign policy,'' said  
Michael Nacht, dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at the 
University of California, Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're increasingly tied with the world economy, so the notion  
that a state as significant as California can have the luxury of 
not worrying about other countries is now gone,'' Nacht said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the gross domestic product of California -- home to  
Hollywood, Silicon Valley, ``agribusiness'' and two large ports -- 
was $1.1 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	California's economy is the eighth-largest in the world, said  
Mike Marando, spokesman for the state Trade and Commerce Agency. 
Jack Kyser, a Los Angeles economist, ranks it at No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	One-quarter of the state's gross product last year was directly  
related to foreign trade, according to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Tuesday that no state in the U.S. benefits more from  
foreign investment than California, which has large Hispanic and 
Asian populations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since at least 25 percent of our economy depends on our  
relationships with trading partners, it's important that California 
have a presence periodically in those countries,'' Davis said. 
``This international market is highly competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis spoke to reporters in a conference call from London, where  
he met Tuesday with BP Amoco chief executive Sir John Browne. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced in April it was acquiring Los  
Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., pending regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Davis opened an international trade and commerce  
office in London, part of his strategy designed to boost the 
profile of California companies abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven government and University of California employees will use  
the office as a base to promote investment in industries and 
interest in university research into information technology and 
biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, California House will be used as a prototype for  
future trade offices in Singapore, Japan and Mexico, Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Along With Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar staged a broad and sharp advance  
Wednesday, taking its cue from the buoyant stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0752, down  
from $1.0838 late Tuesday. The dollar also was quoted at 106.50 
Japanese yen, up from 105.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, the dollar weakened on the latest report of  
the U.S. trade gap. While the Commerce Department announced that 
the trade deficit narrowed slightly to $24.1 billion in August, it 
still was the third worst monthly performance in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a wide trade gap between imports and exports causes dollars  
to flood the world market, pressuring the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But a sharp rise in the stock market, with the Dow Jones  
industrial average up 1.8 percent and the Nasdaq composite index up 
3.7 percent, helped boost the dollar against most major currencies. 
As foreign buyers are attracted by U.S. stocks, they need to 
purchase dollars to invest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar went higher on the back of that rally,'' said Grant  
Wilson, senior foreign exchange trader at Mellon Bank in 
Pittsburgh. ``When the Dow rallies ... that's appealing to foreign 
investors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4813 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4678, and 1.4865 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4909. The British 
pound fell to $1.6644 from $1.6720. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8191 German 
marks, up from 1.8048; 6.1011 French francs, up from 6.0529; and 
1,800.93 Italian lire, up from 1,786.72.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Clemency Called a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's clemency offer to 16  
Puerto Rican nationalists helped heighten the threat of terrorism 
from militant groups seeking independence for the island, the 
Justice Department said in a report made public Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, presented at a hearing by the Senate Judiciary  
Committee on the clemency offer, said Puerto Rican separatist 
groups pose an ``ongoing threat'' to national security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Factors which increase the present threat from these groups  
include renewed activity by a small minority advocating Puerto 
Rican statehood, the 100-year anniversary of the U.S. presence in 
Puerto Rico and the impending release from prisons of members of 
these groups jailed for prior violence,'' said the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, the Justice Department's Five-Year Interagency  
Counterterrorism and Technology Crime Plan, was written a month 
after Clinton offered clemency to 16 convicted Puerto Rican 
militants. Most of them were associated with the FALN -- the Spanish 
abbreviation for Armed Forces of National Liberation -- blamed for 
130 bombings in the 1970s and 1980s that left six dead. The White 
House said none of the 16 had been involved in acts that caused 
injury or death. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, FBI Director Louis Freeh, the U.S.  
attorneys offices in Illinois and Connecticut, where the 
nationalists were prosecuted, were all opposed to their release. 
The Justice Department made its opposition to the clemency known in 
a 1996 recommendation to the White House, according to documents 
made public Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's clemency offer caused a furor, as did New York  
senatorial hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton's appeal to withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Judiciary hearing, Republicans sparred with Deputy  
Attorney General Eric Holder and Pardon Attorney Roger Adams over 
seeming violations of Justice Department clemency guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The original request for clemency, for instance, was made by the  
prisoners' lawyer, not the prisoners themselves. Adams acknowledged 
that was ``unusual'' but said it was not unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice officials declined to answer several questions,  
saying they were bound by the White House's claim of executive 
privilege over information specific to the clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why can't this White House just be open and tell the truth?''  
said committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The only Democrat at the hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont,  
scolded the Justice Department for failing to contact victims of 
FALN violence, either to get their views on the potential offer of 
clemency or to inform them that the prisoners were being released. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we could do a better job ... getting in touch with  
victims,'' Holder conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	Also presented at the hearing was the transcript of a phone  
conversation one Adolfo Matos, of the Puerto Rican separatists 
freed by Clinton, had in April while still in prison. In the 
conversation, which was taped routine inmate monitoring, Matos 
expresses no remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing to be ashamed of or feel that I have to ask for  
forgiveness,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matos did not mention violence specifically, but added that his  
resolve for his cause had grown while in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``My desire has gotten stronger, to the point where I want to  
continue. Continue to fight and get involved with my people, 
because I love them,'' Matos said.

<HEADLINE> Gov't OKs Kids' Online Privacy Regs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government laid out new rules for  
protecting kids' privacy on the Internet Wednesday, allowing 
companies to send e-mail to parents seeking permission to ask 
children questions -- but only if the information is not shared with 
other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules are designed to tell companies how to comply with a  
new federal privacy law that bans them from collecting personal 
information from children without a parent's permission. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most contentious provisions involved a compromise  
allowing businesses for the next two years to send e-mail to 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules from the Federal Trade Commission, approved 4-0,  
are expected to have a dramatic impact on hundreds of popular 
Internet sites aimed at children, which typically offer online 
games and entertainment in exchange for personal information 
valuable to marketers. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Benjamin, a mother of two young children in Rolling  
Meadows, Ill., called the law ``long overdue'' and bristled at how 
easy children online can be persuaded to disclose even the most 
personal details. 
</P>
<P>
	``It scares us,'' said Mrs. Benjamin, who recently warned her  
12-year-old niece about these risks. ``Children just give out 
information on the Internet. There's a lot of wonderful 
opportunities on the Internet ... (but) it can become a dangerous 
tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC will begin enforcing the new rules in April.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a real problem out there,'' said FTC Chairman Robert  
Pitofsky. ``We're going to give the industry six months to get its 
act together to make changes. After that, we'll monitor these Web 
sites and we'll take enforcement action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said Web sites that share children's information with  
other companies must obtain a parent's permission through mailed or 
faxed paperwork, calls to a toll-free number, through use of a 
credit-card number or via e-mail using nascent digital signature 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision over a parent's consent was among the most  
controversial. E-mail is the most convenient and immediate method 
for granting permission, but it's also simple to impersonate 
another person online -- especially for kids who often know more 
about technology than their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``E-mail is completely useless,'' said Stephen Savitzky, a  
father of two young girls in Silicon Valley who runs a Web site 
with warnings for kids. ``What's to keep the kids from giving their 
own e-mail address, or one of their many e-mail addresses? It's 
trivial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new law, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act,  
requires commercial Web sites generally to obtain consent from 
parents before asking children under 13 for their names, addresses, 
telephone numbers or other identifying information. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FTC did a good, balanced job,'' said Ron Plesser, an  
attorney who worked with the Direct Marketing Association and other 
industry groups. ``Everything's a compromise -- it's not all great 
for industry, but it resolves some major concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., who has frequently  
criticized the FTC on other privacy issues, praised it for a 
``remarkably good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent of Congress and the common sense expectations of  
parents seemed to have survived intact,'' Catlett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitofsky said that in two years the FTC will reconsider whether  
e-mail can be more widely used to seek a parent's permission, as 
techniques improve for ensuring the identity of e-mail authors. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry, which generally supported the privacy law, had  
warned regulators that imposing barriers that are too onerous 
between a child and his favorite Web site might discourage kids 
from spending time online. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pitofsky said rules requiring a parent to mail or fax their  
permission -- a process that could take days -- will be in effect 
``only if the company has in mind collecting the information, 
sorting it out and renting it. That is a sensitive enough area that 
the more rigorous approaches are justified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new law does not require companies to obtain a parent's  
permission to send a child information on a one-time basis, such as 
a digital coupon for a video game. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy law, enacted in October 1998, was prompted by an FTC  
study last year of 1,400 Web sites, including one where children 
were asked to give their names, addresses, e-mail addresses and 
ages and say whether they ever received gifts of stocks, cash, 
savings bonds or certificates of deposit.

<HEADLINE> Longtime Twins Owner Griffith Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Calvin Griffith, a tight-fisted owner who  
inherited the Washington Senators and moved them to Minnesota, died 
Wednesday in Melbourne, Fla. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith developed pneumonia, a kidney infection and a high  
fever on Monday, said Sima Griffith, his daughter-in-law. She said 
he had a pacemaker put in three to four weeks ago and had been in a 
rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith moved the Senators after the 1960 season and the team  
was renamed the Minnesota Twins. He sold the club for $36 million 
to Carl Pohlad in 1984, ending 65 years of franchise ownership by 
the Griffith family. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball was the family's primary business, and Calvin Griffith  
was intent on holding the line on escalating salaries. Former Twins 
great Harmon Killebrew recalled tough negotiations one year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were $500 apart and I wasn't going to let $500 stand  
between us and me getting to spring training,'' Killebrew said 
Wednesday from Scottsdale, Ariz. ``I ended up signing the contract. 
I told him that if that $500 meant that much, I'd go ahead and sign 
the contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all the acrimony brought by Griffith's frugality, his  
reputation was hurt much more by a speech to a local Rotary club in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black people don't go to ball games, but they'll fill up a  
rassling ring and put up such a chant they'll scare you to death,'' 
he said. ``We came (to Minnesota) because you've got good, 
hard-working white people here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Minneapolis Star wrote a front-page editorial calling for  
Griffith to sell the team. Griffith said his words were taken out 
of context, but civil rights groups called for a boycott of Twins 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Carew, whose contract was soon to expire, said he would no  
longer play on Griffith's ``plantation.'' Carew left Minnesota for 
the Angels in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Griffith, the Twins led the American League in attendance  
their first 10 seasons, featuring such stars as Killebrew, Carew, 
Tony Oliva, Zoilo Versalles, and Bob Allison. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people in Minnesota were trying to get a baseball club for  
so many years,'' Griffith said in 1995. ``They were on the verge of 
getting one several times. Then the Giants went to California, 
Cleveland stayed in Cleveland and the White Sox stayed in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Minnesota fans) got disappointed so many times, when they got  
a team they wanted to show their appreciation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The love affair peaked in 1965, when the Twins lost the World  
Series in seven games to the Los Angeles Dodgers. It began to fade 
during the 1970s as free agency crept into the game, and the Twins 
began losing top players. 
</P>
<P>
	``You talk about somebody standing up for his principles -- about  
how the game should be run or the ownership of a team -- Calvin 
certainly was one of the dinosaurs,'' Twins manager Tom Kelly, who 
joined the team as a coach a year before Griffith sold the team, 
told WCCO Radio on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith was among the first owners to prophesy doom for  
small-market teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very difficult for Calvin to compete in the way that  
the game is today, so I think he saw the writing on the wall,'' 
Killebrew said. ``There wasn't any way he could survive and that's 
why he sold the team to Mr. Pohlad,'' Killebrew said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins, under Pohlad, won World Series titles in 1987 and  
1991. Some of the key players on those teams were acquired under 
Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
	Public sentiment turned against Griffith when he talked about  
selling the Twins to a group that wanted to move the Twins to 
Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Pohlad sold the Twins two weeks ago to a group led by Glen  
Taylor, owner of the NBA's Timberwolves, and Robert Naegele Jr., 
the lead investor of the Wild, the Minnesota team that enters the 
NHL next season. The sale is contingent on a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins have languished at or near the bottom of the American  
League in recent years and attendance has plunged at the Metrodome. 
The Twins finished 1999 with a 63-97-1 record, worst in all 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith was born in Montreal on Dec. 1, 1911, one of Jimmy and  
Jane Robertson's seven children. He and sister Thelma were sent to 
Washington to live with their aunt and uncle when Calvin was 11 and 
Thelma was 9 because their parents were struggling financially. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jimmy Robertson died a short time later, the children were  
adopted by Addie and Clark Griffith and took the Griffith name. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1920s, Griffith was a bat boy and the mascot for  
the Senators, the team for which his uncle and adopted father 
became a Hall of Fame pitcher. Clark Griffith was also a co-founder 
of the American League and owner of the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Griffith worked in various capacities in the minors and  
majors before taking control of the Senators in 1955 after his 
adopted father died. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith, who spent winters in Florida and summers in Minnesota,  
is survived by his wife, Belva Block; son, Clark II; daughters 
Corinne Pillsbury and Clare Griffith; three grandchildren; sister 
Mildred Cronin, widow of former major league shortstop Joe Cronin; 
and brother Billy Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service is planned at Westminster Presbyterian Church  
in Minneapolis at an undetermined date. Griffith will be buried at 
Fort Lincoln Cemetery in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Talks Continue Over Lending Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Negotiations between Treasury Secretary  
Lawrence Summers and Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, continued for a full 
day Wednesday as a dispute over community lending rules for banks 
threatened to doom legislation overhauling the financial services 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	As the meeting broke up in the evening, Summers told reporters,  
``There are significant unresolved issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The marathon closed-door talks at the Capitol between  
administration officials and Gramm, chairman of the Senate Banking 
Committee, and other key Republican lawmakers have been going on 
through much of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides support in principle the legislative package, which  
would lift Depression-era legal barriers and allow banks, brokerage 
firms and insurance companies to merge and sell each other's 
products. House and Senate negotiators have been in the final 
stages of drafting a measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, however, has threatened a veto over  
provisions in the legislation it says would weaken the 1977 
Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to make loans in 
low-income and minority areas in which they operate. Gramm, who 
drafted the provisions, is a longtime critic of the 1977 law and 
has blocked efforts to extend its reach in the new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and his advisers appear to have been forced  
into a prickly dilemma by the community lending issue. If Clinton 
abandons his staunch support of the 1977 law, he risks provoking 
the ire of key Democratic constituencies such as blacks and civil 
rights activists like Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Clinton refuses to budge on the lending law, he could  
jeopardize the financial overhaul legislation. Some financial 
industry lobbyists have privately held out the retaliatory threat 
that, if that were to occur, Hillary Clinton might be deprived of 
potential campaign funds from Wall Street and the banking industry 
for her presumed Senate run in New York -- home to both industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson underlined the high stakes involved in the issue at a  
news conference last Friday where he denounced the financial 
overhaul legislation as ``a major step backwards'' that would gut 
the community investment law. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, consumer advocates and lawmakers pushing for  
stronger consumer privacy protections have criticized the financial 
overhaul legislation as inadequate in that area and put additional 
pressure on Clinton to veto the bill in its current form. It could 
hurt the administration to be perceived by the public as less than 
a stalwart advocate of consumers' privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the cost of moving to the new financial services  
marketplace is that a consumer's most personal financial secrets 
are going to be compromised, then that price is simply too high,'' 
Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., told reporters Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Rams Lose Kick Return Specialist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Earlier this week, St. Louis Rams coach Dick  
Vermeil said Tony Horne's two scoring kickoff returns were due 
mostly to blocking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The returns he's made are based on overall execution, which is  
not a negative in regard to him,'' Vermeil said Monday. ``Most NFL 
returners could have returned them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil might have been dropping a broad hint that the team was  
about to lose the NFL's leading return man to a four-game substance 
abuse suspension. Horne decided not to appeal the suspension on 
Tuesday, the Rams received official notification in a two-sentence 
letter, and Horne and his 36-yard average were shut down until the 
San Francisco game Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Horne can't participate in any team activities until Nov. 15.  
Another offense would mean a one-year suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a disappointment, because he let himself down and he let  
his teammates down and he let his coaching staff and his city 
down,'' Vermeil said Wednesday. ``There's a price to pay for the 
mistakes you make and he's paying the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates didn't seem particularly shocked by the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``He made a mistake and we're just going to move on from it,''  
linebacker Mike Jones said. ``It's a long season, so you're going 
to have some adversity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The replacement for Horne, 23, is Ron Carpenter, a defensive  
back who led the NFL with a 27.7-yard kickoff return average in 
1995. He had a best of 58 yards that year and also returned four 
kickoffs for touchdowns in the Arena League last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he's a Tony Horne; there aren't many of them  
around,'' Vermeil said. ``But I expect him to do a real good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Carpenter doesn't work out, Vermeil also could use Az-Zahir  
Hakim, who had an 84-yard punt return for a touchdown against 
Cincinnati Oct. 3., or Torry Holt. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter was among the final cuts before the season opener  
despite a strong training camp at defensive back. He was re-signed 
the following week, although he's been inactive all four games he's 
been on the roster, so he's happy to be playing -- period. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just itching to get out there,'' Carpenter said. ``I'm  
looking forward to running down on kickoff coverage and hitting 
somebody. I haven't hit anybody in five weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-1 and 203 pounds, Carpenter is four inches taller and 30  
pounds heavier than Horne. He's also a step slower. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll hit the hole right away instead of trying to use my speed  
to outflank some guys,'' he said. ``And hopefully it'll break open. 
I can get down the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NFL players are required to undergo random drug testing and  
Horne's suspension means he has failed at least two drug tests. 
Under most circumstances, a four-game suspension means a player has 
failed three drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The first offense results in an evaluation; a second offense  
results in a fine; and a third offense brings a four-game 
suspension. Vermeil wouldn't divulge any details of the suspension, 
citing confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
	Occasionally, a four-game suspension comes after a second  
failure of a drug test, particularly if he had substance abuse 
problems in college. Horne was arrested on a driving under the 
influence of alcohol charge at Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	Horne was signed by the Rams in 1998 as an undrafted rookie and  
was the special teams player of the year after setting a team 
record with 1,306 yards on 56 returns. He returned a kickoff 102 
yards for a touchdown that season against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Horne had a 97-yarder for a touchdown Oct. 10 against San  
Francisco and followed up with a 101-yarder at Atlanta on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he gave us was the blind confidence in his ability to  
attack coverage,'' Vermeil said. ``He didn't care who was coming, 
he takes them on. It'll be tough to duplicate that.''

<HEADLINE> Elderly Fla. Suspect Is On Parole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- An 87-year-old man accused of robbing a  
bank was already on probation for a similar crime in Mississippi, 
and may be the nation's oldest bank robbery suspect, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gray-bearded J.L. Hunter Roundtree pleaded guilty in August  
to a bank robbery in Biloxi, Miss., and placed on three years 
unsupervised probation when he tried his luck again Monday in 
Pensacola, said police, who initially gave his age as 88. 
</P>
<P>
	The homeless man, whose 88th birthday is in December, may be the  
nation's oldest bank robbery suspect, although no one officially 
tracks that statistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golly, I think we have prosecuted people that old, but nothing  
like this,'' said Assistant State Attorney Joe Schiller. ``It's 
usually for fighting with neighbors or something like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said that on Monday Roundtree walked unarmed into a  
NationsBank office and handed a note to a teller demanding cash. 
Customers tackled him in the parking lot after he tried to flee on 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Roundtree is being held in lieu of a $10,000 bond. His prior  
bank robbery conviction could lead to time behind bars if he is 
convicted of the Pensacola charge, authorities said.

<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A Columbine High School student has been  
arrested for allegedly threatening to ``finish the job'' of the two 
teen-age gunmen who carried out the bloodbath last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old student, whose name was withheld because he is a  
juvenile, was jailed Tuesday on charges of inciting destruction of 
life or property, and theft for allegedly stealing a school 
microphone. He was held on $500,000 bond.

	A student reported that the teen-ager had remarked that he would  
``finish the job started by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,'' 
Sheriff John P. Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, killed 12 fellow students and a

<HEADLINE> Browns Get Abdul-Jabbar From Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The expansion Browns got their first win on  
Tuesday, beating the trading deadline to get some help for their 
lousy running game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, ranked 26th in the NFL in rushing, acquired running  
back Karim Abdul-Jabbar from the Miami Dolphins for a future draft 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns, who dropped to 0-6 with a loss at Jacksonville last  
Sunday, traded their sixth-round pick in next year's draft for 
Abdul-Jabbar, a three-year pro eligible to become a free agent 
after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Browns extend Jabbar's contract before the last day of  
the NFL's 1999 fiscal year -- an undetermined date in February -- the 
Dolphins would also acquire Cleveland's fifth-round pick in the 
2001 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited to have Karim join us,'' said Dwight Clark,  
Cleveland's director of football operations. ``He is a good young 
back and will be given the opportunity to contribute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar, 25, started three of Miami's games this season,  
rushing for 95 yards and one touchdown in 28 attempts. He also had 
four receptions for 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was benched in favor of rookies Cecil Collins and J.J.  
Johnson and was inactive for Miami's past two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karim has done a great job for us in the past,'' Dolphins  
coach-general manager Jimmy Johnson said. ``However, with the 
emergence of our young running backs, playing with the Browns will 
be a good situation for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a season-high 113-yard performance against the  
Jaguars, Cleveland's rushing offense improved its ranking to 26th 
in the league. But the Browns' inability to run the ball 
consistently has allowed defenses to play close to the line of 
scrimmage and put more pressure on rookie quarterback Tim Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Kirby, primarily a third-down back throughout his career,  
has been the Browns' featured back, with George Jones and recently 
acquired Rashaan Salaam as backups. Salaam, who made one carry for 
two yards late in Sunday's game at Jacksoville, was released to 
make room for Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby has rushed for 300 yards on 85 carries and one TD through  
six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said Browns president Carmen Policy personally handled the  
negotiations with Johnson, and was able to finalize the trade 
before Tuesday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Carmen) shook off the rust, got on the phone directly with  
Jimmy Johnson, and closed the deal for us,'' Clark said. ``Adding 
Abdul-Jabbar to our current running back group of Terry Kirby, 
George Jones, Marc Edwards and Tarek Saleh will strengthen out 
running game this season and hopefully for seasons to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins selected the 5-foot-11, 205-pound Abdul-Jabbar in  
the third round of the 1996 draft out of UCLA. He is ranked second 
to Larry Csonka (53) in Dolphins history with 33 career touchdowns, 
and his 3,063 yards rushing place him fifth on Miami's career list. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar, who rushed for 1,116 yards in 1996 as a rookie,  
was expected to be in Cleveland on this morning for a physical.

<HEADLINE> Security Guard Acquitted of Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A New York Yankees fan arrested during a 1998  
playoff game against the Cleveland Indians said he was disappointed 
by the acquittal of the arresting officer on an assault complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	James B. Shaw, 43, of Cleveland Heights, was acquitted Tuesday  
by Municipal Court Judge Gerald F. Sweeney after a four-hour trial 
on a complaint filed by Jeffrey A. Jakimtschuk, 29, of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Jakimtschuk, who faces trial Nov. 8 in Municipal Court, said  
Wednesday that the acquittal was unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tried. It just came up that way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jakimtschuk was arrested at Jacobs Field on Oct. 9, 1998, for  
disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. He claimed that Shaw hit 
him several times, cut his lip and punctured his ear drum. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, a Cleveland police narcotics detective who was working  
off-duty at the stadium, said Jakimtschuk refused to stay in his 
seat and tried to pick fights with other fans. When arrested, 
Jakimtschuk refused to be handcuffed, cursed and tried to spit on 
Shaw, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer cannot comment on the acquittal because of a pending  
departmental disciplinary hearing arising from the case, police 
spokesman Lt. Edward Thiery said.

<HEADLINE> Paint Sales Lift DuPont's Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- DuPont Co.'s third-quarter earnings rose  
11 percent, driven by an increase in sales of industrial and 
automotive paint. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest chemical company reported Wednesday that it  
had earnings from continuing operations of $625 million, or 59 
cents per share, compared with $610 million, or 53 cents per share, 
in the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The report for the July-September quarter met Wall Street  
expectations. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial 
predicted earnings of 58 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on a strong and continuing recovery in our Asian  
business and an improving outlook for Europe, we remain confident 
of double-digit earnings growth next year,'' said Charles O. 
Holliday, Jr., DuPont chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, DuPont stock slid $1.56 1/4 cents a share, or 2.5 percent,  
to $61.87 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, DuPont recorded net income of $7.5 billion for the  
quarter, an overwhelmingly majority of which was due to the 
company's successful spinoff of its energy subsidiary Conoco. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest gains for DuPont were in its Performance Coatings  
division, a new branch of the company created after the $1.9 
billion acquisition in March of Herberts, a leading German 
manufacturer of automotive and industrial paint. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont had sales of $1.6 billion in specialty coatings and  
polymers, an increase of 51 percent from the $1.07 billion in sales 
during the third quarter last year. Excluding Herberts, sales in 
the division jumped 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge in specialty paint sales helped overcome drops in  
sales of agricultural and nylon products. Agricultural sales fell 
19 percent from the year-earlier quarter to $461 million, and sales 
in nylon declined 4 percent to $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Modest gains in other segments -- pigments, polyester and  
pharmaceuticals -- helped the company post a 7 percent overall gain 
in sales to a total of $6.5 billion. Excluding Herberts, sales were 
essentially flat, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in Asia increased 26 percent, a third-quarter record for  
DuPont and a sign that the region is starting to shake off its 
economic woes, said John Himes, senior vice president for DuPont. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings from continuing operations for the first nine months of  
the year was $2.26 billion, the company said, up about 1 percent 
from the $2.23 billion for the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the first nine months this year totaled $19.8 billion,  
compared with $18.67 billion a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Declares Disaster in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton said Hurricane  
Irene caused a major disaster in Florida and ordered federal help 
Wednesday for those hit hardest by the storm's drenching rains and 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's declaration makes residents in 18 counties in the  
southern half of the state eligible for disaster housing, grants, 
low-cost loans and other programs. Shirley Collins, chief of 
recovery efforts for the state, said the aid could cover some 
losses that insurance does not. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane unloaded a foot and a half of rain in some parts  
of Florida last week. Five people were killed by downed power 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary surveys show 2,800 homes are uninhabitable and  
infrastructure damage will cost about $150 million to repair. Early 
estimates also show major damage to crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a major effort to get folks back, but we'll  
do our best,'' said James Lee Witt, director of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Faces Protests in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin -- unused to seeing  
public protest in his own land -- again on Wednesday faced 
demonstrations by rights activists, who made it clear they would 
keep up the pressure throughout his historic state visit to 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Rights protesters and opponents of the Chinese occupation of  
Tibet were waiting when Jiang arrived on Monday, and have dogged 
his route since. 
</P>
<P>
	They waved flags and sang songs outside Buckingham Palace  
Tuesday night, as Queen Elizabeth II feted Jiang and his wife at a 
glittering state banquet. And on a barge trip down the River Thames 
to see the Greenwich Royal Observatory and Millennium Dome on 
Wednesday, Jiang passed beneath a banner that pro-Tibet activists 
unfurled from a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Chinese leader arrived for an engagement later at the  
Savoy Hotel in central London, a cyclist evaded police cordons, 
rode in front of the presidential limousine and waved a Tibetan 
flag. Two men were arrested after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the visit to the Savoy, where Jiang was visiting Bank  
of China staff, his motorcade passed within a few feet of chanting 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	After an official luncheon, Jiang, known to be a Shakespeare  
admirer, visited the re-creation of Shakespeare's Globe Theater on 
the south bank of the Thames and watched part of a performance of 
``Julius Caesar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 demonstrators waving multi-colored banners gathered  
opposite London's Guildhall, the ancient town hall, before Jiang's 
arrival for a banquet Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	They chanted slogans from behind police lines, and one group  
staged a demonstration of Falun Gong martial arts, whose 
practitioners have been suppressed in China. 
</P>
<P>
	As an army band began to play, protesters sounded air horns and  
sirens in an effort to drown the music out. After Jiang went 
inside, protesters burned a Chinese flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy police protection afforded to him -- and the distance  
at which many demonstrators have been kept -- prompted some 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon Hughes of the opposition Liberal Democrat party said  
police must guarantee that people be allowed to protest peacefully 
along the presidential route for the rest of the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``No head of state should be spared the views of their  
opponents, no matter how important their visit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street  
office said Blair would raise China's human rights record when the 
two leaders meet Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prime minister will express the concern we have about the  
human rights record, as we did when we were in China, but he will 
want to talk about other issues relating to other parts of our 
relationship,'' the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the two countries have warmed since Britain  
returned Hong Kong to China's control in 1997. British investment 
in China was valued at $13 billion at the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Britain announced new business deals worth up to  
$3.30 billion between China and some of Britain's largest 
companies, which it said cemented the United Kingdom's position as 
the largest European investor in China. 
</P>
<P>
	One BP Amoco contract -- to do a feasibility study and to develop  
a plant to produce petroleum derivatives -- is worth about $2.5 
billion. Another project involves constructing an $800 million 
power plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang and his wife have been the queen's guests at Buckingham  
Palace during their stay. They were to travel to Paris on Friday 
and to begin a two-day visit to Portugal on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Gore Plans Deadbeat Dad Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore urged fathers on  
Wednesday to ``step up to their responsibilities'' and pay child 
support or risk losing welfare benefits or damaging their credit 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	If they are unable to pay, the Democratic presidential candidate  
said he would seek to expand welfare programs to help them find and 
keep work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Way too many children are living without the influence of  
their fathers,'' Gore said at the Congress Heights United Methodist 
Church. ``There are too many mothers who are struggling because of 
fathers who will not step up to their responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Children and mothers are not the only ones who can benefit from  
increased paternal involvement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outside of a genuine religious experience, there is hardly  
anything that is more transforming in the life of a man than 
getting involved with his children,'' Gore said. ``It can change 
his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore laid out his ``responsible fatherhood'' package one day  
before Bill Bradley, his Democratic presidential rival. Bradley 
travels to New York on Thursday to unveil what his spokesman called 
``a comprehensive package to make a major move against child 
poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the vice president's plan also was designed to attack  
child poverty by remedying two of its biggest causes: financial and 
emotional abandonment by fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proposed giving federal child-support funds only to states  
that require all non-custodial parents -- mainly fathers -- who owe 
child support to get a job and pay up, or go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	If elected president, Gore said he also would require fathers to  
sign ``personal responsibility contracts,'' in which they would 
acknowledge paternity and pledge to work to pay child support, as a 
condition of getting aid from the Welfare to Work program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Gore's plan, the government would provide credit card  
companies with data on ``deadbeat dads'' who have not paid child 
support and urge lenders to deny them new credit cards or line of 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also referred to another group he calls ``dead broke dads''  
-- those who don't pay because they can't afford to -- his plan would 
broaden regulations allowing states to use federal welfare money to 
help them find and keep jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 welfare reform law moved millions of families off  
welfare, Gore said, but there are still many left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to lead the next generation of welfare reform that will  
ask fathers to step up to their responsibility,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also offered measures to help ensure children grow up in  
two-parent homes, including new grants to community and religious 
groups to ``help couples prepare for and strengthen their marriage, 
become better parents and reduce domestic violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president routinely pre-empts Bradley's speeches. Days  
before the former New Jersey senator unveiled an ambitious and 
expensive plan last month to provide near-universal health 
insurance, Gore rushed together a more limited health plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley press secretary Eric Hauser said it was a matter of Gore  
``agreeing with our agenda'' and lacking his own new ideas. ``The 
depth and significance of our proposals to solve big problems are 
far greater than his. That's even more clear given that a 
significant part of the announcement today are initiatives that the 
vice president already proposed,'' Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane fired back with a reference to  
Bradley's vote in the Senate in favor of President Reagan's 1981 
spending cuts. ``Al Gore's interest and commitment to strengthening 
families dates back ... to 1981 when he stayed and fought against 
the Reagan budget cuts that devastated programs for working 
families and the poor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore reached out Wednesday to key primary states even while  
campaigning in Washington. He made calls to reporters in New York 
which he criticized Texas Gov. George W. Bush's environmental 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	He also spoke with reporters in Iowa, saying an increasingly  
competitive race with Bradley for the Democratic presidential 
nomination wouldn't force him out of the political center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to cause me to change my views,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Harper Wants To Pay Back Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- For a guy who's been out of the NFL for two  
years, was unemployed two weeks ago and is getting to play only as 
a last resort, Dallas Cowboys receiver Alvin Harper sure has a lot 
to say. 
</P>
<P>
	What Harper thinks suddenly became of interest because of a  
series of injuries that have taken him from the sofa of his Fort 
Washington, Md., home to spot duty Sunday against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper used his newfound status Wednesday to say the Redskins  
mistreated him and to take a swipe at receivers in general, saying 
he decided to come back because he thinks he's better than many of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	His sharpest words were aimed at Redskins coach Norv Turner, who  
signed Harper as a free agent in 1997, three years after the pair 
were on two Super Bowl champions together in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The reunion soured quickly. Harper caught only two passes in 12  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Norv knows he didn't do me right,'' Harper said. ``He didn't  
give me a chance. He should've at least played me. They lied to me. 
They were liars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first day of camp, they told me, `No one is the starter.  
You and Leslie Shepherd will both get equal playing time and then 
we will go from there.' I never got equal anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he thought of Harper's comments, Turner said:  
``Nothing, nothing. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harper's lack of playing time is somewhat justified by the fact  
he hasn't played a down since Washington released him Dec. 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper has spent most of his free time playing golf, but he's  
still kept an eye on football. Lately, he's been thoroughly 
unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking at the players around the league who played my  
position and thought there's some ungodly material out there,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being about 15 pounds overweight, Harper called Dallas  
three weeks ago and requested a tryout. He showed enough that the 
Cowboys said they'd think about him if they ever had an opening. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days later, Michael Irvin was injured and Harper was  
signed for a pro-rated share of the veteran minimum, $400,000. 
Still, he was a long shot to ever play. 
</P>
<P>
	Then rookie Wane McGarity dislocated his shoulder Monday night  
against the New York Giants. So, on Wednesday, Harper received a 
crash course in a Dallas playbook that's vastly different from the 
one he had here from 1991-94. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stuff they want me to learn for this game is no problem. I  
learned that already this morning,'' he said. ``The whole offense, 
give me another week or so. I already have 90 percent of it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his first stint as a Cowboy, Harper was the deep threat  
who either kept secondaries from focusing on Irvin or burned them 
for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the NFL by averaging 24.9 yards per catch in 1994, then  
had a playoff-record 94-yarder. He's best remembered for 
celebrating touchdowns by dunking the ball over the goalpost. 
</P>
<P>
	But all Dallas wants from Harper now is an outside receiver in  
four-receiver sets, something Irvin used to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is my last opportunity to show people I've still  
got it,'' Harper said. ``I'm a better player now because I'm 
smarter. I know what I need to do to get the job done. Now I've got 
to do it in game situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said Harper's conditioning will  
determine how much he plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not in great shape yet,'' Gailey said. ``We'd like to  
have had another week or two before we throw him in, but he has to 
go.''

<HEADLINE> Rabid Skunks Bite Two in Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- Two Worcester-area people have been bit  
by rabid skunks in the past week as a burgeoning population of the 
normally mild-mannered creatures search for dens for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	A toddler was bit on the wrist as he played in his yard in  
Auburn, and a 50-year-old drifter who went after a skunk with a 
baseball bat in Westboro was found dead outside his van. Officials 
say the man was covered with skunk bites, but the bites are not 
considered the cause of his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of skunks out there,'' said Susan Langlois,  
wildlife biologist for the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and 
Wildlife. A higher population of skunks means a higher incidence of 
rabies, but it's still unusual for two skunks to attack two people 
within 10 miles of each other in the space of a week, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two consecutive mild winters and an abundant supply of rodents,  
which skunks eat, account for the rise in the skunk population, 
said Dr. Michael McGuill, chief veterinarian for the state 
Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Dignard, 50, was found dead one week ago outside the van  
where he lived. A skunk believed responsible for the bites on his 
body was killed and tested positive for rabies, but the bites are 
not believed to have caused his death, McGuill said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Auburn, Kimberly Riley and her two children were undergoing  
medical treatment after her 21-month-old son was bitten on the 
wrist and scratched by a rabid skunk Sunday in the family's yard.

<P>
	The Clinton administration supports the legislation in principle  
but has threatened a presidential veto, raising objections in three 
key areas: how the new combined financial companies should be 
structured, consumer privacy protections and the community lending 
rules for banks. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement was struck last Thursday on the structure and  
regulation of the new companies, leaving in contention privacy 
protections and the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, which requires 
banks to make loans in low-income and minority areas in which they 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has objected to provisions in the financial  
overhaul legislation that it says would weaken the 1977 law. Senate 
Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who drafted the 
provisions, is a longtime critic of the community lending law and 
has blocked efforts to extend its reach in the new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm told reporters Tuesday that ``In the end, it may be that  
we get no agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He met late Monday night with Treasury Secretary Lawrence  
Summers and Gene Sperling, President Clinton's top economic 
adviser, in an effort to reach an accord. An agreement would almost 
assure House and Senate passage of the legislation and the 
president signing it into law, after 20 years of efforts by some 
lawmakers, Wall Street and the banking and insurance industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The closed-door meetings between administration officials and  
Gramm and other GOP lawmakers continued Tuesday at the Capitol with 
the main focus on the community lending law, congressional aides 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The talks were to 
continue today, and the House and Senate negotiators were resuming 
their drafting session in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, the House and Senate negotiators rejected in a  
mostly party-line vote a Democratic proposal that would have 
allowed consumers to stop their banks from sharing their personal 
financial data with both affiliated financial firms and outside 
companies such as telemarketers. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers adopted instead a provision that would give  
consumers that right only with regard to outside companies. Their 
data still could be shared among banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies that are under the same corporate ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents to the financial overhaul legislation complain it  
would increase the concentration of financial power in a few 
corporations and hurt consumers' privacy. Backers say it would help 
consumers by providing one-stop financial shopping and saving them 
millions of dollars.

<HEADLINE> NBC Enjoys Best Week Since Mid '98 / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Clearly, television viewers like the looks of  
Alan Alda with fake bloodstains on his clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	The erstwhile ``M A S H'' surgeon, starting a brief stint as a  
doctor on ``ER,'' boosted the popular medical drama's ratings and 
led NBC to its best week since the network televised Michael 
Jordan's final games in mid-1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Alda began working in the emergency room of ``ER'''s Cook County  
General Hospital in Chicago last Thursday. The well-publicized 
appearance increased the show's audience by 2 million people over 
the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was easily last week's most-watched show, with nearly 9  
million more viewers than its closest competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's 11.0 rating and 18 share won Nielsen Media Research's  
weekly ratings race. It was the network's biggest weekly audience 
since June 1998, when NBC covered Jordan's last games in the NBA 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sport -- baseball -- helped NBC last week. The New York  
Mets' 15-inning victory over the Atlanta Braves Sunday in the 
National League Championship Series was the highest-rated league 
championship game with an afternoon start since 1987, perhaps 
because it stretched to nearly 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	It enabled NBC to do well on a night that CBS normally wins, and  
postpone a TV movie on disc jockey Alan Freed that had received 
poor reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS finished second for the week with a 9.2 rating and 15 share.  
Fox, also buoyed by baseball coverage, finished third with a 7.6 
rating and 13 share and ABC had a 7.2 rating and 12 share. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB had a 3.1 rating and 5 share, improving UPN had a 2.8  
rating and 5 share and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race  
with a 7.5 rating and 16 share. The ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 7.4 
rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.4 
rating and 14 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Oct. 11-17, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' NBC, 20.4; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 13.8; ``Friends,'' NBC,  
13.8; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 12.3; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 12.2; ``National League Championship Series: Atlanta 
vs. N.Y. Mets,'' NBC, 12.0; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 11.7; ``Judging 
Amy,'' CBS, 11.7; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 11.7; ``CBS Sunday Movie: 
Silk Hope,'' CBS, 11.4.

<HEADLINE> Terrell Davis Watching From Side </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- As Terrell Davis limps through the locker room  
with metal canes attached to each arm, it's hard to believe that 10 
months ago he became the fourth player in NFL history to run for 
2,000 yards in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is life after reconstructive knee surgery.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's painful, man. I can't wait until I can walk,'' Davis said  
Wednesday while taking a break in the Denver locker room. ``That's 
the hard part, not being able to get around on your own, but I see 
signs of improvement every day. I'm able to do more things and get 
a little stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos (2-4) have adjusted well without Davis, going 2-0  
since he was injured while making a tackle after an interception 
Oct. 3. He has watched both games on television, talking to the 
screen nearly every play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always tough to watch the game,'' Davis said. ``I'm a fan  
now. It's a different perspective. When you're at home, you're 
sitting there and you're not tired. You're not hot. You're not 
cold. You're not freezing. It's different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even while sitting in front of the TV, Davis straps his  
reconstructed right knee into a motion machine that bends his leg 
at the joint. It is part of an intensive rehabilitation expected to 
last 4-6 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Walking on his own is at least three weeks away, and the days  
already seem long. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's boring. It's real boring,'' Davis said. ``It's almost  
like starting back at elementary level because you have to retrain 
the muscles to do things that they've been doing for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis works out about eight hours a day, lifting weights and  
doing whatever he can to strengthen his swollen knee. He has ``no 
doubt'' he can return to his MVP form, and his teammates share that 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you've been on top of your game and something like this  
occurs, you're going to be driven to get back,'' said fullback 
Howard Griffith. ``You want to prove people wrong and come back 
better and stronger than when you left. It's an interesting 
challenge for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Davis sidelined, Griffith has been given more  
responsibility. He had seven carries for 25 yards Sunday at Green 
Bay, compared to four rushes for 13 yards all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the ground work, however, has been given to rookie  
Olandis Gary, dubbed ``Baby Riggins'' -- a reference to bruising 
Washington running back John Riggins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard that,'' Gary said. ``Hopefully my career can  
go as well as his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary would do well to follow the footsteps of Davis, who topped  
1,000 yards in each of his first four seasons and increased his 
production every year. Gary's 124 yards on 37 carries last week 
laid a good foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing a great job. I'm happy for him,'' Davis said.  
``It's exciting to see him come in and play well and help our team 
out. He's missing some cuts, but I think that's going to come with 
just playing the game.''

<HEADLINE> Skins Punter Turk Has Broken Finger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Three-time Pro Bowl punter Matt Turk, who  
also is the Washington Redskins holder, may miss Sunday's game at 
Dallas because of a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
	The development sent the Redskins scrambling for an emergency  
punter and holder. Several out-of-work punters will be auditioned 
at Redskin Park on Thursday, and quarterback Brad Johnson stayed 
after practice Wednesday to work as holder with snapper Dan Turk 
and kicker Brett Conway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brad has held before,'' coach Norv Turner said. ``I would  
prefer him not to, but he's probably our best solution right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Turk, who was to have surgery Wednesday night, broke the  
finger during Sunday's game at Arizona. On the plane ride home, he 
turned to brother Dan and said: ``I caught one of your snaps kinda 
funny.'' The brothers thought it was only sprained, and Dan Turk 
playfully jerked at the finger. 
</P>
<P>
	When Matt Turk was still experiencing discomfort Wednesday  
morning, he was taken to a hospital, where an X-ray revealed a 
fracture at the knuckle joint of the left middle finger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins listed Matt Turk as questionable for Sunday's game,  
meaning there's a 50-50 chance he will play. The team will know 
more Thursday, after the surgery is complete and a splint is placed 
on the finger. The injury typically takes four weeks to heal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make sure over the next three days that he can handle  
the football,'' Turner said. ``We won't put him out there if 
there's any risk of a turnover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Turk has fumbled four snaps in the last 23 games, an  
extraordinarily high number for a punter and holder. His punting 
was outstanding until this season, when he began experimenting with 
a new style that has caused him to shank several kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has held before, at Florida State and for a short time  
with the Minnesota Vikings. He said the new duty would not 
interfere with his quarterback job. 
</P>
<P>
	``The distraction for me is having to stay after practice,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Almond Growers Want China WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California almond growers, beset by a glutted  
market and dwindling prices, are hoping a new round of talks on 
China's entry into the World Trade Organization will turn the 
world's most populous nation into a big customer. 
</P>
<P>
	Almond producers will be watching anxiously when U.S.  
negotiators travel to Beijing later this month to resume talks on 
terms of China's entry into the 134-member body, which sets the 
rules for international trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``China seems like a good bet, although difficult,'' said Joe  
MacIlvaine, chairman of the Almond Board of California. ``Over the 
long term, it's got to be a good market for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California's 6,000 almond growers produce all of America's crop  
-- nearly 500 million pounds last year -- and 80 percent of the 
world's supply. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. farmers unwittingly put themselves in a bind during the  
early 1990s, when prices and demand for the sweet, tasty nuts were 
on the rise. Between 1992 and 1996 farmers planted thousands of new 
acres 
</P>
<P>
	Supply exceeded demand, and prices paid to farmers fell from  
$2.48 per pound in 1995 to $1.55 this year. Pinched farmers hope to 
make China the centerpiece of a campaign to expand markets in 
Asia's developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy percent of the U.S. crop already is sold overseas,  
making almonds America's No. 7 food export. The biggest overseas 
customers include Germany, which bought 99 million pounds last 
year, Spain and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales to China are hampered by a 30 percent tariff and a 17  
percent value added tax that China levies on almonds. Growers 
believe lower tariffs -- a goal of U.S. trade representatives -- 
would allow them to triple sales in China to nearly $150 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In looking to China, U.S. farmers join a long list of  
entrepreneurs trying to crack China's difficult marketplace. Few 
have succeeded. Obstacles range from the barriers of language and 
culture to China's complex bureaucracy and cumbersome legal system. 
</P>
<P>
	MacIlvaine believes, though, that almond growers might have an  
easier time than others seeking access to China markets. Almonds 
aren't grown in China, so there's no local industry to protect. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks between U.S. and Chinese negotiators were set back earlier  
this year after U.S. warplanes bombed the Chinese embassy in 
Yugoslavia. Negotiations also have been damaged by U.S. allegations 
that China stole details of advanced American nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts expect China eventually to enter the WTO. But even  
then, prospects for American companies will hinge on a number of 
factors, including the overall state of China's economy and 
relations with the United States.

<HEADLINE> Florida County Vote Favors Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- County commissioners voted against requiring cable  
companies that provide high-speed Internet connections to share 
their lines with competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest in a series of local votes on the matter, the  
Miami-Dade County decision is a boost for AT&AMP;T and other cable 
companies who argue that they should not be forced to make their 
equipment available to rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said Tuesday's vote would hasten the spread of  
high-speed Internet service -- also known as ``broadband'' -- in 
Miami-Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said it would mean consumers would have less  
ability to choose how they reach the Internet and that Internet 
service providers not partnered with a cable company could be 
forced out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials have declined to step into the fray. They fear  
that regulating the industry could discourage companies from making 
investments to bring these services to consumers quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over 1 million consumers in North America subscribe to  
high-speed cable service, compared with 40 million residential 
Internet subscribers total, according to the Federal Communications 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials have pointed to these numbers in saying that it is  
too soon to step in and regulate -- but the agency also does not 
want municipalities coming up with their own rules.

<HEADLINE> 'Happy Days' Star on Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Happy Days'' actress Roz Kelly was placed  
on probation for firing a shotgun at a neighbor's home because she 
was angry about his car alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing results of a 90-day psychiatric exam, Superior  
Court Judge Darlene Schempp on Wednesday suspended a three-year 
prison term and placed Ms. Kelly on three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kelly, 57, who played Fonzie's biker girlfriend Pinky  
Tuscadero on ``Happy Days,'' pleaded no contest to the charge in 
July. She had earlier pleaded innocent to firearms charges related 
to the November shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a plea bargain, the prosecution dropped charges that  
she also fired shotgun blasts into two parked cars, one of them 
with the offending alarm system. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say she fired into two cars and then smashed the  
window of a neighbor's home and fired a shotgun into the living 
room. The neighbor was not home at the time.

<HEADLINE> Gambling Opponents Eye S.C. Lottery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Gambling is on a losing streak in the  
Bible Belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Alabama voters heeded their ministers and rejected  
the governor's plan for a state lottery, and South Carolina's 
highest court signed what may be a death warrant for that state's 
$2.8-billion-a-year video gambling industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the ministers and other gambling opponents from those two  
battles are well-mobilized for their next target: a proposed 
lottery in South Carolina. A lottery referendum is set for November 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Churches have ``tasted blood,'' said Jim Guth, a Furman  
University political science professor who studies religious 
involvement in politics. ``They see they were having impact. They 
see they were influencing people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hodges has already has hit the phones to raise money  
for the pro-lottery forces. ``We're gearing up for a really tough 
campaign,'' said Kevin Geddings, a former Hodges aide who now leads 
the lottery fight. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, gambling is still well-entrenched across South.  
Alabama still has dog tracks and high-stakes bingo. Florida, 
Louisiana, Virginia, Texas and Kentucky have lotteries. Several 
states also have racetracks. Casino boats sail from South Carolina 
and Florida, and there are casinos in Mississippi and Louisiana. In 
fact, a huge new Harrah's casino is opening next week just outside 
New Orleans' French Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But a backlash has taken shape in some places. Gambling  
opponents say as gambling spreads, more cities and towns see a toll 
in life savings lost and families destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``As people see it in their own communities, it raises  
questions,'' said Robert Goodman, executive director of the United 
States Gambling Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina, for example, has been wrestling for years with  
video gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Video gambling became legal here in 1986 and has since become a  
booming industry with 30,000 machines. Opposition grew as garish 
game rooms in convenience stores and corner bars became common, and 
soared after a 10-day-old baby died in a sweltering car while her 
mother gambled. Former Gov. David Beasley pronounced it ``the crack 
cocaine of gambling,'' and churches and business groups said it 
sullied the state's image. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of video gambling were campaigning to get voters to  
ban the games in a Nov. 2 referendum. Last week, however, the state 
Supreme Court blocked the vote but upheld another part of the 
referendum law that said the machines must be unplugged on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	With the video gambling vote now off, churches and other  
potential lottery opponents are still energized and organized. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina Baptist Convention spokesman Scott Vaughan said  
he expects most of the same people who were against video gambling 
to oppose the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the 737,000-member South Carolina Baptist Convention is  
preparing an anti-lottery resolution for its Nov. 8 annual meeting. 
Vaughan said the church believes people should put their faith in 
God, not on games of chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama, Hodges is a first-term  
Democrat who has all but staked his career on a lottery to support 
schools and to stop people from crossing into Georgia to play the 
games there. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alabama, however, the lottery was considered a sure bet until  
ministers got involved. The lottery lost by 8 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Church groups have had other recent successes:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Tennessee's attempts to get a lottery this year fell 16 votes  
short in the state Senate after the Nashville-based Southern 
Baptist Convention led anti-gambling forces. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Video poker was tossed out of 33 Louisiana parishes in a 1996  
referendum with the help of church leaders. Republican Gov. Mike 
Foster, who worked to outlaw the games, faces a GOP challenger who 
claims Foster didn't do enough to roll back gambling.

<HEADLINE> Rescued Calif. Hunter Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- A man who fell 70 feet while hunting for  
deer was rescued after a five-day search and was recovering in a 
hospital Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Vasquez was reported missing after he went on a  
deer-hunting trip to the San Jacinto Mountains on Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	He fell about 70 feet from a ridge into a ravine while chasing a  
deer he had shot. He was unable to move after fracturing his hip 
and skull and was missing until searchers found him Friday in a 
rugged canyon 100 miles southeast of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Vasquez, 31, may need hip-replacement surgery. He  
was fair condition Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother-in-law, Nancy Christensen, said Vasquez was able to  
speak, but was ``coming in and out'' of consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Vasquez said that at times he was able to hear search  
helicopters as they passed over him. 
</P>
<P>
	He was wearing a camouflage hunting outfit, which was ripped but  
still provided enough protection to keep him warm during the cool 
nights. The coloring of his clothing, however, made it harder for 
searchers to see him, she said.

	The union hopes to use the strike threat as a bargaining chip to  
help it win pay raises similar to the three-year, 8 percent wage 
increase that West Coast dock workers received this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Local 142 leader Eusebio Lapenia said members would strike ``if  
need be'' but ``we're not suicidal.'' Leaders could call a strike 
anytime after the Oahu vote.

	Hawaiian residents are extremely dependent on the shipping  
industry. About 90 percent of all the island's goods, ranging from 
cars to cereal, come via ship.

	Talk of a strike has led many residents to hoard such items as  
rice, toilet paper and Spam from store shelves. Even warehouses 
like Costco and Sam's Club have run out of some items. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawaii Employers Council, which represents the four shipping  
companies, says it had hoped talks with resume sooner than 
Saturday. The two sides last met Friday.

	The ILWU terminated its contract Monday, following last week's  
decision by a federal judge to order workers to stop a work 
slowdown that violated provisions of the contract that expired June 
30, but that was extended by both sides.

<HEADLINE> Bells Meet Forecasts, Sprint Misses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Third-quarter profits met expectations at BellSouth and Bell  
Atlantic, driven again by the e-commerce explosion, but Sprint and 
its PCS mobile phone unit came up short with their latest results. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth, the local phone company in the Southeast, edged most  
Wall Street forecasts as revenues grew 9.5 percent. Bell Atlantic, 
the local phone company for much of the East Coast and a major cell 
phone player, posted a 5 percent gain in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's third-quarter profit shrank more than expected despite  
an 18 percent improvement in revenues for the three-month period, 
which ended just days before the company agreed to be acquired by 
MCI WorldCom for a record $115 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS posted a larger-than-expected loss amid continued  
heavy spending to expand its wireless network. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Bell Atlantic    	
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic earned $1.20 billion, or 76 cents a share in the  
third quarter, excluding continuing expenses for the merger with 
Nynex's operations. Those costs left Bell Atlantic with a net 
profit of $1.17 billion or 74 cents a share for the period. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, the New York-based company had an  
operating profit of $1.09 billion or 69 cents, excluding various 
one-time costs that resulted in a net loss of $8 million or 8 cents 
a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenues totaled $8.30 billion, rising from $7.91  
billion a year ago. Core telephone and Internet services revenue 
rose 2.9 percent to about $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results were right in line with what analysts were  
expecting, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial, 
but Bell Atlantic's stock retreated 12 1/2 cents a share to $63.81 1/4 in 
Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	More than the financial results, Bell Atlantic officials touted  
what an eventful quarter it was: specifically, a new wireless 
alliance with Vodafone AirTouch and a request to sell long distance 
in New York that's expected to gain federal approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a watershed quarter for Bell Atlantic,'' said Ivan  
Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive. He also noted the 
company's accelerated deployment of high-speed Internet services 
and progress toward the pending acquisition of GTE, a deal expected 
to close in the first quarter of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Bell Atlantic posted a net  
profit of $3.5 billion or $2.24 per share. That compares with $1.91 
billion or $1.21 a share a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose to $24.57 billion from $23.49 billion.  

</P>
<P>
                            *BellSouth    	
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth reported a third-quarter operating profit of $972  
million, or 51 cents a share. That excludes one-time investment 
gains of $118 million and a $75 million loss related from currency 
fluctuations that gave the company a net profit of $1.02 billion or 
53 cents for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, Atlanta-based BellSouth earned  
$814 million, or 41 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenues grew 9.5 percent to $6.42 billion, up  
from $5.87 billion a year earlier. Revenues from data, Internet and 
other digital services rose 31 percent to $698 million. Domestic 
wireless revenues grew 16.1 percent to $815 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expected a per-share operating profit of 50 cents for  
the just-ended quarter, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. The company's stock rose 93 3/4 cents a share to $43.56 1/4 in 
Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the first nine months of 1999 totaled $2.61  
billion or $1.36 per share, up from $2.52 billion or $1.27 per 
share in the same period last year. Those figures include the 
one-time impact of investment gains and currency losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues were $18.54 billion, up from $16.96 billion  
a year earlier. 

</P>
<P>
                              *Sprint    	
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's FON Group, which includes traditional calling services  
and the newer Sprint ION data unit, reported a third-quarter profit 
of $359 million, or 41 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 1 cent shy of forecasts, according to First  
Call/Thomson Finanacial, and 13 percent below the net profit of 
$415 million or 47 cents a share from the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the just-ended quarter totaled $4.34 billion, up 7  
percent from $4.04 billion in last year's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Sprint FON Group earned  
$1.51 billion or $1.33 per share, compared to $1.13 billion, or 
$1.31 per share in the same period a year earlier. Nine-month 
revenues improved to $12.76 billion from $11.88 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS, the mobile calling operation that became a separate  
unit late last year, lost $615 million or $1.31 per share in the 
third quarter, including spending of $608 million to expand the 
wireless network. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was wider than the $1.23 a share expected by most  
analysts and larger than 1998's third-quarter loss of $176 million 
or $1.04 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The wireless unit's third-quarter revenues totaled $844 million,  
up from $320 million a year ago -- before Sprint PCS bought back 
ownership interests held by Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. 
and Cox Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The company didn't provide an early update on the new Wireless  
Web, a new service providing limited Internet access that was 
launched during the final month of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS' nine-month loss totaled $1.79 billion, or $3.92 per  
share. That compares with $474 million, or $2.99 cents per share, 
in the same period of 1998. Nine-month revenues increased to $2.18 
billion from $788 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the disappointing results, shares of both Sprint units  
rose in Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange: Sprint 
FON rose $1.12 1/2 to $64.93 3/4 and Sprint PCS rose 50 cents a share to 
$74.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Education Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children could not be put in federally funded  
bilingual education programs without their parents' consent under a 
measure that won House approval Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the parental consent provision and other  
changes to bilingual education programs in an amendment to a larger 
education bill the House debated Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional critics say bilingual education programs often  
keep students from learning English and contribute to high drop out 
rates among Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of having children speak more than one language is a  
noble goal ... but somewhere along the way bilingual education is 
miserably failing some of these students, predominantly the 
Hispanic students,'' said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., the main 
backer of the parental consent provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Bilingual education programs often teach students academic  
subjects in their native language, such as Spanish, while gradually 
teaching English. Salmon said 3.5 million children in the United 
States are considered to have limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Salmon's proposal, parents of students with limited  
English would be given information about bilingual education 
programs and would have to agree before their children are 
permanently enrolled in bilingual education. Parents also could 
have their children removed from bilingual programs and placed in 
English-speaking classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Students would continue to take bilingual classes if their  
parents cannot be contacted or do not respond to attempts to get 
their consent. 
</P>
<P>
	That provision was meant to head off criticism that the consent  
requirement could leave some students languishing without any 
instruction at all.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Scraps Bank Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Buckling to strong objections,  
Malaysia's central bank on Wednesday scrapped an ambitious 
blueprint to merge all of the country's financial institutions into 
six banking groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, banks will be allowed to choose their own partners in  
mergers to be completed by December 2000, the central bank, Bank 
Negara, announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All banking institutions ... will now be given the flexibility  
to form their own merger groups and to choose their own leader in 
each group to lead the merger process,'' central bank governor Ali 
Abul Hassan Sulaiman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reversal came just a week after Prime Minister Mahathir  
Mohamad acknowledged that many banks had lodged protests against 
the government's plan to reduce the nation's 58 financial 
institutions to six large groups by April 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the mergers are necessary to make the industry  
strong enough to compete with big foreign banks before the sector 
is liberalized in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia's biggest bank employees union has warned that mergers  
could eliminate some 15,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest statement, the central bank did not say how many  
groups it expected to be former in the merger process. But it 
stressed that the new guidelines place the onus on shareholders to 
initiate and drive the process. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank also warned it will ``intervene directly'' to  
select partners for banks that do not merge voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	All 21 commercial banks, 25 finance companies and 12 merchant  
banks that signed preliminary agreements last month to merge into 
six groups can terminate those agreements with the approval of Bank 
Negara.

<HEADLINE> US Nuclear Arsenal Once Fought Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the years immediately after the United  
States attacked Japan with atomic bombs to end World War II, U.S. 
military leaders fought behind the scenes with their civilian 
overseers for control of the small but growing arsenal of nuclear 
weapons, a once-secret Pentagon report says. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``suspicion and distrust on both sides,'' the bureaucratic  
battle reached crisis proportions in 1948, according to the 
Pentagon document, ``History of the Custody and Deployment of 
Nuclear Weapons,'' written in 1978 and released this year to a 
private researcher under the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say that the issue of civilian versus military control of  
atomic energy had been a burning, acrimonious issue for years would 
be an understatement of classic proportions,'' the Pentagon report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tensions gradually lessened, but the matter was not settled  
finally in the military's favor until 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the military managed the Manhattan Project that  
developed the first atomic bombs during World War II, civilians in 
the Truman administration deemed the military unfit to handle the 
new weapons. Norris Bradbury, a Navy physicist who organized the 
assembly of the bomb used in the Trinity bomb test in July 1945 and 
later headed the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory, had a low opinion 
of the military's ability to maintain the new weapons in good 
working order. 
</P>
<P>
	``He believed the weapons in the stockpile were too complicated  
for the military,'' the Pentagon report says. 
</P>
<P>
	The military argued it must have possession and control in order  
to be prepared to use the weapons on short notice. 
</P>
<P>
	In the summer of 1948, President Truman, citing the approaching  
elections, chose to let the tempest continue, according to the 
Pentagon history, which was classified top secret when written in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military leaders grew increasingly concerned about the  
custody dispute as world tensions increased with the Soviet 
blockade of Berlin in June 1948, although the Soviets did not yet 
have their own nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	In the spring of 1949, a few months before the first Soviet  
nuclear test, a resolution began to emerge, allowing the military 
initially to control nuclear weapon assemblies positioned at bases 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as now, the president retained final say over ordering the  
actual use of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Even today arguments persist over responsibility for U.S.  
nuclear weapons and the vast network of laboratories and other 
installations associated with them. The Energy Department has 
control over research, development, manufacturing and testing of 
nuclear weapons, but after reports of Chinese stealing U.S. nuclear 
laboratory secrets over the past two decades, some in Congress 
recently have called for the Pentagon to take those 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manhattan Project that built the first nuclear bombs was run  
by Army Gen. Leslie R. Groves. It gave up control of the program in 
late 1946 to the Atomic Energy Commission, a civilian agency whose 
first chairman was David Lilienthal. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next two years, Groves led the charge to win military  
custody of the weapons. Lilienthal was his chief antagonist. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House meeting in March 1948, one month after Groves  
retired, Truman cautioned the two sides that in view of troubling 
signs of communist aggressive intentions in Europe they had better 
find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert S. Norris, a military historian who is writing a  
biography of Groves, said the Army general was offended at the 
civilians' position. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was wounded by all of this,'' Norris said. ``From his point  
of view, `You gave me the responsibility of building the bomb 
during the war, and now you don't trust me with it?''' Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
	The military pressed Defense Secretary James Forrestal to get  
Truman on its side. Truman said no. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to Secretary Forrestal, the president had informed  
him that it might be possible to re-examine this issue at a later 
date, perhaps after the fall elections,'' the Pentagon history 
says. In the months leading up to the November election Truman said 
custody should remain with civilian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, however, agreements were reached on giving  
the military a limited custodial role, and as of June 1949 military 
personnel of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project were involved 
in inspection of weapons and their routine maintenance at storage 
sites in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950 Truman authorized the first transfer of nuclear weapon  
components -- minus their nuclear explosive capsules -- to storage 
sites in the United Kingdom, Guam and aboard the U.S. Navy aircraft 
carrier Coral Sea in the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The military wanted control at overseas bases not just for the  
nuclear bomb components but also the U.S.-based nuclear capsules 
under Atomic Energy Commission control that would have to be flown 
in during a crisis. President Eisenhower approved the first such 
transfer of nuclear capsules to military control abroad in June 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
	Not until 1967, however, did the Defense Department win full  
custody of all weapons in the nuclear arsenal.

<HEADLINE> Celtics' Forston May Miss 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Boston Celtics forward Danny Fortson has  
a stress fracture in his right foot and will miss 8-to-12 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics announced Fortson's injury in Charlotte during the  
first half of their exhibition against the Hornets on Tuesday 
night. The team said Fortson, hobbling on crutches before the game, 
would return to Boston on Wednesday for further tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big blow to us, but at least it's not his anterior  
cruciate ligament and it's early in the season,'' Celtics coach 
Rick Pitino said. ``Danny's a tough guy. We cannot hang our heads 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson, a third-year pro, was acquired in an offseason trade  
with Denver that sent former first-round draft choice Ron Mercer 
from Boston to the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7, 260-pound Fortson started Boston's exhibition  
opener last Wednesday and had eight points and 11 rebounds. He came 
off the bench two nights later against Atlanta, getting a game-high 
12 rebounds in 20 minutes.

<HEADLINE> South Pole Doctor Has Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Nearly five months after she found a lump in  
her breast, a doctor rescued from the South Pole confirmed that she 
has cancer and she will undergo treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerri Nielsen, 47, continued to shy away from international  
attention, saying she would not grant any interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The diagnosis of breast cancer has been confirmed and I will  
undergo treatment. My spirit is strong,'' Nielsen said Tuesday in 
her first public statement since returning to the United States on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be back with my family and friends in the United  
States,'' she said in the statement issued through the National 
Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, of the Youngstown, Ohio area, treated herself with  
chemotherapy until she was rescued Saturday from the Amundsen-Scott 
South Pole Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The only doctor among the 41 researchers at the station, Nielsen  
discovered a lump in her breast in June. She had medical supplies 
dropped to her a month later during a daring mercy mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplies allowed her to perform her own biopsy and begin  
self-treatment with chemotherapy. She e-mailed photographs of slide 
samples of the tumor to doctors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her illness, Nielsen kept busy with her duties up until  
she left the South Pole, said her sister-in-law, Diana Cahill. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's rescue from the coldest place on Earth was possible  
only after the Antarctic winter relented slightly, making it warm 
enough -- 58 degrees below zero -- to risk the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the rescue operation was possibly the earliest  
ever post-winter flight to the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	In her statement, Nielsen thanked those who rescued her and  
helped with her treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heartfelt thanks go out to my South Pole friends,  
colleagues and the general public for their encouragement and best 
wishes during my ordeal,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Rob Nelson Becomes TV Host </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A few years ago, Rob Nelson went on television  
to get people involved in his grassroots effort to cut the deficit 
and reform politics. Back then, he was a talk-show guest. Now he's 
a talk-show host. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``The Full Nelson,'' which airs on cable's Fox News Channel  
at 11 p.m. EDT on Saturdays, he's still trying to get people 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that TV is a really powerful medium,'' Nelson says,  
``and I think that there's very little on it right now in the vein 
of what I'm trying to do, that engages people who I can relate 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson and his bosses at the Fox News Channel want ``The Full  
Nelson'' to ignite the interest of young Americans in social issues 
-- and draw the 25- to 45-year-old viewing market to a forum for 
which they previously have had little use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a whole audience out there for news that  
probably doesn't even watch television that I think might watch 
Rob,'' said Fox News head Roger Ailes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ailes calls Nelson, 35, the poster boy for a generation that's  
increasingly disaffected by the two-party system. Nelson, at heart, 
is ``a libertarian who challenges everybody's politics,'' Ailes 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Few talk shows resemble ``The Full Nelson,'' which spends an  
hour trading opinions between half a dozen guests and a studio 
audience on a single issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the show debuted in August, Nelson has asked guests and  
viewers to talk about overcrowded prisons, the relevance of 
marriage, the legalization of prostitution and whether free speech 
really exists in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Were they on ``Hardball'' or ``Jerry Springer,'' Nelson's guests  
might well come to blows. A man protesting as draconian his 12-year 
prison sentence for a first drug offense was pitted against the 
father of a murder victim who said his son's killers went free. On 
another show, a rabbi told two homosexuals that their marriage was 
a sin. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nelson races around his glittery set cutting people off,  
reframing questions, trying to keep the discussion enlightened. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I think it's a little like Phil Donahue,'' he says.  
``That's what he did originally with the daytime audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Nelson, despite his political background, inexhaustible  
debating skills and unconventional opinions on topics like 
vigilantism -- he thinks there's a place for it -- largely keeps his 
opinions out of the mix. 
</P>

	Nelson got seriously involved in politics in 1992, shortly after  
he almost died falling off a cliff in the Adirondacks. An ax he had 
taken for ice-climbing split his helmet after the 25-foot fall. But 
he escaped with a broken leg, a concussion and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I had a second chance.''  
</P>
<P>
	He told himself: ``You know what? Life is short. Do what you  
believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who had been fund-raising for progressive interest  
groups in Washington, shifted gears to all-out activism, founding a 
group called Lead or Leave with Jon Cowan and pledging to recruit 
citizens to make politicians more accountable. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead or Leave was joined by thousands and persuaded 100 members  
of Congress to cut the deficit or quit. They cut the deficit, and 
Nelson said he proved that people could make a difference by 
getting involved in citizen-based movements. 
</P>
<P>
	But the group disbanded in 1995, a year after Republicans took  
over Congress and claimed key governorships. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody after the '94 elections wanted to support a nonpartisan  
group,'' Nelson says. 
</P>
<P>
	A Stanford Law School graduate, he's written a book, ``Last  
Call,'' scheduled for publication later this year, telling of his 
Christian Scientist upbringing in Wisconsin and laying out 10 goals 
for a changed political system. One proposal: holding another 
constitutional convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson wants to return to politics one day as the creator of a  
``viable'' third party, but denies that his television show is 
about his politics or garnering support for such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still an activist at heart. I don't have an agenda I want  
to push out on TV,'' he insisted. ``I simply want to provoke people 
to think and get engaged.''

<HEADLINE> Women Reporters Win Courage Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The director of an independent broadcast station  
destroyed in Kosovo, an Afghan reporter beaten for writing about 
abuses against women, and a Canadian journalist facing death 
threats received Courage in Journalism awards on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Women's Media Foundation honored Aferdita  
Kelmendi of Kosovo, Sharifa Akhlas of Afghanistan and Kim Bolan of 
Canada at its 10th annual awards luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Peterman, who started her journalistic career in 1965  
writing for the St. Petersburg Times' ``Negro News Page'' and 
fought racism and sexism in the newsroom during a 31-year career, 
received the foundation's Lifetime Achievement Award and a standing 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	All four winners receive $2,000 and a crystal eagle sculpture,  
symbolizing freedom and courage. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelmendi she never expected to confront the human suffering and  
death that she witnessed in Kosovo during the Serb crackdown 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolan, a reporter for The Vancouver Sun in British Columbia, has  
been receiving death threats for two years because her articles on 
the 1985 bombing of an Air-India jumbo jet connected Vancouver-area 
Sikh fundamentalists with the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Akhlas watched the status of Afghanistan's women deteriorate  
with the takeover of the Taliban, a Muslim fundamentalist-led army. 
Despite a ban on women working outside the home, Akhlas managed to 
file reports. In 1998, she was arrested and beaten by the Taliban 
for violating the restrictions. Shortly afterwards she fled to 
Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Open Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early  
Thursday after gains in U.S. stocks. Tokyo share prices were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 106.44 yen, up 0.08 yen from late Wednesday in  
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 106.50 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 52.06 points,  
or 0.30 percent, to 17,482.65 in the first hour of trading. On 
Wednesday, the average closed up 280.54 points, or 1.63 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar largely maintained its strength  
from New York trading after the buoyant session Wednesday on Wall 
Street, though bad news from a major U.S. high-technology company 
was hurting the greenback somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 187.43 points, or 1.8  
percent, to close Wednesday at 10,392.36. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tokyo traders said the dollar moved slightly below its late  
New York level after International Business Machines Corp. released 
flat first quarter profit projections. 
</P>
<P>
	``IBM's worse-than-expected figure weighed on the dollar,'' said  
Kazuki Fujita, a senior foreign exchange analyst at the Industrial 
Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders have said IBM faces especially heavy scrutiny this  
quarter. The company said Tuesday it will pull its money-losing 
line of PCs from retail stores in the United States and sell them 
exclusively over the Internet to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 114.48 yen, down  
from 114.83 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, investors in Tokyo were cautious following  
surprise falls in blue-chip technology issues such as IBM and 
America Online Inc. in after-hours trading on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big fall (in) IBM and AOL's stock price is undermining  
investor confidence in the U.S. stock market's recent rally,'' said 
Masatoshi Sato, an equities manager at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 1.77 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,509.08 
points. The TOPIX closed up 35.51 points, or 2.4 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.8500 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8450 percent. Its 
price fell 0.04 points to 98.71.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Playoff Ratings Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major markets, competitive games and incredible  
drama helped NBC and Fox post the highest combined baseball league 
championship series ratings in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks had a 10.3 rating and a 19 share, up 21 percent  
from last year's 8.5-17. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the championship series' drew a 11.8-23.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they aren't going to watch now, they're never going to  
watch,'' Fox announcer Joe Buck said. ``There was a reason for 
people to watch with all these great games and I'm glad they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's six-game average for Atlanta's victory over the New York  
Mets was a 11.3-21, an increase of 20 percent from the network's 
American League Championship Series last season. It was also up 49 
percent from Fox's NLCS in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The dramatic clinching victory for the Braves on Tuesday night  
in which Mets pitcher Kenny Rogers walked in the winning run, 
grabbed a 15.4-27, the highest national mark for a NLCS game since 
Game 6 in 1993 between the Braves and Philadelphia Phillies. That 
game earned a 17.4-28. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox posted its highest rating for a league championship series  
since televising baseball in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-game series between the New York Yankees and Boston Red  
Sox averaged a 9.2 rating and 16 share, up 21 percent from Fox's 
San Diego Padres-Atlanta Braves NLCS last season. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also 5 percent higher than NBC's coverage of the first  
five games of the ALCS in 1998 between the Yankees and Cleveland 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Although both networks received desirable matchups, NBC lucked  
out with more drama in the series in which the Mets nearly fought 
back to force a Game 7 after losing the first three games to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox had its share of obstacles.  
</P>
<P>
	Fox's Game 3 overhyped dream pitching matchup between Roger  
Clemens and Pedro Martinez Saturday ended up 13-1 in favor of 
Boston and had a 7.5 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets-Braves Game 4 on Sunday, a five-hour plus 15-inning  
game that started in the afternoon, overlapped with the Yankees 
game in prime time. Fox still managed a 7.4 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Yankees Game 5 clincher over Boston Monday night had to  
go up against ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' game between the New 
York Giants and Dallas Cowboys, but still drew a 9.6-16. ``MNF'' 
had a 12.1. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a roundabout way, the odds were against us because of  
scheduling and the blowout that all of the country was looking 
forward to,'' Buck said. ``It's nice to finally be on the upside of 
the ratings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A network ratings point represents 994,000 households.  
</P>
<P>
	Baseball is in the fourth year of a $1.7 billion, five-year  
television deal with Fox, NBC and ESPN.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Worldwide visitors swamped Encyclopaedia  
Britannica's Web site on the first day the reference was made 
available for free, leaving the site still blocked today for most 
users. 
</P>
<P>
	The retooled site, www.britannica.com, received millions of hits  
Tuesday after the Chicago-based publisher said it was putting all 
32 volumes and 44 million words on the Internet, gratis. The site 
also includes daily news and links to related sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a victim of our own success,'' said Jorge Cauz, senior  
vice president for sales and marketing of Britannica.com Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	After the initial rush tied up the site, it functioned normally  
overnight but became clogged again early today as Americans woke up 
and sat down at their computers, Cauz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Extra staff and computer hardware were being deployed and the  
problem was expected to be cleared up by day's end, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All our infrastructure was designed to handle the initial  
launch, but this was beyond our own forecasts,'' Cauz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Britannica has seen sales of its printed sets decline an  
estimated 80 percent since peaking at about $650 million in 1990 as 
knowledge-seekers turn to computer versions, primarily Microsoft's 
Encarta. It is counting on advertising, sponsorship and e-commerce 
to make the risky move pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	The encyclopedia set was first published in 1768 in Scotland. It  
was introduced in the United States in 1888 and has been based in 
Chicago for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It is still available in the printed version, at $1,250 per set,  
as well as on CD-ROM.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Debt Agreement Said Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's ailing Daewoo group is  
close to agreement with its foreign creditors to reschedule debt 
repayments, the chief of the government's financial watchdog agency 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides appear to have reached a tentative agreement, but  
a formal deal isn't expected until after a meeting of the foreign 
creditors next week in Tokyo, said Financial Supervisory Commission 
Chairman Lee Hun-jai. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo narrowly escaped becoming the nation's largest bankruptcy  
when its domestic creditors agreed in June to delay repayment of 
$8.3 billion in short-term debt for six months and extend $3.3 
billion in new loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Daewoo bowed to pressure from its domestic  
creditors and agreed to sell all but six automobile-related units 
by the end of this year to repay $52 billion in debts. It has $65 
billion in total assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo's debts to overseas creditors are estimated at $5  
billion. Local newspapers, quoting unidentified sources, said 
foreign creditors were expected to allow Daewoo to delay repayment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee also said General Motors Corp. has expressed strong interest  
in taking over Daewoo Motor Co., but declined to elaborate. GM and 
Daewoo have been in talks on forming a strategic alliance since 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo Motor, South Korea's second largest automaker, produced  
900,000 vehicles last year. At the end of last year, it had $13.3 
billion in total assets and $9.8 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo's major foreign creditors include Chase Manhattan Corp.  
and Citibank of the United States, HSBC Holdings PLC of the 
Britain, ABN Amro Bank of the Netherlands, National Australia Bank 
Ltd., Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. of 
Japan and Arab Bank of Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Nike Taking Shoe Orders Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike said Wednesday it would take orders  
for customized shoes online and deliver them directly to homes, 
bypassing retailers in an industry that has been slower than others 
to embrace the Internet to move its merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good challenge and stimulus for the footwear  
industry,'' said Vada Manager, Nike spokesman. ``The athletic goods 
industry has been a little slow to react to the whole Internet 
revolution, frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only two shoe models will be offered, the Air Turbulence and the  
Air Famished, selling for about $85. But customers can order 
specific colors and features to be delivered within two weeks, and 
Nike will pay the air freight charges for the time being, Manager 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, the Beaverton-based manufacturer of athletic  
shoes and clothing established a retail Web site, Nike.com, but it 
has been used mostly as a showcase for products already carried at 
more than 10,000 retail outlets listed at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Nike announced it had purchased a stake in Fogdog, a  
tiny Internet retailer in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and retailers said they saw the latest announcement as  
an outgrowth of increasing consumer demand for Internet shopping 
rather than competition with stores. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, many stores have beaten Nike to the Net, they said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our Web sales have increased sixfold in the last eight to nine  
months,'' said Juris Pagrabs, vice president of investor relations 
at Venator, the parent of the Foot Locker shoe store chain.

<HEADLINE> Former Irish Prime Minister Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Jack Lynch,  
best-known for his unfulfilled promise not to ``stand by'' as 
violence wracked Northern Ireland next door, died today. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch, whose health deteriorated after he suffered a stroke  
several years ago, died in a Dublin hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Cork in Ireland's southwest, Lynch served as prime  
minister from 1966 to 1973 and again in 1977, when his Fianna Fail 
party won its biggest majority ever in Dublin's parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lavish overspending in his 1978 budget produced soaring  
deficits and inflation, kept taxes high and fueled an immediate 
voter backlash. He resigned in December of that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch is best remembered for his rhetorical intervention in  
August 1969 as violence spilled onto the streets of British-ruled 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	As Protestant police battled Catholic rioters in Londonderry for  
three days straight, Lynch declared that ``the Irish government can 
no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps 
worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch moved some army units to the border to open field  
hospitals for refugee rioters who didn't want to be treated -- and, 
most likely, arrested -- in Northern Ireland hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the north's Catholic militants waited in vain for the tiny  
Irish army to come to their rescue. Instead, Protestant hooligans 
torched scores of Catholic homes in Belfast, and the British army 
was deployed in both Belfast and Londonderry as would-be 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	After his second victory in 1977, Lynch demonstrated a growing  
realism towards the ``northern question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though continually arguing that the path to peace lay in a  
British government pledge to withdraw from Northern Ireland, Lynch 
stressed that the British should first ``indicate in a general way 
they'd like to see the Irish people coming together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the (Protestant) people of the north could be  
realistic enough and hardheaded enough to know that there should be 
accommodation found between the (north's Catholic) minority and 
themselves in the first instance, and between them and us in the 
long run,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland's current prime minister, Bertie Ahern, paid tribute to  
Lynch today, saying his ``firm leadership saw the nation through a 
period of great political tension in the late 1960s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``During the turbulence of the civil rights movement, the  
troubles breaking out and all the problems in Belfast, he had to 
display an enormous sense of control and discipline,'' Ahern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish President Mary McAleese, speaking during a state visit to  
the Czech Republic, said that in his concern for a peaceful, 
political settlement for the entire island of Ireland, Lynch 
``charted a course which led to the important political progress of 
recent years. That will be his great legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch is survived by his wife, Mairin.  
</P>
<P>
	A full state funeral was planned for this weekend in Cork.  
Officials have not released details.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Teens Fear Violent Rampages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Half the teen-agers in a poll out today believe  
a murderous rampage like the killings at Columbine High School 
could happen in their school. 
</P>
<P>
	However, 45 percent in The New York Times-CBS News Poll believe  
increased security made their school safe. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nationwide telephone poll of 1,038 13- to 17-year-olds,  
52 percent said they feared a Columbine-style attack could strike 
their school, despite added security guards, cameras and other 
safety measures taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the poll also found that the measures made the teen-agers  
feel safer. Overall, 45 percent believed their school was safe or 
extremely safe and 42 percent characterized it as somewhat safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that kids are in denial,'' James Alan Fox, a criminal  
justice professor at Northeastern University, told the Times. ``I 
think they probably have a better perspective than many parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last couple of years there have been about four dozen  
school shootings each year,'' Fox said. ``But there are 50 million 
schoolchildren, so the chances are literally one in a million'' 
that violence will occur. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of teen-agers who feared becoming victims of crime  
either at school or on the street dropped to 24 percent from 40 
percent since 1994, according to the poll. There was no statistical 
difference between teen-agers in big cities or rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, which looks at how teen-agers live, also found that 46  
percent of those questioned said they know someone their age who 
tried to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said the poll did not ask detailed questions but  
demographics showed that many more girls (56 percent) than boys (37 
percent) knew friends who attempted suicide. Figures were also 
higher among white teen-agers than blacks or Hispanics. Of those 
who knew someone who attempted suicide, 50 percent were white, 39 
percent were Hispanic and 28 percent were black. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, author of ``Night Falls Fast:  
Understanding Suicide,'' told the newspaper that the poll figures 
jibe with federal figures showing that 1 in 5 high school students 
had considered suicide the previous year and 1 in 10 had attempted 
it. She called the statistics ``absolutely terrifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was conducted Oct. 11 to Oct. 14 and had a margin of  
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Dallas Bower, a pioneer television producer who  
also worked in early radio and cinema, died Monday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Bower began sound recording in radio when broadcasting was a  
novelty. He moved to cinema and then to television where he become 
the first producer of drama and opera for the British Broadcasting 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	He also directed feature films and documentaries and was  
associate producer of Laurence Olivier's 1944 film ``Henry V''. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Bower's first jobs was to record the soundtrack for  
Alfred Hitchcock's 1929 film ``Blackmail'' for British 
International Pictures. That year he also recorded the first 
all-talking British film, ``Under the Greenwood Tree.'' 
</P>

	DENVER (AP) -- Edward Charles Day, a one-time sports writer who  
became a voice for open courts as chief justice of the Colorado 
Supreme Court, died Sunday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Day worked as a sportswriter for the Denver Rocky Mountain News  
and later as an associate editor for the Denver Register. He 
practiced law from 1934 to 1947, when he became a municipal court 
judge in Denver. 
</P>

	BAY CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Thomas Durden, who wrote the lyrics to  
Elvis Presley's hit ``Heartbreak Hotel,'' died Sunday at his home 
in Houghton Lake, Mich. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Durden co-wrote ``Heartbreak Hotel'' with Mae Boren Axton of  
Nashville, Tenn., and for reasons never explained, Presley also was 
given writing credit. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, Durden was performing with a band in Jacksonville,  
Fla., when he came across a newspaper account of a man who had 
committed suicide. The man left a note that said, ``I walk a lonely 
street,'' and Durden said he used that as the basis for 
``Heartbreak Hotel.''

became owner of the Washington Senators, now the Minnesota Twins, 
died Wednesday in Melbourne, Fla. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith had developed a kidney infection and a high fever after  
having a pacemaker put in last month, his daughter-in-law Sima 
Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith was a bat boy in 1924-25 for the Washington Senators.  
He worked in every capacity in the minor and major leagues before 
taking control of the Senators from his uncle and adoptive father, 
Clark Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1960 season, he moved the Senators to Minnesota. The  
Twins, with such stars as Harmon Killebrew, Bob Allison and Rod

	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Jack Lynch, the former Irish prime  
minister best known for his unfulfilled promise not to ``stand by'' 
as violence wracked Northern Ireland, died Wednesday at a Dublin 
hospital. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch served as prime minister from 1966 to 1973 and again in  
1977, when his Fianna Fail party won its biggest majority ever in 
Dublin's parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969 when violence spilled into the streets of British-ruled  
Northern Ireland, Lynch moved some army units to the border to open 
field hospitals for refugee rioters. But the Catholic militants 
waited in vain for the tiny Irish army to come to their rescue. 
Instead, scores of homes were torched in Belfast and the British 
army was deployed as peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Overspending in Lynch's 1978 budget produced soaring deficits  
and inflation and fueled a voter backlash. He resigned later that 
year.

develop France's ``new novel'' movement, died at her Paris home 
Tuesday. She was 99.

movements. It was a distinctive style that helped pave the way for 
the ``new novel'' movement in post-World War II France. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarraute turned out her first book, ``Tropismes,'' in 1939 and  
wrote more than 20 works, from novels to plays. 
</P>
<P>
	She had said that it was in her third novel, ``L'ere du  
Soupcon'' (Era of Suspicion), published in 1956, that a new form of 
writing began to emerge that reached for the ``interior drama'' of 
people's lives.

nature stories, some made for television and some former theatrical 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
	35 years ago: The Rolling Stones made their first appearance on  
``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' So many people complained that Sullivan 
said he would never invite them back. But they made another

</P>
<P>
	And Mel Gibson and Kim Basinger topped US magazine's list of

</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Mick Jagger led a crowd of 34,000 in a chorus of  
``Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo!'' from the song ``Brown Sugar'' at a 
Rolling Stones concert in Salt Lake City. The concert included a 
light show and fireworks. Jagger asked the crowd if they could 
recall the band's last visit -- a 1966 show at an amusement park 
north of Salt Lake City. ``I remember it like yesterday,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Walt Disney Co. apologized to Robin Williams for using his  
Genie voice to sell merchandise from the 1992 animated hit movie 
``Aladdin.'' Williams likened the apology to ``a country 
re-establishing diplomatic relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Madonna, Tina Turner, Demi Moore, Jamie Lee Curtis and  
Arnold Schwarzenegger were on Fitness magazine's list of ``25 
Fittest People of 1994.'' The winners, not ranked in any particular

</P>
<P>
	And director Robert Zemeckis, the Academy Award-winning director  
of ``Forrest Gump,'' gave $5 million to the University of Southern 
California for the creation of a cutting-edge digital arts studio.

for my career,'' Zemeckis said. 

</P>
<P>
	Spoken 10 years ago:  
</P>
<P>
	``I live a very quiet life. There's no television, no music

dresses and big hair.'' -- Singer Tina Turner. 

</P>
<P>
	Spoken one year ago:  
</P>
<P>
	``My Playboy days are over. Taking off your clothes and being

<HEADLINE> 11-Year-Old Faces Incest Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The 11-year-old Swiss-American boy walked  
into the courtroom with his hands in his pockets, a shy smile on a 
face framed by a neat polo collar. 
</P>
<P>
	His demeanor might have painted a picture of innocence. But a  
magistrate ruled there was probable cause to arraign him on a 
charge of aggravated incest. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, identified as Raoul, is accused of making inappropriate  
sexual contact with his 5-year-old sister. His full name is being 
withheld by The Associated Press because of his age and the nature 
of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	His case has grabbed headlines in Switzerland and placed the  
boy, who has dual citizenship, in the center of an international 
debate over when childhood play crosses the line and becomes a 
criminal act. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had charged the boy in juvenile court with incest,  
and a judge ruled Tuesday that the case can proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he did not speak at Tuesday's hearing, Raoul raised his  
hand as he was led out of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boy continues to want to say that he is not guilty,''  
defense attorney Arnold Wegher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raoul, who was released into foster care, faces a trial and up  
to two years in the juvenile justice system. Wegher said the boy 
will plead innocent at his arraignment scheduled for Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Raoul had been in a juvenile detention center since he was  
arrested at his family's home in Evergreen on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Raoul's parents have fled to Switzerland with the  
5-year-old girl and their two other daughters, ages 12 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Their lawyer, Vincent Todd, said the couple fled because they  
had been threatened by social service workers with losing custody 
of their children because of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement the parents said, ``The rule of law is currently  
suspended in Colorado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their cause has been taken up by the mass-circulation Swiss  
daily Blick, which has clamored for the boy's immediate release and 
gathered thousands of signatures in a petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years ago, a harmless play of `doctor' was considered  
quite normal. But today, the prosecutors label it a crime of 
violence,'' Blick said Monday in an editorial. ``Ten- and 
11-year-old children are imprisoned because prudish and unrealistic 
lawyers want it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation and subsequent arrest of Raoul was prompted by  
neighbor Laura Mehmert, who testified Tuesday that she saw the boy 
fondle his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Jarboe, an incest expert with an independent group that  
interviews alleged child victims for the state Human Services 
Department, testified that the girl said her brother touched and 
kissed her genitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas J. Acierno, a Jefferson County sheriff's investigator who  
interviewed Raoul, testified that the boy told him he was only 
trying to help his sister go to the bathroom and he did not kiss 
her genitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Raoul's supporters say the way the case has been handled has  
been a miscarriage of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel this was totally blown out of proportion,'' said  
Hanspeter Spuhler, president of the Denver-area Swiss-American 
Friendship Society. He was among a dozen Swiss-Americans who 
protested outside the courthouse and then attended the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Switzerland if something like this were to happen, someone  
would talk to the parents and say 'Let's sit down and discuss 
this,''' Spuhler said. ``But to make a federal case out of it, this 
is just unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Davidson, director of the American Bar Association's  
Center on Children and the Law, said people in Switzerland ``may 
regret the idea that an 11-year-old can be locked up, and some in 
the U.S. do, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Courts need to take cases of alleged juvenile sex offenders  
very seriously, because this is the time when we probably do the 
most good in terms of treatment intervention,'' Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday, the Swiss Department of Foreign  
Affairs said its main concern ``is that the court considers the 
principle of proportionality and the youth's age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel Sager, a Swiss Embassy spokesman in Colorado, said the  
boy was treated harshly by authorities. He was arrested late one 
night and kept in handcuffs and shackles for three at least three 
court appearances, Sager said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can only be happy that as of today, Raoul is not in the  
juvenile detention center,'' he said.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Worldwide visitors swamped Encyclopaedia  
Britannica's Web site on the first day the reference was made 
available for free, leaving the site still blocked today for most 
users. 
</P>
<P>
	The retooled site, www.britannica.com, received millions of hits  
Tuesday after the Chicago-based publisher said it was putting all 
32 volumes and 44 million words on the Internet, gratis. The site 
also includes daily news and links to related sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a victim of our own success,'' said Jorge Cauz, senior  
vice president for sales and marketing of Britannica.com Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	After the initial rush tied up the site, it functioned normally  
overnight but became clogged again early today as Americans woke up 
and sat down at their computers, Cauz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Extra staff and computer hardware were being deployed and the  
problem was expected to be cleared up by day's end, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All our infrastructure was designed to handle the initial  
launch, but this was beyond our own forecasts,'' Cauz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Britannica has seen sales of its printed sets decline an  
estimated 80 percent since peaking at about $650 million in 1990 as 
knowledge-seekers turn to computer versions, primarily Microsoft's 
Encarta. It is counting on advertising, sponsorship and e-commerce 
to make the risky move pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	The encyclopedia set was first published in 1768 in Scotland. It  
was introduced in the United States in 1888 and has been based in 
Chicago for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It is still available in the printed version, at $1,250 per set,  
as well as on CD-ROM.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana GOP Moves Up Caucus Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Louisiana Republicans have changed the date  
of next year's presidential caucuses to Jan. 15, more than a week 
before Iowa's traditionally first-in-the-nation caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Republican Chairman Mike Francis also promised to move  
the date again -- even to New Year's Day -- if Iowa reschedules its 
Jan. 24 caucuses to an earlier day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just keep hopping,'' Francis said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear whether major candidates will campaign in Louisiana  
and eliminate criticism that the caucuses could turn into another 
embarrassment for the state. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the only candidates that participated in Louisiana's  
caucuses were Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, conservative columnist Pat 
Buchanan and conservative commentator Alan Keyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan won, but other GOP hopefuls -- including former Senate  
Majority Leader Bob Dole and publishing heir Steve Forbes -- 
boycotted in deference to Iowa's traditional leadoff role. 
</P>
<P>
	The only candidates who have campaigned in Louisiana this year  
are Buchanan, Forbes and conservative Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa last week moved its caucuses to Jan. 24 after New Hampshire  
refused repeated appeals to reschedule its Feb. 1 presidential 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Republicans had voted to hold theirs on a Saturday at  
least one week before Iowa's. Louisiana does not have to seek 
national party approval to change the dates. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unlikely that Iowa will change the date of its caucuses  
again, said Iowa Republican Chairman Kayne Robinson. ``Everyone 
seems to be pretty comfortable where we are,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Court OKs Lump Tobacco Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A Florida appeals court reversed itself Wednesday  
and reopened the door to a ruinous, multibillion-dollar verdict 
against the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's 3rd District Court of Appeal said the jury in a big  
class-action case involving 500,000 sick Florida smokers can award 
punitive damages in a single lump sum instead of one smoker at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry lawyer Dan Webb warned the court that damages  
from the case could exceed $300 billion -- which ``would destroy any 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The stakes have suddenly become humongous,'' said Northeastern  
University law professor Richard Daynard, head of an anti-tobacco 
clearinghouse. ``The fate of the industry rests on this jury that 
has already found that the industry has behaved outrageously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daynard said a big award could bankrupt some tobacco companies  
because they would have to post a bond greater than the award 
itself while they appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, tobacco company stocks dropped in trading.  
Philip Morris was down $3.75, or 12 percent, at $27, R.J. Reynolds 
fell $3, or 11.6 percent, to $22.93 3/4, and Loews Corp., parent of 
Lorillard, was down $2.25, or 3.2 percent, to $67.75. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the jury found that the nation's five largest cigarette  
makers had produced a defective and deadly product. The same jury 
is to determine damages in the second phase of the trial, beginning 
Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the appeals court agreed with the industry that  
damages should be decided one smoker at a time. Investors rejoiced, 
figuring the tobacco industry could more easily defend itself 
against lots of small awards than against one big 
multibillion-dollar verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	But the same appeals court withdrew its decision and agreed to  
reconsider. On Wednesday, just hours after hearing arguments from 
both sides, the three-judge panel issued a unanimous, one-paragraph 
ruling without explaining its reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for both sides cannot discuss the case under a gag order  
imposed by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb told the appeals panel that a single award would cause an  
``enormous amount of irreparable harm to the industry.'' But 
Appeals Judge David L. Levy said the appeals court ``cannot 
micromanage what the trial judge does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Brown &AMP;  
Williamson Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, the Liggett Group and the 
industry's Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A and Tobacco 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, said  
the ruling probably increases the chance that the industry will try 
to settle the case out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only  
five times -- twice in Florida and once in New Jersey, Oregon and 
California. The Florida and New Jersey verdicts were overturned on 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The $206 billion national settlement reached with the tobacco  
industry in November bars states from suing to recoup the costs of 
treating sick smokers but doesn't stop lawsuits by individuals.

<HEADLINE> Blues' Courtnall Considering Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A second concussion in less than a year has St.  
Louis Blues left wing Geoff Courtnall contemplating retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a lot of thoughts the past few days,'' Courtnall said  
Tuesday night after watching the Blues' 7-1 victory over the 
Calgary Flames. ``I don't know why it's happening right now. Maybe 
somebody is sending me a signal, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courtnall, 37, missed 4 1/2 months with post-concussion syndrome  
last season, and he suffered a Grade 2 concussion Saturday night 
when Maple Leafs defenseman Bryan Berard elbowed him on the chin. 
He woke up Sunday with a headache that lingered into Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That day, Blues neurologist Dr. Ralph Dacey prescribed 10-15  
days of rest, and he'll be reevaluated after that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to wait two weeks and see if the symptoms go away  
and take it from there,'' Courtnall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Courtnall missed 58 games and suffered from  
exercise-induced headaches and nausea, as well as dizziness and 
some vision problems. Before this season he said he was completely 
recovered, but it didn't take long for a relapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt great and I felt like I was in great shape,'' Courtnall  
said. ``The first five games went well. I thought I was back to my 
old self.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL suspended Berard for two games without pay on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Saturday's blow, Courtnall was dazed on a punch  
to the face by Dallas' Brad Lukowich in a brief scuffle during an 
exhibition game on Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Management and teammates expressed concern for his future  
outside of hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disturbing. He feels a bit like he did last year, which  
is not good,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am worried about him,'' defenseman Marc Bergevin said. ``I  
can see his point, that it's hard to walk away, but this is not a 
leg or an arm. It's his head. He has 40 to 50 good years ahead of 
him. He doesn't want to wake up one morning and not be able to 
talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Post-concussion syndrome has ended the careers of a number of  
players in the past few seasons -- most recently, Jeff Beukeboom of 
the New York Rangers. Flames goalie Grant Fuhr, a teammate the 
previous four seasons, said Courtnall, ``should probably do what 
the doctors tell him to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in his shoes, so I'm not going to make that  
judgment,'' Fuhr said. ``Courts has played for 20 years. He's a big 
boy now, and he can make his own decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courtnall has 367 goals and 432 assists for 799 points in 1,048  
career games.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets 25 Years for Throwing Sons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DELAND, Fla. (AP) -- A man who threw his two young sons from a  
second-story window during a domestic dispute has received a 
25-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had sought a life sentence for Eugene Harris, 23,  
who was convicted in August of two counts of attempted first-degree 
murder and lesser child-abuse charges. His sentence was handed down 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys -- who were 23 months and 7 months old when the incident  
occurred -- were thrown during an early-morning argument on Jan. 13 
between Harris and the boys' mother at their home in Deland, about 
21 miles southwest of Daytona Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, who fell 15 feet onto the concrete sidewalk, have  
since recovered and now live elsewhere with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris testified that he had drank heavily that night, but  
didn't intend to kill the children when he dropped them.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Nears Deal on Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to extend a string of popular  
business and personal tax breaks is coming together in the Senate 
after lengthy negotiations in a key tax-writing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee today was scheduled to consider the  
bill, which would renew the popular research and development tax 
credit and other business breaks and protect millions of average 
taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a bill we think has bipartisan support,'' said Sen.  
William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee. ``I'm 
hopeful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the panel met behind closed doors Tuesday to hash  
over the $8.5 billion measure, which would renew the research and 
development credit, the welfare-to-work credit and other business 
breaks through Dec. 31, 2000. It also would exempt individual 
personal credits from counting toward the alternative minimum tax 
for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The key to the agreement was that the bill would use a variety  
of revenue offsets mainly affecting business instead of spending 
some of the non-Social Security budget surplus, which Democrats and 
President Clinton have opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had to pay for it,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of  
New York, ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee. ``We want this 
bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill contrasts with a $23.3 billion version pending  
in the House that would renew the business breaks for five years 
and make the individual alternative minimum tax fix permanent. That 
bill would spend some of the budget surplus in four of its five 
years, drawing a veto threat from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The research and development credit is the focus of an intense  
lobbying campaign from more than 650 companies and 87 trade 
associations represented by the R&AMP;D Credit Coalition, which sent 
letters to congressional leaders this week urging its renewal. The 
credit expired June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the House made a largely political statement by  
voting 419-0 against a $19.2 billion package of tax and fee 
increases proposed by Clinton to balance the fiscal 2000 budget, 
including sharply higher cigarette taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is to get this question settled once and for all, so  
there is no one who believes we will raise taxes,'' said House 
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats refused to support Clinton's revenue raisers presented  
as they were in a vacuum, saying they must be linked to spending 
goals such as improving education, putting more police on the beat 
or adding a prescription-drug benefit to Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a serious attempt to resolve the budget,'' said  
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. ``It's another 
gimmick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defeated tax package, brought to the floor by GOP freshmen  
Reps. Lee Terry of Nebraska and Jim DeMint of South Carolina, 
included a 55-cents-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes, a $1.5 
billion reinstatement of a corporate Superfund tax and user fees on 
meat, poultry and egg inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came a few hours before Republican congressional  
leaders were to meet with Clinton to begin talks toward solving 
sharp differences on how to pay for the 13 spending bills necessary 
to run the government. Republicans said the vote against Clinton's 
taxes-and-fees increases sends a message that the White House must 
hear if it wants more money. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have nothing to offer but more taxes and higher  
spending,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House GOP whip. 
``Tough decisions have to be made to control spending, not increase 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Prison Rape Described at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- A former prisoner sobbed uncontrollably  
as he described how he was raped by a cellmate and then laughed at 
by guards when he asked to be transferred to another cell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him he couldn't house me with that inmate,'' Eddie  
Dillard recalled telling one of the guards. ``He was an enemy and 
was known for raping inmates. But he was being persistent that I 
had to go in there. I knew he was going to rape me. I knew it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four guards are on trial for allegedly setting up the rapes at  
Corcoran State Prison to punish Dillard for kicking a guard at 
another prison. The guards, who are on paid leave, face up to nine 
years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard, a slightly built 28-year-old now attending junior  
college in Southern California, said he protested as soon as he was 
told he would be sharing a prison cell with Wayne Robertson, known 
as the ``Booty Bandit.'' He said his protests continued until he 
was ordered in the cell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I knew it, we were getting into it. We were tussling  
and he said he was going to rape me. I tried to fight him off but I 
couldn't. He raped me,'' he said, his voice cracking. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard also said guards asked whether he was gay, laughed at  
his pleas for help and later threatened to put him back in the cell 
if he complained about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge eventually called a recess because Dillard was crying  
so much that his voice was barely audible. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson has admitted to raping Dillard and testified earlier  
Tuesday that Dillard -- who was serving time for crack cocaine 
possession and assault -- was on a short list of proposed cellmates 
he gave to Sgt. Robert Decker, one of the guards on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard and Robertson -- both originally from the same Southern  
California street gang -- had tangled before at another prison, 
where Dillard learned of Robertson's reputation as a rapist. 
Dillard even named him on his official enemies list. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1993, when both arrived at Corcoran, Robertson testified that  
he wanted to put Dillard in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needs to learn how to do his time,'' Robertson recalled  
telling Decker when he presented the sergeant with his list of 
preferred roommates. ``Whatever I decide to do ... he needs to 
straighten up his act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard said Robertson, nearly twice his size, raped him twice  
over two days in March 1993. In between, he continued to protest 
and asked to be moved out of the cell, but nothing was done. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Wayne Ordus suggested that Dillard chose to be  
sodomized because he could have saved himself by refusing to return 
to the cell when he was let out to take a shower. That would have 
prompted a disciplinary process during which he might have aired 
his complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard testified that he couldn't count on prison regulations  
protecting him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they did,'' he said, ``I never would have been housed with  
him.''

<HEADLINE> Easing of Cuba Sanctions Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate will get a second chance at easing  
the Cuban trade embargo, the measure's chief supporter says. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate leaders will allow a vote next week on separate sanctions  
legislation that was dropped from the $69 billion agriculture 
spending bill, Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure overwhelmingly passed the Senate but met resistance  
from anti-Castro House members. It would further lift trade 
sanctions by requiring congressional OK for the president to use 
food, medicine or medical equipment in a trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do we need to eliminate foreign barriers to trade,  
but we need to end our own barriers,'' said Ashcroft, who will 
serve as a Senate delegate to the upcoming World Trade Organization 
talks in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	With world demand and farm prices at historic lows, commodity  
groups are pressuring Congress to open world markets by reducing 
trade restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's estimated that sanctions cost the U.S. economy more than  
$20 billion each year,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. ``If a 
nation can't purchase products from the United States, other 
nations are more than ready to fill the needs of those markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unilateral sanctions against countries considered terrorist  
nations -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Cuba and North Korea -- shut 
U.S. farmers out of markets worth an estimated $7.2 billion in 
1997, said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan. His GOP colleague, Kansas Sen. 
Sam Brownback, said the annual cost to U.S. producers is $1.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Food and medicine should not be used as a foreign policy  
weapon,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts argued that the free-market farm reforms he authored in  
1996, which increasingly are under fire with farm country mired in 
depression, will not work unless the United States gains ground in 
opening markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders earlier stripped the sanctions language,  
along with new dairy-pricing rules, from a House-Senate conference 
committee on the spending for operations of the Agriculture 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators stopped work on the bill after GOP leaders refused  
to let them consider the Cuba provision. The leadership then coaxed 
a majority of the panel's members to endorse the bill individually. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Rep. Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri said rice producers  
in her southeast Missouri district suffered from trade embargoes on 
Cuba in 1962, Iraq in 1989 and Iran in 1995 because those countries 
were top buyers of U.S. rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanctions ``only end up pinching us, hurting our producers and  
hurting our country,'' Emerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	If embargoes were lifted this year, the National Association of  
Wheat Growers projects, U.S. wheat growers could export $500 
million more of their crop.

<HEADLINE> Hargrove Interviews With Orioles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Former Cleveland Indians manager Mike Hargrove  
met with officials of the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday to discuss 
the team's managerial vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it went well. I came away very impressed with their  
commitment to winning, and I felt like I answered all their 
questions honestly and directly,'' Hargrove said Wednesday night in 
a telephone interview from his home in Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, who has also expressed interest in the Anaheim Angels'  
manager's job, met with Orioles officials for nearly three hours. 
Owner Peter Angelos was not present. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove guided the Indians to five straight AL Central titles,  
but was fired Oct. 15 after Cleveland squandered a 2-0 lead in its 
best-of-5 division series against the Boston Red Sox. The Indians 
reached the World Series in 1995 and 1997 under his direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove was dismissed after completing his eighth full season  
with Cleveland. His 721 victories make him the second-winningest 
manager in club history behind Lou Boudreau (728). 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old Hargrove would seemingly be a perfect fit in a  
Baltimore clubhouse filled with veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good fit for any baseball person. They strike  
me as an organization that is aggressive and wants to be a 
winner,'' he said. ``They have the nucleus for a very good 
ballclub. I'm keeping my options open, but I would not go to 
Baltimore to waste their time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove already knows what it's like to manage Albert Belle,  
who played for Hargrove in Cleveland, and he is quite familiar with 
the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland was 9-1 against Baltimore this season. The teams met  
in the playoffs in 1996 and 1997; the Indians lost a first-round 
series in 1996 before beating the Orioles to win the AL title the 
following season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles' managerial position opened when Angelos fired Ray  
Miller, who endured two straight losing seasons with one of the 
highest-paid teams in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite carrying a $78.5 million opening day payroll, the  
third-highest in baseball, Baltimore was 36-51 at the All-Star 
break this year and needed a 13-game winning streak in September to 
finish 78-84. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have also interviewed third base coach Sam Perlozzo  
and are believed to be considering Tom Trebelhorn, the Orioles' 
director of player development and former manager of the Brewers 
and Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Oriole Don Baylor, who got his managerial experience with  
the Colorado Rockies, is also a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, however, has the most impressive credentials of the  
bunch. What's more, he is extremely eager to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully this will all work out, because I am interested in  
this team and this situation,'' he said. ``I want to make sure that 
what I do is the best thing for me. And want to make sure that I am 
in position to play for the (championship) ring real soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove's eight seasons in Cleveland was an eternity when  
compared to the lifespan of Baltimore managers under Angelos. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller lasted two years after Angelos accepted Davey Johnson's  
forced resignation after the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos fired Johnny Oates after the 1994 season and hired  
former pitching coach Phil Regan, who lasted one year. Johnson then 
came in and stuck around for two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets rallied Wednesday  
following Wall Street's rise on economic data that eased fears of 
higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up  
280.54 points, or 1.6 percent, to 17,534.71. On Tuesday, the 
average closed down 21.16 points, or 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9 percent overnight as  
concerns over inflation were eased by the latest U.S. consumer 
price data, which lessened fears of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks surged on the gains of two local heavyweight  
shares that might bring in a one-time gain by selling a stake in a 
British telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index rose 364.43 points, or 3 percent, to close  
at 12,498.56. On Tuesday, the index had fallen 164.95 points, or 
1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong interest rates traditionally track U.S. rates because  
the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the  
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar was trading at 106.36 yen in the late afternoon  
in Tokyo, up 1.00 yen from its level of 105.36 yen late Tuesday in 
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 105.28 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares gave up most of their early gains after Muslim  
leader Abdurrahman Wahid was elected president in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The JSX Composite Index ended up 0.778 points, or 0.1 percent,  
at 584.425.

chips, closed at 736.36 points, down 1.92 points, or 0.3 percent, 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares rose as investors scooped up bargains  
after six sessions of declines. The 30-company Philippine Stock 
Exchange Index ended up 27.01 points, or 1.4 percent, at 2,017.62. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean shares ended sharply higher on Wall Street's  
gains and the fall in local interest rates. The Korea Composite 
Stock Price Index rose 19.25 points, or 2.4 percent, to 830.69. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher, but well off their  
intraday highs as investors began to cash in after the unexpected 
Indonesian presidential election results. The benchmark Straits 
Times Index rose 42.27 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,025.48. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher following Wall

do anything,'' Schuerholz said. ``We've won more games than any 
team, we've won 100 games three years in a row, we've won eight 
straight division titles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you choose any criteria except one narrow criteria -- World  
Series championships -- we lead it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that's not such a narrow category. Not to the  
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aren't we the team of the century?'' New York GM Brian Cashman  
said Wednesday. ``World championships, that's the goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fittingly, the clubs that had the majors' two worst records in  
1990 get a final chance to make their cases starting with Game 1 
Saturday night at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, MVP of the AL Championship  
Series, probably will start for the Yankees. The Braves can pick 
from any of their Big Four of Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Greg Maddux 
and Kevin Millwood. 
</P>
<P>
	For Atlanta, it's an opportunity to win that elusive second  
World Series title. The Braves beat Cleveland in 1995 -- prompting 
them to put that boast on their rings -- but have nothing else to 
show for eight straight trips to the NL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Yankees, it's a chance to win their record 25th title  
and third in four years. That recent run began when they beat 
Atlanta in six games in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got another shot at them,'' Atlanta third baseman  
Chipper Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves earned their fifth trip to the World Series in the  
1990s by beating the New York Mets 10-9 in 11 innings Tuesday night 
in Game 6 of the NLCS. The Yankees beat Boston in five games in the 
ALCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta took a day off Wednesday while New York's practice at  
Yankee Stadium was rained out. That gave extra time for the Yankees 
to talk about -- or turn down -- debate about the top team in the 
last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players don't worry about it,'' catcher Joe Girardi said.  
``There are a lot of different players on both teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True, a lot has changed for the Yankees since 1990, when they  
went 67-95 with a starting lineup that included Oscar Azocar, Steve 
Balboni and Bob Geren, plus a rotation that had Tim Leary, Chuck 
Cary and Andy Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves were even worse that season at 65-97. That was the  
year they traded Dale Murphy and could only hope that young Glavine 
and Smoltz would blossom. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Atlanta is a major league-best 925-629 in  
regular-season games during the decade and the Yankees are next at 
851-702. Oh, their interleague record against each other? 
Appropriately, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves have won titles in the West and East in the 1990s and  
became the first NL franchise to reach five World Series since the 
Dodgers in the '50s. The Yankees have gone to the playoffs for five 
straight years, their best stretch since going to the World Series 
from 1960-1964. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, with no slight intended to Toronto for its  
championships in 1992-93, it's all come down the Braves and 
Yankees. At stake, a trophy and a title -- Team of the Decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we win another World Series,'' Schuerholz said. ``At  
least it would put an end to that question.''

	Indonesian Parliament Names New President  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Abdurrahman Wahid was elected by  
parliament today as Indonesia's new president, inheriting the 
daunting tasks of restoring national unity and leading the world's 
fourth-largest country out of its worst economic crisis in a 
generation. The historic vote by the People's Consultative 
Committee culminated a tumultuous 14-hour stretch in which 
incumbent President B.J. Habibie suffered a humiliating setback and 
subsequently pulled out of the race. The assembly backed Wahid over 
Megawati Sukarnoputri, the popular daughter of Indonesia's founding 
president, Sukarno, by a vote of 373 to 313, with five abstentions.

	Hurricane Jose Threatens Caribbean  
</P>
<P>
	POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) -- Islanders braced for a  
battering from Hurricane Jose, which is threatening a string of 
Caribbean islands from French Martinique to the U.S. territory of 
Puerto Rico as it grows and gains power today. ``Our projections 
have it becoming a Category 2 hurricane (with winds of) 90 maybe 95 
mph,'' said Chris Robbins, a meteorologist at the U.S. National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. A Category 2 storm has winds of up to 
110 mph and are capable of moderate damage. Another meteorologist 
said today that there was a strong chance the storm would not reach 
the U.S. East Coast.

	Albright Hails Democracy in Nigeria

<P>
	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
today hailed the restoration of democracy in Nigeria but said the 
transition from military rule will not be complete until repressive 
laws are repealed and civilian supremacy consolidated. Calling the 
reinstatement of democracy here this year an event of historic 
proportions, Albright compared it with the overthrow of repressive 
rule in her native Czechoslovakia a decade ago and in South Africa 
in 1994.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- With Russian forces closing in on  
Chechnya's capital, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin headed to a 
neighboring region today for a closer look at the military 
operation. Putin, who has seen his popularity soar since Russia 
sent troops into Chechnya last month, was traveling to Mozdok, a 
town just outside Chechnya that hosts key Russian military bases. 
The prime minister also planned to discuss the refugee crisis in 
southern Russia. More than 160,000 people have streamed out of 
Chechnya since the fighting started three weeks ago.

	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and  
opposition leader Sonia Gandhi, heir to the Nehru-Gandhi political 
dynasty, took their oaths of office today in India's parliament. 
The Italian-born Mrs. Gandhi, 52 spoke in Hindi as she swore to 
uphold and protect the Indian constitution. Vajpayee, who has the 
support of 303 members of the 543-seat house, walked around shaking 
hands with party leaders, including Mrs. Gandhi, president of the 
Congress party. She was elected to parliament for the first time in 
voting that ended Oct. 3, but led her party to its worst showing 
ever, 112 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha, the lower house of 
parliament.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon for the first time has revealed  
where it stored nuclear weapons abroad during the Cold War, 
including unarmed submarine-seeking depth bombs in Cuba during the 
1962 missile crisis with the Soviet Union. The names of nine places 
where bombs or bomb components minus their nuclear charges were 
located between 1951 and 1977 are revealed in a newly declassified 
official Pentagon history. The names of 18 other locations were 
blacked out by government censors before the document was released.

Williams with the winning run in the 11th inning and the Atlanta 
Braves beat the New York Mets 10-9 last night to win the NL 
Championship Series 4-2. The Braves, having derailed the Mets' 
grand plan for a Subway Series, were headed to the World Series for 
the fifth time this decade. Game 1 against the New York Yankees 
will be Saturday night at Turner Field. It's a rematch of 1996, 
when the Yankees won in six games.

<HEADLINE> No Gun Ri Tunnel May Be Dug Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY SANG-HUN CHOE   	
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Railroad officials offered today to  
remove fresh concrete plastered on the bridge under which hundreds 
of Korean refugees were allegedly killed by American troops in the 
Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's national railroad spent $55,000 in September to  
coat one of the bullet-scarred railroad tunnels at No Gun Ri, South 
Korea, with a 4-inch layer of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	That invited charges of a government cover-up from South Koreans  
who considered the bullet marks as evidence of their claims that 
GIs machine-gunned unarmed Korean refugees seeking shelter beneath 
the railroad overpasses in July 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tunnels stood there for decades. Why did they do the  
repair work at this time, without telling us anything? It smells 
fishy to us,'' said Chung Eun-yong, representative of the survivors 
of the No Gun Ri killings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 30, The Associated Press reported accounts by American  
veterans corroborating villagers' claims. The U.S. and South Korean 
governments then promised thorough investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pure coincidence. We did our repair work on the old  
overpasses,'' said Lee Sung-wook of the National Railroad 
Administration. ``If necessary for the investigation, we will 
restore the tunnel to its original condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a parliamentary hearing last week, railroad authorities  
said they had found cracks in the 80-year-old bridge. They 
presented documents showing that the regional railroad had 
recommended repair work on the tunnels since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors say they felt free to publicize their claims only in  
the early 1990s because past military-led governments had 
discouraged publicity about the case to avoid embarrassing their 
U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
	During the chaotic first months of the war, U.S. troops made a  
fighting retreat along the railroad through No Gun Ri. Many were 
wary of refugees because of reports that North Korean troops had 
infiltrated groups of civilians.
