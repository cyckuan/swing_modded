<HEADLINE> Nepali National Strike Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The armed national strike called
by Nepal's ultra-leftist guerrillas on Thursday ended almost
peacefully, with no reports of violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued late Thursday by the Home Ministry said
no violent activities took place in the country and people's daily
life was almost normal.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas called a compulsory strike across the country to
protest the alleged killings of guerrilla members by the police
and to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the democratic movement
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under the threat of violence against those who ignore the call
of strike, nearly all activities in the country were stopped --
offices,schools and shops were closed while traffic and
transportations were almost paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
At least 7,000 additional armed police personnel were deployed
across the nation to respond to any violent incidents and to SOS
calls during the strike.
</P>
<P>
About 1300 people, including police, guerrillas and civilians
have been killed in police-guerrilla clashes since the ultra-
leftist guerrillas started armed struggles in 1996.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Endeavor in Fight Against Bosman Ruling - Blatter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- International Football Federation
(FIFA) President Sepp Blatter said here on Thursday that the world
soccer's governing body will endeavor to exercise the disruptive
impact brought about by the Bosman ruling.
</P>
<P>
"Rich and poor clubs are clearly categorized and the gap
between them is widened by the Bosman ruling," Blatter said. "
This is not in the conformance to the soccer logic which should be
based on the spirit of unification and democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The disruptive impact of the ruling must be stamped out," said
the FIFA chief, who arrived here on Thursday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"I hope our efforts will yield some results by the end of the
year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1995 Bosman ruling, players were bound to a club
until their contract was sold. As a consequence, the number of
foreign players pitched at one time was limited to three with
another two on the roster for each team in most leagues.
</P>
<P>
But things changed when Belgian midfielder Jean-Marc Bosman
said he should be free to move, without payment to his club, at
the end of his contract. He won his case before the European
Court of Justice, and his example, called the Bosman Ruling,
effectively ended the limits on foreigners within the European
Union and created free agency for European athletes.
</P>
<P>
Soccer bodies are disturbed by the trend of talents being
assembled in the hands of a few rich European clubs. Small clubs
are unable to recover the cost of developing young talents since
the players can wait until the expiration of their contracts to
sign with a bigger club.
</P>
<P>
The EU commission on January rejected a proposal by Blatter to
introduce a new system requiring each team field at least six
players who are eligible for the respective country's national
squad.

<HEADLINE> Gebreselassie Auctions Sports Wear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Olympic 10,000
meters champion Haile Gebreselassie has auctioned one of his
sports wear for 50,000 birr (about 6,200 U.S. dollars) to support
a sports club in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian Herald newspapers
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Buyers offered between 25,000-40,000 birr (nearly 5,000 U.S.
dollars) for Gebreselassie's sports wear, which he put on at the
Atlanta Olympics when he triumphed in the 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
But the track superstar beat these offers by giving out 50,000
birr, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There were also four pieces of sports wear for auction. These
were offered by Abebe Mekone, Belayneh Densamo, Fita Bayisa and
Gete Wami.
</P>
<P>
Like Gebreselassie, both Mekone and Densamo gave the best price
for their sports wear offered to the auction meeting, and remained
to be the owners of their own outfits.
</P>
<P>
A total sum of 206,000 birr (about 25,000 U.S. dollars) was
obtained from the sale of sports wear and donations, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Grants Loan to Zambia on Road Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will construct a
70-kilometre tarred road in its Western Province with foreign
loans including 10 million U.S. dollars granted by Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Hesham Ebraheem Al-Waqayan, deputy director of the Kuwait Fund
for Arab Economic Development, said at the signing ceremony on
Thursday that the 20- year loan provided by the Kuwaiti government
would cover about 29 percent of the total cost of the project,
which will be completed by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Al-Waqayan said Kuwait is willing to work with the Zambian
government to initiate other projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Finance and Economic Minister Katele Kalumba said the
total cost of the project is 27.3 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said co-operating partners BADEA (Arab Bank for Economic
Development of Africa in Khatoum) and Vienna-based OPEC will put
in 10.7 million and four million U.S. dollars respectively and the
government of Zambia will provide the remaining 2.6 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba said the opening of the road would provide Zambia with
a shorter route to the port of Lobito in Angola.

LUSAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and Japan signed an
agreement here Thursday to increase Japanese assistance to Zambia
in the fields of poverty reduction, health, education and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Finance Minister Katele Kalumba said at the signing

the two countries can develop a common understanding and vision on
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He urged Japan to invest in his country's electricity and
telecommunications sectors.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba said it is now the time for the two countries to create
the necessary conditions for the private sectors in both countries
to interact and exploit the available business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Shinsuke Horiuchi, head of the visiting Japanese delegation,
said the two governments are engaged in an intensive dialogue on

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Govt Denies Negotiation With Opposition Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi on Thursday denied that there are any negotiations between
his government and the main opposition party Renamo.
</P>
<P>
Renamo (Mozambican National Resistance) leader Afonso Dhlakama
on Wednesday claimed that negotiations were taking place on
holding early general elections, or securing governorships for
Renamo in those provinces where it won a majority in the last
December elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Mocumbi told a press briefing that he knew nothing of
such negotiations, adding: "There are no negotiations between the
government and any political party."
</P>
<P>
He also denied the constant claims by Renamo parliamentary
deputies that there is "a political crisis" in the country.
</P>
<P>
If anybody was preparing "situations of crisis and
instability", then the law would deal firmly with them, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Renamo accused the ruling Frelimo party of fraud in general
elections last December and threatened to form a separate
government in the six provinces where it won a majority unless the
government agreed to recount ballots and hold negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns U.S.-British Bombings of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday strongly condemned
U.S. and British air raids over southern Iraq on Thursday, which
killed 14 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Information released in Baghdad on casualties shows the damage
caused during the latest strikes by U.S. and British air forces
against southern Iraq is the heaviest since the U.S. and the
United Kingdom launched the campaign "Fox of Desert" against Iraq
in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of strikes against civilian facilities, 14
innocent civilians have been killed and 19 injured. Northern
regions of the country also came under fire," the Russian Foreign
Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, these facts are bound to cause serious concern,
especially because the above-mentioned actions, which are carried
out practically on a daily basis in so-called no fly-zones, are
absolutely illegal from the point of view of international law.
They also directly contradict diplomatic efforts now being made
with the aim of ensuring the enforcement of Resolution 1284 on
Iraq passed by the U.N.Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"The illegal actions against a sovereign state that entail
numerous human deaths and heavy destruction not only do not cease,
but are also glossed over in every way," said the statement,
expressing grave concern over "the excessive use of military force
against civilian populations" by the U.S. and the United Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Tung Confident of Positive Vote on PNTR for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I am delighted that the congressional leadership are committed
to a vote in the House in late May, and in the Senate in early
June," Tung told a luncheon attended by hundreds of U.S.
businessmen at the Ronald Reagan International Center.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that Congress will make the right decision in
the interests of the U.S. and in the interest of the multilateral
trading systems which the U.S. has done so much to help create and
has received so much benefits, in other words, a positive vote for
PNTR," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung addressed the luncheon, sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, after meeting with President Bill Clinton earlier on
Friday and leaders of Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that PNTR for China and the country's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) are "not simply about business
opportunities," it is also about "strengthening economic stability
in the region," "ensuring that differences on trade issues are
resolved sensibly" and "developing the global economy on
responsible, rules-based principles."
</P>
<P>
"The rules-based system under which we operate has facilitated
and encouraged regional and international cooperation on the full
range of trade and investment issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The system has enabled the emerging economies to lift living
standards for millions of people and build more prosperous, stable
societies, he added.
</P>
<P>
"So it is surprising to me that there is so much debate here in
the U.S. on the issue of PNTR for China," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress annually decided after a debate to resume the
normal trade relations with China. The Clinton administration
agreed to grant PNTR to China when the two countries signed an
agreement last year on China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and it needs to be approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Tung stressed that if the House fails to pass the PNTR
legislation in May, the damage to Hong Kong's economy will be "
devastating" because the region's economy is strongly linked to
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
"One of our great advantages in taking forward this vision is
our links with Mainland China. Over the past 20 years, Hong Kong
has benefited greatly from China's open door policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States will greatly benefit from normal trade
relations with China, Tung said, citing the fact that more than 1,
100 U.S. companies have invested over 21 billion U.S. dollars in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt U.S. businesses will make good use of their presence
in Hong Kong to leverage the significant opportunities created by
China's entry to the WTO," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that China's trade will double within the next
six years as a result of the accession and U.S. exports
accordingly could grow from 21 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 to 42
billion U.S. dollars by 2006, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung also told the guests that "One Country, Two Systems" is
working well in Hong Kong. "We are proud of what we have achieved
in almost three years since Reunification."
</P>
<P>
On the economy of Hong Kong, Tung said the economy is expected
to grow by five percent this in 2000. It grew 8.9 percent in the
last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Tung arrived here from New York and is expected to depart on
Friday for Los Angeles after a private meeting with President Bill
Clinton at the White House and other senior U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
This is Tung's second visit to the United States since he was
elected as the first chief executive of China's HKSAR in 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Republican Budget for Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate, by a near
party line vote of 51 to 45, approved Friday a Republican-written
budget of 1.83 trillion U.S. dollars for fiscal year 2001, moving
lawmakers a step closer to a campaign season full of battles with
President Bill Clinton over spending and taxes.
</P>
<P>
Since the House approved a similar budget two weeks ago, the
Republicans' goal is for Congress to pass a compromise measure by
next Friday, in time for lawmakers' spring recess.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which does not require Clinton's signature, only
sets overall tax and spending targets for fiscal year 2001, which
starts on October, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's most notable Democrat victory, senators voted 51-49
to chip 2.7 billion dollars out of the Republicans' five-year, 150-
billion-dollar tax cut to use for Pell college grants for low-
income students.
</P>
<P>
Even before the Senate completed its plan, the two parties were
attacking each others' fiscal visions.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said the proposed Republican tax cut would consume
virtually the entire budget surplus, not counting Social Security
money.
</P>
<P>
Like Clinton proposed, the Republican budget would trim the 3.6-
trillion-dollar publicly held national debt by about 1 trillion
dollars over the next five years, a reduction that most economists
say should help the economy by helping to keep interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
Republicans would also boost spending for education, biomedical
research and other programs. But such details are really decided
in later bills.
</P>
<P>
By voice vote, senators agreed Thursday to add another 4
billion dollars to next year's defense budget for a total of 311
billion dollars, or 7 percent above this year and 5 billion
dollars more than Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
The provision would compensate for a 4-billion-dollar Pentagon
boost the House approved in a separate emergency spending bill
that Senate Republican leaders have decided to scuttle.

CARTAGENA, Colombia, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The 13th Non-Aligned

meeting was opened Friday in Cartagena, north of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Ambassador to the United Nations Alfonso Valdivieso
presided over the inaugural ceremony, that was attended by high-

</P>
<P>
Valdivieso expressed his concern about recent cases in which

</P>

He said that the processes of political negotiation for a peace
agreement and for its consolidation must be respected and duly
supported by the international community.
</P>
<P>
He said that the outlook for a nuclear disarmament is not very
clear, and that for this reason the Non-Aligned Movement must be
very emphatic about the imperative need to clear of obstructions
the disarmament agenda.

LUANDA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 11,500 criminal cases were
handled by the Angolan judiciary last year, marking an increase of
24 percent as compared with the previous year, Angola's top
prosecutor said here on Friday.

five judges were " absolutely insufficient" to handle such a load.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Mobile Telephone Clients Up to 14,000: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Telecommunication
Corporation (ETC) has got 14,000 mobile telephone clients while
all available internet lines have been leased to clients, the
Walta Information Center reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The launching of mobile and internet services with an outlay of
over 130 million birr (about 16.2 million U.S. dollars) has
enabled the country to have better information exchange links with
the outside world, ETC Deputy General Manager Taddele Gurara was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The mobile telephone system introduced with an outlay of 110
million birr (about 13.7 million U.S. dollars) has the capacity
to serve 36,000 clients, Taddele said.
</P>
<P>
Continuing its expansion of mobile and internet services, ETC
has already completed studies for introducing message receiving
and transmitting devices in mobile telephones as well as for
stream lining internet and fax services, the general manager
said, adding this will go into effect next month.
</P>
<P>
Taddele also disclosed that a new system has been devised for
enabling permanent employees working for the government, private
or international organizations to acquire mobile telephones by
making payments spread over a one year period instead of all at
once.
</P>
<P>
According to Taddele, efforts are underway for making
additional installations intended to expand services outside
Addis Ababa to as far as Nazareth and Sodere, two towns about 100
kilometers southeast of the capital, and beyond in the next three
months.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that internet lines made operational at a
cost of over 20 million birr (2.4 million U.S. dollars) have all
been leased to 2, 600 clients, Taddele said, noting that there are
over 1,500 applicants on the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, a sum of 103.3 million U.S. dollars has been
pledged by the United Nations Development Program and ETC for
increasing internet lines to 14,000.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Hails Constitutional Amendment Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
on Friday hailed its parliament's approval of the Constitutional
Amendment Bill which empowers the government to acquire land from
white farmers without compensation.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said with the institution of the amendments, Zimbabweans
had acquired sovereignty to determine their future.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a rally of the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) in Bindura, about 100
kilometers from Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Today is a historic day because we are celebrating
victory over imperialism and colonialism," adding that the people
can now say the land belongs to them. "This is a victory to
enhance our sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the white farmers had betrayed themselves by
rejecting the draft constitution which made Britain liable for
compensation.
</P>
<P>
"But now with the new law the government has the power to
acquire the land without compensation," he said.
</P>

"We will only recognize the responsibility to pay for
structures and other developments," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would not acquire all land belonging to
the whites but only half of that land.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 white commercial farmers own about 12 million
hectares of fertile land while the government needs at least five
million hectares to resettle the landless black families.
</P>
<P>
"We are no longer going to ask for the land but we are going to
take without negotiating," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said if white people wanted to move out of Zimbabwe they
were free to do so, scorning at reports that Britain was ready to
pull its citizens out of the country.
</P>
<P>
"If they want to go we will open the borders for them. We will
give them police escort," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who has kicked off Zanu-pf campaigns for parliamentary
elections, told supporters that the government would soon set the
exact dates for the elections.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Blix Seeks to Make UNMOVIC Different From UNSCOM By Xie Meihua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Hans Blix, Executive
Chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission(UNMOVIC) for Iraq, presented a report to the
United Nations Thursday, mapping out a blueprint for the staff
structure of the new U.N. arms regime.
</P>
<P>
UNMOVIC was created by Security Council Resolution 1284 adopted
last December to replace now defunct the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction and resume the U.N.arms inspection in Iraq which
has been suspended since the U.S-led military strikes against the
country in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Blix's plan, there will be no deputy post for
UNMOVIC, but an executive assistant with less power will be set up,
a contrast with UNSCOM which was headed by Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
The deputy post of UNSCOM has been transitionally held by an
American. The last one was Charles Duelfer who reigned in February
after the establishment of UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
Unlike UNSCOM, Blix recommended in the plan that UNMOVIC will
be strong on experts and technical personnel rather than political
functionaries. He also proposed two-step approach to recruitment
of the personnel for the arms regime, with most UNMOVIC staff
being U.N. employees.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM relied mainly on experts picked up and paid by their
government, a practice resulted in the alleged UNSCOM's spying for
the United States which led to the demise of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Blix wants his arms staff to firmly act with a clear U.N.
identity and to avoid them from getting orders from outside the U.
N.body.
</P>
<P>
Blix also wants his arms regime to be tightly-controlled and
leakproof, saying the low of intelligence must be one way.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that agency's public information officer will
ensure that there will be a single authoritative point of contact
with the media, Blix himself or someone gets authorization from
him.
</P>
<P>
He noted that UNMOVIC has the same rights of UNSCOM, with the
freedom of movement and immediate, unrestricted access to any and
all areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
But he proposed to open a cultural program for his arms staff
which is aimed to train them in importance of understanding
national sensitivities and the proper handling of adversarial
situation in the field.
</P>
<P>
This is what UNSCOM failed in its operation and this is also
what led to consequent confrontations between the U.N. arms
inspectors and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan is an apparent bid of Blix to motivate Iraq
to cooperate with the United Nations and allow the return of the U.
N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Once the plan is approved by the 15-member Security Council,
possibly next week, the next step will be a visit to Iraq. But so
far, Iraq has reiterated that it banns U.N.arms inspectors from
returning unless the sanctions against the country get lifted.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in Switzerland Falls to Lowest Since 1992 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Switzerland has
fallen to its lowest level since 1992, the economic ministry
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministry said that the rate fell last month from 2.
4 percent in February to 2.3 percent, with white-collar industry
showing the biggest growth. The employment office in the ministry'
s state secretariat said it now expects the average for this year
to drop to two percent, 0.3 percent below its earlier forecasts.
</P>
<P>
"All economic indicators point upwards," said Jean-Luc Nordmann,
head of the office, "We are on the way to full employment."
</P>
<P>
He said that some branches of industry were now having
difficulty
finding workers. The number of people looking for jobs fell nearly
8,000 to 140,000 in March, while the number of employment
vacancies rose slightly to 15,000.
</P>
<P>
However, unemployment rates continue to differ greatly between
regions, particularly between German and French-speaking cantons.
They averaged about 0.5 percent in parts of central and eastern
Switzerland last month, but reached 4.5 in canton Geneva and 3.7
in Italian-speaking canton Ticino. The biggest drop was recorded
in canton Valais, where it fell more than one percent to 2.6
percent.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Declares All PACE Visits to Chechnya Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Russian president's aide Sergey
Yastrzhembsky announced Friday that all visits by the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE)
representatives and its leaders to Chechnya will be banned.
</P>
<P>
As a response to the Thursday decision by PACE to suspend
Russia's membership in the Europe Council, Moscow has decided to
stop "visits to Chechnya by PACE delegations, including its
leaders," Yastrzhembsky told a briefing in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"If before PACE could play a certain role in processes in
Russia,now this door has been shut," the Kremlin aide said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that "emotions explicitly prevailed over common
sense" when PACE members discussed the situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"We set no equation sign between PACE and the Council of Europe
as well as between PACE and Europe as a whole," said Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is profoundly disappointed that "deputies in Strasbourg
did not grasp the simple truth that cooperation is essential not
only for Russia but also for the Council of Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the position of Russia remains unchanged: "
the anti-terrorist operation will be continued."
</P>
<P>
"We do not intend to enter a discussion on basic values such as
the integrity of a country and the fight against terrorism," the
aide said.

<P>
The negotiators convened at Bolling Air Force base in southeast
Washington on Friday morning, with American mediators ready to
intervene later in the day to push for an agreement that has
eluded the two sides.
</P>
<P>
They also met for dinner Thursday evening at the base, which is
screened off from the public and news media.
</P>
<P>
The middle-level negotiating teams, led by Yasser Abed Rabbo
for the Palestinians and Oded Eran for Israel, are unlikely to
reach an agreement without more talks between their leaders,
diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
"No single round of talks can be expected to solve all the
complex core issues between Israelis and Palestinians," said
spokesman Mark Regev of the Israeli Embassy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"This round must be seen as another link in a process towards
reaching a framework agreement by May," Regev added.
</P>
<P>
The framework agreement is meant as a step toward a
comprehensive agreement by September 13 covering all the so-called

final status issues such as the size and status of the Palestinian
territories, Jerusalem, water rights, the fate of Palestinian
refugees and Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The same negotiators met at Bolling for one week last month
without any evidence of either progress or deadlock.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Egypt told Israel that it could not expect a warm
peace unless it consented to a Palestinian state and "dealt with
Jerusalem."

MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday detained two

fishing rules, said the Interfax news agency Friday.

The trawlers actually carried some 250 tons of processed sea
products which is much more than the legal margin.

For breaking the rules, the trawlers were stopped and are now
being escorted to Russian port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky for an

<HEADLINE> Russia Demands Swift Release of Its Detained Tanker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Moscow demands "the swift release"
of the Russian tanker and its crew detained in the Persian Gulf,
the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy's warships detained the Russian tanker Akademik
Pustovoit in the Persian Gulf on Thursday evening on suspicion of
smuggling embargoed Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
"We demand the swift release of the ship and its crew," said
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Yakovenko on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, if it turns out the ship was detained groundlessly,
the Foreign Ministry will support the pertinent claims against the
U.S.-led multinational naval force for damages incurred," he said.
</P>
<P>
"According to our information, the tanker, owned by the Russian
Novorossiisk shipping company, was detained on Thursday night by U.
S.naval forces operating in the Persian Gulf in line with U.N.
Security Council sanctions against Iraq," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that there must be an immediate and impartial
investigation in order to ascertain the circumstances surrounding
the incident," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, the Foreign Ministry's priority is to see to the
safety and well-being of Russian citizens," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has been able to maintain uninterrupted communications
with the captain of the tanker. Russian diplomatic and consular
officials in the region have received the necessary orders, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy detained the tanker once before in the Persian
Gulf,during its last voyage with a cargo of oil on March 1.
However, no violations were found and the ship was released, said
the Russian Transportation Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Another Russian tanker, Volgoneft-147, owned by the Russian
company SFAT, was detained by the U.S. Navy on February 2 and
charged with smuggling Iraqi oil in violation of U.N. sanctions.
To the present day there has been no final determination of the
actual origins of the tanker's cargo.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada's jobless rate remained at 6.
8 percent in March, unchanged from that of the previous month,
Statistic Canada reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth straight month for the country to record the
lowest unemployment for the past 24 years.
</P>
<P>
Up to 30,000 full-time positions were created last month as a
result of the strengthening Canadian economy, which has led to a 3.
2 percent rise in the overall employment over the past year,
according to the official statistical agency.
</P>
<P>
Although the job creation is absorbed by a growing number of
people seeking for better positions, the country's influential
economists forecast an even lower jobless rate of 6 percent by the
end of the year to further reduce unemployment from last month's 1.
1 million people.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy will advance by 4.4 percent in terms of
gross domestic product this year, outperforming all other G-7
countries except the U.S., the Bank of Nova Scotia predicted last
month.

LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Deputy Health Minister
Ernest Mwansa urged here Friday the country's citizens to donate
blood, saying that "blood can be available to us in the hour of
need only if we donate blood regularly. "
</P>
<P>
He told a rally to mark World Health Day falling on April 7
that many people have misgivings that donating blood weakens a
person or there are some kind of risks involved. It has been
proven beyond any doubt that donating blood does not weaken a
person in any manner.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country requires 60,000 units of blood
annually while it is able to collect only about 43,000 units.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia 60 percent of blood requirement is met through
voluntary donors while the remaining 40 percent is met from family
members of those in need, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Zambia all the blood collected is tested for
HIV, hepatitis and syphilis and about 10 percent of blood
collected is discarded due to contamination.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said that the country has adopted a
national blood policy and the blood transfusion act is awaiting
approval by parliament.
</P>
<P>
Eight new blood transfusion centers have been built and are
well- equipped, he said.

NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of the 1994 genocide
victims' remains were on Friday re-buried in a mass grave at a
memorial site in Rwanda's capital Kigali to mark the sixth
anniversary of the tragedy, Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to establish a genocide memorial site in
each of 150 communes where the genocide took place. Over 800,000
minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu extremists
during the 100-day genocide starting on April 7,1994.
</P>
<P>
"Genocide in Rwanda was a result of poor political ideologies
that emphasized ethnic differences. The political leaders of the
time deliberately ignored many things that we have in common:
language, culture, marriage ties and peaceful co-existance, that
had for long been a fundamental pillar of Rwandan society,"
Rwanda's interim President Paul Kagame said at the memorial site.
</P>
<P>
"The 1994 genocide victims' remains have to be buried so as to
keep in mind what happened to Rwanda. The whole world should
understand the hard times Rwanda went through and draw a lesson
from Rwanda," Kagame added.
</P>
<P>
"We must have a well functioning judiciary, which will be the
greatest support that the government can give to all Rwandans, so
that all genocide perpetrators are tried, " he said.

<P>
He added that these ideals must be spread throughout the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"We must create an environment for people to thrive in
conditions of equity and ensure that their resources are used to
improve their quality of life,"
</P>

He said it was important that societies in which arrogance of
wealth, greed, the insatiable licence to kill and maim including
vigilantism were banished from the continent.

a press conference here Friday afternoon that this round of talks
focused on political issues -- the separation of religion and
state as well as the right of self-determination in the south.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government delegation led by Nafie held lengthy
discussions with the representatives of the Sudan People's
Liberation Movement (SPLM), Nafie told the press.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, he said the two sides also discussed such
issues as administrative system, national legislation, judicial
system and revenue system, among others.
</P>
<P>
This week's meeting was the latest in several rounds of largely
 fruitless talks that have taken place under the auspice of a
sub-committee of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development
(IGAD).
</P>
<P>
At the press briefing, Nafie did not disclose the date when the
next round of talks will resume.
</P>
<P>
The previous round of talks between the two parties was held in
Nairobi in February, ending without agreement.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the gap in the positions between the government
and the rebels on the issues discussed in the rounds of talks
still remained unbridged.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Prime Minister Guy
Verhofstandt said on Friday that he is sorry that Belgium has done
nothing to stop the Rwandan genocide, Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the commemoration at Gisozi suburb of the Rwandan
capital Kigali where about 200,000 remains of the 1994 genocide
were reburied over the past week to mark the sixth anniversary of
the massacre, he said that the international community is
responsible for what happened in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"I accept the role of Belgium in the genocide that happened
here, Belgium and the United Nations should apologize to Rwandans
for having done nothing to stop the genocide, they very well knew
what was going to happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian Prime Minister said that he and his delegation have
come to pay tribute to the 10 Belgian soldiers and all other
Rwandans who perished in genocide.
</P>
<P>
He said that all genocide suspects who are hiding in his
country will have to be tried by the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda. He assured support to Rwanda in restoring
peace, unity and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian delegation of over 100 people on Friday morning
laid flowers on the graves of 10 Belgian U.N. soldiers who were
killed shortly after the plane carrying the then Rwandan president
Habyalimana was brought down on April 6, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's interim President Paul Kagame thanked the Belgian
delegation in general and the prime minister in particular for the
courage he took to ask for forgiveness.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Spokesmen for both China's Taiwan
Affairs Office of the State Council and Taiwan Work Office of the
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a joint
statement today to criticize Annette Lu's remarks on "Taiwan
independence."
</P>
<P>
They said Lu's remarks during an interview with a Hong Kong
media organ has challenged the One China policy and has provoked
animosity between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
This shows that Lu is an "extremist and typical 'Taiwan
independence' element," they said.
</P>
<P>
Her remarks put a gloss on Japan's occupation of Taiwan, thus
deeply hurting the feelings and national pride of the Chinese
people, they added.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, she has become a scum of the Chinese nation," they
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The people of Taiwan are Chinese. This is a hard fact. No
matter who becomes the leader of Taiwan, the fact that Taiwan is a
part of China can never be changed, they stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We will fight to the end against whoever sticks to the
position of 'two states' and 'Taiwan independence'", they said.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who advocates national separatism is doomed to failure,
they concluded.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Refutes Annette Lu's Separatist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the mainland-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits today pointed
out that Annette Lu's recent statements have exposed the
disgraceful face of a small group of "Taiwan independence"
advocates.
</P>
<P>
He said that their aim is to split China, and they have
maliciously attacked the mainland as well as all the Chinese
people. There is no doubt that their schemes backfire.
</P>
<P>
He said that the basis and prerequisite for the development of
relations across the Taiwan Straits are the One China principle.
However, Lu insists that the principle is creating a "threat" to
Taiwan, and people who agree with the principle are "surrendering"
to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Lu is merely spreading rumors and vilifying
the development of the cross-Straits relations and dialogues, and
her goal is to instigate the Taiwan people to oppose the One China
principle.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Lu's statements that "Taiwan respects
China" and it "will not offend China" reveal that she totally
denies the fact that Taiwan is part of China, and denies the
agreement that "both sides across the Taiwan Straits adhere to the
One China principle".
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she has vilified the Chinese people's will to
safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity, and bruised
the aspiration shared by the Chinese people worldwide who hope to
see the reunification of China and national unity.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Lu's "friendship" and "kindness" are nothing but
deception.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that any issue can be discussed on the
basis of the One China principle. Cross-straits dialogues and
negotiations can be carried out only if this principle and the
fact that Taiwan is part of China are recognized, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Unchanged in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The nation's unemployment rate
held steady at 4.1 percent in March, even as 416,000 workers found
jobs, the largest number in four years, the Labor Department said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In February, only 7,000 new jobs were created, much weaker than
the 43,000 previously reported by the government.
</P>
<P>
Government analysts said a number of special factors boosted
payrolls, including the hiring of 117,000 temporary census workers
and a longer five-week survey period in March vs. the normal four-
week period. The last five-week survey period was in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Job growth last month was slightly stronger than the 400,000-
job range many analysts were expecting. But government analysts
said that taking all the special factors into account, job growth
was probably roughly in line with the average monthly gain for
1999. Those analysts estimated that the extra week in the survey
period added anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Jobs gains were fairly widespread last month.
</P>
<P>
The service sector, the driving force of job creation in the
United States, added 328,000 jobs in March. Business services
added 150,000 jobs last month, while the government added 142,000,
led by the hiring of 117,000 workers to conduct the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing, which lost around 248,000 jobs last year, lost 5,
000 jobs in March. Government analysts said the March decline
would have been greater had it not been for the return of 15,000
aircraft workers who had been on strike in February.
</P>
<P>
Construction companies added 89,000 jobs, reflecting some of
the seasonal hiring that normally occurs and the longer survey
period.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose 0.4 percent to 13.60 U.S. dollars in March. In February,
wages grew by 0.4 percent, slightly higher than the 0.3 percent
increase the government initially reported.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rebuffs PACE Decision to Suspend Its Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Moscow on Friday kicked back the
Thursday decision by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of
Europe (PACE) to suspend Russia's membership in the Europe Council
on the excuse of "bad human rights situation in Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
The resolution "will certainly harm dialogue between Russia and
the assembly," Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said at a
Friday meeting with the European Union's Troika representatives in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"The assembly was misled by members who still think in terms of
the cold war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is stunned by and deeply regrets the PACE decision but "
will continue its policy of eradicating international terrorism,
working out a political settlement in the Chechen republic and
restoring a constitutional order and human rights there," Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has "taken note of the desire expressed by heads of
state and government of European Union countries to cooperate with
Russia on the basis of common values for peace, stability and
prosperity in Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
A statement, released by the Russian Foreign Ministry on Friday,
also said the PACE resolution "delivered a serious blow to the
Council of Europe's' efforts to develop a common European area in
humanitarian and legal spheres among others."
</P>
<P>
PACE "demonstrated disrespect for the memory of the Russians
who fell victim to Chechen terrorists and those who gave up their
lives for the restoration of peace and calm to Chechnya, for the
territorial integrity of Russia," it continued.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the unprecedented openness of the Russian dialogue,
the demonstration of more than convincing evidence of the real
state of affairs in Chechnya and the firm line of the Russian
leadership to a political settlement, the PACE deputies could not
or did not want to take that into account. They continue to
collect their information from the false propaganda circulated by
Chechen terrorists and their patrons," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Russia "will continue to firmly follow the policy of uprooting
international terrorism, achieving a lasting political settlement
in Chechnya, restoring constitutional law, order, and a normal
social and economic life in the republic," it said.

<HEADLINE> Car Registrations In Britain Up In First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Commercial vehicle registrations
remained positive, recording overall growth in March, according to
figures released Friday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders (SMMT).
</P>
<P>
Total registrations in March increased 7.2 percent to 42,239
compared with March 1999's performance of 39,409 units.
Registrations in the first quarter rose 7.3 percent on the same
period last year to 77876 units from 72553.
</P>
<P>
This partly reflects relative weakness in the first quarter of
1999, due to economic stagnation, anticipation of the 1999 Budget
and uncertainty over the twice-yearly plate change, the SMMT said.
</P>
<P>
However, new registrations for Rover fell by more than 1,000 to
24,899 in March from the same month in 1999 and for the year to
date are running 6.38 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
There have been calls for a boycott of German car maker, BMW,
after its decision to sell Rover to a venture capital firm, with
the loss of thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Macgrowan, SMMT Chief Executive said "Even though
there was a degree of uncertainty in the first quarter of 1999,
which undermined demand, the increase seen in the first three
months of this year is undoubtedly welcome."
</P>
<P>
"This is a far stronger performance than was anticipated a few
months ago, a development no doubt helped by the strong economy,
competitive market and continuing growth of e-commerce," he added.

<HEADLINE> Article Refutes Annette Lu's Statements on "Taiwan Independence" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today issued a
commentator's article strongly refuting Annette Lu's statements
advocating "Taiwan independence" when she was interviewed by a
Hong Kong cable TV station on April 2.
</P>
<P>
Lu is a member of the Taiwan-based Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Lu repeated her argument that the
relationship between the mainland and Taiwan should be called a "
remote relative and close neighbor", that is to say, because the
ancestors of the Taiwan people came from the mainland, Taiwan is
the mainland's historical "distant cousin" when consanguinity is
considered; and when geographical factors are considered, their
relationship is merely that of a "close neighbor".
</P>
<P>
The article says that the allegation is aimed at denying the
fact that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and
that the people of Taiwan are an inseparable part of the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
The article says that whoever attempts to change the situation
that Taiwan is part of China by using any means whatsoever is
simply daydreaming.
</P>
<P>
Lu also held that the people of Taiwan are scapegoats from the
civil war between Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China, and
that the formation of the Taiwan issue arose from the
confrontation between the two parties after Kuomintang withdrew to
Taiwan. Since the Kuomintang has now ended its rule, Taiwan should
pursue the goal of independence, she alleged.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that the temporary separation between
Taiwan and the mainland will inevitably come to an end. Taiwan has
been part of China under the Kuomintang's rule, and it will still
be part of China under the rule of any other party or person.
</P>
<P>
Anybody attempting to take advantage of the Kuomintang's step-
down to carry out a "Taiwan independence" policy is doomed to fail,
the article says.
</P>
<P>
Lu did not forget to use the camouflage of "communications with
the mainland", but anybody with common sense can find out that she
is cheating the public, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It continues to point out that her attempt to reach the goal of
"realizing Taiwan independence through peaceful means" by playing
tricks is just her own wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
The article restates the Chinese government's policy that it
will never negotiate with any party or person who advocates "
Taiwan independence", and will never give people pursuing "Taiwan
independence" any chance to realize their dream.
</P>
<P>
Lu is cheating the people, and first of all, she is cheating
the Taiwan people, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It says that Lu has over-estimated herself, and underestimated
the Chinese nation's resolution and will to safeguard state
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that the China will adhere to the One China
principle without wavering in any circumstances or at any time.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Remain as Cosmopolitan, Open City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 7 (Xinhua) - Hong Kong will remain a
cosmopolitan city, a city that is more open to the outside than
most other cities in the world, said Leung Chun-ying, Convenor of
the Executive Council of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (
SAR).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar in Tokyo organized by the Hong Kong
Economic and Trade Office in Japan, Leung said Hong Kong has the
qualities to become Asia's world city, and at the same time, a
major city in China.
</P>
<P>
Leung said Hong Kong's overall economy is bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter of 1999, the gross domestic product
increased by 8.7 percent over the same quarter of the previous
year, after a handsome growth of 4.4 percent in the third quarter.
The whole year of 1999 brought home an annual growth of 2.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Leung told the audience that Hong Kong has embarked on another
program of ambitious projects since it believes that a modern and
efficient economy has to have the best transport network.
</P>
<P>
"There are five new rail projects and a bridge which are at
various stages of construction," he said. "When the new transport
projects come into action in or before 2006, the economic
territory of Hong Kong will be many times its political territory.
"
</P>
<P>
Leung also introduced a report entitled "Bringing the Vision to
Life" which was published by the Commission on Strategic
Development a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the first time that Hong Kong had sat down to
examine its long-term future - a future that would not expire.
</P>
<P>
"It means Hong Kong now has a clear vision, based on an
assessment of strengths and weaknesses, and of challenges and
opportunities," he said.

learning and stimulate life-long learning, to enhance the quality
of teaching and teacher development and to make teacher become the

<HEADLINE> India May Discontinue Land Links With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The matter was being considered and a final decision was
expected to be taken soon, Home Minister L. K. Advani said Friday
in Chandigarh, 235 kilometers northwest of here, the Press Trust
of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Indian hardliners have been pressing for a stop of the railway
link between the two countries, and the only bus service between
New Delhi and Lahore in Pakistan, which was open into service
following a historic bus trip to Pakistan by Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Advani ruled out once again an immediate resumption of the
stalled dialogue with Pakistan, saying that no purpose would be
served even if talks were held while innocents were being killed
in Kashmir and cross-border terrorism was carried on, according to
PTI.
</P>
<P>
"We never deny that talks or negotiations should be held and
that we are ready to even discuss Kashmir, but a conducive
atmosphere has to be created by Pakistan for holding talks,"
Advani echoed Vajpayee as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee undertook the Lahore bus journey in an effort to
improve the situation, Advani said, adding that the armed
conflicts between the two countries last year in Kargil sector of
Kashmir changed the situation as the neighbor "augmented terrorist
activities" after the war.

MAPUTO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Strong winds and rains caused by
cyclone Hudah have hit the coastal districts of the northern
province of Nampula, Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
However, instead of coming inland, the cyclone changed its
course and has been moving slowly down the Mozambique Channel, the
Mozambique News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But Hudah appears to be losing intensity. The wind speed has
fallen from 100 to 30 or 40 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
According to Nampula provincial governor Rosario Mualeia, Moma
district was the area worst affected by the rains and winds caused
by the cyclone.

<P>
One child is said to have died in Moma, though the
circumstances of this death were not reported.
</P>
<P>
Flimsy houses in Moma were blown down by the winds, and an
unspecified number of people rendered homeless. Extensive areas of
maize and cassava fields were damaged.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five military campaign tents are on hand in Nampula City

</P>
<P>
"It is proposed that all future peacekeeping interventions
conducted by the South African National Defense Force (SANDF), or
in which the SANDF participates, should ascribe to the principles
of participatory, empowering and sustainable development," she
said.

"This would require a refocus and retraining of our soldiers to

JOHANNESBURG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- South African National
Defense Force (SANDF) will have to be equipped with new weapons to
meet the rescue or peacekeeping missions in the future, South
African Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Introducing debate on his budget vote in the National Assembly
in Cape Town, Lekota said the defense function is about developing
and maintaining a capability to ward off threats or dangers
created by human beings or natural forces to South Africa and its
people.
</P>
<P>
The most memorable record of South Africa's defense capability
in recent times was the coverage by media throughout the world of
SANDF personnel and aircraft carrying out rescue missions in
Mozambique, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "these were SANDF personnel performing their duty
as our nation expected of them."
</P>
<P>
However, the capital equipment of the SANDF has reached a state
of block obsolescence, Lekota said, adding that the ships,
submarines and aircraft will become obsolete by 2004 or 2005 and
will be maintained until they can be replaced with
newer-generation equipment.
</P>
<P>
"The department of defense will henceforth embark on the
planned capital renewal program for the South African army, which
will primarily constitute a domestic acquisition program," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Refuses to Accept Obligations From Zimbabwe's Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The British High Commission in
Zimbabwe Friday said that it will not accept the obligations
imposed by Zimbabwe's Constitutional Amendment Number 16 on
Britain.
</P>
<P>
"We obviously fully recognize the right of the people of
Zimbabwe to draw up their own constitution. But equally obvious a
sovereign and independent state can not use its constitution to
impose conditions on another," the commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The parliament of Zimbabwe Thursday passed the Constitution of
Zimbabwe Bill (No. 16) which seeks to amend the Lancaster House
Constitution and allow the Zimbabwean government to compulsorily
acquire land for resettlement without paying any compensation.
</P>
<P>
Successive British governments had made substantial
contributions to the first phase of land reform in Zimbabwe, the
commission said, stressing that Britain had met all the
obligations agreed at the time of the independence in relation to
land.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to supporting a transparent, fair and cost
effective program of land reform," the commission said. "This is
part of our commitment to support programs in Zimbabwe and
elsewhere to reduce poverty."
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, Britain is willing to fund a
program of land reform on the basis that it deals with real
poverty and is within the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Land ownership in Zimbabwe is in favor of whites who hold large
swathes of the prime farming land while more than 70 percent of
black Zimbabweans are congested in infertile wastelands.

<HEADLINE> Most People Lack Access to Safe Blood, Says WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- An overwhelming majority of the
world's population does not have access to safe blood, the World
Health Organization (WHO) warned here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite all the technological marvels that humanity is
experiencing, reliable and safe blood supply is still out of reach
for untold millions of people around the world," WHO Director-
General Gro Harlem Brundtland said in a statement marking the
World Health Day.
</P>
<P>
WHO called on its 191 members and on the international
community to address urgently this glaring inequality.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Day is observed on April 7 each year to mark
the day in 1948 when WHO was founded. This year's theme, "Safe
Blood Starts With Me," highlights the highly unbalanced situation
in the world today with regard to blood supply.
</P>
<P>
Between 5 percent and 10 percent of HIV infections worldwide
are transmitted through the transfusion of infected blood and
blood products, according to WHO and the United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). They estimate that 5.6 million new HIV
infections occur annually.
</P>
<P>
Another important issue is the inappropriate and unnecessary
use of blood especially where clear clinical guidelines are not
available, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The major diseases other than HIV that can be transmitted by
infected blood are the hepatitis B and C viruses, syphilis,
malaria and Chagas disease, amongst others. Each year, unsafe
transfusion and injection practices cause an estimated 8-16
million hepatitis B virus infections, 2.3-4.7 million hepatitis C
virus infections, and 80,000- 160,000 HIV infections, according to
WHO.
</P>
<P>
Some 75 million units (one unit generally equals 450
milliliters) of blood are donated each year throughout the world,
but more than 13 million of those units are not tested for all
transfusion-transmissible infections.
</P>
<P>
In 1975, WHO's governing body, the World Health Assembly,
passed a resolution urging WHO members to "promote development of
national blood services based on voluntary non-remunerated
donation of blood."

Friday over the air raids by U.S. and British warplanes in

inspection in Iraq and an alleviation of U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Inflation Rises in March  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflation rose to 3.1
percent in March from February's 2.9 percent, the National
Statistics Service (NSS) announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The NSS attributed the increase in inflation to a 4.0 percent
rise in durable household items and services, a 13.9 percent jump
in clothing-footwear and a 2.5 percent increase in transport
prices.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation is expected to be stable or slightly
drop in the following two months due to the seasonal exclusion of
the heating oil index from the consumer price index (CPI) basket
and other factors.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected that the country's harmonized consumer
price index, which is used to compare Greek inflation with that of
other European Union members, will remain at 2.0 in March.

<HEADLINE> SDB Pledges 29 Billion Yuan for Yunnan's Key Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank (SDB)
will provide 29 billion yuan (about 3.49 billion US dollars) in
loan over the next two to three years to southwest China's Yunnan
Province for the construction of key projects.
</P>
<P>
SDB President Chen Yuan and Yunnan Governor Li Jiating signed
an agreement of intent here on the loan today.
</P>
<P>
This is one of several huge-sum loans pledged recently by the
bank. Earlier it signed similar agreements on multi-billion-yuan
loans for two other western provinces -- Sichuan and Guizhou --
and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after signing the protocol, Chen Yuan
said Chinese financial institutions are very supportive of the
country's strategy of developing west China, and they have all
increased their capital support for the western provinces and
Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Founded in March 1994, the SDB is the largest policy bank in
China, with assets totaling 600 billion yuan. It aims to offer
help to key local and state projects for infrastructure
construction.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, it has begun to extend preferential treatment
to central and western counties; loans to these areas account for
some 70 percent of its total loans.
</P>
<P>
Under today's agreement, the loans will be used for Yunnan's 15
key projects, in the fields of highways, railways, electricity,
telecommunications and urban construction.

<HEADLINE> Female Scientists Owe Success to Aspiration, Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Female scientists belief that they
depend on aspiration and effort to become successful rather than
talent, according to a recent survey released by the Science Times
today.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire survey was conducted by the Department of
Sociology of the Shandong University on 18 female academicians at
the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Answering the mailed questionnaires, 14 academicians gave
themselves the highest grades in terms of "clear goals and
aspirations" and "hard work and reading", while 15 of them wrote
zero in terms of talent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that these female scientists have been
keeping a good balance between career and family, and many of them
play leading roles in their families as well as in their
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
Eight academicians said that they spend more time on housework
than their husbands, six said they share the household chores with
their husbands, and four said they do less.
</P>
<P>
All the scientists surveyed have a strong sense of equality
between men and women, but most of them thought that female
scientific workers are not as well employed as their male
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The academicians, all of whom are over 60 years old, also
provided their opinions on the situation of women in scientific
and technological research fields during the past 20 years. But
more said the situation is not as good as in the 1950s and 1960s
than those who said it has improved.
</P>
<P>
Only half of the scientists believe that the status of female
scientific workers will improve in the country in the near future,
and the other eight said they are just not so optimistic.

<HEADLINE> UNIFIL Not Mandated to Disarm Palestinians in Lebanon: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) said Friday that it has no mandate to disarm the
Palestinians in refugee camps in the country, An-Nahar newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL spokesman Timor Goksel said the Palestinian refugee camps
were outside UNIFIL's area of operation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said in a memorandum after
talking here with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy Roid
Larsen that the U.N. peacekeepers should disarm Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon after Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud expressed concern that Palestinian guerrillas would
continue attacks after Israel's unilateral withdrawal from south
Lebanon. Lebanese government can not entirely control Palestinian
guerrillas so they will not be responsible for the possible
attacks, he hinted.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why this is being said in connection with UNIFIL.
We are a peacekeeping force, not a deterrent force." Goksel said.
</P>
<P>
He also added that UNIFIL still has no word on how the Israeli
army would withdraw from south Lebanon or how long the withdrawal
process would take.
</P>
<P>
"In order to be able to fill the vacuum that will be created by
the Israeli military withdrawal, we have first to know the size of
this withdrawal and where it will go," he was quoted as saying by
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"UNIFIL is a peacekeeping force. Any change in its role or its
location must be contingent on the Lebanese government's
agreement," the spokesman reiterated.
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 of Palestinian refugees, driven out of their
homeland during decades of Arab-Israeli conflicts, live in camps in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL was founded in 1978 after Israel launched a large-scale
invasion to Lebanon. The 4,500-strong UNIFIL's term is renewed
every six months by the Security Council.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is now
carefully studying suggestions from some sectors to limit the
number of non-working holidays observed in the country.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma of the Department of Labor and
Employment (DOLE) said Friday the suggestions stemmed from
concerns that too many holidays may adversely affect the
productivity of workers.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking into these suggestions. We want to look closely
at the productivity aspect and its implication on our workers,"
Laguesma said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE is also encouraging labor groups and employers to meet
halfway and work out an acceptable compromise on the matter, the
secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said limiting the number of holidays may contribute to
efforts to attract investments and generate job opportunities,
pointing out that the government wants to create enough employment
opportunities at home for Filipinos so that they need not seek
greener pastures abroad.

<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that it fully supports the plan of the rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) to prepare a comprehensive action plan for
the development of Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Aventajado, chairman of the Presidential Committee on
Flagship Programs and Projects, made the announcement during a
press conference at the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado was accompanied at the press conference by Saeed Ali
Daof, emissary extraordinary and plenipotentiary of MILF chief
Hashim Salamat.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada designated Aventajado as his personal
representative to discuss, assist and work with the Economic
Development Committee of the MILF in the development of their
plans and programs for Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
This includes the preparation of the action plan and
feasibility studies and the conversion of MILF camps into MILF
special economic zones but subject to the provisions of law.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado also pointed out that President Estrada believes
that the programs to develop the MILF-controlled areas will not
only enhance the confidence-building measures but will also
improve the lives and well-being of "our Muslim brothers and
sisters."

<P>
For his part, Daof stressed that the MILF action plan covers
specific development and livelihood projects which are supportive
of the government's flagship and other projects.

He said that MILF projects would serve as "realistic and
practical building mechanisms" not only for the people of Mindanao
but also for the Estrada administration and the MILF leadership as
well.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been fighting for an independent state in the
Muslim Mindanao during the past two decades.

including computers, semiconductors and automobiles, the three
major industrial sectors, with their production rising 18.1
percent.

The construction boom has also spread to the residential
housing construction from the public sector and consumer prices
rose 0.8 percent in the first quarter this year despite higher
international oil prices and school registration fees.

<P>
Meanwhile, the current-account balance showed a surplus of 1.11
billion U.S. dollars in January and February and the establishment
of the new venture firms numbered 3,480 in February alone.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Mayor Chats with Citizens on Hotline (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Xu Kuangdi, mayor of this east
China metropolis, today chatted with citizens on a hotline opened
by the Shanghai People's Broadcast Station.
</P>
<P>
The "Mayor and Citizens" hotline is famous here, and it even
attracted Bill Clinton to visit it when the US president toured in
China in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue began at 12:00 am. The anchor first asked Xu to
explain his government's work to the audience. But Xu said he was
more eager to listen to what the citizens had to say.
</P>
<P>
The first call was from a Mr. Dong, who works for a private
company. Xu, 63, was the deputy dean of the Shanghai Metallurgy
Department in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Dong suggested that conventional industries should merge with
the IT sector.
</P>
<P>
Xu answered that the two sectors are very important, but there
is one problem: China cannot feed its 1.2 billion people with
virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
The second call came from a woman who had lived in the poor
western region for several years. She held that Shanghai, as a
prosperous city, must do something to help the west.
</P>
<P>
"I made steel in the west for one year, so I agree with you,"
said Xu, a metallurgist.
</P>
<P>
Xu is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. He
was elected the mayor of Shanghai in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a number of questions, including unemployment,
pollution and social security, Xu answered promptly and honestly.
</P>
<P>
A blind man named Chen complained that the official procedures
are too complicated for him to apply for setting up a private
company.
</P>
<P>
Xu told his secretary to write down Mr. Chen's address and
telephone number, and promised that the government would create a
much simpler and more direct channel for disabled people to run
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue lasted for 50 minutes.

HANGZHOU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Austrian Federal Chamber of
Commerce is planning to set up more representative offices in
China, the Chamber's president Leopold Maderthaner said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We see great potential for cooperation with China, and we
should accelerate our efforts to seek cooperation opportunities,"
said Maderthaner, who is on his seventh visit to China.
</P>
<P>
He was leading an Austrian economic delegation to this capital
city of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
He said every time he comes to China he sees that great changes
have taken in the country.
</P>
<P>
Representing the interests of Austria's 300,000 enterprises,
the Austrian Federal Chamber of Commerce has established four
representative offices in China since 1994.
</P>
<P>
They are in Shanghai, Shenyang, Chongqing and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that more Austrian enterprises would
seize this great opportunity and invest in China.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, his chamber plans to send five more national
economic delegations to China this year, starting in May.
</P>
<P>
According to Maderthaner, 85 Austrian companies have set up
representative offices in China, and more than 90 Austrian
patented techologies have found Chinese cooperation partners.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese businesses have also increased cooperation
with their Austrian counterparts. The Austrian Federal Chamber of
Commerce received 42 visiting Chinese delegations last year.

<P>
XI'AN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Private businessmen from seven
municipalities and provinces including Beijing, Tianjin and
Shaanxi, issued a declaration here today that they will join hands
to develop China's vast and underdeveloped western region.
</P>
<P>
"The central government has made a correct decision to develop
the region, which has abundant natural resources and a huge market.
And we private companies have the funds, personnel and technology
to accomplish the development," the declaration says.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing trade fair here, with the theme of attracting

of agreements signed between private companies with companies from
the western region.
</P>
<P>
Prosperous Guangdong Province sent 500 companies to attend the
fair, among which 250 are private companies.
</P>
<P>
Experts hold that private companies are usually more
competitive than state-owned enterprises in many fields, and have
become a strong force promoting China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has 1.8 million private companies.

Global Poverty Reduction Unlikely to Achieve Summit Target,
UNDP Report
</P>
<P>
Many regions of the world are unlikely to reach this year's
poverty reduction target as set by the Social Summit of 1995, said
a United Nations Development Program (UNDP) report on world
poverty released here today.
</P>
<P>
The three indicators used by the UNDP to measure long-term
poverty, namely, adult illiteracy rates, child malnutrition rates,
and the percentage of people threatened with premature death, were
all supposed to be reduced by half between 1990 and 2000,
according to the 1995 Social Summit target.
</P>
<P>
But figures in the UNDP Poverty Report 2000 cast grave doubt on
these over-optimistic projections.
</P>
<P>
The illiteracy rate for people over 15 years of age in East
Asia and the Pacific Region dropped from 20 percent in 1990 to 16
percent in 1997, still a long way from the 10 percent target. In
South Asia, which had the highest adult illiteracy record of 54
percent in 1990, the figure had been reduced by only 5 percent by
1997.
</P>
<P>
UN Calls for Strategies to Reduce Global Poverty
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Poverty Report 2000 released here today
called for the adoption of a new global poverty-reducing strategy.
</P>
<P>
The strategy should feature more input of resources, and more
emphasis on reducing poverty. While ambitious global target has
been set, donor countries are reducing their aid and existing
poverty problems have not been given due attention.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that efficient management lacks links between
state-planned poverty-reducing work and the grassroots level.

MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The employment facilitation
programs pushed by the Philippine government in 1999 placed some
124,000 youths and handicapped persons in various jobs nationwide,
the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE-led employment programs grew by 8.8 percent in 1999

</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said in a report that 121,
300 of the beneficiaries were either students or dropouts, and 2,
700 were handicapped people.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma, however, noted in the report the small number of
handicapped people who benefit from the DOLE programs and stressed
the need to push the programs harder so they will reach more
disadvantaged people.

He directed DOLE offices to remind establishments that they are
entitled to tax breaks when they employ people with disabilities
under the country's law.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said the DOLE's efforts to facilitate the employment
of disadvantaged people nationwide as well as the employment of

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Own Advanced Nuclear Reactors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China will focus on developing
advanced nuclear reactors with its own intellectual property
rights rather than merely relying on foreign technologies,
according to Xu Guanhua, vice-minister of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the reactors must be Chinese-made, and safe
and economical.
</P>
<P>
China has built nuclear power plants in Zhejiang, Guangdong and
Jiangsu provinces, but the main technologies were imported from
foreign countries, including France and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony celebrating China's breakthrough in
producing some core nuclear technologies here today, Xu revealed
that China has the ability to develop its own advanced reactors,
and the government will invest more in this endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The new achievements include a helium gas circulator, a high-
temperature gas-cooled reactor, and a control rod diver system,
which all passed government examinations today.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor is of
particular significance, because only the United States, Germany
and Japan were previously able to produce such reactors.
</P>
<P>
China is building its first such reactor in the suburbs of
Beijing, with an investment of 250 million yuan (about 30 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Most of the key equipment of the reactor is made here.
</P>
<P>
Currently, coal accounts for 75 percent of China's energy
consumption, creating serious environmental problems. Xu said that
China will readjust its energy structure in the 21st century by
exploring new energy sources such as nuclear and hydroelectric
power.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yiren, vice-mayor of Shanghai, said that the city will
participate in international competition in the nuclear energy
field by offering products that meet international standards.

BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The China Yan'an Spirit Research
Society and "Modern Shaanxi" magazine have jointly held a forum
here to mark the 10th anniversary of President Jiang Zemin's
inscription reading "The Yan'an Spirit Will Shine For Ever".

<HEADLINE> War Hinders Angola's Tourism: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Angolan authorities of tourism
attributed here on Friday the actual tough situation of the
country's tourism to the troublesome civil conflicts between the
government troops and the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
According to Mario Justo, the Chief Supervisor of the Angolan
Hotel Department, the war is the main obstacle to tourism
development in the country, especially in the central highland
that includes the provinces of Huambo, Bie, Malange and parts of
Moxico.
</P>
<P>
Justo said that tourism in those areas has been seeing a
standstill since the recrudescence of the civil war in 1998, as
most of the main touristic areas are militarized.
</P>
<P>
"There is no tourism in Huambo because the great touristic
zones of the region are militarized", he said.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the Huambo province is famous for its
great scene of primitive parkland and the far flung thermal
regions.
</P>
<P>
He said the most famous touristic centers, thermal regions in
the districts of Lwama, Gove and Kuando dams as well as the "Ilhas
dos Amores (Love Islands)", have gone out of use due to the
political, military situation.

</P>
<P>
In the hinterlands of the vast west, disastrous sandstorms or
duststorms occur almost every year, experts said. However, in
recent years, they became more frequent and caused more property
and environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
Excessive grazing and logging have been the major culprits of
desertification of the grasslands and forests in China's north and
western regions.
</P>
<P>
One instance is the Horqin desert in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region. About 15 years ago, it was a vast stretch of
fertile grassland. Now, nothing is left but sand.
</P>
<P>
To improve the environment of the western region, it is
imperative to further prevent the deterioration of the environment.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating environment of the west not only impedes the
western economic and social development, but seriously undermines
the living conditions of the whole nation.

"We all have a duty to act up and do our bit for the
improvement of the country's ecology and environment," the article

<HEADLINE> "Taiwan Independence" Is Not Allowed: Army Daily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Army Daily today
published a signed article entitled "Taiwan Independence" in Any
Form Is Not Allowed, stressing that the future of Taiwan relies on
the complete reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
The change of leader in Taiwan region can by no means change
the fact that Taiwan is recognized internationally as inseparable
part of China.
</P>
<P>
Insisting that the One-China Principle is not a "topic" but a
premise for the cross-straits talks and negotiations, the article
reiterates the central government's positions of Taiwan being part
of China and China's sovereignty and territorial integrity being
inseparable.
</P>
<P>
According to the history of Taiwan, Taiwan has been a Chinese
territory since ancient times. The history of the Republic of
China came to an end when the People's Republic of China
government replaced it as the sole legal government and
representative in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
China's territory and sovereignty have remained intact; and the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits have never been two states. The
Taiwan issue can only be resolved on the basis of the One-China
Principle.
</P>
<P>
The bottom line of a peaceful resolution would be broken if the
One-China Principle is shaken, the article says.

<TEXT>
<P>
The One-China Principle is related to the state sovereignty and
to realize reunification of the motherland is both the starting-
point and end-result for cross-straits negotiations. The Chinese
government will never hold talks with those who are engaged in "
Taiwan independence".
</P>
<P>
When the leader of Taiwan was changed not long ago, leaders of
the mainland made it clear that if the One-China Principle is
recognized, Taiwan leader is welcome to come and talk on the
mainland or the mainland leaders could also visit and talk in
Taiwan. Talks can also be held between the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits of the mainland and the
Straits Exchange of Foundation of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
If the One-China Principle is denied, there will be no ground
for improving the cross-straits relations and holding political
negotiations across the straits and exchange of visits by leaders
of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The attitude towards the One-China Principle is an important
symbol for judging if a Taiwan leader is in favor of "Taiwan
independence" or really advocates peace across the straits and
gradual advancement towards the reunification, according to the
article.
</P>
<P>
It condemns Lee Teng-hui, who has ruled over Taiwan for 12
years, saying Lee's plots revealed his true nature as an advocate
of "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
The new leader of Taiwan is urged to think carefully, face the
reality, and do something practical for breaking the deadlock on
the cross-straits relations and improve and develop the cross-
straits relations.

The article warns that there is no way out for "Taiwan
independence". Over the past five decades, it says, the Chinese
government has exerted hard efforts to boost the cross-straits
relations and realize the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
For most of the years after 1949, the Taiwan authorities
adhered to the stance of one China and opposed the plotting of "
two Chinas" and "Taiwan independence," though it had never
recognized the People's Republic of China government's legal
status as the representative of China.
</P>
<P>
It indicates that Chinese living on the two banks of the
straits hold a consensus on this fundamental issue, the article
stresses.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's issuance of the principles of "
peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" has relaxed
tension across the Taiwan Straits and led to the increasingly
expansion of the cross-straits economic, trade and cultural
exchanges, it says.
</P>
<P>
During his 12 years in power, Lee Teng-hui has basically been
engaged in splittism and "Taiwan independence." The "two-state"
remarks Lee has made only hasten his demise from power.
</P>
<P>
Lee's defeat shows that whoever is engaged in "Taiwan
independence" and separatism will never come to any good.

<P>
The Taiwan issue has become even more urgent after the return
to the motherland of Hong Kong and Macao. The two banks of the
Taiwan Straits can not separate from each other for ever and the
Taiwan issue cannot remain unresolved indefinitely, according to
the article.
</P>
<P>
It is the common will of the entire Chinese people including
Taiwan compatriots to completely end the hostility across the
straits and realize the reunification of the motherland at an
early date, it says.
</P>
<P>
The article goes on to say that the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) defeated the Kuomintang (KMT) in the regional
elections of Taiwan, just because the DPP had lowered its tone of
"Taiwan independence" and promised to revise its party
constitution advocating "Taiwan independence".
</P>
<P>
The corruption and splitting of the KMT and Lee Teng-hui's
support of "Taiwan independence" are also factors contributing to
the KMT's loss of power.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan independence" is against the fundamental interests of
the Chinese people, the article says, emphasizing that "Taiwan
independence" means nothing but war. Whoever in power in Taiwan
must not be engaged in "Taiwan independence" and the Chinese
government and the Chinese people will never allow "Taiwan
independence" in any form.
</P>
<P>
Activities for "Taiwan independence" are also against
international legal norms. All the 161 foreign countries that have
diplomatic relations with China have recognized the One-China
Principle and promised to handle their relations with Taiwan
within the framework of one China.

The determination and capabilities of the Chinese government
and the Chinese people to halt any form of "Taiwan independence"
should not be underestimated, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has been making the most sincere efforts to seek
for peaceful reunification but has never promised to abandon the
use of force. The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) is a
great wall of steel guarding the country and shoulders the sacred
responsibilities of safeguarding state security and territorial
integrity and the unity of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In the process of resolving the Taiwan issue, the mainland will
try every possible means to realize a peaceful reunification, it
says.
</P>
<P>
"But we could be forced to adopt every possible, determined
measures to complete the great cause of the reunification of the
motherland, if any major events that lead to the separation of
Taiwan from China occur, if foreign forces invade Taiwan, and if
the Taiwan authorities have refused, indefinitely, to peacefully
resolve the Taiwan issue through negotiations," it says.
</P>
<P>
The PLA is completely determined, confident and capable of
safeguarding the state sovereignty and territorial integrity and
will by no means tolerate and sit by and watch the success of any
plots to split the motherland, the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
Both history and reality show that Taiwan's future relies on
the complete reunification of China, it says.
</P>
<P>
Throughout history, Taiwan's fate has been closely tied with
the ups and downs of the motherland. A unified and powerful
motherland is always the root of Taiwan, and Taiwan, when
separated with the motherland, would be reduced to the status of a
colony or a subordinate of big powers, the article concludes.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will seek greater
South-South cooperation at the summit of the Group of 77 to

STOCKHOLM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of people supporting
Denmark's entering the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
has reduced considerably compared with earlier this year,
according to two opinion polls published Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a poll conducted by the Greens Analyse Institut among the
984 people questioned on the issue, 46 percent expressed support
for the EMU entry, while 42 percent were against it and 10 percent
said they are undecided.
</P>
<P>
Another poll carried out by the Vilstrup Research showed that
37 percent of 1,500 people were for the EMU entry, while 34
percent were against it and 26 percent still undecided.
</P>
<P>
The two polls were taken between April 2 and 5.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls conducted earlier this year showed that
supporters for the EMU entry accounted for 54 percent and there
were only 34 percent against it.
</P>
<P>
Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen announced a month
ago that a referendum will be held on September 28 on the EMU
issue.
</P>
<P>
Denmark is one of the four European Union member states that
still stay out of the EMU. The other three are Great Britain,

The Elysee presidential palace did not give any details on the

Clark is due to be replaced by another U.S. general, Joseph W.

<P>
He will also hold talks with French Defense Minister Alain

A heavy security was imposed in Paris upon the arrival of Clark,
apparently because of the strong pro-Serb sentiment in France.

<HEADLINE> UK's National Health Service Plunging Deeper Into Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The National Health Service (NHS)
is facing a worsening of its financial crisis caused by a growing
number of patients complaining about ill-treatment, official
figures have confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Although the public was promised billions of pounds for new
hospitals, nurses and doctors, a latest report from the National
Audit Office shows that much of the cash will be spent instead in
the law courts.
</P>
<P>
The spiraling cost of clinical negligence cases could amount to
a total of 3.4 billion pounds (5.44 billion U.S. dollars) during
the past financial year if all incidents that occurred are
reported.
</P>
<P>
The cost for cases already dealt with increased by 600 million
pounds (960 million dollars) to 2.4 billion pounds (3.84 billion
dollars) but another 1 billion pounds (1.6 billion dollars) has
been allocated.
</P>
<P>
David Davis, Chairman of the House of Commons Committee of
public Accounts, said: "Funding successful claims for clinical
negligence means that there is less cash available to treat
patients."
</P>
<P>
The growing cost, partly due to patients' increased tendency to
sue over ill-treatment, will help to push the overall deficit of
the NHS from 18 million pounds (28.8 million dollars) to 200
million pounds (320 million dollars) next year, Davis added.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the National Audit Office also noted that the
growing financial difficulties of the NHS were mainly caused by
the record numbers of patients receiving treatment. However, he
added that under present conditions the deficit was "likely to
grow if anything."

<HEADLINE> France Suggests New Approach of Aiding Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- France has suggested a "new approach
" of providing financial aid to Russia by the West after summing
up the balance sheet of cooperation between Russia and the West
over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius and Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine made the proposal in a letter to the European Union
and other members of the Group of Eight most industrialized
nations after the election of Vladimir Putin as Russian president,
the daily Le Figaro reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers said that despite the dispute between the
West and Russia over Chechnya, the West should continue to provide
aid to Moscow in the long term, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to help Russia, but the problem is for what
and how?" the two ministers were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the West should be "more demanding" in
imposing the conditions for cooperation. "The legal and judicial
cooperation should make up the first priority," they said.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also said that the amount of the money which
was brought out of Russia by "the mafias and the oligarchy"
surpassed that of international aid sent in over the past 10 years.

<P>
TOKYO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- World champion Peter Gade
Christensen was upset by unseeded Roslin Hashim of Malaysia,
failing to make the last four in the Japan Open badminton
tournament here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hashin, who routed world silver medalist Fung Permadi of
Chinese Taipei and Sun Jun of China in the earlier stages,
continued his giant-killing run by beating defending champion
Christensen 16-17, 15-7, 17-14 in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Hashim was only ranked sixth in his country and 33rd in the
world, with a sole victory came in the Dutch Open in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals on Saturday, Hashim will take on third-
seeded Hendrawan of Indonesia, who ended Ahn Jae-Chang's seed-
killing run as the South Korean retired for an injury.
</P>
<P>
The other semi-final will be a re-match of the All-England semi-
finals between the eventual champion in Birmingham, Xia Xuanze of
China, and his compatriot Ji Xinpeng.
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Xia, who won the Dutch and German Opens last
season, defeated fifth-seeded compatriot Luo Yigang 15-10, 15-2 in
an all-Chinese affair, while Ji narrowly beat Marleve Mainaky of
Indonesia 17-15, 8-15, 15-10.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese to Own Private Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 7 (Xinhua)-- A training program for individual
pilots has attracted more than 200 applicants, including 25 women,
since the program started January in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Feng, manager of Shanghai Eastern Aviation Training Co.,
Ltd., said his company has just started to enroll trainees, adding
that he has full confidence in the future of private aviation in
the country as more and more Chinese can now afford to own a
private aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that two U.S-made Cessna-172 light planes, valued at
150,000 U.S. dollars each, will be used for the training.
</P>
<P>
The demanding training course consists of 80 hours of
theoretical lessons and 35 hours of flying. It will takes two
months at most to complete the entire training process and final
test, at a cost of about 80,000 yuan, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Qualified trainees will receive pilot's licenses from the
General Administration of Civil Aviation of China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the applicants include private entrepreneurs,
employees of foreign enterprises, and even a 17-year-old student.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 40 people in China with private pilot
licenses. The country began to approve such applications in August
1996.

<HEADLINE> China to Build 150,000 km of Roads in Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China will build highway roads with
a total length of 150,000 kilometers in the western part of China
over the next 10 years, Hu Xijie, vice-minister of Communications,
said today.
</P>
<P>
In twenty years, all villages in western China will have an
access to the national or regional highway networks, according to
the overall plan for infrastructure construction in western China.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, China is to build eight national trunk lines, most of
which are expressway roads. At present, construction is under way
on 4,600 km of roads in western China. Work on another 4,000 km
will start pretty soon, Hu said at a seminar on development of
western China which closed today in Xi'an, capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Western China comprises 10 provinces and autonomous regions.
The region has 56.8 percent of the country's territory and 23.1
percent of China's population. However, highway density of the
region only accounts for one fifth of China's eastern part.

<HEADLINE> Sandstorms Set Off Environmental Alarm (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Sandstorms that swept much of
northern and eastern China in the past weeks have set off alarm of
deteriorating ecology in the western areas, said China's most
authoritative news weekly "Outlook".
</P>
<P>
Over the past month, Beijing has been hit by six dust or sand
storms. The worst of the storms descended upon the city yesterday,
blotting out the sun and turning the sky dusty yellow.
</P>
<P>
The dusty winds of forces up to 7-8 originated from the
Mongolian Plateau reduced visibility and caused a major delay of
flights at Capital Airport.
</P>
<P>
"Sandstorms set off again the environmental alarm bells in
China's west," declared a signed article from the April 10 issue
of "Outlook magazine" which will hit newsstands tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
During the past few weeks, gusty winds from the northwest moved
through much of the country, blowing dust and sands into the
capital and even down to the east provinces of Anhui and Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the country's largest eastern industrial city,
experienced a rare muddy rain, which meteorologists blamed on
worsening ecological deterioration in the less developed northwest
region of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The nasty winds of dust and sands have again highlighted the
urgency of environmental protection in China's west".
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that over the past few decades,
desertification in the country has been deteriorating instead of
improving.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980s, China's desertified land expanded at an
average rate of 1,560 square kilometers a year. The figure rose to
2,100 square kilometers a year in the 1980s and to 2,460 square
kilometers in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Goldbach's Conjecture: Mission Impossible for Amateurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A scholar from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS) suggested today that amateurs stop trying to
crack the difficult mathematical enigma, Goldbach's Conjecture,
because it is far beyond their ability.
</P>
<P>
It needs not only a solid background of mathematical knowledge
and some super talent to solve the puzzle, but also study how
other scientists have tackle the problem, said Lu Zhujia, a
research professor with the Academy of Mathematics and Systems
Science attached to CAS.
</P>
<P>
An amateur mathematics researcher can hardly possess all the
qualities which are vital to crack the Goldbach's conjecture, Lu
added.
</P>
<P>
In March, a British publishing house, Faber, and an American
publishing house claimed that they will give one million US
dollars to the person who cracks Goldbach's Conjecture within two
years.
</P>
<P>
This has made the conjecture a hot issue among math experts
around the world and also among Chinese math lovers.
</P>
<P>
The conjecture was put forward by the Prussian mathematician
Christian Goldbach in 1742. It states that every even number
greater than 6 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
</P>
<P>
Supercomputers found the conjecture true for every even number
up to some very large figure but no abstract proof, a mathematical
sleight-of-hand is available to prove that the conjecture is true
for every number up to infinity.
</P>
<P>
Chinese mathematician Chen Jingrun proved that every even
number is the sum of one prime, plus a number that is the product
of two primes. And "it is the best result so far," according to
Alan Baker, a Cambridge University professor and Fields medalist
</P>
<P>
"It is unlikely that we will get any further without a big
breakthrough. Unfortunately there is no such big idea on the
horizon," the Times magazine quoted Baker as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that his academy has been receiving large groups of
letters and visits concerning the Goldbach's Conjecture during the
past month. But many amateurs just cannot avoid making simple
mistakes in their "solutions."
</P>
<P>
He said that CAS will no longer accept letters and visits
concerning Goldbach's conjecture because their is simply no time
to identify mistakes from amateurs' solutions.

<HEADLINE> Top Judge Criticizes Low Efficiency of Court Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China's top judge Xiao Yang today
criticized low efficiency in court hearings and the enforcement of
court rulings now widespread in many local courts across the
country.
</P>
<P>
"A considerable number of courts have been found to over delay
settlement of lawsuits and fail to enforce court rulings in time,"
Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court, told a
national tele-conference today.
</P>
<P>
"Such delays are also a reflection of judicial injustice, which
is detrimental to society." Xiao Yang warned heads of provincial
level higher people's courts, noting that "the long-existing
problem is commonplace in people's courts."
</P>
<P>
He was also severely critical of local courts for providing
unrealistic statistics to the SPC.
</P>
<P>
Statistics presented to the SPC have shown that courts in China
settle almost all lawsuits according to law. Xiao said some courts
do not accept lawsuits or just do not register them at the end of
the year to increase their ratio of lawsuit settlement.
</P>
<P>
The over delayed enforcement of court rulings is largely the
result of local protectionism, Xiao Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Xiao pledged that the SPC is considering new measures to solve
the problem of delays in case settlements and the enforcement of
court orders.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak instructed Thursday night
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky to order the workers in charge of
issuing passports back to work, so as not to prevent Israelis from
vacationing abroad during the Jewish Passover holidays.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions of civil service staffers in the past week, which
have stopped short of an outright strike, made it impossible for
Israelis who had left their passport arrangement for the last
minute to go abroad for the Passover.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, it was pressure from this irate group that finally
prompted the prime minister to act.
</P>
<P>
If such back-to-work orders are issued, they may also enable
thousands of tourists stranded at the borders to enter the country.
Those tourists, whose countries do not have diplomatic ties with
Israel, had come to Egypt or Jordan with the understanding that
they would receive Israeli visas at the border.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The police Thursday recommended closing the criminal
investigation of President Ezer Weizman on suspicions of bribery
and breach of trust in connection with funds he received from
French millionaire Edouard Saroussi.
</P>
<P>
All charges against Weizman, according to police recommendation,
should be dropped. The investigators said there is insufficient
evidence to support charges of bribe-taking and tax-evasion.
</P>
<P>
Although they found enough evidence to sustain an indictment
against the president on fraud and breach of trust, they cannot
press such charges because the statute of limitations has expired.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The opposition Likud legislator Yisrael Katz said Thursday
that if the president does not announce his resignation by the end
of the Knesset (parliament) break in Passover, he will continue the
impeachment procedures he launched when the investigation against
Weizman began.
</P>
<P>
According to the basic law on the presidency, the Knesset can
impeach a president for improper conduct.
</P>
<P>
To launch the impeachment process, at least 20 legislators must
submit a complaint to the Knesset House Committee. If 75 percent of
the committee's members vote in favor of the impeachment motion, it
is transferred to the Knesset plenum for a vote.
</P>
<P>
Support of no less than 90 legislators are needed in the 120-
member Knesset to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A large number of politicians from across the spectrum
suggested that Weizman, who had just be spared of criminal charges,
should step down.
</P>
<P>
One Israel whip Ophir Pines congratulated Weizman, but added
that while from a criminal point of view the president has been
cleared of wrongdoing, the public aspect of the police report is
serious and, without doubt, President Weizman would have difficulty
continuing his position.
</P>
<P>
Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said he was sure that
the president, who is citizen No.1, will take the right decisions
at the right time. He said he had confidence in the president's
judgement. Likud Knesset member Dan Naveh told Channel One
that Weizman symbolizes the state and the question cannot be
decided within a criminal aspect, but by moral and public values.
He thought the findings require the president to do a lot of soul
searching.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) left here Friday for home after winning major
Thai parties' commitment to developing friendly relationship with
China.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of all these parties who held talks with the delegation
promised that whichever party in Thailand assumes the reins of
government, it will always follow the policy of developing
friendly relationship with China, an informed source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the belief that the strengthening of party-to-
party relations between the two countries will help develop
bilateral ties in an all-around way, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Dai Bingguo, a member of the CPC Central
Committee and head of the International Liaison Department of the
CPC Central Committee, arrived here on Monday for a five-day visit
at the invitation of Surin Pitsuwan, a member of the Executive
Committee of the ruling Democrat Party and Thai foreign minister,
after visiting India and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
During the visit here, the delegation met Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, who is also Democrat leader, Surin Pitsuwan, deputy
Democrat leader Banyat Bantadtan, Chart Thai leader Banharn Silpa-
archa, Chart Pattana leader Korn Dabbaransi, opposition leader and
New Aspiration leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and deputy Thai Rak
Thai leader Pitak Intrawityanunt.

LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Thousands of people who go bankrupt through no fault of
their own will be allowed back into business after only six months
under new rules designed to encourage risk-takers.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The government believes it is close to resolving a row with
high-technology companies over national insurance charges on share
option schemes.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:

<P>

The Independent

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Uncontrolled Export of Scrap Iron Damages Romanian Metallurgy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The uncontrolled export of scrap
iron has greatly hurt Romania's metallurgy sector, which has been
declining in the last decade, the official Rompres news agency
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a crime" to destroy the stainless steel equipment in the
chemical and food industry and sell it for 60-70 U.S. dollars per
ton only to have the foreign partners sell it back to Romania in
the form of stainless steel for 400-500 dollars per ton, said
Aurel Radi, president of the Metarom National Trade-Union
Federation (MNTUF).
</P>
<P>
Although the Romanian iron and steel works are reporting
shortage of raw material, the scrap iron is still one of the major
items for export, with 750,000 tons annually, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Radi said that of the 24 ships in the country's only seaport of
Constanta that are loading, 14 ships are exporting scrap iron.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the MNTUF wrote a letter to Prime Minister
Mugur Isarescu to draw the government's attention to the country's
metallurgy industry.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Says British Economy on Track to Join Euro Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain could join the European
single currency "in the near future" because the economy has
already converged with those of the 11 countries in the euro-zone,
according to a newspaper report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Independent said officials in the House of
Commons (lower house of the parliament) have agreed to an
independent analysis which suggests that Britain might be able to
join the euro in the near future if it chooses to.
</P>
<P>
The unpublished report comes as the British government is under
growing pressure to make a firm statement of intent to join the
euro to bring down the overvalued pound, the Independent said.
</P>
<P>
"If the United Kingdom government decided in the near future to
recommend entry it could do so with a set of economic indicators
that, with the exception of the exchange rate, would almost
certainly pass any reasonable convergence assessment process," the
newspaper quoted the Commons report as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the report, compiled by the House of Commons Library,
admits the exchange rate remains "the issue" to be settled before
a possible entry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Individual housing loans in 1999
is quite small in size compared with the country's total
outstanding loans, experts said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, individual housing loans amounted to
126 billion yuan. Total outstanding loan stood at 9.4 trillion and
GDP at 8.2 trillion. The proportion of housing loan against total
loans was 1.5 percent, far lower than the general 30 percent in
other countries, "China Securities" said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from changing people's spending habits, better financial
services must be introduced to help increase housing loans,
according to Xie Jiajin, director of Housing and Real Estate
Department in the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
Xie called for simplified procedures in loan application and
introduction of insurance and guarantee policies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China today urged the United
States and Britain to cancel the "no-fly" zone in Iraq and stop
military actions against the country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese FM spokesman Sun Yuxi made the remarks when asked to
comment on the April 6 bombing by U.S. and British warplanes of
residential districts in Iraq's Al Basrah and other regions,
during which quite some civilians were injured.
</P>
<P>
"China is really concerned over the recent development in Iraq
and feels deeply uneasy for the civilian casualties caused by the
bombing," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China has consistently advocated and time and
again stated that Iraq's sovereignty, territorial integrity and
independence should be fully respected.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the "no-fly" zone goes against the
principles of the United Nations Charter and norms of
international relations, and the bombing is detrimental to the
efforts by the international community for resolving the Iraq
issue, the spokesman pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Italian Pilot Likely to Be Freed Without Trial: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- An Italian pilot detained by Jordan
on charges of violating its airspace could be released without
trial and get back his small, confiscated aircraft, the
semiofficial Jordan Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot, identified as Claudio Castagna, was detained for
questioning Wednesday after his plane was intercepted by two
Jordanian fighter planes and forced to land down at Azraq airport,
80 kilometers east of Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Information Saleh Qallab said whether to
allow him to leave the kingdom depends on the prosecutor`s
decision.
</P>
<P>
The pilot faced charges of violating Jordanian air space and
civil aviation laws, and his P68 plane was confiscated after
touching down.

The small, twin-engined plane, had shuttled between Amman and
Damascus on business missions before the incident. Chartered by
Italian businessman Nicola Grauso and other three international
activists to protest the crippling sanction against Iraq, the plane
deviated from its routine line on Monday after taking off from
Amman, and headed for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aviation officials said it re-entered Jordanian airspace on
Wednesday without permission, apparently from Iraq, and was forced
to land at 01:00 p.m. (1400 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The pilot and his passengers was demonstrating defiance of an
international ban on flights into Iraq, and they were given a hero`
s welcome by Iraqi officials after the plane touched down at an
airport in Baghdad on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot said he had flown his aircraft at a low altitude once
inside Iraq on Monday to avoid radar detection by U.S.-British
fighter planes, which were policing no-fly zones in Iraq imposed in
the wake of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials are further investigating the motives of the
pilot and his passengers for the dramatic mission in and out of
Iraq, the first of its kind since U.S. and British forces imposed
no-fly zones in the south and north of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Overcomes Political Hurdle for EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has overcome a political
hurdle in its European Union accession negotiations as it concluded
the talks on common and foreign security policy (CFSP) with the EU,
local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed in Brussels on Thursday to close the CFSP
chapter and three less problematic chapters: social and employment
policy, fisheries and company law, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the four chapters means Cyprus has provisionally
closed 15 of a total of 30 chapters. It also assuages the doubts
that the division of Cyprus could impede the island's accession
course.
</P>
<P>
The CFSP had been left open from a previous round after four EU
members -- Italy, Germany, Britain and France expressed concern
over the implications Cyprus' division could have on this chapter.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third in the wake
of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Thursday saw the opening of two new chapters: fiscal controls
and regional policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after his meetings Thursday in Brussels,
Cyprus' chief negotiator on EU accession George Vassiliou said he
was very pleased with the outcome of the meetings and in general
with the country's accession course.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged that things must be speeded up, especially in
matters relating to the value added tax (VAT) which Cyprus must
align with the EU rate.
</P>
<P>
At present, VAT in Cyprus stands at 8 percent and it should
intensify efforts to bring VAT to the minimum 15 percent the EU
requires of the applicants.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started substantive
accession negotiations with the EU in November 1998.

NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has ordered security agencies in the country to be alert to
prevent any terrorist attack like the August 1998 bombing from
reoccurring.
</P>
<P>
The security team should be vigilant, especially on
non-governmental organizations, which could be used as conduits to
bring in people to do harm to Kenya, he was quoted by Friday's
Daily Nation newspaper as saying.

Officially commencing the construction of the August 7 Memorial
Park on the former American embassy site on Thursday, the

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Underscores Support for Private Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa has underscored the importance to support private investors
with vision and commitment to enhance the country's economy, media
here reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an interactive meeting with chief executive officers
of private enterprises organized by Tanzanian Ministry of Trade
and Industries here on Thursday, the president said Tanzania is
very willing to work with people who are concerned about their
cash flows as they are about the nation's tax flows.
</P>
<P>
The rate of economic growth, the attained lowest inflation rate
in over 30 years and the increased government revenues so far are
insufficient to have an impact on poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
Four percent annual growth is only about half of the rate of
growth that could have an impact on poverty, Mkapa told the
meeting which he described as opportune for looking back upon his
four-and-half-year administration.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the economic reforms the country is undertaking
might be politically unsustainable if the measures taken could not
lead to a better life for the people.
</P>
<P>
"We want to work with good corporate citizens, contributing to
the welfare and social development of those communities in which
they operate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the nation to identify and encourage growth of
private investors and pave the way for them.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Customs Earns Over $120 Million in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Customs earned over 120
million U.S. dollars in 1999, said Director of the country's
Customhouse Mateus da Rosa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by official newspaper Jornal de Angola as saying
that 80 percent of this amount came from customs posts in the
capital city of Luanda, particularly the "February 4th"
International Airport, whose monthly earning is estimated at some
one million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although the head of the Customhouse did not mention the figure
in the previous year, local analysts said the Customs had seen a
hike in the earning.
</P>
<P>
According to Rosa, the increment of the earning is mainly due
to the program "Tolerance Zero" which was masterminded by the
customhouse in the past year with an aim to curb fraud and tax
evasion and to reinforce control over the administration of the
customhouse.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese medical expert said
that preventive measures of sanitary science can reduce the
occurrence of accidental injuries.
</P>

He Zhesheng, a researcher from the Zhejiang Provincial Academy
of Medical Science, said prevention and control of accidental
injuries is a systematic project involving departments and units
in the fields of sanitation, public security, industries,
consumption, culture and education, science and technology, sports,
social security, tourism, and trade unions and women organizations.
</P>
<P>
Research has found that all the aforementioned sectors have a
close relation with the occurrence of accidental injuries. He said
that the government should work out strategies, regulations and
measures for controlling accidental injuries, and make the public
aware to prevent such injuries from occurring.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that accidental injuries caused some 600,000
deaths annually and because of such injuries, 20 million people

<HEADLINE> Lottery Market Booms in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Just like the stock market had a
boom several year ago, lotteries have gained more and more
popularity with the Chinese people. It seems that everyone yields
to the temptation of the low input and high return game.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the Beijing Review, an English weekly
publication, quoted an official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs
as saying that many reasons could explain the growing trend of
lotteries in China, and among them people's ideas of doing
something for social welfare projects and chancing one's luck are
what counts.
</P>
<P>
The first welfare lottery ticket in China was sold in
Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei Province in north China, on
July 27, 1987.
</P>
<P>
Lotteries have gradually become a fun-making charity industry.
When Shanghai began to sell the lottery ticket entitled Stylish
Shanghai in 1998, the number of lottery buyers outstripped its
stock holders, encouraged by the first prize standing at as much
as 1 million yuan. Its 2,000 sales centers sold 300 million yuan
of lottery tickets for the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai Welfare Lottery Ticket Distribution
Center, winning the lottery would be a pleasant surprise to buyers,
and loss can be as a service to society.
</P>
<P>
In January 1999, the issuance of disaster-relief lottery
tickets swept across Beijing, with 70 million yuan worth of
tickets sold in one week.
</P>
<P>
Prizes of lotteries range from objects, such as a sedan car and
a color TV, to cash.
</P>
<P>
In addition to charity lottery, sports lottery release has
witnessed a growing trend over recent years. Beijing began to
issue sports lottery tickets in 1990. The Dongcheng District alone
issued 2.4 million yuan worth of tickets last year.
</P>
<P>
Chen Bojun, Deputy Director of the Beijing Dongcheng District
Sports Commission, said that the funds raised were devoted to the
building of sports facilities and constructions of stadiums.
</P>
<P>
The profits of the lottery industry are huge, observed industry
insiders. They have noticed that some departments issued lottery
tickets without the approval of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Experts are calling for the introduction of a law on lotteries
and they proposed to make lottery tickets a State or Government
monopoly, as many other countries with the successful lottery
industry do, to avoid unfair competition and issuance.

SHENZHEN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Shenzhen, Guangdong
Province in south China, might be the richest in China. Eighty
percent of their income comes from township businesses.
</P>
<P>
The per capita farmer's yearly income in Shenzhen averaged 8,
310 yuan last year, leading the way in Guangdong which has
witnessed rapid economic growth in China.
</P>

There are a total of 57,556 township firms in Shenzhen. They
earned 28 billion yuan worth of output value last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Shenzhen People Traveling Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua)-- Travel agencies have made money
through organizing trips abroad in Shenzhen, a leading economic
city north of Hong Kong last year.
</P>
<P>
The city's travel agencies made sales revenue of nearly 1.3
billion yuan, 1.23 billion yuan of which generated by taking local
tourists to Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand last year,
said the city's trade and development bureau.
</P>
<P>
The agencies engaging in overseas travel made a combined profit
of 33.82 billion yuan in 1999. Some 123,200 Shenzhen people
traveled overseas last year. Shenzhen travelers who traveled in
China numbered 600,000 people, less than previous years.
</P>
<P>
A bureau official attributed the boom of overseas travel to
lower costs than domestic trips. For instance, traveling six days
in Thailand costs only 2,380 HK dollars and five days in the
Republic of Korea costs 3,480 HK dollars. For Shenzhen people,
both are cheaper than traveling to Xi'an or Dalian.

<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Zhang Xiang has urged China's vast
western region to take advantage of special characteristics in
developing trade and economic cooperation with overseas countries.
</P>
<P>
The west should first of all take advantage of its special
industries and map out strategies encouraging exports, first
targeting increased added value for its export products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the west should map out medium- and long-term
policies to attract foreign investment, especially in the reform
of state-owned enterprises. The west also should endeavor to
create a better investment environment and try to make all state-
level economic and technological development zones a success.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted in particular that the west should take full
advantage of its ecological resources and strengthen the
construction of its ecological environment. Exports of
agricultural products and tourism can become two ways to promote
foreign trade and economic cooperation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Donation Vital to Blood Safety: Health Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China has to expand its team of
blood donors to ensure the supply of safe blood, according to
officials with the Ministry of Health (MOH).
</P>
<P>
"China still has a long way to go to guarantee blood safety
even though it has encouraged blood donation since the 1980s and
pushed forward the implementation through enforcing a national
blood donation law on October 1998," said Health Minister Zhang
Wenkang.
</P>
<P>
About three million people have voluntarily donated blood to
save thousands of lives since 1998, he told a seminar here today
to mark the World Health Day 2000, which is dedicated to the theme
of blood safety.
</P>
<P>
But the MOH officials admitted that clean and safe blood is far
from being enough, and safety problem in blood transfusion remains
serious due to illegal blood deals. Diseases transmitted through
blood transfusion such as hepatitis B and C, and AIDS, endanger
blood users' health.
</P>
<P>
Up to five percent of HIV infections worldwide are transmitted
through the transfusion of contaminated blood and blood products,
"and the proportion in China is much higher," said Shan Ouqi, an
MOH official who is in charge of blood management work.
</P>
<P>
China is estimated to have more than 500,000 HIV carriers.
Many Chinese still believe that giving blood is harmful to their
health.
</P>
<P>
Other obstacles preventing the spread of blood donation include
the lack of blood donation institutions and blood testing
facilities, and unnecessary use of blood during surgery, said Shan.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Export Values Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Figures released here Friday by
Statistics New Zealand show that New Zealand export values
recorded the strongest growth in the latest six-month period since
1992.
</P>
<P>
For the month of February this year, the provisional value of
New Zealand merchandise exports was 1.13 billion U.S. dollars
compared with 1.12 billion U.S. dollars for imports. It is rarely
seen that New Zealand trade balance for the month of February was
a surplus.
</P>
<P>
According to the government statistical department, the
provisional value of New Zealand merchandise exports for the year
from March 1999 to February 2000 was 12.1 billion U.S. dollars, up
eight percent from the previous year. This growth was assisted by
the low New Zealand dollar and strengthened commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
But the value of New Zealand merchandise imports rose by 16.4
percent over the same period to 13.77 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Australia, the United States and Japan continue to be New
Zealand's main export destinations. For the year from March 1999
to February 2000, the destinations contributing the most to the
annual growth in New Zealand exports were Australia, the United
States, Britain and the Republic of Korea.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Pablo Picasso's oil painting,
Verre et pichet (glass and pitcher) was unveiled at the Simpson
Grierson Season launched by the Auckland Art Gallery Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Television New Zealand, it is the first

Paris. It is placed alongside works by other artists who make
personal or political statements about the experience and cruelty
of war.
</P>
<P>
The Simpson Grierson Season, which showcases New Zealand's
finest art collection, runs from April until October 2000. The
works it displays span 700 years of European art as well as
drawing on art from the United States, Australia and New Zealand (
including works by Maori and Pacific artists).
</P>
<P>
The Picasso oil painting Verre et pichet was recently acquired

<HEADLINE> N.Z. Will Dump Monarch as Head of State: PM Clark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark said here Friday that it's inevitable that New Zealand
will eventually dump the monarch as head of state.
</P>
<P>
She made the statement when she was addressing the Building A
Constitution conference organized by Wellington-based Victoria
University's Institute of Policy Studies.
</P>
<P>
But, the prime minister noted that there is no public mood at
the moment for the country to become a republic, "nor is it
anywhere near the top of my priorities."
</P>
<P>
Clark said that when she was a child people still referred to
Britain as "home."
</P>
<P>
"Now, at age 50, I wonder what the association means to
teenagers, 20- and 30-year-olds. I suspect not too much," she said.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of New Zealanders now have no connections with
Britain. "Will not those new New Zealanders not pose the question
why we retain as head of state a monarch who resides 12,000 miles
away?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Clark had said that a decision to
drop the Queen as head of state and turn New Zealand into a
republic has to be driven by the public, not the government. "It
is inevitable, however, that as New Zealand society changes, the
country would change to a republic," she said.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Orders Stronger Protection for Overseas Filipinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- With the assistance of the
international community in stopping human trafficking, Philippine
President Joseph Estrada has ordered a far more aggressive effort
to protect the rights of Filipinos based abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said the president is
now batting for the prosecution of violators of overseas Filipinos
' rights.
</P>
<P>
"Before, our role in DFA was to protect. Now the president
wants us to prosecute those who violate our Filipino migrants'
rights," DFA Undersecretary Benjamin Domingo said Friday in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
According to Domingo, this will be made possible with the
Philippines' participation in a 21-nation network that monitors
human trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Domingo also expressed confidence that the DFA can do the job,
as new international laws allow a government to prosecute
violators of migrants' human rights, wherever they may be.
</P>
<P>
He said the protection to be provided by the government would
extend to some 2 million undocumented Filipinos overseas, many of
them believed to be abducted or forcibly moved.
</P>
<P>
Domingo said the president has already signed an executive
order mandating stronger protection for Filipinos overseas and
stepped-up efforts to stop the trafficking of Filipino women and
children.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations will also provide assistance in
stopping human trafficking and protecting the rights of migrant
workers.
</P>
<P>
Data from the government showed that there are about 7 million
Filipinos working abroad and they remitted more than 7 billion U.S.
dollars back home in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 hectares of
about-to-mature crops in the provinces of Matabeleland South,
Masvingo, Manicaland and Midlands of Zimbabwe have either been
completely swept away or flooded after the tropical cyclone Eline
hit the country a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
Crop production in the affected areas is expected to fall below
average, said the latest issue of the Southern African Development
Community food security bulletin released here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Current estimates put the total cost of flood damage to
infrastructure, crops, livestock and property in Zimbabwe at about
263 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains destroyed the little food stocks the rural
people had and affected 500,000 people, with 182,000 of them left
homeless.
</P>
<P>
Latest information indicates that as many as 100 people have
died in flood-related incidents. Most of the affected areas are
drought-prone where the food security situation is already of
concern at this time of the year.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Court Issues Warrant to Arrest Cult Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan court has issued a
warrant to arrest the leaders of the cult Movement for the
Restoration of Ten Commandments of God over charges of murder.
</P>
<P>
Buganda Road Court Chief Magistrate Andrew Bashaija said that
they must be brought to court to face the law on May 8, 2000, the
New Vision daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
State Prosecutor Michael Elubu applied for a warrant of arrest
follows an international one issued last month.
</P>
<P>
The cult founder Joseph Kibwetere and five others were held
responsible for murdering some 1,000 innocent followers in
Kanungu in southwestern Uganda and some other places used as
their residence or venue of activities.
</P>
<P>
On March 17, over 530 people were burnt to death in a church of
the cult in Kanungu and hundreds of bodies of murdered believers
were later exhumed from mass graves in other places. The cult
leaders, who are said to collect almost all the money belonging
to their believers, are still at large.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Alert Issued in Western Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government Thursday
night sent out a cholera alert in Nyanza and Western provinces,
both in western Kenya, after 24 people died of the disease in the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Friday quoted Ambrose
Moisore, Nyanza provincial health officer, as saying that at least
55 other patients had been admitted to hospitals by Thursday,
adding that about 250 others were treated and discharged in the
last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Pollution of Lake Victoria by industries and contamination of
local cities by direct raw sewage discharge can not rule out for
the outbreak of the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
He advised local residents to boil their drinking water and
ensure that cleanliness in food preparation and handling is
improved, saying if they see any signs of diarrhoea, they should
seek immediate medical attention.
</P>
<P>
Medics in hospitals and medical institutions in the two
provinces have been put on alert to deal with emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Cholera was last reported in Nyanza in 1997 when it claimed at
least 1, 000 lives. The epidemic also spread in Western and Rift
Valley provinces.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Ready for Stiff FTA Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian products are ready to face
competition under the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) Free Trade Area (FTA) because of improved quality
standards, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a recent study released by the Zambia
Investment Center (ZIC) here on Thursday as saying that the
international community exhibited a high appreciation of Zambian
products because of their high degree of standards.
</P>
<P>
"This in a way shows how competitive Zambian products are in
the region and how well prepared the country is in moving from
preferential trade area to a full trade area," said ZIC while
reviewing the participation of the Zambian private sector in the
recently held Cairo international Trade Fair in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Conference provided a good opportunity for attracting
foreign direct investment (FDI) as well as for enhancing trade in
the COMESA region, ZIC said.
</P>
<P>
According to ZIC, the response from over 20 private sector
companies which participated in the Cairo fair was overwhelming,
especially when they were able to establish international business
and sales contacts for their products.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Girls Launch Campaign Against Child Sexual Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Girl Child Network
Thursday launched a one-year campaign in Chitungwiza near Harare
to fight rising child sexual abuse in the country.
</P>
<P>
The organization, with a membership of 1,500 girls, seeks to
sensitize the public on the need to give girls the same
opportunities as boys.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to raise public awareness on the psychological
effects of rape and invite members of the public to suggest ways
of dealing with the vice.
</P>
<P>
The girls, through this campaign, will be lobbying for the
reviewing of policy and laws that deal with forced marriages,
polygamy, the age of majority and inheritance.
</P>
<P>
The initiative came in the wake of reports that sexual abuse is
on the increase in the country, with children as young as three
months being abused by relatives.
</P>
<P>
Girls are also said to be engaging in sexual relationships when
they are as young as eight years old, increasing the risk of
contracting sexually transmitted illnesses, including the deadly
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
According to Project Coordinator of the Girl Child Network
Betty Makoni, 30 of their members were sexually abused, 50
suffered attempted rape and most of them physically abused.
</P>
<P>
The 12-month campaign would be characterized by workshops, art
 competition, conferences and camping, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the idea was to enable girls to access information on
opportunities, HIV/AIDS and their rights through defined channels,
such as clubs in schools, colleges and within the community.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: DPRK, Japan Have Good Start for Normalization of Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Although the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Japan did not reach any agreement
here during the negotiations on April 5-7, the two countries have
made a good start toward normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the press statement released after the session
this morning, the talks were held in "a good environment," and "
the two sides have conducted sincere discussion on various issues
related to the realization of normalization of diplomatic
relations."
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also agreed to continue the talks for
the ties normalization and the next round of talks is expected to
open in late May in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
During the latest talks, Jong Thae-hwan, the DPRK's chief
negotiator, demanded Japan's apology and compensation for its
colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japanese side, headed by Kojiro Takano,
reiterated Tokyo's main concerns including the so-called "missile
threat" from the DPRK and the whereabouts of "missing citizens" of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Back in 1991, the DPRK and Japan began negotiations in
Pyongyang on the establishment of diplomatic ties, which ended
without any result after eight rounds of talks due to the wide gap
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations deteriorated in September, 1998, when
Japan imposed sanctions on the DPRK after the DPRK launched a man-
made satellite which Japan regarded as a missile test.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the two sides agreed to resume talks when a
Japanese delegation visited Pyongyang. Later, Japan lifted the
sanctions. All these have paved the way for the negotiations on
the normalization of relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Australia Leads Germany 2-0 in Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Davis Cup holder Australia took a
comfortable lead over Germany by winning both singles matches in
its quarter-final clash against Germany in Adelaide on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Teenager Lleyton Hewitt outclassed a nervous Michael Kohlmann 6-
1, 6-1, 6-2 in the opening singles before Wayne Arthurs overcame
David Prinosil 7-6, 3-6, 7-6, 6-7, 11-9 for a 2-0 lead for the
defending champion.
</P>
<P>
By winning one of the three remaining matches, Australia will
secure a home semifinal against either Brazil or Slovakia in July.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt, ranked 11th in the world, defeated his older opponent
in the opening match which lasted just 80 minutes as Kohlmann only
came to Australia as a hitting partner for his teammates and was
only ushered onto the grass court after Rainer Schuettler withdrew
with an injury on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Arthurs was pushed all the way by Prinosil, who is
ranked nine places ahead of him at 93rd in the world.
</P>
<P>
Arthurs, a replacement for injured Mark Philippoussis, won the
first and third sets in tiebreakers then held match point in the
fourth, but Prinosil survived and went on to win the tiebreaker to
force for a deciding fifth set.
</P>
<P>
The German saved two match points in the 14th and 16th games
before Arthurs broke him in the 20th game to seal victory after
four and a quarter hours.

KUNMING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China plans to apply for UNESCO's
World Natural Heritage listing for the arthropod fossil stratum
site located in Chengjiang county in southwest China's Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Chengjiang fossils, dating back some 500 million years,include
large quantities of tiny multicellular animals and their embryos,
which are said to be the earliest multicellular animals on Earth.
Their discovery has led to significant breakthroughs in attempts
to understand human evolution.
</P>
<P>
The first discovery was made in July 1984 by Hou Xianguang, a
research fellow with the Nanjing Institute of Geology and
Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences when he conducted
field investigations at Maotian Mountain in Chengjiang County, the
original discovery site.
</P>
<P>
To date, Hou has discovered more than 10,000 fossils in 17
speciations. The most important ones include Yunnan Zoon,
microdictyon, anomalocaris and fuxianhuia.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of Jan Bergstrom, an scholar from the Sweden Royal
Academy, Hou made a systematic and comprehensive research on
fossils found in Chengjiang and published 40-odd academic papers
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
"Chengjiang fossils are miracles in the evolution of organisms
in the formation of Earth. These fossils offer valuable research
on human evolution dating back to 530 million years ago," Hou said.

<HEADLINE> ITU Adopts Chinese IP Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 7 (Xinhua)-- A proposal regarding IP technology
put forward by a group of scientists at the Wuhan Posts and
Telecommunications Academy has been accepted by International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) as an international standard.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Yu Shaohua, who was responsible for the program, explained
that their IP standard, dubbed "IP over SDH (Synchronous Digital
Hierarchy)," successfully solved the problem of operating IP on
SDH optical cable so that telecommunications network and computer
networks can be combined, and with this new standard Internet
surfing will be much faster than now.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, the Chinese IP standard was first put forward
to ITU in July 1998, and was formally adopted as an international
standard for IP technology by ITU on March 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
The present commonly used IP standard is one developed by
American scientists. The adoption of the Chinese IP standard as
an international standard by ITU is of far-reaching significance
for the development of China's IT, said Dr. Yu Shaohua.

<HEADLINE> Chinese ISP Cuts Drastically Cut Internet Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- 263 capital Online, China's second
largest Internet access provider (ISP), said it will launch two
new Internet cards on April 8 which will reduce Internet fees
drastically.
</P>
<P>
The two cards will enable cardholders to surf the Internet and
cost 66 yuan and 99 yuan respectively. Prices could be further
reduced to 48 yuan and 78 yuan if the cardholders use the card for
more than one month.
</P>
<P>
The cheaper card, called "carefree card", allows buyers to surf
via the company's own server, and the other, "maneuvering card",
provides users free choices among other ISPs.
</P>
<P>
At present, such a service costs 158 yuan a month, which has
already dropped substantially from 198 yuan earlier this year.
Ordinary dial-up services charged six yuan per hour.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Internet users have long complained about high fees and
the time delays to access the Internet, but local analysts believe
the new round of fee cuts will attract a huge amount of customers.
</P>
<P>
Capital Online is a leading ISP which also engages in Internet
content provider (ICP) business. About three million people in
China surf the Net via the company's server, thanks to the
continued fee cuts by the company.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Daqing, general manager of the company, said 263 capital
Online is increasing equipment and facilities in preparation for a
huge inflow of surfer.

<HEADLINE> Global Poverty Reduction Unlikely to Achieve Summit Target, UNDP Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Many regions of the world are
unlikely to reach this year's poverty reduction target as set by
the Social Summit of 1995, said a United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) report on world poverty released here today.
</P>
<P>
The three indicators used by the UNDP to measure long-term
poverty, namely, adult illiteracy rates, child malnutrition rates,
and the percentage of people threatened with premature death, were
all supposed to be reduced by half between 1990 and 2000,
according to the 1995 Social Summit target.
</P>
<P>
But figures in the UNDP Poverty Report 2000 cast grave doubt on
these over-optimistic projections.
</P>
<P>
The illiteracy rate for people over 15 years of age in East
Asia and the Pacific Region dropped from 20 percent in 1990 to 16
in 1997, still a long way from the 10 percent target. In South
Asia, which had the highest adult illiteracy record of 54 percent
in 1990, the figure had been reduced by only 5 percent by 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Asia's percentage of children under five who are
underweight dwindled slightly from around 55 percent in 1985 to a
little less than 50 percent in 1995. Despite global improvement in
this respect, slight as it is, the child malnutrition rate in sub-
Saharan Africa had risen during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Progress in life expectancy has also been slow, the report
admits. The percentage of people not expected to survive to age 40
in the least developing countries declined by only 8 percent from
1988 to 1998. Many countries remain far from reaching an average
life expectancy of only 60 years, the Social Summit target for
2000, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> UN Poverty Report 2000 Released in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Poverty Report
2000 released here today said that China has achieved remarkable
successes in reducing abject poverty since the start of major
economic reforms in 1978, providing many lessons for countries
with less developed programs.
</P>
<P>
China's official estimates of poverty show an extraordinary
drop from 260 million poor in 1978 to 42 million in 1998, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 China launched an ambitious project to eradicate abject
poverty of the country's remaining 80 million population by the
end of 2000, the report said, and today China's two-billion-U.S-
dollar annual program is concentrated in 592 nationally designated
poor counties.
</P>
<P>
The report attributes China's success in this regard to its
rapid economic growth, as infrastructure programs have stimulated
the economy in poor counties.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that the Chinese government has increased
allocations to micro-finance operations, which is a good sign.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggests that China put more resources into
basic education and health care and nutrition in poor regions.
</P>
<P>
Attention must be given to the recent rise of urban poverty and
new initiatives should be launched in this area, according to the
report.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for Strategies to Reduce Global Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Poverty Report
2000 released here today called for the adoption of a new global
poverty-reducing strategy.
</P>
<P>
The strategy should feature more input of resources, and more
emphasis on reducing poverty. While ambitious global target has
been set, donor countries are reducing their aid and existing
poverty problems have not been given due attention.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that efficient management lacks links between
state-planned poverty-reducing work and the grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the UNDP will focus on improving the
quality of poverty-reducing programs such as assisting countries
in improving their decision policies and concentrating assistance
to the numerous micro-finance programs.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Progress in Poverty Reduction Blamed on Poor Governance, Strategy, UNDP Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua)-- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP)'s Poverty Report 2000, released here today,
attributes the lack of progress in world poverty-relief efforts to
ineffective government intervention and poor planning.
</P>
<P>
More than three-quarters of the world's countries have poverty
estimates, and over two-thirds have poverty-reduction plans, but
those who have set substantial poverty-reduction or elimination
targets constitute less than one-third, the report notes.
</P>
<P>
Another serious shortfall is the fact that many countries have
failed to include the poverty issue in their state development
strategies. Moreover, many national programs do not have a solid
management structure, and the responsibility for reducing poverty
is simply handed down to a ministry of social affairs, which often
does not have a say over the coordination of other governmental
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Responsive and accountable institutions of governance are
often missing the link between anti-poverty efforts and poverty
reduction," the report points out, saying that reforms of relevant
government institutions should be carried out concurrently in
order to make these plans work.
</P>
<P>
The report also emphasizes the often-ignored role of local
governments and communities in helping implement national anti-
poverty campaigns, suggesting that the central government should
help local governments establish their authority and capacity in
dealing with poverty, and form partnerships with non-governmental
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Computer Network Readingrooms to be Set Up Across China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The National Library of China will
establish computer network readingrooms across the country, a
development expected to extend the library into every corner of
China.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiaobai, director of the library's information network
department, said the Network Readingroom Digital Library Project
has formerly begun, and that a single computer in the fiber
distributed data interface (FDDI) can constitute a large library.
</P>
<P>
Forty million pages containing tens of thousands of books held
by the National Library of China will be able to be read without
limits of space or time.
</P>
<P>
The abundantly rich information in the library will be
transmitted by cable TV Wide Band provided by the State
Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) at speeds
much faster than through than Internet.
</P>
<P>
A successful experiment has been carried out in Jinan in
eastern China's Shandong Province, said the director.
</P>
<P>
Four provinces and municipalities including Beijing, Tianjin,
Hebei, and Henan have finished FDDI installation, and altogether
15 provinces and municipalities will have these network
readingrooms by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a key scientific research project, the Network
Readingroom Digital Library will be jointly hosted by National
Library of China and SARFT, and this cooperation is a perfect
marriage of information source and computer network.
</P>
<P>
The National Library is the largest Chinese information source
in the world, while SARFT is engaged in the cable TV networking
system with 80 million users, and SARFT's wide band provides an
information highway for the library.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1909, the National Library of China stores 20
million volumes and hosts 1.5 million readers every year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Open Tobacco Auction Floors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco auction floors,
a main tobacco market in the world, are scheduled to open on April
26 amid threats by farmers to withhold the crop until the
Zimbabwean dollar devalues further, The Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted General Manager of the Tobacco Industry
Marketing Board Stanley Mutepfa as saying on Thursday that the
opening would be on April 26.
</P>
<P>
There has been growing uncertainty surrounding the opening of
the floors,
</P>
<P>
with farmers indicating that they want the floors to open on May
3, expecting that the Zimbabwean dollar would have devalued by
then.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the rate of the U.S. dollar to the Zimbabwean
dollar is one to 38. Farmers expect the rate to increase to one to
45 or even one to 78.
</P>
<P>
"If the exchange rate is favorable, then farmers would sell
their crop," said Director of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association
Market Information Pat Davis. "In fact, farmers will be under a
lot of pressure to sell to off-set their debts."
</P>
<P>
Farmers are expected to sell 220 million kilograms of tobacco
this year, well above last season's 196 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the country's biggest foreign currency earner.

<HEADLINE> Southern African States Urged to Fight Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Southern African governments have
been urged to reduce the crime rate in the region in order to
attract potential investors, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Robert Okello, director of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa, said at a press briefing in Lusaka on
Thursday that most of the countries in the Southern African region
are facing high rates in crime which affect investment.
</P>
<P>
"Governments should embark on ways on how to tackle high rates
of crime and then determine the solutions. The crime rate in the
region has been going up every year and it is having a negative
impact in many countries, hence we should fight it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said potential investors in Southern African countries are
being discouraged from investing because of general insecurity.
</P>
<P>
"Governments should not only condemn high rates of crime as
people need to survive for them to live," he said, suggesting that
"employment systems should be revisited as a way of dealing with
reduction of high crime rates."

<HEADLINE> China to Auction Off Part of Its Cotton Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China plans to auctioned off part
of its cotton reserves this month to improve cotton supply and
demand and stop price hikes.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the All China Federation of Supply and Marketing
Cooperatives (ACFSMC) said all legal textile and cotton
enterprises will be eligible to take part in the public bidding.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of cotton reserves will be sold on April 10,
said an ACFSMC source.
</P>
<P>
Prices of first-grade cotton went up from 8,800 per ton earlier
this year to the present 12,000 yuan per ton. Experts attributed
the price hike to decreased cotton production in 1999 and an
increasing consumption demand at present.
</P>
<P>
"However, the price surge doesn't mean China's cotton resources
is in shortage. It merely indicates that there is a gap between
last year's cotton output and this year's consumption demand, "
said an official with ACFSMC.
</P>
<P>
The cotton consumption for 2000 is estimated at 76 million dan
(one dan equals to 50 kilograms). There might be a temporary gap
between demand and supply, the official noted.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, Japan End Talks Without Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and Japan ended talks in Pyongyang Friday without
any agreement but that they will meet again in Tokyo in late May.
</P>
<P>
The talks, aimed at normalizing diplomatic relations between
the two countries, were started on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued on Friday said the two sides
reconfirmed the need to continue the talks and agreed to resume
them in Tokyo in late May.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides, basing themselves on the understanding of the
need to improve and develop the DPRK-Japan relations, had sincere
discussions on all the matters related to the establishment of
diplomatic ties between the two countries, including a matter
related to how Japan will liquidate its past," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
In this round of talks, Pyongyang demanded a formal apology and
compensation from Japan over the atrocities inflicted on the
Korean people during Japan's occupation. Pyongyang also asked the
return of cultural treasures and the improvement of the legal
status of Korean nationals living in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The apology must be made by the head of the Japanese government
before the establishment of diplomatic relations, said Jong Thae
Hwa, who heads the DPRK delegation, at a press conference on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We must address the problems of the past as the top priority
or else we see no reasonable grounds for continuing the talks and
we will seek other ways."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and Japan began their normalization talks in the late
1980s. Eight rounds of talks had been held before they were
suspended in 1992.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. gasoline prices should peak this month and

the Energy Department said Thursday.

The latest analysis by the Energy Department's Energy

oil production, gasoline prices were expected to soar to a

<HEADLINE> Newly Elected Japanese Premier Vows Efforts For "Rebirth of Japan" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Newly elected Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori Friday pledged to achieve a "rebirth of
Japan" through such steps as economic recovery and educational
reform.
</P>
<P>
Mori, who took over Japan's premiership from stricken Keizo
Obuchi on Wednesday, said in his first policy speech to the Diet
or parliament that he plans to stay his predecessor's course.
</P>
<P>
"I will take over the policies of the former prime minister and
try to develop them further," Mori noted.
</P>
<P>
Mori said the policies he will maintain include Obuchi's
efforts to stir a genuine rebound in the economy and carry out
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
"I will do my best to steer the economy onto a path toward real
recovery by enabling a smooth transfer from public demand to
private demand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mori, a former education minister, said he shared Obuchi's
determination to reform the country's education system, adding
that he will have a newly launched panel draw up an interim report
around summer to promote the drive.
</P>
<P>
On Japan's foreign policy, Mori said he will continue efforts
to "ensure peace in Asia, especially Northeast Asia, based on
relations between Japan and the United States."
</P>
<P>
Mori, who is scheduled to meet Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin later in the month, said Japan's policy of boosting ties
with Russia and concluding a peace treaty with the country has not
changed with the change of cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Mori also pledged to do all he can to ensure that July's summit
of the Group of Eight (G-8) major nations in Okinawa will be a
success.
</P>
<P>
Mori was sworn in as Japan's 55th prime minister late Wednesday
to take over from Obuchi, who remains in a coma after suffering a
stroke Sunday. Mori reappointed all of Obuchi's cabinet ministers
to ensure stability and continuity in government policy.

<P>
The Chinese Government underscored its intention to implement
its WTO obligations earnestly after its accession to the WTO and
stressed its commitment to develop a legal regime and
administrative procedures that are in conformity with WTO
requirements. Both sides believe that China's accession to the WTO
will contribute not only to their own trade and economic
development but also to the development of the world trading
system.
</P>
<P>
Considering the requirements of China's accession to the WTO
and the need for closer cooperation in this regard, China and the
United States agreed to establish a cooperative program involving
technical assistance and a comparative law dialogue. The United
States agreed to provide technical assistance, including WTO-
related materials, training programs, and exchanges of government
and private legal experts on the operation of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The comparative law dialogue would include an exchange of ideas
concerning commercial laws and regulations in both countries and
compliance with WTO obligations, including requirements related to
transparency, due process, and judicial review. This dialogue
would be conducted on an equal and mutually beneficial basis and
would promote bilateral trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The two sides noted that China's accession to the WTO would
provide significant economic advantages to China and the United
States and open new opportunities for Chinese and U.S. enterprises
and workers. The United States recognized the many market-based
reforms, including legal reforms, that China has already
undertaken. These reforms and the market opening steps to be taken
by China will create significant export opportunities for American
businesses, farmers, and workers.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Rebels Involved in Trafficking Human Cargo: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been involved in a
massive racket in trafficking human cargo, said an official report
published here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's law enforcement authorities have uncovered that the
head of the LTTE finance division, R. Visendrarajan and his family
had sent 17,000 people abroad to 11 countries last year alone and
charged enormous fees on forged passports, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Most of these people who had been smuggled abroad are
reportedly languishing in detention camps in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have revealed that they have earned 25,000
million rupees (340 million U.S. dollars) last year from the
illegal operation assisted by six companies owned by Visendrarajan.
</P>
<P>
Visendrarajan also owns two shipping companies with six ships
used for gun running and shipment of armaments for the LTTE. Two
of Visendrarajan's abettors Wahid and Illiyas were allegedly
arrested last week.
</P>
<P>
They had also allegedly defrauded the department of Inland
Revenue to the tune of 22 million rupees (299,320 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"This operation is considered one of the LTTE's major fund
raising devises for its ongoing war with Sri Lankan government
troops," the report said
</P>
<P>
The war has induced several Sri Lankans to seek refuge abroad,
mainly for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
It has been recently uncovered that the LTTE, which has been
fighting the war since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the
country, is one of the largest ship owners in the world and its
ships are used for several illegal purposes, including gun running,
drug smuggling and trafficking in human cargo.

<HEADLINE> Mynamar Govt Urges Opposition to Act Constructively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar military government
Thursday urged the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD)
to act in a more responsible and constructive manner without
adding hardship to the country while it is working to develop
Myanmar and rejoin the world community.
</P>
<P>
The government charged in a statement available here Friday
that the NLD as well as some foreign governments are in favor of
using the method of confrontation in dealing with the State Peace
and Development Council (SPDC), the military's ruling body, saying
that the SPDC is merely a caretaker or transitional government.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the SPDC has discarded the one-party
socialist system for a multi-party democratic system and has also
introduced a market economy, enabling Myanmar, a war-torn country
not too long ago, to become one of the most peaceful and stable
countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
The government has, in fact, kept and is still keeping the
doors open for those who desire to cooperate with it for the
development of Myanmar, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the NLD to avoid all actions that are
detrimental to the interests of the nation and its people. It also
encouraged the opposition party to try to achieve its political
goal and the nation's goal of transforming Myanmar into a stable
and multi-party democracy with a thriving economy through shared
responsibility and cooperation but not confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to say that the Myanmar government,
together with many other developing and developed countries, share
the concept that for the third world countries, the most important
rights for the mass population are the basic human needs, without
fulfillment of which, it added, it is absolutely not possible to
achieve sustainable development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that the development of the people of
those developing countries should not be hampered in anyway by
having the U.N Charter being manipulated and exploited as a tool
and leverage.
</P>
<P>
The statement welcome constructive advice as well as criticism
without ill-intention.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NLD blamed in a recent statement that the
government is still refusing to implement the result of the 1990
multi-party general election, in which the NLD won 396
parliamentary seats out of 485.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the statement said, the government applies
various means to stop and disturb all efforts aimed at demanding
the emergence of the people's parliament. As a result, the country
continues to be in the crisis in the fields of politics, economy,
education, social and international affairs, it added.
</P>
<P>
The NLD's statement warned that the only way out to tackle
Myanmar's present overall crisis is to follow the people's desire
and transfer back the state power to the people's representatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of angry protesters
Friday stormed a tree-planting ceremony attended by Prime Minister
John Howard in the Blue Mountains west Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, wielding banners and screaming chants against
racism, shouted "Justice Yes, Racism No" and "Mandatory
Sentencing Has to Go."
</P>
<P>
Police were forced to form a barricade to prevent the
protesters getting close to the ceremony. A protester was
arrested whilst trying to force his way through the police
barricade.
</P>
<P>
The protest followed Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron's
denial of the existence of the stolen generation contained in his
April 2 report to the senate.
</P>
<P>
About 100 years ago, "half-caste" children were separated
forcibly by the then missionaries and government agents to
assimilate them and those "full-blood" aboriginals were left to
die out. The separated children are the so-called "stolen
generation."
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard Thursday apologized to
the aborigines hurt by the government's denial that the stolen
generation existed.

production lines in May, bringing its total number of production
lines to six.
</P>
<P>
The expansion also including 32,000 square-meter workshops,
scheduled to be operational in July 2001, will cost 45 million U.S.

including the Shanghai Posts and Telecommunications Equipment
Company, and the U.S. Lucent Technologies Optical Networking Group,
has made profits for the past 11 years running.

<HEADLINE> Rural Province Leads China in Tax-for-Fees Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's province of Anhui is
expected to become once again the pacesetter in the country's
rural reforms. This time, it will be the reform of tax-for-fees.
</P>
<P>
The province has been selected by the central authorities this
year for a tax-for-fees reform on a trial basis, according to the
country's most authoritative news weekly "Outlook".
</P>
<P>
The April 10 issue of the magazine said that the reform has
already been kicked off in the province, where majority of its
population live in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the timetable put forward by the provincial
government, all the preparatory work will be finished by the end
of May, and new taxes will be levied from June.
</P>
<P>
"This will be another major reform step for rural China since
the founding of New China, following the land reform and
implementation of a family-based farming system," the magazine
said.
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, it was also the province of Anhui that took
the lead in establishing a family-based farming system against the
backdrop of rigid ideology and the prevalence of the People's
Communes.
</P>
<P>
Under the preliminary measures of reform, fees and charges
levied by township and village administrations, such as the fees
for pig slaughtering and education, will all be abolished.
</P>
<P>
And the agricultural tax will be readjusted according to new
measurement of the present family-contracted farming land.
</P>
<P>
Like the family-based farming system established 20 years ago,
the tax-for-fees reform is expected to start a new round of
changes in rural China, experts claimed.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Protests Council of Europe's Intervention in Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine protested on Thursday against
the Council of Europe's attempt to postpone its planned referendum,
scheduled for April 16, denouncing it as unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Europe, a Europe-wide consultative assembly on
human rights and democracy issues, passed a resolution on Tuesday
demanding that Ukraine should put off the referendum until a new
law on referendums has been passed, and threatening to suspend
Ukraine's membership of the organization if President Leonid
Kuchma does not back down.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that the
resolution does not reflect the true reality of Ukraine,
criticizing it as "a contempt of the Ukrainian people,
constitution and legislation," and an intrusion of the ruling by
the country's constitutional court.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that no international organizations are entitled to
restrict the Ukrainian people's rights and freedom that the
country's constitution gives them to participate in the management
of national affairs.
</P>
<P>
It noted that holding referendums is "an important stage of
developing and improving democracy" in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Council of Europe's threat, Kuchma pledged on
Thursday to press ahead with a modified referendum after the
constitutional court ruled that two of the six questions were
illegal.
</P>
<P>
Voters will now be called on to vote on the four remaining
questions, which are the dissolution of parliament if it fails to
produce a governing majority within a month, the abolition of
parliamentary immunity, the reduction of the number of deputies
from 450 to 300, and the creation of an upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the statement said that as a member of the Council
of Europe, Ukraine will continue its effective cooperation with
the 41-nation organization, although the council's "proposal is
not constructive."

<HEADLINE> Israel Says Permanent Peace Accord With Palestine Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Justice Minister Yossi
Beilin said here Thursday that it is possible for Israel and its
arch rival Palestine to conclude negotiations and reach a
permanent peace agreement by September 13 as stipulated by an
earlier peace accord.
</P>
<P>
On his visit to Portugal, which holds the European Union's
rotating presidency, Beilin told reporters that Israel and
Palestine have yet to settle a number of thorny issues through
negotiations, but these stumbling blocks are not insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El-sheikh Memorandum signed in 1999, Israel and
Palestine should reach a framework agreement on the final status
of Palestine by February 13 this year and sign a permanent peace
accord by September 13. But the two sides failed to meet the
February 13 deadline and agreed to set the end of May as the new
date.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister, who arrived here Thursday morning for a
one-day visit, also expressed regret at the break-down of Israeli-
Syrian peace talks. Israel and Syria suspended talks in January
after failing to eliminate differences on Israeli troop withdrawal
from the occupied Golan Heights in southwest Syria.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Beilin met Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres and briefed him on the latest developments of the
Mid-east peace process.
</P>
<P>
Beilin also held talks with his Portuguese counterpart, Antonio
Costa, on developing cooperation between Israel and the EU in the
judicial field, and on strengthening exchange and cooperation
between the judicial sectors of Israel and Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Tung Asks U.S. Congress to Pass PNTR for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),
Thursday expressed his hope that the U.S. Congress will pass the
legislation for China's permanent normal trade relations (PNTR)
status.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly hope the House (of Representatives) will come to
the right decision," Tung told reporters at the lawn outside the
Capitol Hill building after meeting 7 senators and 16 congressmen.
</P>
<P>
The House will vote on the legislation in the week of May 22.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Tung briefed the legislators about the
development in Hong Kong after China resumed the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of my visit is really to be able to tell our
friends on Capitol Hill how well in the last two and half years '
one country, two systems' is being successfully implemented and
how well Hong Kong has recovered from the impact of the financial
turmoil," said Tung.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the main purpose of his visit is to explain to
senators and congressmen the importance of the PNTR legislation.
</P>
<P>
"It is of course very important to Hong Kong that the
legislation is passed, it's important to China. But it is very
important to the United States of America too."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has annually decided after a debate to resume
the normal trade relations with China. The Clinton administration
agreed to grant PNTR to China when the two countries signed an
agreement last year on China's accession to the World Trade
Organization. The White House decision needs Congress approval.
</P>
<P>
Tung arrived in Washington early Thursday from New York and is
expected to have a private meeting with President Bill Clinton and
other senior U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
This is Tung's second visit to the United States since he was
elected chief executive of the HKSAR.

<HEADLINE> China to Televise Siberian Tigresses Giving Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A Siberian tiger park in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province has decided to televise live the
birth of tiger cubs, park officials announced.
</P>
<P>
The Heilongjiang Siberian Tiger Park has invested over 800,000
yuan (about 96,380 U.S. dollars) to install more than 30 micro-
cameras in dens of expectant tigresses so as to televise the
process of the delivery of their cubs.
</P>
<P>
The move is to help visitors learn more about the rare animals
and to raise people's awareness of the importance of saving them
from extinction, Zhang Chengzhong, director of the park's general
managing office, said.
</P>
<P>
Siberian tiger mothers are vulnerable to difficult labor if
bothered by outside elements, especially people, when giving birth.
</P>
<P>
But people watching the process through television will cause
no harm to them, he noted, adding that every year four to five
tigresses give births to cubs in the park.
</P>
<P>
The park, which has over 60 Siberian tigers in captivity, is
the country's largest feline animal breeding center. It receives
about 200,000 Chinese and overseas visitors every year.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there are now fewer than 300 wild Siberian
tigers in the world. China has about 10 such tigers living in the
wild.

<P>
CHANGSHA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The first test-tube baby born
from a fast-frozen embryo in China is reported to be healthy in
the Human Reproduction Institute under the Hunan Medical
University in the capital of Hunan Province in central China.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, test-tube babies in China were all born from
embryos that used the slow-freezing method. The institute
established the first test-tube embryo bank in China in 1990,
which has started to use the new technique.
</P>
<P>
The fast-freezing technique is a new invention by the institute.
It involves simpler procedures and equipment, according to experts
here.
</P>
<P>
The first fast-frozen test-tube embryo was transplanted to a
woman's womb in 1998. However, she suffered an abortion. She
received the second test-tube baby operation in July last year,
and gave birth in March.
</P>
<P>
The birth of the boy has laid a foundation for the upgrading of
embryo freezing technology in China, said doctors at the institute.

<P>
LHASA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Pager users in this capital of
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region now can read e-mail with
their pagers, following the opening of the website: http://pec.263.
net.
</P>
<P>
The online pager service was introduced to Lhasa by the Tibetan
Youxun Paging Station.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet users in Tibet has surged from 300 at
the end of 1999 to the present 1,500, providing a basis for the
opening of the online pager service which transforms e-mail into
wireless signals that can be received by pagers. Users can enjoy
this service by applying to paging stations for e-mail boxes.
</P>
<P>
Online pagers, originally developed in the United States, were
introduced to China by Internet service providers and paging
stations a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
Online paging brings a new opportunity for the development of
Chinese paging stations, which have been competing with mobile
telephone services.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the country has 1,763 paging stations now,
with the number of pager users totaling 72.68 million.
</P>
<P>
Now, 50 paging stations in 21 Chinese cities including Beijing,
Shanghai, Xi'an, and Harbin, offer online paging service.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Launch Provider Upbeat About Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- After successfully putting more
than 20 commercial satellites in orbit, China is considered a
launch provider with competitive ability, said Zhang Xinxia,
president of the China Great Wall Industrial Corp (CGWIC).
</P>
<P>
Exactly 10 years ago, China cautiously launched its first
international commercial satellite-Hughes Corp's Asiast I,
according to a China Daily report today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's firm is the nation's only company authorized to provide
commercial launch service and work with foreign aerospace firms.
</P>
<P>
"Following its first success in 1990, China has carried out 24
commercial launches for overseas customers, placing 26 foreign-
manufactured satellites in space," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Satellites sent into orbit by CGWIC's Long March series of
rockets, 60 percent of which are commercial launches, service more
than 100 countries and are able to provide satellite
communications for three quarters of the world's population, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
To compete with international launch providers, China has
improved its carrier-rocket technology and increased the launch
capacity of its rockets.
</P>
<P>
The Long March rockets are now capable of carrying 5.3 tons of
payload into geostationary transfer orbit and 9.2 tons of payload
into low earth orbit, which means China is well able to send all
kinds of satellites into space.
</P>
<P>
China has grabbed 7 to 9 percent of the world's commercial
satellite launch market, said the president.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges that China's aerospace industry suffered a
major setback in February 1996 with the unsuccessful maiden flight
of the Long March 3B. But the 18 following consecutive successful
launches have bolstered international confidence in the
reliability of the Long March rockets.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expected that his corporation will serve as an in-orbit
delivery supplier by sending Chinese-made satellites atop Chinese
carriers into the preset orbits for overseas users and provide
after-launch services.

LHASA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Doctors Without Borders, the
international medical relief group which won the 1999 Nobel Peace
prize, will soon go to Qamdo Prefecture in eastern Tibet to

According to Xavier Crombe, head of the group's Lhasa office,
the doctors will treat sufferers from Kaschin-Beck disease (
osteoarthrosis deformans endemica), train local medical personnel
and do research on the cause of the disease.

Doctor Crombe said about three million people in the world are
suffering from Kaschin-Beck disease, most of them living in Asia
and some 10,000 in Tibet.

in highland barley, a staple food on the plateau, and iodine-
short water are responsible for the disease.

autonomous regions and municipalities in terms of the signed
contract value, on the first day of the fair.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Governor Lu Ruihua said that the state policy to spur

development opportunities for developed eastern area.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong will certainly grasp this development opportunity,

<HEADLINE> School Building Quality Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Education has
vowed to ensure the safety of students by asking authorities to
eliminate dilapidated buildings from schools, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"Every level of government should stick to related education
law and policies, take firm responsibility, pour more money and
labor, and do stricter inspections to prevent any further fatal
school-building accidents," Guo Zhenyou, director of the ministry
's supervision office, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, six students were killed at a village primary
school in east China's Jiangsu Province. The students died when
high winds knocked down a school wall on March 27.
</P>
<P>
Also last month, four students died in a dining-room collapse
in southwest province of Sichuan. The accidents have set off an
alarm about the deteriorating condition of China's school
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 13 million square meters of school buildings are
classified as "dangerous". The figure is less than one percent of
the total school building floor space of the country.
</P>
<P>
Though the proportion of dilapidated school buildings is small
and decreasing every year, the problem is still very grave, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Guo blamed fund shortages, negligence and corruption for
rundown schools.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry has called for an overall inspection of school
buildings nationwide," the official noted.

Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
"Pudong has received support from the third generation of the
collective leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central
Committee since the very beginning," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu cited three important visits to Pudong by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin. During the visit to the area on November 11, 1992,
the Chinese leader noted that establishing Pudong was part of
China's overall economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
"President Jiang has provided the right direction for us when
the Pudong area was at the initial stage of construction," Hu
noted.
</P>
<P>
When Jiang visited the Pudong Area again on May 1, 1994, he
said that the central authorities' decision to develop Pudong is
firm and will not change.

<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The seventh day of each April is
designated as World Health Day, which will focus on global issues
of blood safety this year.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two years ago, the date witnessed official establishment
of the World Health Organization (WHO), and its annual assembly in
1950 designated the day as World Health Day.

"World Health Day 2000" has been dedicated to the theme of
Blood Safety and to the slogan "Safe blood starts with me".
</P>
<P>
The objectives of World Health Day 2000 are:
</P>
<P>
To raise awareness of blood safety issues globally.
</P>
<P>
To encourage Member States, including China, to commit to and
support national blood programs and implement national blood
legislation or a legal framework for a national blood program to

<HEADLINE> Bergkamp Gives Arsenal Edge in UEFA Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Arsenal took a step closer to the UEFA Cup final, as Dennis
Bergkamp's early goal gave them a slender lead after the first leg
of their semi-final at Highbury against Racing Lens.
</P>
<P>
Bergkamp put the Gunners ahead after just two minutes - but the
rest of the game proved a frustrating affair for Arsene Wenger's
side and unfancied Lens did enough to keep the tie in the balance.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal were expected to find life relatively easy against the
team rated as the weakest of the four semi-finalists.
</P>
<P>
And when Bergkamp found the net right at the start of the game
and Nwankwo Kanu was presented with two gilt-edged chances soon
after, it looked like being a stroll for the north Londoners.
</P>
<P>
But Lens proved they are more than mere makeweights in this
year's competition and will fancy their chances of causing an
upset in the return leg in two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Kells Quits as Olympic Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Morley Kells, Olympic commissioner
in Ontario, Canada, has resigned amid delicate negotiations
involving the 2008 Games.
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm he has resigned," said Hillary Stauth, a
spokeswoman for Premier Mike Harris of Ontario.
</P>
<P>
The duty of the Olympic commission will be assumed by the
SuperBuild Corp, the provincial agency that oversees
infrastructure spending.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kells made the recommendations that responsibilities for
the Olympics and waterfront development be shifted to SuperBuild
Corp., and so this is being done at his recommendation," announced
Harris' another aide Pierre Leduc.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, Kells felt frustrated over the budget
issue in negotiations between the city of Toronto, the bid
committee working on Toronto's proposal for the 2008 Games and the
province of Ontario, which insists on a guarantee that the
proposal won't run over budget.
</P>
<P>
He was unhappy with a lack of cooperation of officials from
Toronto city hall and the Olympic bid committee, who preferred to
deal directly with the premier's office.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of photographs
featuring nudity did not intrigue many people in this city with a
population of nearly 10 million.
</P>
<P>
Only about 200 people have visited the exhibition during the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Harbin is the capital city of northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, neighboring Russia.
</P>
<P>
Over 120 pictures are on display. They were all taken in Russia
using local models by photographers from the province last year.
</P>
<P>
"We were worried at first that the exhibition might arouse a
great disturbance," said Li Qian, secretary-general of the
provincial society of artistic photography. "It seems now that our
worries were groundless."
</P>
<P>
In the visitors' book for the exhibition, some visitors wrote
"Creation and nature make perfection", "The courage to display the
beauty of the human body is social progress", and "We enjoyed the
exhibition, as bodily beauty is a kind of natural beauty too".
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will last for one month here, and then will go
on tour across the province.

<HEADLINE> S. African Banks Urged to Help Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin on Thursday urged banks to do more to
help small businesses so as to create more jobs, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's banks have performed poorly in helping small
businesses, Erwin said during a debate on the trade and industry
budget in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said the banks' lack of familiarity with the black community
had made them react slowly to job creation through small and micro
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
His ministry intended to intervene more decisively in the
creation of small businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said the promotion of small business and black economic
empowerment would remain at the top of the department's agenda
over the next year.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Meets U.N. Envoy on Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign
Minister Faruk Shareh met here Friday evening with
U.N. chief's personal envoy Terje Roed Larsen on a
planned Israeli troops withdrawal from south
Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Larsen, who arrived here earlier in the day
from Beirut, conveyed to Shareh a message from U.
N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on his talks with
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in Geneva on
Tuesday, the Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Annan, Levy assured
Annan that his country is determined to implement
the U.N. Resolution 425 which calls on Israel to
withdraw its army unconditionally from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted by the Security
Council in 1978 after Israel invaded southern
Lebanon allegedly to wipe out Palestinian
guerrillas who had launched attacks on northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Levy also pledged that Israel will cooperate
with the 4,500-strong U.N. peacekeeping forces
stationed in south Lebanon during the July
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of increasing guerrilla
attacks on Israeli forces in south Lebanon, which
resulted in seven deaths since the beginning of
this year, the Israeli cabinet earlier last month
approved Prime Minister Ehud Barak's plan to pull
out from south Lebanon by July with or without a
peace agreement with Syria, the main power broker
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Larsen said his meeting with
Shareh was held in a friendly and cordial
atmosphere, adding that he and Sharek will keep in
contact with each other to advance the peace
process in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shareh said his country understands
Lebanon's security concerns due to Israel's 22-
year-long occupation of the country.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have threatened harsh
retaliation against Lebanon if its guerrillas
stage attacks on northern Israeli towns after the
pullout.
</P>
<P>
"Syria cannot but welcome full and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon," Shareh said, adding that he deems the
move as a "significant gain for Lebanon and the
Arabs as a whole."
</P>
<P>
No matter whether the withdrawal is genuine or
not, Syria will not yield to any pressures
whatever their sources might be, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Syria will never give up any of its rights to
land and water," Shareh stressed.
</P>
<P>
Israel has accused Syria of using Lebanese
guerrilla attacks on
Israeli forces in south Lebanon as a bargaining
chip to take back the whole Golan Heights, which
Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
Syria will continue urging the international
community especially the U.N. Security Council to
implement relevant U.N. resolutions on ending the
decades-old Arab-Israeli conflict so as to
establish a fair, permanent and comprehensive
peace in the Middle East, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which deploys about 30,000
troops in Lebanon, have insisted on the
integration of their talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday Shareh phoned Lebanese Prime
Minister Salim Hoss on the forthcoming Israeli
pullout and the obstacles set by Israel on the
road to peace.
</P>
<P>
Larsen discussed with Lebanese leaders on the
Israeli withdrawal before coming here.

The two sides agreed in Brussels on Thursday to
close the CFSP chapter and three less problematic
chapters: social and employment policy, fisheries
and company law, the reports said.
</P>

The closure of the four chapters means Cyprus
has provisionally closed 15 of a total of 30

Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said in a

Lahoud expressed concern that Palestinian
guerrillas would continue attacks after Israel's
unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon. Lebanese
government can not entirely control Palestinian
guerrillas so they will not be responsible for the
possible attacks, he hinted. (Lebanon-UN)

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Meets U.N. Envoy on Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh met here Friday evening with U.N. chief's personal envoy
Terje Roed Larsen on a planned Israeli troops withdrawal from south
Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Larsen, who arrived here earlier in the day from Beirut,
conveyed to Shareh a message from U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
on his talks with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in Geneva on
Tuesday, the Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Annan, Levy assured Annan that his
country is determined to implement the U.N. Resolution 425 which
calls on Israel to withdraw its army unconditionally from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted by the Security Council in 1978 after
Israel invaded southern Lebanon allegedly to wipe out Palestinian
guerrillas who had launched attacks on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Levy also pledged that Israel will cooperate with the 4,500-
strong U.N. peacekeeping forces stationed in south Lebanon during
the July withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of increasing guerrilla attacks on Israeli
forces in south Lebanon, which resulted in seven deaths since the
beginning of this year, the Israeli cabinet earlier last month
approved Prime Minister Ehud Barak's plan to pull out from south
Lebanon by July with or without a peace agreement with Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Larsen said his meeting with Shareh was held
in a friendly and cordial atmosphere, adding that he and Sharek
will keep in contact with each other to advance the peace process
in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shareh said his country understands Lebanon's
security concerns due to Israel's 22-year-long occupation of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have threatened harsh retaliation against
Lebanon if its guerrillas stage attacks on northern Israeli towns
after the pullout.
</P>
<P>
"Syria cannot but welcome full and unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon," Shareh said, adding that he deems
the move as a "significant gain for Lebanon and the Arabs as a
whole."
</P>
<P>
No matter whether the withdrawal is genuine or not, Syria will
not yield to any pressures whatever their sources might be, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Syria will never give up any of its rights to land and water,"
Shareh stressed.
</P>
<P>
Israel has accused Syria of using Lebanese guerrilla attacks on
Israeli forces in south Lebanon as a bargaining chip to take back
the whole Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria will continue urging the international community
especially the U.N. Security Council to implement relevant U.N.
resolutions on ending the decades-old Arab-Israeli conflict so as
to establish a fair, permanent and comprehensive peace in the
Middle East, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which deploys about 30,000 troops in Lebanon,
have insisted on the integration of their talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday Shareh phoned Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss on the forthcoming Israeli pullout and the obstacles set by
Israel on the road to peace.
</P>
<P>
Larsen discussed with Lebanese leaders on the Israeli withdrawal
before coming here.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Parties Urged to Stop Fighting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Expressing its deep concern at the reports that the Islamic
faction of Taliban and the opposition United Front are preparing
for renewed large-scale fighting, the council condemned the
Taliban for the launching of new offensives.
</P>
<P>
"There is no military solution to the conflict and only a
negotiated political settlement aimed at the establishment of a
broad-based multiethnic and fully representative government
acceptable to all Afghans can lead to peace and national
reconciliation", the council said in a presidential statement
after an open debate on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has entered into its 22nd year without any
tangible hope for a solution in the foreseeable future, according
to U.N. official John Renninger.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the region and beyond already suffer from the
spill-over of many Afghan-based problems including the flood of
refugees, narcotics, arms smuggling and cross-border terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
Continuous clashed between the warring factions took place in
various places throughout the winter with the front lines
remaining almost unchanged, Renninger told the council.
</P>
<P>
Renninger, Officer-in-Charge of Asia and the Pacific Division
in the U.N. Department of Political Affairs, said during the OIC-
sponsored talks involving the Taliban and the United Front in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from 7 to 9 March, neither side changed its
basic position.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban insisted that the opposition join the "Islamic
Empire", while the United Front reiterated that an interim
government including third parties should be established.
</P>
<P>
The OIC, or Organization of Islamic Conference, is attempting
soon to arrange further talks between the two sides in Jeddah and
the U.N. "fully supports this effort", said Renninger.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Not to Take Part in CDU Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The conservative German opposite
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will hold its first national
congress without Helmut Kohl in 30 years, Kohl's Berlin office
said.
</P>
<P>
The CDU congress, scheduled for next Monday in Essen city in
Ruhr industrial region, will elect Angela Merkel and Ruprecht
Polenz its leading duo, and the acting party chief Wolfgang
Schaeuble is expected to step down.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, the former CDU chancellor who is facing a criminal probe
for his slush funds scandal, in an open message thanked Schaeuble
and Merkel for their congratulations letter on his 70th birthday.
</P>
<P>
"I had tried to fulfill my duty. I am very glad to know that
many were successful, yet some were not so successful," said the
message.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's office added the former chancellor, who had led the CDU
for 25 years, would not take part in the party congress.
</P>
<P>
Again, Kohl in his message thanked his "personal friends" for
their "important support" to his work.
</P>
<P>
"My career in this decade was only possible because many had
support it. I am lucky that I have found many personal friends in
our society these years. I also thank them for their important
support to my work," said the message.
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble and Merkel sent a congratulatory letter to Kohl this
Monday for his 70th birthday. The letter, while eulogizing Kohl's
contribution to German reunification in 1990, also accused his
illegal funding practice.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who has by now refused to disclose the name of his
benefactors for his "promise to personal friends," passed his
birthday quietly in an Austrian town, canceling all public
activities.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Presidential Candidates Close Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian presidential candidates
Friday closed their electoral campaigns with mass rallies previous
to Sunday's general elections.
</P>
<P>
President Alberto Fujimori, who is bidding for a third mandate,
called more than 100,000 followers in the closing of his campaign
in Lima downtown Plaza Grau.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, who leads in the polls with more than 40 percent of
the voting preferences, called on electors to avoid returning to
the past, to consolidate the reforms started by his government,
and made a series of promises if he is reelected.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian president has not been able to solve the serious
unemployment problem, despite achievements in the economic,
security aspects, and in the war against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
 Fujimori faces eight opponents. Only one candidate, Alejandro
Toledo, is considered a serious threat. A runoff would be
scheduled in late May or early June if no candidate achieves a
majority.
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Toledo, the Peru Possible movement presidential
candidate, who has 30.2 percent of the Peruvian electors
preferences in the polls, closed his political campaign in the
Andean city of Cusco.
</P>
<P>
Toledo, an economy Harvard graduate, of humble origin and
without much political experience, has had a meteoric ascension
which makes him a serious prospect for the Peruvian presidency.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, Fujimori tamed hyperinflation,reversed
Peru's pariah image with international lenders and implemented
liberal, free-market policies with remarkable success. Growth
averaged more than 7 percent annually, but the trend ended in his
second term, as Asian financial turmoil spread throughout Latin
America and Peru was rocked by the El Nino weather phenomenon.
About half the population lives in poverty and only one in two
people in the labor force has steady work.

<HEADLINE> (RPT With Corrections) News Analysis: Blix Seeks to Make UNMOVIC Different From UNSCOM  (by Xie Meihua) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Hans Blix, executive
chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) for Iraq, presented a report to
the United Nations Thursday, mapping out a blueprint for the staff
structure of the new U.N. arms regime.
</P>
<P>
The UNMOVIC was created by Security Council Resolution 1284
adopted last December to replace the now defunct United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction and resume the U.N. arms inspection in
Iraq which has been suspended since the U.S-led military strikes
against the country in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Blix's plan, there will be no deputy post for the
UNMOVIC, but an executive assistant with less power will be set up,
a contrast with the UNSCOM which was headed by Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
The deputy post of the UNSCOM has been traditionally held by an
American. The last one was Charles Duelfer who reigned in February
after the establishment of the UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the UNSCOM, Blix recommended in the plan that the
UNMOVIC will be strong on experts and technical personnel rather
than political functionaries. He also proposed a two-step approach
to recruitment of the personnel for the arms regime, with most
UNMOVIC staff being U.N. employees.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM relied mainly on experts picked up and paid by their
government, a practice that resulted in the alleged UNSCOM spying
for the United States which led to the demise of the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Blix wants his arms staff to firmly act with a clear U.N.
identity and to avoid them from getting orders from outside the U.
N. body.
</P>
<P>
Blix also wants his arms regime to be tightly-controlled and
leakproof, saying the flow of intelligence must be one way.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the agency's public information officer will
ensure that there will be a single authoritative point of contact
with the media, Blix himself or someone gets authorization from
him.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the UNMOVIC has the same rights of the UNSCOM,
with the freedom of movement and immediate, unrestricted access to
any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
But he proposed to open a cultural program for his arms staff
which is aimed to train them in understanding national
sensitivities and the proper handling of adversarial situation in
the field.
</P>
<P>
This is what the UNSCOM failed in its operation and this is
also what led to consequent confrontations between the U.N. arms
inspectors and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan is an apparent bid of Blix to motivate Iraq
to cooperate with the United Nations and allow the return of the U.
N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Once the plan is approved by the 15-member Security Council,
possibly next week, the next step will be a visit to Iraq. But so
far, Iraq has reiterated that it bans U.N. arms inspectors from
returning unless the sanctions against the country get lifted.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Invest $2 Billion in Four Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian government will
invest more than two billion U.S. dollars in the next four years
to improve the economy and the elemental services for society,
such as health, education, housing, drinking water, and production
means.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Friday by Economy and Finance Minister
Victor Juliao when he presented his plan of economic, social, and
financial development, with investment in human capital before the
Ninth International Banking Convention.
</P>
<P>
The economic plan is an instrument of the state to solve the
most oppressing problems faced by Panamanian citizens, especially
the 37 percent of the population who lives in a state of poverty
and the 17 percent which suffers extreme poverty, said Juliao.
</P>
<P>
The plan foresees to invest 249 million dollars in the
agriculture sector to improve the quality of the products for
export and also other 39 million dollars for irrigation programs.
</P>
<P>
The program includes the investment of 451 million dollars in
health, 140 million for housing, 303 million in education, and 357
million for the construction of a second bridge over or a tunnel
under the Panama Canal, among other projects.
</P>
<P>
Juliao said that a lot of money will be necessary to implement
this plan and that Panama cannot ask for more international loans,
because its public has reached 7.7 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Army Thwarts Plan To Detonate Car Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Colombian soldiers defused Friday a
terrorist plan of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
aimed at detonating a car bomb in the La Calera municipality, near
the Colombian capital.
</P>
<P>
This was reported by General Arcesio Barrero, commander of the
13th Army Brigade, who added that the rebel plan was frustrated "
thanks to intelligence labor and information provided by the
citizens" which helped to prevent bigger damage that could have
caused the car bomb.
</P>
<P>
Barrero invited the citizens in general to form a common front
to bar the FARC military plans from advancing in La Calera, and
offered rewards for those who will denounce the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Colombia is tense because there have been
detonations of car bombs in the last two weeks in the central
department of Cundinamarca and around Bogota, while the combats
between the Army and the FARC continue.

LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major stock markets
finished with a surge Friday as technology, media and
telecommunication issues rebounded from steep declines earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 rose 1.84 percent to 6,569.9, as a gain of
more than 16 percent for Internet security firm Baltimore
Technology outweighed weakness in defense, banking and food stocks.
</P>
<P>
Media company Pearson surged 17.4 percent after it confirmed it
will combine its television business with the pan-European

</P>
<P>
The merger provided a boost to other media stocks, with
broadcaster Carlton Communication rising 11.9 percent, TV and
hotel owner Granada Group up 7.3 percent, and British Sky
Broadcasting climbed 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The leading gainer on the FTSE 100 benchmark index was Internet
service provider Freeserve, which surged 18 percent. Hand-held
computer maker Psion rose 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax index rose as gains by tech and insurance

The Dax index ended at 7,522.2 points, up 75.99 or 1.02 percent,

"We're not at this stage where we think it's appropriate for us
to impose or pressure either party to accept an American plan," U.
S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"There's an enormous amount of work to be done" to reach an
agreement, Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators started a week of talks at
Bolling Air Force Base in Washington on Friday morning as the
target date approached for a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
The middle-level negotiating teams were led by Odea Eran for
Israel and Yasser Abed Rabbo for the Palestinians. U.S.
negotiators are expected to join the talks later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The framework agreement is meant as a step toward a
comprehensive agreement by September 13 covering all the so-called

final status issues such as the size and status of the Palestinian
territories, Jerusalem, water rights, the fate of Palestinian
refugees and Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also were taking up another Israeli withdrawal on
the West Bank. Due in June under a 1995 agreement, the size and
specific stretches of territory to be turned over to the
Palestinian Authority have not be decided.
</P>
<P>
So far, Israel has relinquished 40 percent of the West Bank and
all of Gaza to the Palestinians.
</P>

The same negotiators met at Bolling for one week last month
without any evidence of either progress or deadlock.

<HEADLINE> McGuinness "Willing" to Attend Bloody Sunday Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Sinn Fein figure said
Friday that Martin McGuinness is willing to appear at the Bloody
Sunday Inquiry to answer allegations that he fired the shot which
started the killings.
</P>
<P>
Party chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said his colleague had yet to
be invited to the inquiry being heard at Londonderry's Guildhall,
and would respond if he was.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry heard Thursday that McGuinness, a former education
minister in the suspended Northern Irish assembly, could have
fired a gun on the day of the army killings 28 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A Security Service document described as the debriefing of an
informer stated McGuinness had admitted "that he had personally
fired the shot from Rossville Flats in the Bogside that had
precipitated the Bloody Sunday episodes."
</P>
<P>
But McLaughlin poured scorn on the allegation, saying the
allegation emerged from an informer and it was dated 1992 --
exactly 20 years after the event.
</P>
<P>
"We have an unnamed military source and clearly it is an
attempt by military -- who are destroying the evidence as this
inquiry progresses -- to create a diversion from the fact that the
British Army murdered 14 people on the streets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal was also told that McGuinness -- "widely reputed"
to have been commander of the Provisional IRA in the city at the
time -- had so far refused to cooperate with the new inquiry.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness, a Mid Ulster MP and prominent member of Sinn Fein,
has also denied the inquiry's claims, saying they were "a pathetic
fabrication."
</P>
<P>
The inquiry was set up to look again at the deaths of 14 men
shot by paratroopers during a civil rights march in Derry's
Bogside on January 30, 1972.
</P>
<P>
The claims about McGuinness were made on the eighth day of
public hearings of the Saville Inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The Bloody Sunday Inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville of Newdigate,
has been gathering evidence for the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Laborers in US Send Home $5.91 Billion Last Year </HEADLINE>

<P>
The central bank said that the money sent by some 8.5 million
Mexicans to their families is now the second most important source
of income for the country, after oil, which in 1999 amounted to 8.
86 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Mexico annual report says that these resources can
be compared with the amount of direct foreign investment in that
same year, since it was 11 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The National Population Council (Conapo) said that the flow of
Mexicans who go to the United States seeking better working
opportunities reached 2 million during the five years of this
administration.
</P>
<P>
Conapo said that the labor force outflow, about 10 percent of
the total population, can be compared with their money remittances,
so the loss is minimal in this aspect.

<HEADLINE> Blair Pushes Health Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Friday hosted the first meeting of a ministerial group designed to
push through the government's health reforms.
</P>
<P>
After the two-hour health summit in Cardiff, Wales, the first
top level meeting of ministers from all four parts of the UK, he
said Labor's new money for the National Health Service (NHS) would
burst a dam of energy.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister said that it was clear that in all parts of
the UK, and all parts of the NHS, the case for reform was accepted,
" the BBC quoted a government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"He said it was clear that across the UK there was a shared
determination to modernize the health service to deliver better
healthcare and to deal with variations in performance," he added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Appeals for Unity of Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
on Friday appealed for unity in the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) leadership if it was to
remain a formidable party.
</P>
<P>
Lack of unity was destroying the party in some provinces, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at least 10,000 people at a Zanu-pf rally in
Bindura, about 100 kilometers north of Harare, Mugabe said Zanu-pf
would remain committed to the full sovereignty of the Zimbabwean
people.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic hardships being experienced by the poor
people in the country could not be blamed on the government but
manufacturers who keep on increasing prices of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
He attacked managers of parastatals such as the National Oil
Company of Zimbabwe for corruption that was ruining the country.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the shortages of fuel and price increases were
temporary problems that would pass soon.
</P>
<P>
"We are going back to the time when the increase of prices of
basic commodities will be controlled by the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president praised war veterans for invading
white- owned commercial farms, saying they were keeping the
liberation spirit alive.
</P>
<P>
He said white farmers should not resist the action by the war
veterans because some who tried to do so were injured.
</P>
<P>
The former freedom fighters recently invaded at least 700
white-owned farms throughout the country, saying they were hungry
for land.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the war veterans' action had been justified by the
Constitution Amendment Bill passed in Parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Bill empowers the government to acquire land compulsorily
without compensation if Britain does not provide the money.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Support to Anti-poverty Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice President Christon
Tembo on Friday called on donor countries to continue supporting
newly established Drought Rehabilitation Initiative aimed at
assisting rural people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon here organized by the Program Against
Malnutrition (PAM), Tembo said the Zambian government was
concerned about the high poverty levels in the rural areas and
that was why it had established the initiative, which would
address poverty issues resulting from natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
He said the government appreciated the role PAM played in
addressing poverty in the country and revealed that cases of
malnutrition had reduced by 30 percent between 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The vice president noted that about 18,000 flood victims in the
country were in need of food and shelter and called on the donors
to assist them.
</P>
<P>
Tembo assured the donors that the government would utilize all
the donated resources judiciously to benefit all the Zambian
people.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Gets Support for Ivory Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Endangered Wildlife Trust
(EWT) fully supports South Africa's bid to sell 28 tons of ivory
stock from the Kruger National Park in the country, the EWT's
media manager Rayaan Adriaanse said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Adriaanse said in a statement that the EWT rendered its support
because the ivory had been obtained over the years through natural
mortality and population control measures.
</P>
<P>
The South African team, led by Minister of Environmental
Affairs and Tourism Valli Moosa, will submit application to sell
the tusk to a single buyer at the 11th Conference of the Parties
to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES), which will be held in Nairobi, Kenya, from April 10-20.
</P>
<P>
The sale could yield around 30 million rand (4.9 million U.S.
dollars), which South Africa has undertaken to use for future
elephant conservation management purposes.
</P>
<P>
"The EWT notes that the controlled ivory sales by Botswana,
Namibia and Zimbabwe permitted by CITES after its last meeting in
Harare were conducted responsibly and transparently," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said there was no evidence that the sales caused an increase
in elephant poaching.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with correction)Largest Air Carrier Calls for PNTR with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 7 (Xinhua) -- In order for the United States
to benefit from China's significant market opening, the United
States must first extend China "Permanent Normal Trading Relations
" (PNTR) status, said United Airlines in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The United Sates and China are part of a global community and
marketplace," United chairman and chief executive officer Jim
Goodwin said in the statement. "The United States has an historic
opportunity to benefit from the opening of the China market, but
only if China is granted PNTR status. We at the United strongly
believe this must happen soon so that the American people can
benefit from the opportunities that will occur when China enters
the World Trade Organization."
</P>
<P>
Denying China PNTR status does not prevent China from joining
the WTO; it only prevents the United States from having greater
access to China's markets, said the largest air carrier in the
world.
</P>
<P>
United Airlines is seeking to operate more air service to China.
The airline currently offers nonstop flights between San Francisco
and Shanghai five days each week, and is urging the U.S.
Department of Transportation to grant it the two remaining
frequencies it needs to provide daily nonstop service. In June,
United will launch daily nonstop service between San Francisco and
Beijing, and the airline will launch another Shanghai daily
nonstop service next year from Chicago, the company said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jury Awards Smokers $6.9 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. jury Friday ordered the
tobacco industry to pay two smokers 6.9 million dollars and
awarded a third smoker a record 5.8 million dollars in
compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
But the jury decided that the third smoker couldn't collect the
money because a four-year statute of limitations had expired on
his claim.
</P>
<P>
The three smokers had asked for 13.2 million dollars in
compensatory damages, including a total of 4.2 million dollars in
medical costs and other past and future expenses and up to 3
million dollars each for pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
The three plaintiffs are Farnan, a 44-year-old nurse from
Inglis, Amodeo, a 60-year-old clockmaker from Orlando, and Della
Vecchia, a housewife from New Port Richey who died last year at 53.
</P>
<P>
The same jury, which began hearing the case 18 months ago,
ruled last July that the tobacco industry fraudulently conspired
to produce a dangerous, addictive product that caused 29 illnesses,
including cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
Smokers' attorney Stanley Rosenblatt argued all three
plaintiffs became addicted in the 1950s long before they became
aware of the health dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
"The verdict itself is a potentially crippling blow to the
tobacco industry because it opens the door now to a possible
massive punitive damage verdict," said Matt Myers, president of
the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
</P>
<P>
The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
, Brown &AMP; Williamson, Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc.
and the industry's Council for Tobacco Research and Tobacco
Institute.
