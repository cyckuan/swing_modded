<HEADLINE> France Raises Alcohol Taxes to Support Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The French National Assembly
today adopted a new bill to increase taxes on alcohol to raise
money for social security programs.
</P>
<P>
The tax increase of 4.97 percent will bring some 900 million
francs (180 million U.S. dollars) a year into the national coffers
to pay for social security programs, which are facing stiff cuts
under the government's austerity measures to bring the budget
deficit down.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, parliament voted for a 6.39 percent rise in taxes on
tobacco, which is expected to bring about 2.7 billion francs (540
million U.S. dollars) in extra income in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A government proposal for a 17.1 percent rise in tax on spirits
was strongly opposed by drinks companies including the popular Cognac
and Armagnac brandy giants, and their representatives in
parliament. A compromise was finally made at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, taxes on beer and other alcoholic soda drinks
will also be increased.
</P>
<P>
The tax on beer will be raised by nine centimes (1.8
U.S. cents) per bottle of 33 centiliters, while that on alcoholic
soda drinks will go up by 15 francs (three U.S. dollars) per
liter.

<HEADLINE> EU Farm Ministers to Grant Extra Mad Cow Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- EU Farm Ministers have
approved a package of measures to cut beef production and provide
extra aid for farmers hit by the so-called mad cow crisis.
</P>
<P>
The package, hammered out at a meeting in Luxembourg, won the
support of 14 ministers, with Germany's farm minister the only one
to vote against the plan.
</P>
<P>
France, the EU's main beef producer, will get 23.8 percent of the
500 million Ecu (635 million U.S. dollars) aid, while German
and British farmers will get 20 and 13 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Irish Farm Minister Ivan Yates, whose country holds the
rotating EU presidency, said the aid would supplement the 850
million Ecu (1.1 billion US dollars) package agreed by EU leaders
in Florence in June.
</P>
<P>
EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said the European
Commission would come forward next year with a document on the
long term reform of the beef regime.
</P>
<P>
Germany's demands for a cut in beef output by marketing calves
market earlier and a higher premium for bulls were met. But it
still voted against the package because it contained measures
which it said would weaken efforts to make structural changes to
cut output.
</P>
<P>
Beef sales in Europe plummeted after the mad cow crisis broke
out in March when the British government admitted a possible link
between a fatal brain disease in cattle and a similar disease in
humans. Demand for EU beef has since fallen by 11 percent and some
400,000 tons of unwanted beef have been put into storage.

<HEADLINE> Goma Airport Under Control of Zairean Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The airport in Zaire's eastern
city of Goma is still under the control of government troops, as
fighting in the city between Zairean forces and armed groups from
Rwanda continued throughout the morning, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) reports from Goma quoted Zairean
soldiers at the airport as saying that armed groups from Rwanda
tried to capture the airport this morning, but Zairean troops used
mortars and rockets to pound the fields surrounding the airport
to drive away unidentified gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The airport, just several hundred meters from the Rwandan
border and some four kilometers north of the city center, has
become a key target in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies use it to bring in staff and supplies for refugees
and the Zairean military has been flying in army reinforcements
over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the military situation in both North Kivu and
South Kivu provinces in eastern Zaire is worsening and there are
reports of intensifying fighting between Zairean troops and the
Tutsis Banyamulenge militias, who are joined by Rwandan army.
</P>
<P>
General Ngwala Panzu, commander of the Fourth Military Region
of Zaire told AFP that Zairean troops this morning bombarded the
Munigui area situated between Goma and the Kibumba refugee camp,
which was abandoned by some 200,000 refugees days ago after being
attacked by Rwandan troops,
</P>
<P>
Troops and armaments have been sent in from the capital
Kinshasa and Lubumbashi to reinforce Zairean troops in Goma, AFP
reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 150,000 Hutu refugees fled the refugee camp of
Kahindo north of Goma this morning as fierce fighting broke out
Wednesday night near the refugee camp, United Nations humanitarian
sources working in the refugee camp said.
</P>
<P>
These refugees will have to walk for two or three days to
arrive at the next refugee camp in Mugunga, which has already
become the largest refugee camp in the world with 420,000
occupants, AFP quoted U.N. sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund
(UNICEF) said that it is preparing to withdraw 101 UNICEF aid
workers from Goma.
</P>
<P>
It is also studying ways to help the local population of Goma
and the 750,000 refugees in the Goma area, AFP quoted officials of
the organization as saying today.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Afghan Situation Worsening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- October witnessed escalating
factional fighting in war-torn Afghanistan and failure of
mediation by the United Nations and several countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the Afghan situation is further worsening as
no reconciliation is in the cards mainly due to deep-rooted hatred
for one another among the warring factions and poor coordination
among certain countries with influence on the Afghan factions.
</P>
<P>
Although there are more than 10 parties in Afghanistan, the
future of the country will be decided by the top three players --
the Taliban Militia led by Mullah Umer, the Uzbek Militia led by
Rashid Dostum and the ousted government led by President
Burhanuddin Rabbani and his top commander Ahmad Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
Since capturing Kabul on September 27, the Taliban have gained
control over two-thirds of Afghan territory while rival groups
concentrate on northern Afghanistan in which seven provinces are
controlled by Dostum and three by Masood.
</P>
<P>
Since its mysterious emergence in the autumn of 1994, the
Taliban have termed all the other Afghan warlords as criminals and
vowed to wipe them out by force.
</P>
<P>
The student militia have killed Hezb-i-Wahdat leader Abdul
Mazari and defeated forces of Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar group) and
troops loyal to Ismael Khan, a renowned warlord in western
Afghanistan, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, the Taliban routed forces loyal to Abdul
Qadeer, a prominent leader in eastern Afghanistan, before driving
the government troops led by Masood out of the capital.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban did not stop there, but sent heavy troops
deep into the northern part of the country in the first 10 days of
October, chasing Masood's men and facing off Dostum's fighters.
</P>
<P>
The remaining troops loyal to Masood, which were forced into a
corner by the Taliban, have been determined to fight back for
dignity and survival instead of making concessions.
</P>
<P>
Dostum, who remained neutral in the Kabul campaign in
September, joined hands with his old rival Masood on October 10
and formed an Afghan Supreme Council of Defense.
</P>
<P>
Although both the Taliban and the ousted government tried to
woo him, Dostum chose the latter as partner, out of fear that the
advancing Taliban would target at him if Masood was removed.
</P>
<P>
After one month of fighting, the Masood-Dostum joint forces
inflicted heavy losses on the Taliban in northern Afghanistan and
marched to areas merely 20 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed that the major obstacle to the Afghan peace
process is the lack of a sense of compromise on the part of the
warring factions.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old war in Afghanistan has taught the warlords more
skills of fighting than those of negotiation and the inter-party
bloodshed has resulted in deep-rooted hatred and distrust among
the factions.
</P>
<P>
So far, there is no indication that negotiations would take
place any time soon between the Taliban and the ousted government
as the two sides have fought each other since the beginning of
1995.
</P>
<P>
Although some officials from both sides have called for a
ceasefire, their sincerity is dubious as they always make such
proposals when their troops are in a disadvantageous position on
the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
Playing a double game in the triangle conflict, Dostum
supported Masood in his counteroffensive on Kabul on the one hand
and held talks with the Taliban on the other.
</P>
<P>
Under the mediation of Pakistan, Dostum proposed a countrywide
ceasefire in mid-October, which was conditionally accepted by both
the Taliban and Masood.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban asked for a simultaneous exchange of POWs when the
ceasefire went into effect while Masood linked the ceasefire with
the demilitarization of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Later, Dostum also set as a precondition for the ceasefire the
withdrawal of the Taliban troops from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire proposal was doomed to failure due to the lack of
trust and a sense of compromise among the warlords.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban rejected the preconditions raised by Masood and
Dostum, vowing to fight to the last drop of blood. The group also
opened a second front in northwestern Afghanistan against Dostum.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan, Norbert Holl, and
Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar held several rounds
of talks with the Taliban leadership and Dostum, but failed to
reconcile the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from Russia, Iran and some other countries
also visited Dostum's headquarters in northern Afghanistan, but
they failed to stop the factional fighting.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that although all the countries want a
peaceful settlement of the Afghan crisis, they have different
views on how to realize peace.
</P>
<P>
Although all the countries and the United Nations call for the
establishment of a broad-based government in Afghanistan, sharp
differences remain on the composition of such a government.
</P>
<P>
In fact, some countries would like the factions they support to
be the central part of a broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
All this intensified foreign interference, together with the
lack of trust among the Afghan factions, has plunged the Afghan
situation into a deadlock. And no end is expected to the fighting
in the country in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Accuses Namibia's Health Minister of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 31 (Xinhua) --Namibia's official
opposition, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), has called
on the government to dismiss Libertine Amathila,now Minister of
Health and Social Services, over a 2.15 million U.S.Dollars
housing scandal, reported the South African Press Association
today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Windhoek, the DTA said allegations
and accusations of fraud, corruption and maladministration
against senior officials of the State Housing Parastatal are the
worst of their kind since the independence of the country in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The DTA called for all implicated officials to be suspended
immediately, saying the result of the investigation into the
housing scandal would only be ''the tip of the iceberg''.
</P>
<P>
Two senior officials of the State Housing Parastatal and two
building contractors appeared in the Windhoek Magistrate's Court
this week on charges of fraud, bribery and theft.
</P>
<P>
One of the accused claimed in the court that Amathila was
involved in the fraud when she was housing minister, saying that
the former housing minister was aware of the scandal and had used
materials from a government project for her personal home.
</P>
<P>
But Amathila denied the allegations and said she was prepared
to make public all financial dealings about a house she has
recently built for herself.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Hage Geingob has ignored the DTA's
call, saying Namibia is not a police state where people are
punished on the basis of allegations.

Turkey's largest city of Istanbul by environmental ministers from
Turkey, Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The action plan is the most comprehensive environmental
protection guideline ever prepared for the Black Sea, which is
one of the most polluted seas in the world.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to bring important economic benefits from a
cleaner sea and environment and to procure the necessary funding
and infrastructure for permanent development, reports reaching
here quoted delegates as saying.
</P>
<P>
To mark the signing of the plan, the date of October 31 has
been set as the "International Black Sea Day," which will be
celebrated every year in each of the coastal countries, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said the Black Sea ecosystem is rapidly
being destroyed mainly by pollutants carried into it by rivers in
western, central and eastern Europe, particularly the Danube
which crosses a half dozen countries.
</P>
<P>
Increased pollution levels from fuel emissions by ocean going
vessels, industrial wastes and sewage are also depleting plant
groups and fish stocks, particularly of turbot and anchovy
catches in the sea, an important fish breeding ground for more
than three dozen fish species, they said.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, a Black Sea Environmental Program was established,
supported by intergovernmental bodies and the governments of
Netherlands, France, Japan and Austria and backed by the UN
Development Program, UN Environmental Program and the World
Bank.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Relays Syria's Calming Message to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, on a mediation mission in the Middle East,
today relayed a calming message to Israel sent by Syria.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who arrived here today from Cairo, held talks with
his Israeli counterpart David Levy to discuss reducing tension
between Israel and Syria and seeking ways to renew the stalled
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister sent a message to Damascus
immediately after the talks, but the contents were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Before his arrival here, Primakov had visited Syria, Lebanon
and Egypt on a mediation tour to explore ways to calm the tension
between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Levy said Primakov provided him with impressions and important
informations from neighboring countries. "Theses kinds of
informations play an important role in preparing to move ahead
(the peace process)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Israel was more prepared to ease the tension
with Syria after receiving the calming message from Damascus,
Levy replied: "We are working on it."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting Levy, Primakov said he had
"a very good impression" that his Israeli counterpart showed
Russia the respect as a co-sponsor of the peace process which
started in Madrid Conference five years ago.
</P>
<P>
He added he was also deeply impressed by Israel's position
that past agreement and understandings would be honored. "This
is the only way to advance the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked what Russia could offer to mediate the peace process
where the U.S. could not, Primakov dodged the question. But he
said the Russian policy was not to push aside Washington in the
peace mediation.
</P>
<P>
Levy said Russia could play an important role in "encouraging
the sides to come together and push the peace process forward."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement that "Israel
attributes great importance to Russia's possible contribution
toward advancing the multilateral channel of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Ambassador to Russia Aliza Shenhar said
Wednesday Israel would hold regular strategic consultations with
Russian security and diplomatic establishments to discuss Middle
East issues.
</P>
<P>
Late today Primakov would hold talks with Israeli President
Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. He is to
travel to Gaza tomorrow to meet Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat who would return from a week-long European
tour. Primakov will also also visit Jordan before flying home.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Spending Up Slightly in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Consumer spending in the
U.S. rose by a tiny 0.1 percent in September, the weakest increase
in three months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that it was another evidence that the U.S. economy
is slowing down on its own without raising the interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department said that consumer spending
totaled 5.18 trillion dollars at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
in September, up from 5.17 trillion in August when it rose by 0.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The advance was the smallest since the U.S. consumer spending
actually fell by 0.5 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The data supported the report announced by the department on
Wednesday that consumer spending inched up just 0.4 percent at an
annual rate in the third quarter after surging 3.5 percent and 3.4
percent in the prior two quarters.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of the economic
activity in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report said that spending on durable goods, items expected
to last more than three years, declined by 1.4 percent in
September after posting a 3 percent gain in August. Slack
automobile demand accounted for most of the decrease.
</P>
<P>
Spending on nondurable goods such as food and fuel rose by 0.4
percent, erasing a 0.2 percent decline the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Spending on services increased by 0.2 percent, just half the
0.4 percent advance a month earlier.

JERUSALEM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 150 Israeli and
Palestinian women today held a solidarity march in Hebron,
calling for an immediate redeployment of the Israeli army in the
disputed West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Media and Communication Center reported that
the march was organized by Bat Shalom, a left-wing Israeli women
organization, and in cooperation with Palestinian women in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natsheh briefed the demonstrators on the
local deteriorated situation because of Jewish settlers' rampage
and the delay of the Israeli army pullout.
</P>
<P>
Moli Malikar, a member of Bat Shalom, said "We have come to
show solidarity with the Palestinian women despite harassment we
were subjected to while entering the city."
</P>
<P>
Malikar said that they came to demand for implementation of
the redeployment in accordance with the Oslo peace agreement,
adding they would continue their efforts until achieving a
comprehensive and just peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian women distributed a leaflet that
reads "Hebron women raise high their voice so that it can be
heard by all."
</P>
<P>
"Hebron has been and will continue to be a united Arab and
Islamic city, " and "we will not allow division of the city," the
leaflet said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian women said they believe in just and comprehensive
peace, but not in Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's peace,
which is not a real one.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that "genuine peace can be achieved only after
the settlers leave from all the Palestinian territories,
particularly Hebron."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Defense Ministers
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has mapped
geostrategic areas of the former Soviet region, a Russian general
said today.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Leonid Ivashov, chief of the International
Cooperation Department of the Russian General Staff, told a news
conference that the CIS defense chief passed resolutions on 11 of
12 agenda items during one-day meeting in Tajik capital of
Dushanbe on Wednesday.

<P>
The meeting resolved a crucial problem of "geostrategic mapping
of CIS security regions," the general pointed out, noting that the
operational fields include land, sea and air space.

<P>
He said that there is "a threat to southern borders of the CIS
in the wake of the recent flare of hostilities in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The threat to the CIS' southern rim and Central Asian republics
also relates to "the active influence on this situation -- and not
positive -- of the U.S. and other states of the region," Ivashov
said.

not relate to any offensive operations. Rather, "there is only the
task of defense and parrying a threat," he added.

<HEADLINE> Democrats, Republicans Alike Get Big Soft Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Both major political parties
in the United States received millions of dollars in so-called
"soft money" donations in the last month before the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Donors included insurance companies and wealthy businessmen,
documents show.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of October the Democratic National Party took
in 4 million dollars in soft money -- donations supposed to be
used for party building only and not covered under post-Watergate
campaign finance rules.
</P>
<P>
Republicans raised 2.3 million dollars in soft money. Four
donors each gave the Republicans 100,000 dollars during the first
half of October, according to records covering the final reporting
period before next Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
Advocates for campaign finance reform contend that soft money
is a way for corporations and individual donors to get around
federal rules governing campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
Companies are prohibited from donating money directly to
candidates, and individuals are limited to giving each party
20,000 dollars per year. But those rules do not apply to soft
money.
</P>
<P>
Both parties have used the money on ads that closely resemble
campaign commercials.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Balance of Payments Deficit Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Greece's deficit in the balance
of payments increased by 47.3 percent over the first half of the
current year, amounting to 3.155 billion U.S. dollars compared to
2.141 billion in the corresponding period in 1995, it was reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in the deficit of the balance of payments
reflects repercussions emanating from exchange policy and a
decreased inflows from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the trade deficit increased by 300 million
dollars, the invisible resources surplus decreased by 2.37 billion
and as a result overseas transactions in their entirety produced a
deficit amounting to 2.7 billion dollars compared to a surplus of
1.115 billion dollars in the corresponding period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, foreign exchange reserves decreased from 16.5
billion dollars to 13 billion dollars. But according to an
announcement by the bank of Greece, the foreign exchange reserves
increased in the following months and reached 16.8 billion dollars
at the end of September.

BEIRUT, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
received here today a letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton on
a conference to be held in Washington on December 16 over aid of
Lebanon's reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Richard Jones, who delivered the
letter to the Lebanese president, said the conference will make a
decision on financing a series of projects in Lebanon, which will
cost 5 billion U.S. dollars in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The conference, to be attended by the United States, European
Union countries, Japan and Malaysia, was called for by a
ceasefire understanding reached between Lebanon and Israel under
the auspices of the U.S. and France, which ended a 17-day Israeli
blitz in south Lebanon in April.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's visit to Brussels last
month and his meetings with Clinton and Secretary of State Warren
Christopher in the middle of this month in Washington were
focused on how to activate the so-called "consultative
committee," whose name has changed into the conference of
Lebanon's friends, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
They reached an agreement on the date of the conference, which
had been scheduled in September, but was postponed till after the

<HEADLINE> WHO: Rotavirus Vaccine Available in Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- First vaccine against rotavirus
diarrhoea, a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality
worldwide, may be licensed for use in children in one to two
years, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) today.
</P>
<P>
WHO said this after the conclusion in Geneva Tuesday of a
two-day workshop on establishing a European rotavirus surveillance
network, which is part of efforts towards global prevention of the
rotavirus diarrhoea through the use of vaccines.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the meeting from 11 European countries agreed
on common approaches to surveillance of the disease and
charaterization of strains. This will help gather information
needed for conducting mass vaccination.
</P>
<P>
WHO said in a news release issued today that rotavirus
diarrhoea accounts for one third of all hospitalization for
childhood diarrhoea in Europe. In the developing world, the
proportion is up to 40 percent each year, and an estimated 870,000
deaths annually are caused by rotavirus infection.
</P>
<P>
According to the global public health agency, its next meeting
on rotavirus infection is scheduled for January 1997 in Geneva,
which will focus on rotavirus vaccines for the immunization of
children in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Raises Import Duties on Wheat by 75 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government today
announced that the import duties on wheat will be raised from
2.00 Kenyan Shillings (less than 0.04 Dollar) to 3.50 Shillings
(nearly 0.07 Dollar) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the government said that a
glut supply of wheat at the world market has sharply lowered the
commodity's price from about 220 U.S. Dollars per ton to less
than 160 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
This has maded some of the major producers to reintroduce
subsidies and import of the subsidized wheat is adversely
affecting Kenyan farmers, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that the government will take
measures to step up inspection of import goods to ensure that
they will meet statutory quality and standards requirements.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government assured the public that it will not
hesitate to increase the coverage of the anti-dumping measures
whenever it is proved that import goods are subsidized in their
country of origin.
</P>
<P>
The measures have been taken by the government following the
recent incidents of dumping of expired goods, low quality and
sub-standard goods, and subsidized goods in the East African
country.

<HEADLINE> Rival Kurdish Factions Reach Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi rival Kurdish
factions signed here today a peace deal pledging to maintain and
strengthen the ceasefire in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and its rival Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) agreed to set up a Peace Monitoring
Force (PMF) in northern Iraq to observe maintenance of ceasefire,
announced a final statement issued by the six parties at the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Turkoman Front in northern Iraq, the United
States, Turkey and Britain also participated in the two-day peace
talks which was held at the Ankara State House under the
chairmanship of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert
Pelletreau.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-backed PUK and the Baghdad-supported KDP also agreed
that they shall not seek the intervention of any other forces
which would aggravate their conflict or raise tensions.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the two parties would hold further
discussion about a Temporary Local Administration in northern
Iraq with the participation of all parties and ethnic groups,
including Turkomen and Assyrian communities, on an equitable
basis.
</P>
<P>
The parties agreed to work to prevent "terrorist elements, the
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in particular," from having a
presence or activities in northern Iraq, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the talks agreed to reconvene in Ankara on
November 15, to review and advance progress on implementing these
principles.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Pelletreau last week, KDP leader Massoud
Barzani and PUK chief Jalal Talabani agreed to order a ceasefire
which was declared in the midnight on October 23 to hold on.
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted in the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq once
again when the KDP ousted the PUK from Irbil, the seat of the
now-defunct regional government, and took control of vast
swathes of northern Iraq in a Baghdad-backed operation at the
end of August.
</P>
<P>
Launching a surprise counter-attack earlier this month with
reported Iran's support, the PUK recaptured most of the lost
territory earlier, including its strongholds of Sulaimaniya, one
of the biggest cities in northern Iraq, and Koy Sanjaq, and
approached as near as 25 kilometers to Irbil.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the KDP
and the PUK began fighting in 1994.

<HEADLINE> US Personal Incomes Up 0.6 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Personal incomes in the U.S.
increased by 0.6 percent in September and the saving rate reached
the highest level in nearly three years, the U.S. Commerce
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
But the increase of income did not result in a gain in the U.S.
consumer spending which rose by a small 0.1 percent in September,
the weakest showing in three months. Consumer spending amounts to
two-thirds of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that the U.S. personal incomes in
September totaled 6.54 trillion dollars at an annual rate, up
from 6.5 trillion dollars in August when it rose by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that private wages and salaries, the most
closely watched component of personal income, jumped by 30.7
billion to a 3.7 trillion dollar rate, compared with an increase
of 29.4 billion a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income in the month, income after paying taxes, rose
by 0.6 percent, slightly more than the 0.5 percent advance in
August.
</P>
<P>
The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans'
saving rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- was
5.7 percent, the highest since it reached a 6.3 percent rate in
December 1993.
</P>
<P>
The income figures were not adjusted for inflation. When
adjusted, disposable incomes in the country were up 0.4 percent,
the same as in August.

<HEADLINE> US 30-Year Mortgage Rates Down to Seven-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-year, fixed-rate
mortgages in the U.S. averaged 7.78 percent this week, the lowest
level in nearly seven months, according to a national survey
released today by the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
The average was the lowest since the rates averaged the same
7.78 percent on April 4. The rates averaged 8.34 percent as
recently as September 5.
</P>
<P>
The fixed-rate mortgages in the U.S. have increased
dramatically since early this year. The average was as low as 7.03
percent last January and soared to 8.25 percent in August and 8.23
in September.
</P>
<P>
The increase of mortgages has resulted in the slowdown of the
housing market in the country but the market is still much stronger
than last year.
</P>
<P>
The mortgages averaged as high as 9.15 percent in January of
1995.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for people in U.S.
refinancing mortgages, averaged 7.30 percent this week, down from
7.37 percent a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. National Association of Realtors said today
that the ability of the typical American family to buy a home
slipped in the third quarter as high prices and mortgage rates
offset increases in incomes.
</P>
<P>
The association said that its Housing Affordability Index
dipped to 120 during the July-September quarter from 121.9 during
the previous quarter. The index was the lowest since it registered
118.9 during the second quarter of 1992.

<HEADLINE> Procuratorates Urged To Play Greater Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- China's procuratorates are
being asked to carry out decisions of the Communist Party of China
on socialist ethical and cultural progress and to play an
exemplary role in society.
</P>
<P>
Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang
Siqing made the remark at the third national political work
conference on procuratorates, here today, where he noted that
their work is an important component part of socialist ethical and
cultural progress and that they must concentrate on the following
issues:
</P>
<P>
-- Investigation into Embezzlement, bribery, abuse of power,
and other crimes committed by officials.
</P>
<P>
-- Comprehensive handling of social security, severe crimes
that disturb social order, and crimes that defile the social
atmosphere and spread cultural trash.
</P>
<P>
-- Undertaking responsibility for governing the state by the book
and building China into a socialist country run in accordance with
the law.
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening ideological, moral, educational, and cultural
building of the procuratorates themselves.
</P>
<P>
Zhang stressed that the procuratorates must put great emphasis
on professionalism, and noted that a competent procurator must
adhere to the Party Spirit, be loyal to the people, persevere in
seeking the truth, have initiative, work hard, be frank, and have
a sense of foregoing personal gain in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
The building of leadership is crucial in procuratorates'
building of socialist ethical and cultural progress and quality in
their ranks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates at all levels must, in accordance with Party
guidelines and the requirements of the CPC Central Committee,
build the leadership into a collective that follows the Party
guidelines, serve the people, develop a high level of ability in
their work, and be honest in performing duties, he said.

<P>
HONG KONG, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The last British Gurkha
infantry battalion held a farewell ceremony at Sek Kong here this
evening to mark their withdrawal from the territory in the coming
weeks and the closure of the Sek Kong Camp.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the ceremony, the national flag of Britain and
the flag of the First Battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles were
lowered for the last time at the Sek Kong Military Base.
</P>
<P>
Major General Bryan Dutton, commander of the British Forces in
Hong Kong, and Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten attended the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to an officer of the Joint Service Public Relations
Staff of the British Forces, there are now about 700 Gurkha
soldiers and officers in the battalion.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the coming weeks, more than 300 members of
the battalion will move to Britain where they will be assigned to
the Fifth Airborne Brigade and about 300 others will retire and
return to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
A small rear party of about 70 members will remain to complete
the closure of Malaya Lines and prepare it for handover to the
Hong Kong government in December, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gurkhas have been deployed intermittently in Hong Kong since
1948.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Appeals for Cease-fire in Zaire to Avoid Catastrophe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees Sadako Ogata today called for an immediate ceasefire
between Zairean troops and ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels in
eastern Zaire to avoid a humanitarian disaster.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees have abandoned camps
north of the city of Goma on the Zaire-Rwanda border and are
heading for two already overcrowded camps on the western outskirts
of the city.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to all sides to stop the fighting now", Ogata told a
UN meeting in New York.
</P>
<P>
She said a cease-fire was needed to allow aid agencies to get
access to refugees, provide assistance and protect the security of
humanitarian aid workers.
</P>
<P>
There are already some 400,000 refugees in the Mugunga and Lac
Vert camps.
</P>
<P>
"Unless basic assistance is provided to them, I am very afraid
that we are facing a terrible situation where people fleeing for
their lives will end up dying because humanitarian aid failed to
reach them", Ogata said.
</P>
<P>
With no food, water and sanitation facilities in Mugunga, she
fears a disaster worse than that in 1994 when 50,000 refugees died
of epidemics at the beginning of the mass exodus of Hutus from
Rwanda. The refugees fled to Zaire in fear of reprisals by Tutsis
after Hutu hard-liners killed minority Tutsis in Rwanda's 1994
genocide.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. refugee agency said from Geneva that some 115,000
refugees abandoned the Kahindo camp, 50 kilometers north of Goma
early today to escape the fighting between Zairean government
troops and Banyamalenge rebels. They are heading for the Mugunga
and Lac Vert camps.
</P>
<P>
There were also unconfirmed reports of movements out of Katale
camp, 60 kilometers north of Goma, which hosts 202,000 Rwandan
refugees. UNHCR has been cut off from the camp since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The agency is cut off from some 700,000 out of the 1.2 million
refugees in eastern Zaire, where fighting between the Zairean army
and the rebels is escalating.
</P>
<P>
The Banyamalenge have been fighting with Zairean government
forces in a bid to regain the nationality which was stripped from

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects US Aid to Kurds in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today rejected the
7-million-dollar aid in food to the Kurds in the north of the
country offered by the United States.
</P>
<P>
An editorial carried by the official Al-Iraq daily added that
it is the arrogance of the U.S. mentality which thinks that it
secures the Kurds' allegiance to the U.S. at the rate of three
dollars each Kurd.
</P>
<P>
The editorial described the U.S. offer as charities only to be
used as political cards.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper accused the U.S. of placing the Kurds in
northern Iraq in a status of starvation and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that it is the United States that has delayed
the implementation of the oil-for-food deal between the United
Nations and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The deal allows Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil
during a 180-day period to buy food and medicine. It is crucial
to Iraq, which has been hit hard by U.N. sanctions imposed after
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Kurds have been living without the government ration
of food and other essential items since their failure in rising
against President Saddam Hussein after the 1991 gulf war. They
depend on humanitarian aids from world organizations.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said the U.S. wants to divert Kurdistan Iraq
into another Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rejects Indian Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today described as
"misplaced" a protest made by India against the expulsion of an
official of the Indian High Commission here.
</P>
<P>
"The concern expressed by the Indian Ministry of External
Affairs is misplaced," a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said
here, commenting on reports from New Delhi regarding the protest
lodged by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs with the
Pakistani High Commission in the Indian capital.
</P>
<P>
"By making a big issue out of the apprehension and expulsion of
one of their own officials who is a confirmed RAW (Research and
Analysis Wing) agent and was caught red-handed purchasing
information from a local contact," he charged, "the Indian
Ministry of External Affairs is trying to divert attention from
the indefensible actions of their intelligence agencies."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused India of "conveniently ignoring the fact
that an official of the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi,
Hafiz Mushtaq Ahmed Khoso, was kidnapped by Indian security
officials on the evening of October 25, 1996."
</P>
<P>
Khoso "was physically manhandled and assaulted" before his
release the next morning and "was coerced into making a false
confession which was video-taped," according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan each have expelled one of the other's
embassy officials one week ago on charges of espionage.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in a month that such expulsions have
taken place.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania' Trade Deficit on Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade account
deficits are moving downwards due to an increase in export earnings
and a decline in imports.
</P>
<P>
An annual trade report for 1995/96 issued recently by the Bank
of Tanzania (BOT) says, the total export earnings in the
1995/1996 fiscal year are 696.37 million U.S. Dollars in
comparison with 592.93 million U.S. Dollars recorded in 1994/95,
registering a 17.44 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The report says that export earnings in 1993/1994 went to
480.96 million U.S.Dollars from 412.7 million Dollars in
1992/1993.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the export earning increase largely to a raise
in export volumes for major commodities including coffee, cotton,
sisal, tea and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Coffee alone contributed 17 pecent to the total export
earnings during this year, which was followed by cotton, 15
percent, while cashewnuts and manufacured goods contributed 8 and
12 pecent respectively.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of cotton whose price showed an increasing
trend, all other major export prices either stagnated or
declined.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report says that the country's imports decreased
from 1,324.91 million U.S.Dollars in 1994/95 to 1,242.14 million
U.S. Dollars in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
The move by the government to tighten revenue collection from
import duty has contribued to the decline in import, the report
added.

<HEADLINE> US Lifts Restrictions on Macao Textile Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States has decided to
lift restrictions on imports of textile products and garments from
Macao, according to a report issued by the Macao Government
Information Office.
</P>
<P>
The report says that after talks between the Economic
Department of Macao and the US Customs on October 30, the US side
decided to stop extra examinations and other restrictions on five
items of textile products Macao exports to the U.S. as "the US
side recognized the good co-operation between the two sides and
the efforts the Macao side made in cracking down on 'illegal
trans-shipment.'"
</P>
<P>
The US side unilaterally imposed restrictions on the five
export items -- gloves, underwear, men's pants, dresses, and
skirts -- on June 5 this year, suspecting the source of those
products.
</P>
<P>
Under the restrictions, the five items could be refused entry
into the US market unless both Macao exporters and US importers
show documents on the source of the products and hand in a certain
amount of earnest money.
</P>
<P>
As a result of negotiations, Macao and the US signed a
memorandum of understanding on the issue on July 2. According to
the memorandum, within the validity period of 120 days, Macao
allows US Customs officers to inspect locally-made goods before
their shipment to the US.
</P>
<P>
The US decision was welcomed and called "a wise decision" by
local businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Textile products and garments are leading exports of Macao,
accounting for 80 percent of all exports. Most of the exports are
oriented to the U.S. and the European Union.

</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Alecos Markides was quoted as saying today
that there has been a worrying increase in the number of such
offenses, especially under circumstances suggesting they were
carried out on an organized, continuous basis.
</P>
<P>
The stiffer penalties would better reflect the seriousness of
the crime and act as a more effective deterrent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question whether the five-year sentence was still
too lenient, Markides said he had no objection to a further
rise.
</P>
<P>
He said his office will send such cases to the Assizes, rather
than a district court -- if the suspected offense is believed to
have been carried out systematically.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Confidence Pushes Up HK Property Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's property market
has experienced a strong recovery so far this year with active
trading and a 15 to 20 percent picking-up of prices for the home
sector on average.
</P>
<P>
Related statistics show that in the first nine months, more
than 100,600 property transactions have been registered, with a
total value of 29 billion HK dollars (3.72 billion US dollars),
surpassing the total of 22.5 billion HK dollars (2.88 billion US
dollars) for the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
Indications for the residential market are quite positive, with
both luxury and mass residential sectors enjoying major rallies.
</P>
<P>
The downward movement of office market has also
stopped. Transaction statistics show that for some prime office
buildings, prices have rebounded some 10 percent and trading
activities increased by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
Analysts held that the strong comeback has mainly been buoyed
by buyers' confidence in the prospects of Hong Kong's property
industry. They said that the smooth proceeding of various
preparations for the handover of Hong Kong raised people's
confidence in the future of the territory, and the general
economic, political and social atmosphere is very encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Other factors that helped boost the property market include
beneficial interest rates, stock market rallies and constantly
increasing overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's property market experienced years of upward
movement and peaked in early 1994, followed by an 18-month
downward correction, with property prices dropping at an average
of some 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The market began to regain its losses at the end of 1995 when
most developers abstained from cutting prices further, predicting
that the property market would stabilize and recover, which has
been proven to be true.
</P>
<P>
Many property managers say that the market's upward momentum
this year was stronger than they have expected. They predict that
the price increase for the whole year will be well above 20
percent and the total transactions will probably reach 45 billion
HK dollars (5.77 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to their forecast, this bullish upward trend will
continue next year, and property prices are expected to rise by a
further 10 to 15 percent. By mid-1997 prices for most residential
buildings will be able to regain their historical high recorded in
1994.

<P>
BAGHDAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice-President Taha
Yassin Ramadan opened here today the 29th Baghdad International
Fair with the participation of 16 countries and 45 multinational
companies.
</P>
<P>
Various products from different countries including food,
medicine, industrial and agricultural machinery are on display in
the Baghdad International Fair complex. Most of the products are
expected to be donated to the Iraqis suffering from more than six
years of trade sanctions imposed by the U.N. to punish its August
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Among the leading foreign and Arab countries attending the
current trade fair are China, Russia, India, South Korea, Poland,
Romania, Austria, Turkey, Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The participating companies are competing to win their trade
opportunities with Iraq under the oil-for-food deal signed by
Iraq and the United Nations in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Four Chinese companies organized by the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade are taking part in the fair.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal was stalled over recent fightings
between two rival Kurdish factions in the Kurdish-inhabited
northern Iraq. The deal allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil in six months to buy food, medicine
and other humanitarian supplies for the sanctions-hit Iraqi
population.
</P>
<P>
A host of Iraqi government ministers and diplomats based here
were also present at the opening ceremony of the trade fair
which will last for 15 days.

<HEADLINE> Don't Let Race Debate Hurt Tourism, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian tourism
industry should not allow the current race debate to damage the
image of Australia, Federal Tourism Minister John Moore said
today.
</P>
<P>
Moore told the Annual Australian Tourism Conference in Perth,
West Australia, that the debate was "very unfortunate, the very
unfortunate debate on immigration is based on comments by
ill-informed individuals", according to a media release here.
</P>
<P>
"It has no regard to the damage that could be done to our
relationships with our neighbors and to our major industries. We
should be united in our condemnation of comments which undermine
Australia's international relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the conference that the government would do
all it could to ensure that Australia remained safe, secure and
welcoming. Federal Parliament has passed a bipartisan motion on
Wednesday affirming Australia's non-discriminatory immigration
policy and denouncing racial intolerance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after the appeal made by leaders of tourist groups
for ending the racism debate yesterday, leading property
consultant Jones Lang Wootton (JLW) today said that the debate
about anti-Asian immigration must not be prolonged.
</P>
<P>
JLW said in a statement that attacks on Asian immigration by
Independent MP Pauline Hanson threatened Australia's billion
dollars commercial property market. Her comments were out of step
with moves by Australian business to strengthen Asian links.
</P>
<P>
"Asian investors are now an important investor class, which in
some instances has rivaled and outpaced local institutions and
property trusts".
</P>
<P>
From January 1990 to October 1996, Asian investors accounted
for 20 percent of Australia's 39.2 billion Australian dollars
(31.36 billion US dollars) purchases of office, retail, industrial
and hotel commercial property.

MOGADISHU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Somali warlord Ali Mahdi
Mohamed last night called on rival factional leaders in south
Mogadish to Keep restraint and check the new round of
fighting which, he said, would further separate the Somali
people.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi's call came as hostilities between some of the
signatories of the Nairobi peace deal seemed escalated.
</P>
<P>
At least six people died and 11 others were injured in heavy
mortar and artillery exchange of fire between the militiamen of
Osman Atto and those of Hussein Aidid in south Mogadishu last
night.
</P>
<P>
The deafening shelling which mainly fell on the residential
areas of Hodon,Hawlwadag and Wadajir districts in south
Mogadishu, terrified many inhabitants to flee their houses to
nearby concrete buildings for shelter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more serious clashes occurred last night in the
southem region of Lower Jubba when the forces of Hussein Aidid
overrun a militia base belonging to Osman Atto at Mugambo
Village, 60 km north of Kismaio Town. Forces of Hussein Aidid
killed nine of Osman Atto's men and confiscated two technicals
together with a communication radio.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in the Jubba Valley is continuing and both sides
are sending reinforcement to the valley.
</P>
<P>
Politicians here believe that the recent consecutive massacres
in Mogadishu and the capture of the 50 km airstrip in Middle
Shabelle by Osman Atto's forces on October 30 had triggered the new
round of fighting.

<P>
XINING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai
province has reported a record harvest of 1.225 billion kilograms
of grain this year, 80 million kilograms more than last year.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official attributed the good harvest to the
government's policy of raising the grain purchase prices early
this year and awarding those who produced more grain with chemical
fertilizer, sending officials and scientists to rural areas to
help farmers with farming, and the ideal weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that areas for grain production this year
reached 402,000 hectares, up 12,000 hectares over 1995.

<HEADLINE> Antiques, Art Works Market Thriving in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- In more and more Chinese
families, the color TV set that for so long was the focal point of
the drawing-room has been replaced by antiques with hundreds of
years of history.
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese capital, auctions are held nearly once a month to
meet the demands of thousands of eager antique-lovers.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of a just-closed auction of ancient snuff bottles
called the event "extremely successful." And large public auctions
are held frequently to sell the famous Rongbao Art, where about
400 pieces are bought at each sale.
</P>
<P>
A senior employee with the Rongbao Art auctions said that the
prices of these items are mostly affordable for the average
Beijing family: the lowest price offered for a calligraphy work of
Hong Yi, a well-known monk who lived more than half a century ago,
was 250 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that at an auction they conducted this June, 452
antiques and pieces of art were sold, with sales reaching 160,000
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This would have been unbelievable 20 or even ten years ago," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rongbao Art, a cultural enterprise with more than 300 employees,
is widely known as the "window of traditional Chinese art." The
organization is located in Liulichang, an area in Beijing where a
special cultural market was established at the beginning of this
century.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the Beijing Municipal Government built a "cultural
street" which includes a number of antique shops, art bookstores,
traditional Chinese musical instrument shops and galleries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jin has run an antique shop there for almost six years.
At first, he said, most of his clients were foreigners and
overseas Chinese, but now local Chinese are also big buyers. He
attributed this to the increased income of many Chinese and the
country's improved cultural environment.
</P>
<P>
Gao Zongyuan, Rongbao's general manager, said that their yearly
sales volume from art has exceeded 50 million yuan, or six million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past, many antiques and art works flowed from
the inland to Hong Kong, bringing in higher prices. But since 1994
this trend has been reversed.
</P>
<P>
He said this is because the reform and opening-up has brought
greater awareness of art collecting, and more and more individuals
as well as companies now see antique collecting as a safe and
highly-profitable investment.
</P>
<P>
Major Chinese cities such as Xi'an, Shanghai and Tianjin have
been encouraged to develop similar cultural streets devoted to art
and antiques.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Its Army Fighting in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Foreign Minister Eriya
Kategaya has dismissed Zaire's accusation that its army is
fighting alongside Tutsi rebels in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"The Zairean leadership is just trying to externalize an
internal problem," Kategaya, who doubles as second deputy prime
minister, told the New Vision paper yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has no interest in Zaire and is worried about the
refugee influx from Zaire only, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya's statement wass made in response to Zairean
Information Minister Boguo Makeli who told Reuter yesterday "We
have evidence to prove that the Ugandan army has entered the fray
near Beni" in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 Tutsi people settled down in eastern Zaire 200
years ago, and some of them took up arms to fight Zairean troops
who want to drive them back to Rwanda, and allegedly defeated the
Zaireans and seized towns and even the capitals of two provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to a Reuter report, Boguo claimed that the Uganda
People's Defense forces have entered the battlefields to back the
Tutsi rebels in fighting Zairean troops in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Zaire charged that troops of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi joined
hands with the rebels in a bid to take over a 1,000 km strip of
Zairean territory with 15 battalions to accomplish the goal.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Probe Its Education Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha yesterday inaugurated a 25-member committee to
examine the country's higher education policy.
</P>
<P>
The move comes shortly after the ending of a six-month-long
strike by university teachers nationwide, demanding improved
working conditions and better funding of universities.
</P>
<P>
The teachers ended their strike last week under pressure of
students and parents without their demands satisfied.
</P>
<P>
Abacha said new policies and strategies are required to deal
with the new problems of higher education, as the old polices and
strategies used in the 1960s and 1970s are no longer relevant to
the country's higher institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the government perceives education as a potent and
dynamic instrument for national development and social
transformation and charged the committee to come out with a
blueprint for the management of higher education in Nigeria in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the decision in late 1970s to abolish tuition
fees in universities had triggered off explosion in the number
of students and also deprived universities of a legitimate source
of revenue to meet the shortfall in government funding.
</P>
<P>
He blamed university teachers for becoming progressively
politicians, unionized and confrontational, adding that despite
government's effort to pacify them, they continued to make new
demands.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Grape Exports Plummet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' grape exports this
year have plummeted in face of international competition even
though production was one of the best, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
1996 has proven to be the worst year for exports as
traditional markets in Europe are increasingly turning to new
varieties from Italy and Spain, the Commerce Committee at House
of Representatives was told.
</P>
<P>
MP Doros Theodorou said that Cypriot grapes were of poorer
quality, but high costs have made grape growers unwilling to sell
at cheaper prices.
</P>
<P>
Exports have fallen from 5,275 tons last year to 4,868 this
year -- less than half the 10,000 ton figure typical only a few
years ago, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Another problem cited was packaging: grapes were often packed
at 45 degrees Celsius, thus damaging the quality.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that the government will study the
situation and a decision has already been made to compensate the
producers.
</P>
<P>
Grape has been a traditional export commodity for this eastern
Mediterranean island, earning the country foreign exchange.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Statistics Shows Gloomy Year for Thai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The latest figures released by
the central bank of Thailand have indicated gloomy economic
prospects this year for the country, which has been entwined with
both political and economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months, the country's exports, a major
foreign exchange earner, grew only 2.4 percent from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
even though the Ministry of Commerce's calculation, based on a
different method, was 3.1 percent up for the same period, it
certainly fell far below the projected target.
</P>
<P>
In July, the Bank of Thailand, which is the central bank,
readjusted downward its export growth to 10.2 percent, from 18
percent forecast late last year.
</P>
<P>
compared with august of last year, export volume dropped by 1.1
percent and import was down by 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although export in the said month rose 6.2 percent from July
because of slight pick-up of fresh and frozen shrimp, rubber,
machinery, sugar and textiles, there was no evident signal of a
further upturn, according to Kleo-Thong Hetrakul, director of the
central bank's Economic Research Department.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the current account deficit will be higher than
the bank's projection, at 8.1 percent of the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
Current account balance improved slightly in the said month due
to marginal changes in the trade balance and an increase in the
services account from tourism revenue and investment income. The
deficit was 29.3 billion baht (1.17 billion US dollars) in August,
far below the peak of 49.6 billion baht (1.98 billion dollars) in
April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economic activity is showing signs of a continuing
slowdown, with private investment index recording an 8 percent
growth from the past year, a relatively low rate due to slowing
imports of machinery and capital equipment for construction,
statistics of the bank indicated.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital inflow was only a net 36 billion us dollars,
reflecting a continuing slowdown trend.
</P>
<P>
Money conditions in September were also tight, resulting from
foreign capital outflows due to the slump in the Stock Exchange of
Thailand and payment of corporate tax.
</P>
<P>
A good sign is that the balance of payments in September
showed a surplus of 8.6 billion baht (344 million dollars),
against a 2.6 billion baht (104 million dollar) surplus in August.
</P>
<P>
With the general election set to take place in mid-November,
it is believed that the new government will not be able to create
a miracle within the one and a half months before the year ends to
meet the various economic projections.

</P>
<P>
"We must be prepared to face any eventuality and Malaysia's
commitment to international calls for ensuring peace in the world
is one of the tests of our abilities," he said.

Malaysia needs a lean, compact and credible armed forces with
a high degree of mobility, sufficient punch and fire-power as well
as readiness to react to any outbreak of conflict in any part of
the country, he said.

<P>
"It must be strong though not necessarily threatening, but
adequate to discourage the development of any aggressive
intentions toward us," the minister added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Ensures Fast Compensation for Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Workers
</P>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 1 (Xinhua) -- All legal foreign workers
except domestic maids in Malaysia are ensured speedy compensation
effective today against work-related accidents without the need
for litigation under a new scheme.
</P>
<P>
Employers are compelled to buy the insurance covering
disablement and death under the scheme, made possible by
amendments to the Workers Compensation Act 1952, Human Resources
Minister Lim Ah Lek announced here today.
</P>
<P>
London and Pacific Insurance Company has been appointed as the
insurer under the scheme, he told reporters after launching the
ministry's Quality Day here.
</P>
<P>
The insurer has given an undertaking not to dispute the amount
of compensation assessed by the Labor Department and to make
payments within seven days of receiving the assessment, he said.
</P>
<P>
This special scheme will ensure 100 percent accountability on
the part of the appointed insurer to fulfill its responsibility in
settling all claims for compensation by workers, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The annual premium for the special scheme has been fixed at
120 Ringgit (about 48 US dollars) and it cannot be revised without
approval from the Human Resources Minister.
</P>
<P>
The premium must be paid by the employers, and not the
workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The scheme has also seen a rise of 20-25 percent in the
compensation rate.
</P>
<P>
The new compensation rate for fatal accidents is a lump sum
payment equivalent to the worker's 60 months' income or 18,000
Ringgit (about 7,200 US dollars), whichever is lower. The old rate
is 45 months' income or 14,400 Ringgit (about 5,760 US dollars),
whichever is lower.
</P>
<P>
For accidents causing permanent total disablement, the new
rate is 23,000 Ringgit (about 9,200 US dollars) compared to the
old rate of 19,200 Ringgit (about 7,680 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
For temporary disablement, the workers are entitled to
half-monthly payments of 165 Ringgit (about 66 US dollars) or
one-third of their monthly pay, whichever is lower. The old rate
is half-monthly payments of 135 Ringgit (about 54 US dollars) or
one-third of their monthly pay, whichever is lower.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the scheme also offered some extra benefits
without additional premiums, which include an ex gratia payment of
2,000 Ringgit (about 800 US dollars) in the event of a worker's
death that is work-related and a maximum payment of 20,000 Ringgit
(about 8,000 US dollars) for death or permanent total disablement
resulting from accidents occurring outside working hours.
</P>
<P>
Another new benefit is a maximum payment of 4,800 Ringgit
(about 1,920 US dollars) in repatriation cost in the event of
death or permanent total disablement.
</P>
<P>
Workers covered under the scheme will be issued with
identification cards in colors according to the sectors they are
working in, the minister said.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States has not
taken or recommended any action against Malaysian Oil Corporation
Petronas for its investment in Iran, the US Embassy said here
today.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that media reports that a US government
"sanctions committee" responsible for implementing the Iran-Libya
Sanctions Act had recommended action against Petronas were false.
</P>
<P>
"No 'sanctions committee' has been established, " the
statement said, adding the media reports referred to a statement
by a Congressional aide who had expressed his own views.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, the US has threatened to
impose sanctions on non-US firms that invest 40 million US dollars
or more a year in the oil and gas sectors of the two West Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Petronas, Malaysia's national oil corporation, has a 30
percent stake in the Sirri A and E fields in Iran which have
recoverable reserves of 600 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
The total investment required to develop the two oil fields
was estimated to be 600 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said yesterday
Malaysia would not submit to US dictation while Minister of
International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz said Malaysia would
raise the issue of the US intending to sanction Petronas at
international forums like the forthcoming Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) meeting in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Electrical Companies to Enter China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Germany's electrical industry
intends to increase exports of electrical equipment to China, as
well as boosting investment in the country, especially in the
power plant sector.
</P>
<P>
Olaf Henkel, president of the Federation of German Industries,
said here today that Germany's electrical enterprises had a
growing interest in the Chinese market. Henkel is in Beijing at
the 6th International Exhibition on Energy and Power.
</P>
<P>
The five-day showcase event, starting October 29, has attracted
nearly 30 German electrical enterprises involved in power station
equipment, control systems and technology sectors.
</P>
<P>
Germany has attached great importance to the exhibition, which
is helping provide a good opportunity for Germany's electrical
enterprises to expand their business in China, Henkel said in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
It is crucial for China to improve power station construction,
and to increase energy supplies to guarantee the country's
sustained economic development, added Henkel.
</P>
<P>
China's power and energy industry has been opened to overseas
investors, and the country has made progress in improving
construction of power stations in the country's resource-rich
areas. This has encouraged overseas investors to increase
investment in the country's power and energy sector, said Henkel.
</P>
<P>
Germany's enterprises are giving priority in China to
transferring technologies involved in power station building,
electricity transmission and environment protection, in order to
help the country tap its rich coal reserves for the development of
power and energy industry, Henkel said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he added, Germany's enterprises are also investing
in China's hydro power sector, to help China ease its dependence
on coal-fueled electricity generation.
</P>
<P>
China had imported a total of 1.5 billion Deutsche Marks worth
of electrical products from Germany by the end of last
year. Germany is now Europe's largest trade partner with China.
</P>
<P>
In addition to trade with China, Germany's electrical
enterprises have also increased their investments in
China. Siemens AG has invested more than 300 million US dollars in
China, setting up 35 enterprises in the country. The company plans
to lift its investment in China to one billion US dollars by the
turn of the century, nearly 90 million US dollars of which will be
used in China's power and energy industry.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that Germany will increase investments in China
this year, with contracted investment estimated to reach four
billion US dollars, equal to the total of Germany's investment in

<HEADLINE> More Funds For Poor Areas in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 1 (Xinhua) -- China is to raise its present
annual help-the-poor loans of 5.5 billion yuan (one U.S. dollars
equals to 8.3 yuan) to 8.5 billion yuan from the start of next
year.
</P>
<P>
It is part of a nationwide drive to cut down the number of
people living in poverty - now standing at 65 million.
</P>
<P>
A national conference on help-the-poor and development credit
work, sponsored by Agricultural Development Bank of China (ADBC),
heard that western areas of the country will get more of the
funds. The conference closed today in Guiyang, capital of
southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yuanliang, governor of ADBC, said that as China pushes
ahead with its "help-the-poor through development projects"
scheme, the proportion of credit funding has been increasing in
its financial input for the program.
</P>
<P>
China drafted a plan in 1994 to provide 80 million poor people
with adequate food and clothing by the end of this century. By
1995, the poor population in the country had dropped to 65 million.
</P>
<P>
The China's central government has attached great importance to
aid-to-the-poor work, and the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and the State Council held a meeting on
aid-to-the-poor work in Beijing recently, calling for increased
funds for help-the-poor program.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, ADBC bears an important responsibility toward
increasing the financial input for aid-to-the-poor. ADBC, a
policy-making bank set up in 1994, will offer 24.5 billion yuan to
aid-to-the-poor projects by the end of this year, and the amount
will be increased to 33 billion yuan by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Aid-to-the-poor funds in China mainly consist of bank loans,
financial allocations, and giving relief by providing labor.
</P>
<P>
Credit provided by the Agricultural Development Bank of China
now accounts for 51 percent of the total amount of aid-to-the-poor
funds, and by 1997, the proportion will rise to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that while increasing the volume of loans, it is also
necessary to understand and guide the orientation of the credits
for aid-to-the-poor.
</P>
<P>
Most of China's remaining poor population are distributed in
the western areas of the country, and poor people living in
southwest account for more than a half of the country's total poor
population.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, ADBC will give greater priority to southwest and
northwest provinces and autonomous regions in the issue of
help-the-poor loans, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Guizhou Province will get more aid as the
country's total funds for aid-to-the-poor increases next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ADBC will also increase its loans for comprehensive
agricultural development in Guizhou.

<P>
HANOI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The representatives of Vietnamese
National Assembly have expressed their concerns with the situation
of law enforcement in Vietnam, Vietnamese News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The representatives voiced their concerns about negative
phenomena in law execution bodies such as the high rate of unfair
trials and the violation of law by law enforcement personnel. Many
representatives were questioning the responsibility and efforts of
the inspectorate branch.
</P>
<P>
A number of deputies were worried about the current situation
in the guarding of prisons which have seen the escape of five
inmates on death row, 24 serving life sentence and 1,300 sentenced
to between five and 20 years in prison, according to the news
agency.
</P>
<P>
In the group discussion Thursday, representatives pointed out
that the national assembly's inspection of government agencies in
law execution was not carried out well.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said many representatives suggested a law on
anti-corruption was needed to effectively curb the vice. Others
proposed a national assembly anti-corruption committee be set up
at the same time along with the building up of the law in the
coming 11th session.

<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- 956 Sino-foreign joint ventures
were set up in China's 13 bonded areas in the first nine months of
this year, statistics from the Central Administration of Customs
show today.
</P>
<P>
The newly built joint ventures have secured a total contractual
value of about 940 million US dollars, and attracted an actual
investment of 463 million US dollars. Investments by 22 of the
firms has exceeded five million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The import and export value of the bonded areas in the first
three quarters of the year totalled 2.82 billion US dollars,
almost 35 percent more than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The 13 listed areas are located in Waigaoqiao area of Shanghai,
Tianjin Port, Dalian, Zhangjiagang, Shatoujiao and Futian in
Shenzhen, Haikou, Xiangyu in Xiamen, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Ningbo,
Shantou and Hainan Yangpu Economic Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11,900 overseas-funded enterprises, and 5,900
domestic firms, had settled in the 13 bonded areas by the end of
last year. The majority features export-oriented, or
technological-intensive production and trade.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists hold that the bonded areas serve as a bridge
to make market operations in China identical to those of other
countries, as they follow international practice and enjoy more
preferential government policies.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, investment environments and management in the
13 bonded areas have been greatly improved. They have invested 6.5
billion yuan building infrastructure projects, and leveled five
million square meters of land for building factory workshops,
warehouses and other projects.
</P>
<P>
Waigaoqiao bonded area in Shanghai, the largest of its kind in
the country, has adopted a computer system in office management.
</P>
<P>
To provide every convenience for foreign investors, many bonded
areas have simplified application procedures, and offered one-stop
consultation, evaluation and taxation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, investors swarmed in, and last year alone a dozen
countries opened companies in the bonded areas.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, the highest governing body in China, is
drawing up a unified customs management system in bonded areas
across China. Its aim is to enhance the functions of the bonded
areas, said an official from the Central Administration of

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Reconsiders Arms Sale to Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
is reviewing its recent decision to sell about 19.3 million
U.S. Dollars worth of arms to the Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad confirmed this yesterday in
parliament after South African special representative to Burundi, Welile
Hlapo, said last week that the government should reconsider delivering
arms to Rwanda because of the renewed fighting.
</P>
<P>
The National Conventional Arms Control Committee whih decides on
arms exports, announced recently that it had decided to authorise the
sale of "certain defensive materials" to the Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
Defence Minister Joe Modise told parliament this week that the
value of the arms sale is 19.3 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
He refused to say what types of arms were to be sold.
</P>
<P>
Hlapo suggested in a radio interview last week that the rapidly
unfolding conflict on the eastern Zairean border had overtaken
South Africa's decision to sell the arms to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the decision on October 23 had "come at the
wrong time", Hlapo said.
</P>
<P>
However, Pahad said in a interview yesterday that no decision had
yet been taken. The government had called in Rwanda's ambassador to
South Africa two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister insisted his government's army was not
involved in the fighting in eastern Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Ancient County Town Listed in World Heritage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese county town where time
has stood still for hundreds of years has joined the world's elite
- as an important heritage site.
</P>
<P>
What makes Pingyao important is that it looks today just as it
did during the reign of Emperors of China's Ming and Qing
dynasties (1368-1911).
</P>
<P>
None of the elderly people living in Pingyao imagined that
their small county town could attract the attention of the United
Nations. Or that the houses, where they have spent most of their
lives, could become part of the World Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the central part of north China's Shanxi Province,
Pingyao is the first county of its kind to be included as part of
world's cultural heritage. It is the only place in the country
well-preserved as a complete county town from the Ming and Qing
dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a brick city wall, the small city covers an area
of 2.25 square kilometers, is teeming with old shops, temples,
houses and streets of an ancient style. Some 42,000 people live in
the old town.
</P>
<P>
Local people became active in carefully protecting their living
space, particularly when the central and local governments started
to apply for the town to join the elite of the world's heritage.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Guo Huairen, a sixth generation shop owner, sponsored
the setting up of a non-official society for protection of the
town. Now it has a membership of more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the society come from all walks of life, including
housewives," Guo said.
</P>
<P>
In Pingyao, there are more than a dozen other non-governmental
organizations, like Guo's, which have become a key force in
protecting and repairing the cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
One of them, the Cultural Relics Association, raised 120,000
yuan in 1991 to pay for the repair of two temples in the town.

<HEADLINE> Wan Guoquan Meets Hong Kong Toys Manufacturers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The toymakers of Hong Kong have
vowed to play their part in helping a smooth transition of their
area to Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
It is an industry with a high world-wide reputation - and a
major export winner, Wan Guoquan, vice-chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), was told today in Beijing during his meeting
with a delegation from the Toys Manufacturers' Association of Hong
Kong, led by its President Dr. C. L. Luk.
</P>
<P>
Wan said the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong is a concern
shared by all Chinese people both at home and overseas.
</P>
<P>
China's inland areas and Hong Kong will try their best to
achieve this target, because it is in the interests of both sides,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said toy manufacturing in Hong Kong is a trade of fine
prospects, and it has played a positive role in promoting the
economic prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his hope that Hong Kong's toys manufacturers will
continue to work for the prosperity of the region.
</P>
<P>
Luk said Hong Kong's toy manufacturing enjoyed a great prestige
worldwide, with its export volume ranking the third in Hong Kong
for decades.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of establishing his association last March was to
gather together Hong Kong's toy manufacturers, and make
contribution to maintain a smooth transition of Hong Kong and
promote common prosperity of China's inland areas and Hong Kong,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Toy manufacturers of Hong Kong have set up more than 3,000
factories in the inland areas, employing one million workers. Last
year, their total export volume exceeded 77.7 billion HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in Beijing last Wednesday, to introduce
the development of the toy manufacturing industry in Hong Kong,
and increase mutual understanding and co-operation with related
departments in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, the delegation members visited some
relevant departments, including Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation, General Administration of Customs, State
Administration of Taxation, and China National Council of Light
Industry. They are scheduled to leave for Shanghai tomorrow.

<P>
South Street, which is 440 meters long and features the
architecture and the living style of local people in the Ming and
Qing Dynasties, has 78 old shops.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are still in operation, with peddlers hawking
their wares along the street, and flags flying at the gates of
some bars and tea houses.
</P>
<P>
Among them is Guo's shop, which started to sell desserts, wine
and sundry goods 300 hundred years ago.
</P>
<P>
It is a typical architecture designed in the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644), with its fore-part as shopping area and back-part as
a mill. It has not only attracted local people, but many foreign
customers.
</P>
<P>
The county town of Pingyao can be traced back to more than
2,700 years ago, but it took its present form in the Ming and Qing
dynasties. The majority of families have lived in the town for
over 150 years.
</P>
<P>
In Fanjiajie street, there are two compounds with houses around
a square courtyard in Ming Dynasty style. With the owners of these
houses changing several times over a period of 300 years, the
houses have remained the same.
</P>
<P>
"I will not change the curved glass with paintings, because
they are cultural relics left by our ancestors," owner of one of
the houses said proudly.
</P>
<P>
At 25 Stone Slope Street, live heirs of an important business
man from ancient Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
"Two of my children found jobs in the province's capital after
their graduation, and live in the high-rise apartments there. But
their homes are not as good as ours -- it is cool in summer and
warm in winter," said Zhang, the third generation of the
businessman.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the old style, the construction workers of the town
have abided by the principle of copying the ancient patterns. Many
of the houses, which have been repaired, and installed modern
utilities inside, look as if they were built hundreds years ago.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-funded Aircraft Engine Maintenance Training Center Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGHAN (Sichuan), November 1 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-foreign
aircraft engine maintenance training center involving world-class
engine makers opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Jointly funded by the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC), GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE) of the United States, and Snecma
of France, the center is aimed at training maintenance personnel
for CF6 and CFM56 engines used for Boeing and Airbus aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The CF6 engine is a product of GE, and the CFM56 engine is made
by a joint venture between GE and Snecma. GE aircraft engines make
up about 40 percent of China's market, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
The new training facility, located within the China Aviation
Flight Institute, covers 4,020 square meters, including a 1,134
sq. m engine maintenance exhibit hall capable of accommodating eight
large engines.
</P>
<P>
Within a five-year term of cooperation, the center plans to
train 2,200 to 2,600 aircraft engine personnel in China.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign companies have already provided equipment worth
a total of 17 million US dollars to the center. They will also
cover operational costs and provide two full-time teachers,
according to David Voeller, the general manager of the GEAE South
Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
The courses taught in the center will be the same as those
available in the companies' training centers in the US and France,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Public Fund for Housing Popular in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 1 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The establishment of
public funds for housing, a key task for China's housing reform in
urban areas, is now being widely implemented in the country's
towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
The progress was spelled out at a national training course on
fund management in housing reform, sponsored the Housing Reform
Office of the State Council, and held in Shenyang, capital of
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Previously, houses and flats were distributed among workers as
part of an enterprise's welfare program, leaving a heavy burden
both on the state and on the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The goal of China's housing reform is to realize
commercialization and socialization of housing, and the key task
for the reform is to establish a new housing fund operation
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Currently in China, public funding for housing is raised by an
enterprise (or institution) drawing a certain amount of every
employee's monthly salary, and laying it aside as the employee's
share of the fund.
</P>
<P>
According to the information, in Shanghai, which took the lead
in introducing public funds for housing in 1991, a total of 33,628
entities have been practising public funding for housing, and 4.63
million workers have participated in the program, accounting for
98 percent of the city's total number of employees.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of last June, 9.402 billion yuan had been raised
under the public fund for housing.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai experience has proved that the public housing fund
has played a positive role in accelerating the city's housing
construction, and improving the living conditions of workers.
</P>
<P>
Officials responsible for housing reform from Shanghai
disclosed that half of the investment for housing in the city this
year came from the city's public housing fund.
</P>
<P>
Successful stories from a number of cities, such as Nanjing,
Taiyuan and Shenyang, were also reported at the training course.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Housing Reform Office under the State
Council, added that they have earmarked Guilin in Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, Yichang in Hubei Province and Xuzhou in Jiangsu
Province, for experiments in standard management of public housing
funds.

<HEADLINE> Israel Says Egypt Avoiding Inviting Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's decision of not
inviting government heads to a regional economic conference was
aimed at excluding Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu,
Israeli officials were quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
"Within the last week, Egypt decided not to invite heads of
government due to the poor regional climate," a key official was
quoted by the English daily The Jerusalem Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Netanyahu had publicly expressed
interest in attending the meeting slated for mid-November, Egypt
felt this was not the time to invite Netanyahu who was blamed for
the rising tension in the region, another senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny confirmed
that heads of government would not be invited, but he denied any
link between the decision and the regional atmosphere or any
interest in excluding Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"There is no political issue behind it. We would like to
concentrate on the economic issues, so we invited the
ministerial level," he said.
</P>
<P>
An official in the Prime Minister's Office also sought to
downplay the fact that Netanyahu would not be invited. He said
there was a need to build economic cooperation even during a
period of political turbulence.
</P>
<P>
This marks the first time since the annual economic
conference started in Casablanca, Morocco, in 1994 that
government heads are not invited. Therefore, the Cairo meeting
is now being called an "economic conference" rather than the
originally named "economic summit."
</P>
<P>
Egypt had been waiting for Israel's implementation of its
troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron before
deciding to downgrade the political representation at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Palestine have so far failed to reach a deal on
carrying out the Hebron redeployment after three weeks of
intensive talks, which resumed in the wake of the bloodshed late
September. The main dispute is over Israel's demand for security
arrangement changes to the signed agreement on Hebron
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Still, a high-level Israeli delegation is expected to
participate in the Cairo conference, led by Foreign Minister
David Levy, Finance Minister Dan Meridor, Trade and Industry
Minister Natan Sharansky and Communications Minister Limor
Livnat.
</P>
<P>
Many Arab and Israeli economists said that unless the peace
process remained on track, significant regional economic
cooperation will not be possible.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo economic conference follows the Amman economic
summit last year, which envisioned future regional economic
cooperation and development to grow in the region, which lags
behind in a fast-growing world because of long history of
tension and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
However, the prospects for future economic cooperation and
development are dimmed since the Israeli hardline Likud
government took over power in June. The peace process is stalled
on all tracks, and the stalemate has already led to a tragic
bloodshed late September that killed 75 people.

<HEADLINE> China Promotes Patriotism Education in Primary, Middle Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- One hundred of China's most
famous places, including Tian'anmen Square, the Chairman Mao
Memorial Hall, and the China Science and Technology Museum, were
designated as patriotism education bases here today.
</P>
<P>
They were jointly designated by the State Education Commission
(SEC), the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, the
State Bureau of Cultural Relics, the Communist Youth League of
China, and the General Political Bureau of the People's Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
The 100 patriotism education bases are part of the group of
projects known as the "Four Hundred," which were launched by the
SEC and other departments and ministries.
</P>
<P>
Prior to these, the Propaganda Department of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the SEC together
recommended to primary and middle schools across the country 100
outstanding movies and TV films related to patriotism, 100
patriotic songs and 100 books about patriotism education.
</P>
<P>
The 100 bases are required to give priority to organized groups
of visitors from primary or middle schools. Those who charge fees
should offer preferential treatment to teachers and students on
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Chinese vice-premier Li Lanqing noted in a written speech that
the focus of patriotism education should be on young people. CPC
branches and governments at all levels must pay attention to ways
in which young people can be better educated, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the content of today's patriotism education should
include the great achievements made in the modernization drive,
CPC history, China's modern history and contemporary history, the
basic condition of the country, fine traditions of the Chinese
nation and revolutionary traditions, ethnic unity and the unity of
the motherland, national defense and state security.
</P>
<P>
Li regarded the 100 bases as having precious spiritual wealth,
adding that they are of great significance in implementing the
spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central
Committee and improving the ethical and cultural quality of young
people.
</P>
<P>
The Sixth Plenary Session, held in Beijing from October 7-10,
adopted a resolution about promoting socialist ethical and
cultural progress nationwide.

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Article Stresses Importance of Rural Science (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- In a signed article carried in
today's "People's Daily," a senior official has stressed the
significance of boosting agriculture with science and education.
</P>
<P>
The official listed key matters that should be included in the
development drive, such as the research and spread of
agro-techniques, training of farmers, technical upgrading of rural
enterprises, boosting economic growth in poor areas, and deepening
the reform of agro-science mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The article was written by Wen Jiabao, an alternate member of
the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee and a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Since reform and opening-up, the total output of China's
agricultural products has achieved considerable increase, and one
major reason is that the research on agricultural science has made
marked progress," Wen said in his article.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since 1978, Chinese agro-technicians have
produced more than 20,000 rural scientific achievements and
cultivated over 1,000 new crop species which include hybrid rice
and hybrid corn.
</P>
<P>
However, Wen noted that China's rural science still cannot meet
the demand for overall rural development, and that China has a
long way to go in this regard compared with developed countries.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive plan should be worked out to make breakthroughs
in some key areas, especially the application of advanced
technology in agriculture, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The spread of advanced and practical rural technology based on
such a plan is key to realizing the country's agricultural
modernization, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
Since China's reform and opening-up, more than 6,000 practical
agricultural techniques have been publicized around the country's
rural areas. Nearly one million technical workers are contributing
to the spread of agricultural technologies.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the workers are responsible for familiarizing
farmers with fine crop species, water-saving irrigation, proper
fertilization, the control of plant diseases and pests, and
advanced cultivation methods.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Its Army Fighting in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Foreign Minister Eriya
Kategaya has dismissed Zaire's accusation that its army is
fighting alongside Tutsi rebels in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"The Zairean leadership is just trying to externalize an
internal problem," Kategaya, who doubles as second deputy prime
minister, told the New Vision paper yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has no interest in Zaire and is worried about the
refugee influx from Zaire only, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya's statement wass made in response to Zairean
Information Minister Boguo Makeli who told Reuter yesterday "We
have evidence to prove that the Ugandan army has entered the fray
near Beni" in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 Tutsi people settled down in eastern Zaire 200
years ago, and some of them took up arms to fight Zairean troops
who want to drive them back to Rwanda, and allegedly defeated the
Zaireans and seized towns and even the capitals of two provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to a Reuter report, Boguo claimed that the Uganda
People's Defense forces have entered the battlefields to back the
Tutsi rebels in fighting Zairean troops in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Zaire charged that troops of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi joined
hands with the rebels in a bid to take over a 1,000 km strip of
Zairean territory with 15 battalions to accomplish the goal.

<TEXT>
<P>
To achieve the goal, he noted that "we should pay great
attention to the technical training of rural laborers, and regard
improving farmers' quality as a major measure to revitalize
agriculture with science and education and develop modern
agriculture."
</P>
<P>
Wen called for the proper management of various kinds of
agricultural schools, and the reform of educational content and
teaching methods in rural elementary and secondary
schools. Scientific workers should also spread advanced
agricultural techniques in villages.
</P>
<P>
In impoverished areas particularly, publicizing practical rural
technology and raising the agricultural skills of farmers is the
key to solving the food and clothing shortages of poor farmers,
Wen wrote.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, rural businesses are a major component of the
national economy and a pillar of rural economy, and the
development of these businesses relies to a great extent on
technical upgrading, Wen noted.
</P>
<P>
Although there have appeared numerous large-scale and highly
efficient rural enterprises, many still get by with simple and
crude equipment and poor management, he said.
</P>
<P>
All rural enterprises should quicken their pace of technical
upgrading in order to make them more adaptable to the market and
raise their competitiveness, Wen noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the comprehensive development of crop growing,
livestock breeding, processing and marketing of rural products and
rural businesses, which are stimulated by advanced rural science,
should be utilized to step up the country's agricultural
modernization, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a country which has a large population with inadequate rural
resources and unbalanced resource distribution, arable land must
be protected, water conservation projects must be managed well,
and low-yielding farmland must be improved, according to Wen.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he added, the current system of rural scientific
research has to be reformed to fully display the initiative of
rural scientific workers. Scientific studies should be integrated
with practical production in the process of developing a market
economy, he pointed out.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israel not Interested in Russia's Mediating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has rejected Russia's mediating role in the
Mideast peace process, saying it was up to the concerned parties
to conduct direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after holding talks with visiting Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov Thursday night. Meanwhile,
Primakov denied that his country wanted to compete with the
U.S. in mediating peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging Russia as the co-sponsor of the Madrid
Conference held five years ago, Netanyahu pointed out that the
important thing was for the concerned parties to conduct direct
negotiations without outside intervenation
</P>
<P>
"I think that everyone recognizes, as recognizes Madrid
(Conference), it is up to the parties to negotiate directly
between themselves and I am sure this is understood by
everyone ... by the United States as well," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian
talks on Hebron redeployment, Netanyahu said even the U.S. role
was a temporary and facilitating one. He once again stressed the
importance of holding direct talks between the parties and "not
the in-between parties."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that Russia would do its utmost to help ease the
tension between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister, who had visited Syria, Lebanon
and Egypt before arriving here, reportedly brought a calming
message to Israel from Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the tense situation with Syria, Netanyahu said
the first thing should be easing tension and reducing escalation
of the crisis. "Following that I believe we can find ways to
renew the peace talks between Syria and Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said no country, including Russia, would support
Syria should it choose to launch a military attack. But he added
Moscow is convinced that Syria had no such intentions.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is the latest official to bring back calming
messages from Syria. The U.S. and France have also brought such
messages to Israel in recent days. Israel valued the assessment
by Russia who is the biggest weapon supplier to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is to travel to Gaza today to hold a meeting with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to discuss the
stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister's current Middle East tour,
which will also take him to Jordan, is regarded as an attempt to
increase its influence on the peace process to balance that of
the U.S..
</P>
<P>
However, both the U.S. and Israel rejected any other outside
involvement in the peace process, including Europe led by
France. In light of the dwindling of influence since the
collapse of the former Soviet Union and its domestic problems,
Russia is unlikely to play a more aggressive role to compete with
the U.S. in influencing the current Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Public Fund for Housing Popular in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of public
funds for housing, a key task for China's housing reform in urban
areas, is now being widely implemented in the country's towns and
cities.
</P>
<P>
The progress was spelled out at a national training course on
fund management in housing reform, sponsored the Housing Reform
Office of the State Council, and held in Shenyang, capital of
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Previously, houses and flats were distributed among workers as
part of an enterprise's welfare program, leaving a heavy burden
both on the state and on the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The goal of China's housing reform is to realize
commercialization and socialization of housing, and the key task
for the reform is to establish a new housing fund operation
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Currently in China, public funding for housing is raised by an
enterprise (or institution) drawing a certain amount of every
employee's monthly salary, and laying it aside as the employee's
share of the fund.
</P>
<P>
According to the information, in Shanghai, which took the lead
in introducing public funds for housing in 1991, a total of 33,628
entities have been practising public funding for housing, and 4.63
million workers have participated in the program, accounting for
98 percent of the city's total number of employees.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of last June, 9.402 billion yuan had been raised
under the public fund for housing.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai experience has proved that the public housing fund
has played a positive role in accelerating the city's housing
construction, and improving the living conditions of workers.
</P>
<P>
Officials responsible for housing reform from Shanghai
disclosed that half of the investment for housing in the city this
year came from the city's public housing fund.
</P>
<P>
Successful stories from a number of cities, such as Nanjing,
Taiyuan and Shenyang, were also reported at the training course.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Housing Reform Office under the State
Council, added that they have earmarked Guilin in Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, Yichang in Hubei Province and Xuzhou in Jiangsu
Province, for experiments in standard management of public housing
funds.

<HEADLINE> International General Merchandise Fair in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The third International General
Merchandise Fair opened Thursday in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan
Province, featuring the eye-catching Hong Kong Hall.
</P>
<P>
The largest exhibit at the event, the hall has 38 booths from
29 Hong Kong companies, which are displaying nearly 100 types of
commodities ranging from household electrical appliances and
garments to office products.
</P>
<P>
An executive for the China Trade Promotion under the Trade
Development Council (TDC) of Hong Kong said Hong Kong businessmen
are confident about the development prospects of southwest China's
market under the country's current efforts to vigorously develop
midwest areas.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu, as a hub of commerce, trade, transportation, science
and technology, telecommunications and goods, is the first and
most ideal location for Hong Kong businessmen trying their luck in
the southwest.
</P>
<P>
He said the TDC's Chengdu office handles a monthly average of
250 consultancies concerning two-way trade between interior areas
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The general merchandise fair offers an opportunity to Hong Kong
businessmen to display their commodities to their southwest
Chinese clients, he said, adding that in time, more and more Hong
Kong businessmen will participate in the fair.
</P>
<P>
TDC statistics show that trade between interior areas and Hong
Kong has been growing rapidly. Last year, commodities worth 447
billion Hong Kong dollars were shipped from Hong Kong to the
interior areas, up 17 percent compared with that of the previous
year.

<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A major Chinese plant has a
plan to produce some four million solar energy collection
facilities per year by the end of the century, helping ease the
country's energy shortage.
</P>
<P>
The Solar Energy Electronic Plant of Qinghua University, the
largest of its kind in the world, turned out 650,000 all-glass
vacuum solar energy collectors last year. It will produce more
than one million in 1996, executives said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the factory's output value will
exceed one billion yuan (some 120 million US dollars), making it a
strong competitor in the international market.
</P>
<P>
The product, whose quality and function have passed
international appraisal, can be used to make hot water, desalinate
seawater and provide heat for crops.
</P>
<P>
China has been the world's largest coal user for thousands of
years. Recent economic expansion has caused a shortage of energy,
so the government and scientists are seeking substitutes,
including nuclear plants, to solve the problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A scientist today urged that
efforts be made to protect a 4.5-billion-year-old aerolite -- a
stony meteorite -- located in this capital city of northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
"No effective protection has been made for the ancient
meteorite for a long time, and it is already eroding," he said.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that the aerolite, the largest ever found in the
world, fell to the earth about 1.9 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Liaoning Geological and Mineral Bureau
found a huge "black stone" in the city's Dongling District, and
called it the "Shenyang Ancient Aerolite."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Haiting, a geologist from the bureau, said that over the
past decade the city has built several special parks and nature
reserves to protect it, attracting many scientists and tourists.
</P>
<P>
But it has become seriously eroded by weather damage, the
geologist said, and if no effective measures are taken to protect
it, sooner or later it will disappear.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a huge shelter, 100 meters long and 60 meters
wide, be built as a protective cover for the aerolite.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- International Business
Machines (IBM) has opened an east African regional office in
Nairobi to promote its business in the region, the East African
Standard newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted central Africa General Manager of the U.S.
computer giant Karsten Schoeneborn as saying the new venture
resulted from the IBM group's focus on emerging markets and the
existing potential in the Africa continent, especially the east
African region.
</P>
<P>
Business in the continent had dramatically changed and offered
attractive returns to investment, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi office of the U.S. firm will serve markets in
central and east Africa such as Kenya, Burundi, Djibouti,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The American multi-national computer firm pulled out its
operation in Africa 10 years ago and moved the region's
headquarters to Johannesburg in South Africa toward the end of
1994.
</P>
<P>
IBM set up two branch offices in Botswana and Zimbabwe last
year.

<HEADLINE> Midwest China Adjusting Export Commodity Structure (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Central and western Chinese
provinces and autonomous regions have given a major shake-up to
their export structures.
</P>
<P>
They have shifted the emphasis from resource exports to the
sale of high value-added products, and the efforts have already
borne fruit.
</P>
<P>
Information from the 80th Exports Commodities Fair, which has
just closed in Guangzhou, shows that export of high value-added
products has greatly increased compared with previous years. And
many of the new products at the fair, which netted more than 10
billion U.S. dollars worth of export deals, were from central and
western regions.
</P>
<P>
These regions abound with mineral resources, and have many high
quality raw materials. Due to a lack of funds, technology and
well-trained professionals, provinces and autonomous regions in
central and west China had long relied on exporting primary
products or roughly-processed products.
</P>
<P>
Di Rong, member of the delegation from the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region to the fair, explained that the export of
primary and roughly-processed products has poor economic returns,
as prices for such products are low in overseas markets despite
high transport fees. This greatly hinders the development of
foreign trade in the regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Di, the main export items of the region include
textile products, garments, coal, iron and livestock products.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Ningxia has made efforts to fully tap its
resources and to raise the level of processing mineral
products. The proportion of finished products in exports has risen
to the current 64 percent from 56 percent in 1994.

<P>
Shanxi Province, dubbed the "sea of coal", had primary products
and some roughly-processed products such as coal, coke and pig
iron as its traditional export commodities.
</P>
<P>
To improve economic efficiency of foreign trade, the province
has listed raising added-value of commodities as a work priority.
</P>
<P>
In coal development, Shanxi has been working hard to improve
processing standards for coal, and has increased the export of
clean coal and coke, which have higher prices on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
The province has also set a next goal for reducing export of
crude coal, as well as changing from sending coal to areas outside
the province to instead transmitting electricity.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, exports of electronics products and machinery
from the central and western regions have gained momentum.
</P>
<P>
Provinces such as Shanxi, Sichuan and Shaanxi, with complete
industrial sectors and many large machinery and power plants, have
accelerated their pace of technological upgrading and replacement
of equipment over the past few years, and have produced products
with stronger market competitiveness including lathes,
motor-driven tools and small machines.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an City, capital of Shaanxi Province, and the center for
economic life of northwest region, has a number of military
factories and scientific research institutes.
</P>
<P>
The city has made a full use of its sound industrial foundation
and advantages in science and technology, and has focused on
development of its electromechanical industry.
</P>
<P>
Export volumes of such industrial products as bearings and
complete sets of equipment make up 60 percent of the city's total
exports.
</P>
<P>
Central and western regions have also encouraged local
enterprises to conduct more cooperation with eastern and coastal
areas of the country, and have benefited from such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Products produced by joint ventures in the regions also sold
well at the 80th Guangzhou Export Commodities Fair.

<HEADLINE> Second Phase of China's Leading Nickel Base Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of China's
largest nickel production base has been completed in Jinchuan
City, in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Work on the second phase, which cost 2.3 billion yuan, will
double the annual nickel production at the plant.
</P>
<P>
The mining area, located in Jinchuan, is the second largest
multiple metal sulphide deposit in the world in terms of
reserves. Its output of nickel accounts for 88 percent of China's
total, and its platinum output makes up 90 percent of the national
total.
</P>
<P>
The mine produced 33,000 tons of nickel, 300 tons of cobalt,
20,000 tons of copper, 500 kg of rare metals, and 400,000 tons of
sulphuric acid in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 of the products reach quality assessments by the
province or the ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources. Among
them, grade 1 electrolytic nickel and sponge platinum, have won
the state gold medal. The quality of electrolytic
nickel-electrolytic cobalt, cobalt oxide have reached advanced
world levels.
</P>
<P>
Its nickel flash smelting production system is the first of its
kind in Asia, and the fifth in the world.
</P>
<P>
A dozen products have been exported to Japan, France, Iran and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Population Up, But Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's population is
continuing to grow - but at a slower rate compared with the start
of the 1990s, latest figures show.
</P>
<P>
According to a sample survey, the natural population growth
rate has continued to drop in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The birth rate was 7.92 per thousand and death rate 5.12 per
thousand in Beijing last year, with the natural growth rate
staying at 2.8 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
Compared with figures for 1990, the birth rate dropped by 6.09
per thousand, the death rate 1.16 per thousand, with the natural
growth rate 4.93 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
As there has been a big decrease in birth rate in the past five
years, with the average annual drop of 1.22 per thousand, the
natural population consequently has also seen a big drop.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute this to the local legalization of family
planning, tight reins on birth control, and modern attitudes
towards childbirth.
</P>
<P>
The experts predict that in the years to come, there will be
still a stable drop in the population growth.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the survey, the local population surpassed
12.5 million by the end of 1995, an increase of 1.65 million,
compared with the figure for 1990.
</P>
<P>
And there is an average of 3.15 people in each family in
Beijing, which now has a total of 82,100 families. Three-member
families account for over 40 percent of the city's total number of
families.
</P>
<P>
Among the working population, 47.91 percent of the people are
employed in the service sector, the survey says.

<HEADLINE> Society Established to Study Ancient Envoy to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A society was established
in China at the end of last month to study Xu Fu, a famous figure
who brought Chinese culture into Japan some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Xu, a Taoist priest in the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.), was sent
by Emperor Qinshihuang to seek "fairy lands" in the Pacific
Ocean. However, he and some 1,000 followers ultimately landed on
the islands now called Japan.
</P>
<P>
Xu and his fellow-travelers settled down there and began to
spread Chinese culture, teaching local people how to improve
agriculture and smelt copper and iron. Many Japanese still regard
Xu as the God of Harvest and hold memorial ceremonies for him.
</P>
<P>
The society is based in central China's Hebei Province, where Xu
is believed to have started his journey. However, some other
provinces have claimed they had found ancient ports which had some
connection with Xu.
</P>
<P>
The society will promote friendly relations between China and
Japan, according to its founders.

HUHHOT, November 1 (Xinhua) -- China plans to boost its wind
power industry after signing a range of contracts for the import
of equipment and technology, according to the State Economic and
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
China is stepping up technological progress and has exerted
more input into new energy projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, it will have built eight wind power
projects, costing 1.2 billion yuan, with a combined generating
capacity of 120,000 kilowatts, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Wind power industry in China is still in its fledging stage. By
the end of 1995, the country had a total generating capacity of
35,700 kilowatts, according to the commission.
</P>
<P>
China is rich in wind power resources. The potential resources
are as high as 253,000 megawatts, about 1.4 times the nation's
total existing generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
Electric power bureaus in east China's Zhejiang province, Inner
Mongolia and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions have signed
contracts with Danish companies to build joint ventures in the
areas to produce wind power generator parts.

DHAKA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) closed
the trading week on Thursday with extremely aggressive bull face
as the all share price index sharply increased by some 793 points
over single six days.
</P>
<P>
The market resumed on Saturday with the index at 2,193.9 points
and the week closed on Thursday with the index at all-time high
2,986.2 points. The market also witnessed the growth in turnovers
in both volume and value.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the total market capitalization increased from
the level of 150 billion taka (about 3.75 billion US dollars) to
the level of 210 billion taka (about 5.25 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to some market observers, the secret of the present
surge lies in the heavy influx of new investors into the market.
Despite cautions and warnings of speculation, the investors kept
on putting money into this gambling over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
To avoid possible market crash, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), the regulatory body, last month introduced
so-called circuit breaker -- a system under which price movements
of an issue are restricted within 10 percent from the previous
day's closing price either way.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, market analysts claimed that only the government's
prompt steps relating to increase of flow of securities in the
primary market can offer the best prop for the sustainable growth
of the securities market of Bangladesh.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Dengue fever claimed another
six lives on Thursday while 175 new cases were admitted to various
hospitals in the Indian capital of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dengue patients from all over the city as well as
the neighboring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh continued to
flock to hospitals for treatment, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from dengue fever now rose to 312 and the total
number of affected patients admitted to different hospitals of
Delhi ever since the epidemic began two months ago has nearly
reached the 8,000 figure. The exact number is 7,940 cases,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
In a major policy decision, the Delhi state government on
Thursday took over with immediate effect seven of the nine local
hospitals being run by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi in a bid
to improve health care services in wake of the dengue epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken in view of the fact that these hospitals
had the potential of being developed into much larger medical care
units that could take some of the burden off the major government
hospitals in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi state government will now upgrade these local
hospitals into 100-bed hospitals with expansion and improvement of
their services as well as their infrastructure.

WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Secret Service has
broken up an alleged credit-card fraud ring and arrested 32
people, the Treasury Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made on Wednesday after a five-month

</P>
<P>
Charges brought against the suspected Nigerians included
counterfeiting and trafficking in American Express cards and
conspiring to commit fraud.

<HEADLINE> Curfew Ordered After Violent Protest in U.S. City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- A dusk-to-dawn curfew began
Thursday in Leland, Mississippi, after one night of broken windows
and fires set by a crowd protesting the shooting death of a black
man.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said the violence erupted after the
group marched Wednesday night to the police headquarters in an
effort to meet with officials about the October 17 shooting.
</P>
<P>
It began about 9:30 p.m. and ended about 90 minutes later
when local police and state law enforcement got the situation
under control.
</P>
<P>
About 10 businesses had their window fronts destroyed, several
police vehicles were damaged by rocks, and a police officer's
house was pelted with stones and bricks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There were no major injuries reported, but one person was
arrested for allegedly throwing rocks.
</P>
<P>
The crowds were protesting the death of Aaron White, owner of a
television repair shop. The 29-year black man died from a gunshot
wound in the head after he allegedly fled from police because his
car was involved in a traffic accident, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted L.C. Gatewood, a protest organizer, as saying
that a white narcotics officer shot White and that police tried to
cover up the story by claiming White shot himself.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, initially, police said White was shot
when officer Jackie Blaylock returned fire after seeing a muzzle
blast in the dark from behind a house. But authorities later
concluded that White accidentally killed himself as he crawled
through bushes in an attempt to avoid officers after the car
accident.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The oil reserves of
the newly discovered field in the department of Cundinamarca, in
central Colombia, could be the largest in the country, a local
daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The El Tiempo daily quoted Energy and Mines Minister Rodrigo
Villamizar as saying that tests made in the first well drilled in
Medina, southeast of Cundinamarca, indicated the existence of a
deposit that could contain 1.5 billion to 2 billion barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
The newly discovered Coporo oil field in Cundinamarca could be
the biggest in Colombia, Villamizar said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the drilling of the first well reached
the scheduled depth of 18,000 feet (5,400 meters).
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Ernesto Samper announced the finding of oil
in Medina last month.
</P>
<P>
So far, the biggest oil field in Colombia is in Cusiana, with

<HEADLINE> Eight Bulgarian Banks Go Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Eight out of nine banks under the
special supervision of the Bulgerian National Bank since last
month are in a state of bankruptcy, confirmed the National Bank
here today.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank also declared that it will take legal
proceedings against these banks in local courts which are expected
to announce their bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The situation of ELIT bank, the only exception out of the nine
banks, will be discussed later by the National Bank.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank announced today the drop of monthly interest
rate from 20 percent to 15 percent, the second adjustment within
one month.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the rate drop to the inflation rate decline
and foreign exchange rate increase this month which were made
known by the National Statistics Bureau. However, some noted
economists took a different view, saying that if the bank interest
rate continues to rise, the industrial production will be unable
to maintain.
</P>
<P>
Since May, the Bulgarian government has started overhauling the
banks by bringing about merges of commercial banks and declaring
bankruptcy of those banks which were unable to clear off debts.
</P>
<P>
The deficit of the bank industry in Bulgaria last year reached
37 billion lev, while bad debt loans were as much as over 10
billion lev. The amount of bank losses in the first six months of
this year reached 64.1 billion lev (about 2.7 billion
U.S. dollars). The main reason of grave losses incurred in banks
was that commercial banks were irresponsible in granting
non-guarantee, non-mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that by acting in collaboration, some banks and
loaners embezzled public funds to make some "millionaire loaners."
</P>
<P>
Loosing confidence in banks, many people had withdrawn bank
deposits amounting to over 500 million U.S. dollars in foreign
exchange and lev in a period of several months.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The representative of the
international community and leaders of Bosnia have called on all
factions to stop torching and dynamiting houses of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Reports of the multi-national peacekeeping force in Bosnia said
that some 170 houses have been burned down over the past few weeks
along the inner-border between the two entities in Bosnia --
Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation and within the
federation itself.
</P>
<P>
In the region of Drvar, 40 Muslim houses have been burned and
in many other areas, especially in Mostar, houses of the Croat and
Serb refugees have also been damaged.
</P>
<P>
High representative of the European Union in Bosnia Carl Bildt
has appealed to the leaders of Bosnia for intervention into the
matter in an effort to stop the escalating ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
Alija Izetbegovic, Chairman of the Bosnian Presidency, called
on the other two members of the presidency Kresmir Zubak and
Momcilo Krajisnik to condemn the crimes of burning houses.
</P>
<P>
The damaging of the refugee houses was an attempt to block the
return of refugees to their home of origins.

ROME, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfang
Schussel said here today that "directorship" by big powers in
Europe was not necessary at all.
</P>
<P>
Schussel made the remark at a news conference when he said both
he and his Italian counterpart Lambecto Dini expressed the hope to
enter European Union's "first railway carriage".
</P>
<P>
But he warned that the "first railway carriage" should not be

<P>
Public opinion here pointed out that Schussel's remark was
directed against those economically strong powers in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Contradictions stemming from issues of EU's Single Currency are
becoming increasingly apparent. If this problem can not be solved
effectively, it will be much possible that sharp conflicts will
break out among EU's member states, public opinions here said.
</P>
<P>
Schussel, who arrived here on Wednesday, held talks with Dini
on maintaining stability in central Europe and Balkan regions,
strengthening cooperation with the Bosnian federal government as
well as the relations between Austria and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The two nations agreed to strengthen consultation and

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Environment Minister
Sergio Marchi today tabled the first-ever legislation to give
protection to endangered species in the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 276 species of wildlife have been listed at risk in
Canada. "The clock of extinction is ticking, and we are taking
action now to slow down that clock," Marchi said.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, an independent process will be established to
identify species at risk and protect their habitat and provide for
a recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
It stipulates tough penalties of up to 370,000 U.S. dollars for
corporations that harm each specimen of such species, and fines of
up to 185,000 dollars or five years' imprisonment for an
individual.
</P>
<P>
The bill also allows individuals to take action if they have
evidence that a species is at risk. They can bring evidence
forward and ask the federal government to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists here welcomed the government's action. But
they also pointed to its limited scope.
</P>
<P>
The bill applies only to endangered species that live on
federally controlled land, leaving 60 percent of Canada's
endangered species to the provinces, which might not have as tough
measures as the federal government, they said.

<HEADLINE> Writ Petition Filed in Nepal Against Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A writ petition has been
filed at Nepal's Supreme Court here against the ratification of a
Nepal-India border river development treaty earlier by the
parliament, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Five individuals including lawyers and journalists Thursday
jointly filed the 11-page petition urging the court to invalidate
the parliamentary ratification of the Mahakali treaty, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The petitioners claimed that the ratification of the
Nepal-India integrated development treaty on the Mahakali river,
Nepal's western boundary with India, was unconstitutional as it
has not yet been endorsed by the king of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
A joint session of both houses of the Nepali parliament in
September approved the Mahakali treaty with an overwhelming
majority vote.
</P>
<P>
The writ petition names lower house speaker, prime minister,
ministers of foreign affairs and water resources as defendants
among others.
</P>
<P>
The first hearing by the Supreme Court on the case is to take
place on December 4, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal-India Mahakali Treaty has been hailed by Nepali
officials as a watershed in water resources cooperation between
the two countries as it was said to have laid down principles of
benefit and cost sharing in the development of the border river on
an equitable basis.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Tries to Use LPG for Transportation Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is conducting a
three-month trial run with the first bus ever to use liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) in the country, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is a part of the government's "blue sky campaign" to
encourage the use of alternative energy for public transportation
in a bid to reduce air pollution, Chris Sulisto, president of Pt.
Otogas Karya Pratama was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The use of LPG, the LPG supplier chief said, reduces not only
air and sound pollution but also maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
He said the bus' fuel tank is capable of storing up to 240
liters of gas, enabling it to cover a distance of 576 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the passengers' safety, the LPG tank is made eight
times thicker than an ordinary gasoline tank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chris admitted that the conversion of diesel-fueled
vehicles is still costly, ranging from 10 million rupiah (one US
dollar equals 2,300 rupiah) for a new car to 20 million rupiah for
an older one.

<HEADLINE> Thai Textile Industry Faces Huge Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Market conditions and allegedly
inadequate government support have led to huge losses to Thai
textile manufacturers this year.
</P>
<P>
The synthetic fiber industry was estimated to face losses of
about 1.5 billion baht (60 million US dollars) in the first nine
months of this year, according to Tamrong Kunopakarn, president of
the Synthetic Textile Association of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Because of price speculation by raw material suppliers, who
hoarded fiber supply while prices were on the rise, manufactures
were often forced to buy from the "grey" market, where prices were
close to 2,000 dollars a ton, but prices of intermediate outputs
slightly increased.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the price of the main raw material of the
synthetic fiber industry -- purified terephthalic acid (PTA) --
rose sharply from a price base of about 750 dollars to a peak of
1,500 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
He said Thai manufactures are badly hampered by saturation in
the domestic market and intense competition in the export market,
which sees the emergency of new producers in the new economies
where production costs are much lower.
</P>
<P>
He said the textile industry is being viewed as a "sunset"
industry, receiving less attention from the government.
</P>
<P>
He said that with all kinds of heavy machinery and poor
infrastructure in underdeveloped provinces, it is impractical for
textile plants to relocate to remote provinces, as the government
has urged.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to offer more support for plants in
Bangkok and its adjacent provinces, including reduction or
exemption of duty on machinery and raw material imports.

company, Pertamina, is to increase its production of unleaded
gasoline from the current level of 1,890 kiloliters to 5,000
kiloliters per annum starting next year, a Pertamina official
said.
</P>
<P>
Pertamina plans to produce enough unleaded gasoline to supply
greater Jakarta by 1999 under the government's "blue sky program"

Abda'oe said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on President Soeharto's order that Pertamina
phase out the use of lead as an additive in its gasoline by 1999,
Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Lead is used to increase the octane power of gasoline, but lead
particles in the air can harm people's cardiovascular systems and
their intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Pertamina began production of unleaded gasoline last year in
its new refinery in Balongan, West Java.

<P>
SAN JOSE, October 31 (Xinhua) -- A group of 24 specialists from
the Costa Rican Public Security Ministry have started to locate
and defuse land mines in a border zone between the country and
Nicaragua, said ministry officials today.
</P>
<P>
Demining work began on Thursday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The mines were planted in the 1980s by Nicaraguan groups who
fought the then Sandinista regime of Nicaragua with the support of
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Some areas in the north of Costa Rica were believed to be mined
by Nicaraguan groups who fought from their positions against the
Sandinista army troops in southern Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed by the left-over mines in 1990 in the
town of San Isidro de Pocosol in San Carlos on the border with
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Central American countries have agreed to cooperate in demining
the region, especially the border between Costa Rica and Honduras,
where the Nicaraguan groups planted most mines.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Carlos Alberto Decasa, member of the Inter-American
Defense Board, estimated that the demining work would take one
year.
</P>
<P>
The demining team, who have been trained for three months by
the Inter-American Defense Board, will comb a vast area south of
the San Juan River, part of the Costa Rica-Nicaragua border, from
Los Chiles to San Isidro de Pocosol.

<HEADLINE> Finland Not to Apply for NATO Membership Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja
Halonen today reiterated that his country had no intention to
apply for NATO membership at present in spite of its
General-Secretary Javier Solana's visit here.
</P>
<P>
She made the reiteration after holding talks with Solana, who
arrived here on Wednesday for a two-day official visit to Finland,
the first of its kind by a NATO chief.
</P>
<P>
But Halonen reaffirmed that Finland was keen on wider
cooperation with the military bloc, especially on the enlargement
of its Partnership For Peace (PFP) Program, which was proposed by
NATO, and aimed to strengthen political and military ties with
countries that could not be accepted as its first members and
those which didn't apply to join.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen echoed Halonen when meeting
Solana by saying that Finland would develop closer ties with NATO
within the range of the PFP Program, which was seen by the country
as an important tool of cooperation with the 16-member alliance,
on the basis of non-alignment in military and independent defense.
</P>
<P>
Considering its own security, Finland was seeking closer ties
with NATO through various means though it wouldn't want to join
the organization now in order to avoid irritating Russia which is
strongly opposed to the eastward expansion of the military
organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, October 31 (Xinhua) - Visiting Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat today urged Europe to play more active roles in
pushing forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In solving the current crisis in the peace process, Europe, a
chief aid donor in the Middle East, should assert a "political
weight" compatible with its economic contributions to the region,
Arafat told a news conference after meeting Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar here.
</P>
<P>
It was possible for him to accept the mediation of the European
Union in order to implement all the peace agreements on the peace
process, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was in Spain to mark the fifth anniversary of the Madrid
Middle East peace conference that convened on October 31, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader has visited several European capitals
this week to seek European help and support in the latest crisis
between the Palestinians and Israel over the Jewish state's
reluctance to withdraw its troops from the West Bank town of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said, Spain had been committed to the Middle East peace
process and he hoped to visit the region in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was also invited to
visit Spain on December 3 to mark the anniversary of the Madrid
conference, the Spanish government announced.

MEXICO CITY, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Uruguayan President Julio
Maria Sanguinetti said today that the "reapproachement" between
Mexico and the South American Common Market (Mercosur) toward a
free trade agreement will start next year.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan president, who arrived here on October 29 for a
four-day visit, said during a breakfast with Mexican businessmen
that conditions have been ripe for creating bridges that will
benefit all the nations, especially those on the American
continent.
</P>

It is necessary more than ever now for Latin American countries
to have a commercial reapproachement, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sanguinetti said Mercosur should diversify its commercial
relations with Latin American countries, adding that Mexico, a
member of the North America Free Trade Agreement, is a potential
partner of the group.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, whose members include Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay, is the biggest commercial bloc in South America.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand Struggles to Maintain Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will struggle to
maintain an export growth rate of 5-6 percent, according to a
source from the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The value of the country's exports in the first eight months of
the year amounted to 939.855 billion baht (37.59 billion US
dollars), up 3.1 percent from the same period last year, while the
import value grew to 1,255.258 billion baht (50.2 billion
dollars), up 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The source was quoted by local daily The Bangkok Post as saying
that if Thailand was to maintain 5-6 percent growth, its monthly
value of outbound shipments should be kept at 130 billion baht
(5.2 billion dollars). But exports from January to August
averaged at only 120 billion baht (4.8 billion dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
Exports of footwear, plastics and pellets, artificial flowers,
frozen shrimp and fish, traveling gear, canned tuna, cars and
motorbikes are reported to have declined.
</P>
<P>
With regional trade and cooperation getting stronger, the
source suggested that Thai exporters should build up their
manufacturing bases overseas to reduce production costs and look
for a better export platform.

<HEADLINE> FAO: Food Supply to Cities Facing Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 31 (Xinhua) -- With the world's urban populations
growing by more than 60 million people a year, supplying and
distributing food to cities is becoming an increasingly pressing
challenge, U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned
today.
</P>
<P>
FAO said in a report that the situation is particularly serious
in developing countries where post-harvest storage, processing and
marketing facilities have failed to keep pace with the
accelerating urbanization.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, there will be around 200 cities with a
population of over one million each and 21 "megacities" over 10
million, FAO said, "Worldwide, cities and towns are currently
absorbing over 60 million people each year."
</P>
<P>
"This growth will continue to present enormous challenges for
the suppliers and distributors of food," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Guaranteeing the efficient distribution of low-cost and
nutritious food to the urban poor, it said, "will be one of the
major food security issues of the coming decades."
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Food for Consumers' Marketing, Processing
and Distribution", is one of a series of technical background
documents prepared for the World Food Summit to be held at
Rome-based FAO headquarters on November 13-17.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state and government from nearly 200 countries have
been invited to the Summit to renew their commitment to achieving
universal food security and agree on a Plan of Action to be
carried out in cooperation with international and non-governmental
organizations, the private sector and civil society.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Guerrillas Pledge to Continue Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Guatemalan guerrillas
today broke its long silence and reaffirmed their commitment to
continue the peace negotiations with the government to end the
country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG) admitted in a
statement that Rafael Augusto Valdizon Nunez, also known as
"Comandante Isaias," had organized the kidnapping of an
86-year-old wealthy woman.
</P>
<P>
The URNG expressed its concern and regrets for the abduction
incident.
</P>
<P>
The URNG reiterated its "unbreakable commitment to continue
acting in good faith and with full responsibility" in the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said that the kidnapping occurred
out of the control of the URNG general command and "without the
knowledge or authorization" of the guerrilla chiefs.
</P>
<P>
After being arrested by police on October 19, Valdizon, one
leader of the four separate guerrilla units that make up the URNG,
confessed that his men have been holding Olga de Novella hostage
since August 25.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of peace negotiations, the guerrillas have
promised to end such means of fundraising by abducting wealthy
Guatemalans.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Guatemalan government suspended peace talks with
the URNG, planned for Tuesday in Mexico City, saying the recent
abduction of Olga de Novella by the guerrillas had violated terms
of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu warned on Wednesday that the
resumption of the peace talks between his government and the URNG
would depend on a satisfactory explanation from the guerrillas for
the recent kidnapping incident.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan president said that though he set conditions for
resuming the peace talks, he was confident that a final peace
accord would be reached by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan government and the URNG initiated peace
negotiations in an effort to end the country's 36-year-old civil
war in April 1991, the longest in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Recommends to Dismantle Fencing Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The soccer's world governing
body on Thursday urged the dismantling worldwide of fencing at
soccer stadiums following the disaster in Guatemala two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
At Mateo Flores Stadium in Guatemala, more than 80 people were
killed as fans collapsed against each other prior to a World Cup
qualifier between Guatemala and Costa Rica in the CONCACAF region.
</P>
<P>
In the November edition of FIFA News, Secretary General Joseph
Blatter said after Hillsborough, the fences were dismantled in
England as a respect for the victims, "the same principles must
now be applied throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
In 1989, 95 people was killed in Hillsborough as the victims
were blocked by the fencing around the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Nowsdays, Guatemalan officials were still investigating the
disaster on October 16.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said those wire fences played an important part in the
incident just as it had in Sheffield seven years ago.

<HEADLINE> Panama Canal Collects Record Toll in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Panama Canal earned a
record toll revenue of 486.7 million U.S. dollars in the 1996
fiscal year, a 5.2 percent increase over the previous year, a
spokesman for the Canal Commission said today.
</P>
<P>
Franklin Castrellon told Xinhua that the inter-oceanic waterway
collected 462 million dollars in 1995 from tolls applied to deep
draft ships, bulk and cargo ships, and others.
</P>
<P>
He added that transit of deep draft ships in 1996 increased by
0.7 percent over 1995, to 37.5 a day, while that of "Panamax"
ships, ships with tonnage surpassing 10,000 tons, increased by
11.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the planned increase in toll prices announced earlier this
week, Castrellon said the final decision would be made on November 22
in Miami, where canal executives would analyze the feasibility of
toll increases.
</P>
<P>
He said proposals included a gradual toll increase of 8.7
percent in 1997 and 7.5 percent in 1998, as well as payment
according to deck tonnage.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed: "The increase is a necessity for the
modernization and improvement projects the Canal Commission is
planning for the inter-oceanic waterway."
</P>
<P>
Castrellon estimated that about 895 million dollars would be
needed in the next five years to implement the modernization and
improvement projects.
</P>
<P>
He added the toll increase was expected to bring more than
900,000 dollars in the first stage, which would all be used for
buying machinery.
</P>
<P>
"If the toll increase is approved in Miami, the first hike will
take effect on January 1 next year, and the second at the very
beginning of 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Panama Canal has increased its tolls six times in the 82
years since it was built in 1914.

<HEADLINE> Law Implementation to Ensure Consumers' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer watchdog group
has urged commercial enterprises to diligently improve the quality
of both commodities and services to protect consumers' rights.
</P>
<P>
The China Consumers Association (CCA) has vowed to make
implementation of the Consumer Protection Law a top priority in
the coming year, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
"We will, of course, continue education programs to promote
public awareness about the law as we have been doing since the law
became effective in January 1994," CCA's director Cao Tiandian was
quoted as telling a national conference of shop managers where
experience in protecting consumers was exchanged.
</P>
<P>
"If all shops run their businesses in line with the law and do
not perform against the interests of customers, the number of
complaints sent to consumers' organizations will certainly see a
remarkable drop," Cao said.
</P>
<P>
However, many shops have not implemented the law effectively or
have even worked against it, the report said, "This is a reason
why consumer complaints keep increasing."
</P>
<P>
"Our aim in promoting the law is to improve the quality of both
commodities and services to improve self-discipline and standard
business practices in order to protect the rights of consumers,"
Cao said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, concluded here Thursday, was attended by
representatives from 56 large department stores and shopping
centers around the country.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged experience in implementing the consumer law and
the laws against unfair competition.

KIEV, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The improvement of relations
between Russia and NATO will help establish a common European
security system, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko said

</P>
<P>
He was commenting at a news conference on a recent Russian
statement about its relations with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) issued by Ivan Rybkin, the newly appointed

</P>
<P>
Rybkin expressed Russia's willingness to participate in the
political alliance of NATO. Udovenko described Russia's attitude
as a positive step.
</P>
<P>
However, if Russia and NATO decided to sign a treaty they
should take into consideration the interests of third countries,
Udovenko said.
</P>
<P>
The statement showed that Russia's attitude towards NATO was
changing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia had long been at odds with NATO over its enlargement
because it considered NATO's eastwards expansion to its border a
threat to its security.

BUDAPEST, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Hungary is busy finding
shelters for tens of thousands of homeless people as winter
approaches.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and the Red Cross branches are doing their
best to find warm places for 100,000 to 150,000 homeless people,
one to 1.5 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
But their efforts seem largely doomed at the very beginning
because of a shortage of cash. In recent years, more and more
people have been driven to the streets as family incomes dropped
and unemployment kept rising.
</P>
<P>
Between 20,000 and 30,000 people are wandering Budapest's
streets alone, where about 35 relief institutions could at the
most bed 3413 people.
</P>
<P>
Outside the capital, the situation is even worse. Only 3000
beds are available for many more of the homeless to evade the
cold nights.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 105 in Brazilian Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- At least 105 people were
confirmed dead after a Brazilian jetliner crashed today soon after
its takeoff on a domestic flight from Sao Paulo, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
In addition to all the 89 passengers and six crew on board the
Fokker-100 airliner owned by the TAM regional airline, at least 10
people on the ground were also killed, said an airport spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The crash happened at a densely populated residential area
which was only two kilometers away from the airport runway.
</P>
<P>
Television pictures showed dozens of bodies from the plane
wreckage wrapped in black plastic bags lined up along the streets.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of firefighters and ambulance men were at the scene
trying to rescue people trapped in the rubble of the apartment
buildings. Ten vehicles were also destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The crash is the worst air accident in the country in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
An airport official said the plane took off from Sao Paulo's
Congonhas airport at 8:25 a.m. local time (19:25 GMT), heading for
Rio de Janeiro. Two minutes later the plane crashed into an
apartment building and burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident is now under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Receives Tumor Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A 16-year-old giant panda has
undergone a tumor operation in Zhengzhou, capital of
central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
It is reported to be the first operation of its kind performed
on a giant panda.
</P>
<P>
The panda, "Shunshun", who weighs 69 kilograms, arrived at
Zhengzhou Zoo from the Oulong Nature Reserve in
southwest China's Sichuan Province last December.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, a fist-sized tumor grew bigger and bigger on her
left arm.
</P>
<P>
Local doctors and animal experts decided to remove the tumor,
but first they had to obtain approval from the Ministry of
Forestry, and the panda's owner - the Sichuan Provincial Forestry
Department.
</P>
<P>
On October 9, two senior doctors in the local tumor hospital
carried out an hour-long operation, and cut the 650-gram
tumor from the panda.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the operation, Shunshun started to chew her usual
food - fresh bamboo leaves, not showing any unusual post-operation
signs.
</P>
<P>
China now has some 1,000 giant pandas in the wild, and plans to
build 28 nature reserves to protect what is one of the world's
most loved animals from extinction.

<HEADLINE> Top Eight Completed for Cup Winners' Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Cup Winners' Cup holders
Paris Saint-Germain of France Thursday blanketed Galatasaray of
Turkey 4-0 to advance to the last eight of the tournament 6-4 on
aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Leonardo of Brazil netted one and set up two to pace
the French club to win the second-round second-leg home game.
</P>
<P>
Other qualifiers for the last eight were Brann Bergen of
Norway, Liverpool of England, AIK Stockholm of Sweden, Barcelona
of Spain, Fiorentina of Italy, Benfica of Portugal and AEK Athens
of Greece.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the game, Galatasaray who won the first leg 4-2, hoped
to intensify the cyclone swirled up by their compatriots from
Fenerbahce who defeated Manchester United 1-0 in the Champions'
League on Wednesday, ending the United's 40-year unbeaten home
record in European competition.
</P>
<P>
However, PSG proved to be hard nuts for the Turks. Leonardo
scored the opener with nine minutes into the game, Panama striker
Dely Valdes added the second with a free kick in the 32nd minute,
followed by a goal from home striker Patrice Loko before Brazilian
Rai struck the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Brann Bergen, from a 2-2 tie in the first leg, also advanced to
the top eight 4-3 on aggregate as Dutch PSV Eindhoven failed to
convert their dominance into goals.
</P>
<P>
Geir Hasund scored the first in the 35th minute and Tore Andre
Flo added the second in the 59th minute to put the Norwegians
ahead.
</P>
<P>
The lone goal for Eindhoven, leaders in the Dutch league, was a
combination between Rene Eykelkamp and Boudewijn Zenden in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool that hit three goals in six minutes for 8-4 on
aggregate, also secured the quarterfinal spot.
</P>
<P>
After a 2-1 first leg win, Liverpool once lagged 3-2 against
Sion of Switzerland and was on the threshold of ending its voyage.
</P>
<P>
Then came up John Barnes and Robbie Fowler who scored two goals
in a minute to turn over the scoreboard before the English team
finally won the second game 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In other actions, Nimes of France defeated AIK 1-0 but still
failed to stop its Swedish opponents from entering the last-eigth
3-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Cyril Jeunechamp was even sent off for his attempt to attack
Slovakian refreee Lubos Michel with five minutes to go.

<HEADLINE> Craze For Art in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WUHAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- As the hammer struck the auction
block, a painting by a young artist sold for 500 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Zheng, who bought the work at the recent '96 Three Gorges
Artwork Auction, said delightedly, "Although it costs what I can
earn a month, I think it worth the money. It's an original."
</P>
<P>
The auction in Yichang, a city in the Three Gorges area in
central China's Hubei Province, sold 160 items, 80 percent of the
pieces available, and raked in over 400,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
These works, including paintings and calligraphy works, were
mainly created by well-known Chinese contemporary artists, such as
Liu Haisu, Li Kuchan and Pujie who was the brother of the last
emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
The auction's highest bid came in at 36,000 yuan, and the
lowest, 250 yuan. Most of the items sold averaged about 1,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the buyers were ordinary residents with an
interest in collecting and appreciating art.
</P>
<P>
A stamp-collector paid nearly 10,000 yuan for six items. He said
that buying art made by famous artists was good for both
appreciating and collecting, and was a wise investment.
</P>
<P>
One woman, who works at the Yichang Department Store, did not
bid high enough for some of her favorite calligraphy works, but
said she would come to the next auction to try again.
</P>
<P>
About 500 people took part in the auction, according to the
director of Hubei Artwork Auction Company, which sponsored the
event.
</P>
<P>
As local residents showed such a high level of art appreciation,
activities of this kind are scheduled to be held in Yichang in
December, the director said.

<HEADLINE> UN: Croats to Visit Cemeteries in Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Belgrade office
spokesperson Susan Manuel said today that she hoped there would be
no incidents during visits by Croats to cemeteries in the region
of Eastern Slavonia Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Belgrade, Manuel said 200
Croats would arrive in buses under U.N. escort from Croatia in
Eastern Slavonia, which is a Serb-dominated region, to visit 25
cemetaries.
</P>
<P>
The region, bordering Yugoslavia in the north, was placed under
a one-year international administration in late 1995 under an
agreement between the authorities of Croatia and the local Serbs,
with a possible one-year extension of U.N. administration.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 troops of the U.N. Transitional Administration for
Eastern Slavonia are stationed in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The visit is of a religious nature to commemorate All Saints'
Day," Manuel said. The authorities appealed to the local
population to be patient and calm during the visit of the Croats,
she said.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authorities in the region also filed a request
recently for visits by Serbs to their cemeteries in Croatia, and
U.N. officials are working on organizing this visit soon, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the same press conference on the return of refugees,
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Marwan
Elkhoury said 722 refugees had returned to Bosnia so far and 193
to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Elkhoury said the UNHCR had so far received over 3,000 requests
for return to Bosnia and about 2,000 for return to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 of the requests for return to Bosnia met the required
conditions and 25 for Croatia, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 refugees from Croatia and Bosnia are living in
Yugoslavia. Many of them hope to be reintegrated into local
communities in this host country.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Zaire on Brink of Calamity: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of
refugees and Zairian civilians are fleeing for their lives as
fighting spread in eastern Zaire, which is on the brink of another
humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako
Ogata made the revelation in her speech at the Third Committee
(Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) of the U.N. General Assembly
today.
</P>
<P>
Many people had been uprooted by armed conflicts in Burundi,
the Caucasus, Iraq, Liberia, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, Tajikistan, and
mostly recently Zaire, which was on the brink of calamity, Ogata
said while reviewing the world's refugee situation over the past
months.
</P>
<P>
An immediate cease-fire should be negotiated to obtain access
to the refugees, provide assistance and protect the aid workers,
she said. The negotiations with Rwanda and Zaire for a return of
refugees had no positive results, according to the high
commissioner. The number of returnees had been low, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Goma region in northeastern Zaire was currently the main
fighting area, she said. There were six big camps north of Goma.
The 194,000 refugees in the Kimbumba camp, the largest in the
region, left for a camp at Mugunga in the southwest, which already
had a population of 150,000. Now, that camp was packed to
capacity, and it was extremely dangerous in terms of health, food
and water availability.
</P>
<P>
She appealed to the international community to exercise its
influence to bring the fighting to an end.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the UNHCR, the agency had to deal with
a total of 14.2 million refugees worldwide by the end of 1995.

<HEADLINE> US to Deport Former Nazi Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
began proceedings today to deport a former Nazi concentration camp
guard.
</P>
<P>
The department said Ferdinand Hammer, 74, of Sterling Heights,
Michigan, concealed from U.S. authorities the fact that he had
been a guard at the Auschwitz and Sachsenhausen camps during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
Hammer, a retired foundry supervisor, did not tell the
authorities his background when he applied for citizenship in
1963, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Hammer was stripped of his citizenship by a U.S. judge in May
because, the judge ruled, Hammer "was a guard at the Auschwitz and
Sachsenhausen concentration camps" and that he served as an SS
guard on prisoner transports between the camps.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were interned because of their race,
religion, nationality of political beliefs during Hammer's service
as an armed guard at the infamous Auschwitz death camp complex in
Nazi-occupied Poland and Sachsenhausen concentration camp in
Germany, the Justice Department said.

<HEADLINE> Russia: Signing of US-Russia Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Georgy Mamedov said today that it was still possible to sign a
U.S.-Russian accord to permit testing of some missile defense
systems.
</P>
<P>
Mamedov, who arrived here today to sign the accord, told a news
conference that he was disappointed that a spokesman of the U.S.
State Department had announced Wednesday that the negotiations had
foundered. He also regretted that his U.S. counterpart,
Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis, had failed to come to Geneva
for the signature as scheduled before.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the signing of an accord was still possible
because "some new ideas have appeared and the head of the U.S
delegation is reporting them to Washington."
</P>
<P>
The agreement deals with the complicated issue of the kinds of
missile defenses that can be tested without violating the 1972
U.S.-Soviet Union Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) or requiring
its renegotiations.
</P>
<P>
The 1972 treaty limited missile defenses, reasoning that an
aggressor unsure of devastating retaliation would be less likely
to launch a first strike.
</P>
<P>
Mamedov described the treaty as "a cornerstone of strategic
stability" as well as the condition for ratification of the START
II treaty on deep cuts in strategic arsenals of the United States
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we are trying as soon as possible to finalize that
process of demarcation of strategic and non-strategic ABM systems
in order to ratify the START II treaty and then immediately to
start working on START III which will make even deeper cuts in our
nuclear arsenals," he said.
</P>
<P>
After long negotiations, the two sides agreed on which
lower-velocity battlefield missile defense systems could be tested
legally. But discord remains on the faster missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
The two sides originally planned to sign an accord today and
the U.S. view was that once the agreement was signed, the tests
could go ahead. Russia has now disagreed, holding that
negotiations over the more controversial high-velocity defense
systems must be completed first.
</P>
<P>
Mamedov said that the negotiations on high-velocity systems
were extremely difficult because some of them were indeed capable
of intercepting strategic missiles and therefore threatening the
compliance of the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said Russia wanted to solve the lower- and
high-velocity defenses through a package.
</P>
<P>
Mamedov explained that Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin had
agreed in April this year that the two sides should reach
agreement on both issues in October.
</P>
<P>
Because of the disagreement on high-velocity defenses, Russia
had suggested building "a bridge" between the two and had
submitted a proposal on how to do that, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have received response to our latest proposal from the head
of the U.S. delegation on Thursday and we have discussed that
response and came to the conclusion that it was worth trying out
some the new ideas," Mamedov said.
</P>
<P>
"The strange thing is that the statement dooming the talks to
failure was made even before the talks begin," Mamedov said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the U.S. change of attitude to the strong pressure
from the Republicans who are not in favor of the ABM treaty, and
the U.S. industry which wants to make money from new missile
defense systems.
</P>
<P>
"There are calculations which show that creation of the new
generation of strategic interceptors will allow certain people to
earn between 60 to 100 billion dollars. And they're afraid our
talks will take that money out of their pockets," Mamedov said.
</P>
<P>
Given that his counterpart from Washington is not in Geneva,
Mamedov said an accord could still be signed today or Friday by
the U.S. head of delegation if Washington had the desire and gave
the authorization.

<HEADLINE> Few Greeks Make Use of Banking Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Greeks have a positive opinion
of bank employees but most of them do not make use of banking
services, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Federation of Bank
Employers, only 11 percent of the Greeks, mostly businessmen and
employers, make frequent use of banking services. Another 41
percent, the elderly and the housewifes, make banking transactions
only once or twice a month. The rest, the report said, do not make
any banking transactions at all.
</P>
<P>
The report said the middle to upper classes prefer the private
and foreign banks, such as the Commercial Bank and the Credit
Bank. Employees use the banking services of the National Bank of
Greece, and farmers make their banking transactions at the
Agrobank.
</P>
<P>
An exceedingly high 86.3 percent of the Greek population
believes that banks make extremely high profits which they do not
invest in a clever way. Despite this, 82.6 percent of the Greeks
say they trust the banks, as against a mere 33.5 percent who say
they trust the insurance companies. Only 14 percent of the Greeks,
however, believe that banks have a positive contribution to the
country's economic development.

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves 700 Mln Dlrs for Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of two loans
totaling 700 million U.S. dollars to back Mexico in its reform of
the pension system and modernization of the food and agricultural
sector.
</P>
<P>
A 400 million dollar loan to the agricultural sector is
designed to increase sector competitiveness under the incentives
provided by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
The other loan of 300 million dollars for pension reform is
targeted to enhance equity, transparency and fiscal solvency of
the pension system while at the same time promoting institutional
savings. The program will assist the government in adopting new
regulations and carrying out recent reform laws under the
Contractual Savings Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The two programs are part of a coordinated effort by the
international community to support the economic stabilization and
recovery program of the government of Mexico. Last year, the IDB
approved more than 1.475 billion dollars in loan financing to
Mexico, a record for a single year, in the areas of financial
reform, essential social services, and energy.

<HEADLINE> Great Lakes Leaders to Meet on Rwanda-Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SLAAM, October (Xinhua) -- Heads of the Great Lakes
countries are expected to meet in Nairobi, Kenya, on Tuesday to
slove the conflict between Rwanda and Zaire, the Tanzanian
Foreign Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
Minister Jakaya Kikwete left here this afternoon to the
Ugandan capital of Kampala for the preparatory meeting of the
summit, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the two central African countries were
reported after Zairean authorities ordered Banyamulenge Tutsis to
leave Bukavu area and return to Rwanda within a week.
</P>
<P>
Zairean and Rwandan soldiers traded artillery fire at the
border on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 Tutsis are denied Zairean nationality despite
their claim that their ancestors arrived in Zaire 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 Banyamulenge Tutsis were said to be executed
last September amid reports about disappearance of more than 50
others.
</P>
<P>
Both Rwanda and Burundi have denied Zaire's accusation that
they are backing the Tutsi rebels known as Banyamulenge, who have
taken the town of Uvira and threaten to overrun the South Kive
provincial capital of Bukavu.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Campaigns in Republican Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
campaigned today in Arizona state that has not voted for a
Democratic presidential candidate since Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is on his 15-state campaign trip in the final days
leading up to the Election Day on November 5, while Republican
challenger Bob Dole had started 96 straight hours of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
"I want an America that is rejecting the racial, ethnic, tribal
and religious divisions that are tearing apart" the country, news
reports quoted Clinton as telling thousands of supporters at
Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's criticism of Dole has gradually become more pointed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton suggested that the former senate Majority Leader
opposes student loans and called his tax-cut plan "a risky tax
scheme."
</P>
<P>
Arizona was last won by a Democratic candidate in 1948. Clinton
also plans to visit Florida, Texas and New Hampshire in hopes of
winning Republican bastions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dole announced a 96-hour, virtually nonstop final
push through 15 states beginning Friday, in the hope of shaking up
the race.
</P>
<P>
Dole also appealed today to Reform Party nominee Ross Perot's
supporters in his most direct terms yet.
</P>
<P>
In what could be viewed as a concession that he could not win a
three-way race against Clinton, Dole said, "I can beat one
candidate. I can't beat two. So don't vote for Ross Perot."
</P>
<P>
Aides said that after an overnight stop in a hotel in Columbus,
Ohio, Friday night, the only hotel pauses before the Election Day
would be brief, 90-minute stops every 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The trip is to take him to 15 states in roughly this order:
Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota,
Colorado, Nevada, California, New Mexico and Kansas, with side
trips to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
"I will not rest until we have made my case to every worker,
every family, and every voter," Dole said. "I am determined to
make every hour of this decisive election count."

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Importation Allowed in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Regional Sanctions
Co-ordinating Committee has allowed importation of various items
for the needs of 250,000 displaced people in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here today by the Tanzanian Foreign
Ministry said that the committee had decided to allow the goods
to be imported by Burundi on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
The move is in response to concern raised during the summit
meeting held on October 12 in the northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The participants were worried over the fate of internationally
displaced people under the care of UN agencies and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Burundi, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The items allowed for importation include food stuffs, bean
seeds, water purification agents, plastic sheeting, sanitary
facilities and mats.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the move did not mean that economic
sanctions imposed on Burundi by the Great Lakes countries had
been relaxed.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions would not be relaxed until the military junta of
Major Pierre Buyoya met the conditions set by the Arusha summit
in July, the statement declared.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Prevention of Genocide in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has urged the international community to do
its utmost to prevent another genocide.
</P>
<P>
In a report available today, the secretary-general said that he
was extremely worried about the reports of the killing of
thousands of Burundians since the coup d'etat of last July 25.
</P>
<P>
"I am continuing to encourage the countries which have the
military and logistical capacity for contributing to the necessary
preparations to stand ready to take necessary measures to prevent
a disaster similar to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda from happening
in Burundi," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that civil war continues to rage in Burundi. Despite
the apparent lull following the coup de'etat, violence has
unfortunately reasserted itself very quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there have been over 10,000 casualties of
the civil war since the coup d'etat, he said.
</P>
<P>
A glimmer of hope appeared at the Arusha Regional Summit on
October 12, when the regional heads of state and delegations
received a solemn pledge from two main leaders of the conflicting
parties to start negotiations immediately and without conditions,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Burundi is therefore again at a crossroads. The key question is
whether the parties to the conflict will succeed in embarking on a
serious process of negotiation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali also noted that the situation in eastern Zaire is
becoming particularly alarming as some incidents took place not
far from the Burundi frontier.
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely worried by the recent charges and
countercharges between Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador on International Criminal Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador Chen Shiqiu
said today that in the process of establishing an International
Criminal Court, the principle of complementarity and the principle
of consent of state should be observed.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has always maintained that, in the
contemporary international community, states must bear the primary
responsibility for the prevention and punishment of international
crimes," he said in explaining the complementarity principle.
</P>
<P>
"An International Criminal Court, set up to deal with certain
special and exceptional circumstances, can only be complement to
national courts," he said.
</P>
<P>
About the principle of consent of state, Ambassador Chen said
that according to the principle of state sovereignty, the
jurisdiction of the International Court must be based on consent
of state.
</P>
<P>
"The draft statute by the International Law Commission has
provided inherent jurisdiction for the Court without consent of
state in respect of the crime of genocide," he said. "This goes
against both the principle of state sovereignty and the principle
of complementarity."
</P>
<P>
The Six Committee of the 51st General Assembly is meeting
today to consider major issues concerning the establishment of an
International Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
It was in 1994 that the General Assembly established an Ad Hoc
Committee on the International Criminal Court. Last year, the
assembly authorized the establishment of a Preparatory Committee,
which replaced the Ad Hoc Committee.
</P>
<P>
There were two meetings of the Preparatory Committee this year,
one in April and one in August. As a result, it issued a
compilation of proposals of member states. But it is quite far
from becoming a widely acceptable consolidated text.
