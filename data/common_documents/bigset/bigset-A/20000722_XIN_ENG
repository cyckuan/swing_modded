<HEADLINE> Round-up: G-8 Summit Opens in Japan, G-7 Issues Statement on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Group of
Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations ended a meeting here
Friday with a statement on global economic issues, including
poverty reduction, debt relief for poor countries, tax evasion and
other abuses of the financial system.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting in the southern Japanese island of
Okinawa were U.S. President Bill Clinton, Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President
Jacques Chirac, Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, the G-7 became the Group of Eight (G-8)
after Russian President Vladimir Putin joined them to kick off a
three-day annual summit. Russia does not take part in the
financial part of the summit program.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the G-7 leaders said prospects for world
economic growth have improved in the past year, but further action
is needed to ensure further prosperity. They said vigilance and
further action are needed to ensure sustained strong and balanced
growth.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also expressed concern about the adverse effect on
world economic growth of recent developments in world crude oil
markets. They stressed the need for greater stability in oil
markets to help ensure sustained growth and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on the United States and Canada to
continue their current macro-economic policies to ensure sustained
economic growth and low inflation rates. Countries in the euro
area were requested to implement correct economic policies, and
vigorously push reforms of economic structure to increase
investment and promote employment.
</P>
<P>
The leaders promised to continue to work to further strengthen
the international financial architecture, including reform of the
International Monetary Fund, and multinational development banks.
</P>
<P>
On debt relief required by poor countries, the G-7 encouraged
heavily indebted countries (HIPCs) to develop poverty reduction
strategies to benefit from the debt reduction initiative.
</P>
<P>
They expressed deep concern over the military conflicts in the
HIPCs and called on these countries to end their involvement in
conflicts to allow debt relief to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the G-7 launched the HIPC initiative at a summit in
Cologne, Germany, to deliver faster, broader and deeper debt
relief, releasing funds for poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the G-7 leaders also expressed their determination
to curb money laundering. They said they would give advice and
technical assistance to jurisdictions that commit to improvement
of their regulatory regimes.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, during their talks Putin and Clinton agreed to
control the spread of missiles and missile technology. U.S.
defense missile programs, which have been strongly opposed by
Russia and other countries, are reportedly among topics of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
In the coming two days, the G-8 leaders will discuss a wide
range of issues including global security, regional problems, a
common fight against epidemic diseases and international terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Physicists Find First Direct Evidence for Tau Neutrino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found the first
direct evidence for the subatomic particle called the tau neutrino,
the third kind of neutrino known to particle physicists.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough, announced Friday, was achieved by an
international collaboration of scientists at the U.S. Department
of Energy's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Although earlier experiments had produced convincing indirect
evidence for the particle's existence, no one had directly
observed the tau neutrino, a massless or almost massless particle
carrying no electric charge and barely interacting with
surrounding matter.
</P>
<P>
"We finally have direct evidence that the tau neutrino is one
of the building blocks of nature and that it reacts with other
particles in accordance with our current scientific theory of
particle interactions," said Byron Lundberg, spokesman of the
Direct Observation of the Nu Tau (DONUT) experiment, a
collaboration of 54 physicists from the United States, Japan,
Korea, and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The tau neutrino is the third neutrino of the Standard Model of
elementary particles, a theoretical description that groups all
particles into three generations.
</P>
<P>
First-generation electron neutrinos and their second-generation
cousins, muon neutrinos, are easier to produce and detect than tau
neutrinos. Experiments identified them in 1956 and 1962 by
recording neutrino interactions creating either electrons or muons.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 years of technological advancement has now allowed
physicists to observe the third-generation tau neutrino producing
a tau lepton.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, using Fermilab's Tevatron accelerator, scientists
produced an intense neutrino beam, which they expected to contain
tau neutrinos. The neutrino beam was fired into a 50-foot detector
composed of iron plates coated with an emulsion, which recorded
the particle interactions.
</P>
<P>
Then the scientists analyzed the 6 million impressions left on
the coating.
</P>
<P>
The researchers used computer-assisted video cameras to create
a 3-D images of the particle tracks. They narrowed down the field
and found four clear tracks of a tau lepton that scientists say
were caused by tau neutrino collisions.
</P>
<P>
Stanford University physicist Martin Perl, winner of the 1995
Nobel Prize for discovering the tau lepton, the first indicator
for a third generation of particles, congratulated the DONUT
experiments.
</P>
<P>
"Finding the tau neutrino is very important and very exciting,"
said Perl. "DONUT was not an easy experiment, and now it opens a
whole new world. There is the possibility of the tau neutrino
interacting somewhat differently from the other neutrinos. We
might have a chance of learning more about all other particles,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Launches Phone Diplomacy on Camp David Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Friday launched an extensive telephone diplomacy to reaffirm
Jordan's support for the Palestinians and to protect Jordan's
interests in the on-going trilateral summit at David Camp near
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The monarch held telephone conversations with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to discuss the summit set to resolve the most
difficult issues between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In his call to Arafat, King Abdullah stressed Jordan supports
the efforts by the Palestinians to achieve a just and peaceful
solution, which will meet the aspirations of the Arab nation and to
achieve the rights of the Palestinians, including the establishment
of an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Abdullah received a phone call from Barak,
who briefed the monarch on the latest developments of the three-way
summit between Barak himself, Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton which was launched on July 11.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah stressed to Barak the importance to Jordan and all
countries and peoples in the region that the summit succeed and
make progress to open the way to a lasting and just peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The king also consulted with Egyptian leader Mubarak on the
David Camp summit, and both leaders stressed that any solutions
must lead to a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 and
1994 respectively, and currently they are the only two Arab
countries to reach such a peace deal with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah Khatib
said Jordan is closely following the development of the David Camp
summit, which focused on the thorniest issues of Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees, border and security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Khatib stressed that Jordan has a stake in the final status
issues between Israel and the Palestinians, particularly in the
refugee issue, because it is hosting some 1.5 million Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
And also, the status of Jerusalem is not related to only one
party, but to Jordan and other countries in the Arab world, as well
as the whole Muslim and Christianity world, Khatib added.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian government supports Palestinian refugees' rights to
choose between returning home or staying in Jordan while asking for
compensations.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes a Growing Threat in Gulf: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Diabetes has occurred in up to 17
percent of the overall population in the Gulf region while at least
11 percent more are likely to develop the disease in the future,
according to studies in various Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
"The most startling fact of all is that Type 1 diabetes, which
is more common among children and adolescents, is as high as 20
percent (of the total incidence), one of the highest in the world,"
said Dr. Abdul Razak Al Madani, secretary-general of the Dubai-
based Gulf Diabetes Study Group.
</P>
<P>
Al Madani said the soaring incidence of diabetes among children
in the past few year is especially alarming. The Gulf is considered
among the world's dangerous spots for diabetes, reported local
media on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Diabetes Group has representatives from the United Arab
Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman. Two
doctors from each country are on the board. The aim of the group is
to promote services concerning diabetes and create awareness of the
risk among the general public.

The commission announced Saturday in a communique that it is
preparing to file a lawsuit before the Human Rights European Court.
</P>
<P>
It said that although the Court rejected this week an
accusation made for the same reasons by two relatives of the
fallen, this does not mean that most of the relatives of the
fallen in the Belgrano grouped in this commission cannot present
their own lawsuit.

<P>
The commission said in its communique that on the contrary, the
court rejection has stimulated it to continue with the
denunciation.
</P>

Two relatives of the fallen in the Malvinas War filed an
accusation against Britain for war crimes, which was rejected by
the Human Rights European Court "because it was presented

<P>
Central Bank data quoted Saturday by the press show that raw
expenditures in January to June international trips amounted to 1.
77 billion U.S. dollars, 23.8 percent over the amount recorded in
the first semester of 1999, when the figure was 1.42 billion
dollars.

In June Brazilians spent 362 million dollars on trips and
purchases abroad, against 276 million dollars spent in the same
month of 1999.

<P>
Liquid disbursement, which is the money spent by Brazilians
abroad increased 46.38 percent, compared to the first half of 1999,
going from 569 million dollars to 833 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A Central Bank analysis shows that tourists expenditures in
1999 were strongly influenced by the uncertainty caused by the

<HEADLINE> Mexico Controls Demographic Growth: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico has now 97.4 million residents.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said that the growth rate of the population was 2.1
percent per year in 1994, when he assumed the presidency of the
country.
</P>
<P>
His government set itself the target in 1995 of reducing the
rate of growth, and according to a recent report on the census of
the last decade, the birth rate dropped to 1.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said Saturday in his weekly radio program "A chat with
the President," that the birth rate reduction obeys, among other
things, to the fact that more couples use some method of family
planning.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-nine percent of Mexicans enjoy now health assistance
coverage and life expectancy has risen to a 75 years on average,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his administration promoted the development
of small cities to better distribute the population in the
territory and create new poles for investment.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the birth rate opens new opportunities for
development, because it permits to direct more federal resources
to the improvement of public services, said Zedillo.

cooperation in economic fields, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran is ready to expand relations with Germany in all areas
based on mutual respect and common interests, Iranian First Vice
President Hassan Habibi told visiting German Minister of Labor and
Social Affairs Walter Riester.
</P>
<P>
Habibi said Iran welcomes Germany to actively participate in the
country's economic activities. The two countries can expand
cooperation by holding regular meetings on employment, investments
and technical and vocational training, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the exchange of know-how on privatization and
international marketing.
</P>
<P>
The German labor minister, who arrived here Friday, called a
recent trip by President Mohammad Khatami to Germany as "positive,"
saying the trip has brought about good impression among the German
public and media.
</P>
<P>
He added Germany is interested in bolstering bilateral ties with
Iran in all areas, especially in the transfer of technical know-
how, establishment of vocational training centers and training of
Iranian economic experts.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the German minister also held a meeting with
his Iranian counterpart Hussein Kamali, during which both officials
stressed their readiness to expand bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kamali told the German visitor that he is happy with the
expansion of bilateral relations and added that President Khatami's
recent visit to Berlin showed the political will on both sides to
expand the cooperation in all areas.
</P>
<P>
Riester said he is happy to visit Iran, underlining the
necessity of expanding bilateral relations in economic areas.
</P>
<P>
The Germany minister's visit came only eight days after
President Khatami ended his three-day landmark visit to Berlin, the
first by an Iranian president since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who received a warm welcome in Germany, said he was
satisfied with his visit, hopeful that good Tehran-Berlin ties
would have a favorable impact on Iran's ties with the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Berlin are determined to expand relations in all
spheres, he said at the end of his visit on July 13.
</P>
<P>
Germany was once Iran's largest trading partner, but the status
was taken by Italy in recent years due to strains in Tehran-Berlin
ties after a German court ruled in 1997 that the Iranian government
had been involved in the assassination of exiled Iranian dissidents
in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan Urge Israel to Return East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Jordan stressed on Saturday
East Jerusalem is part of the Arab territories occupied by
Israel in 1967 and subject to the relevant United Nations
resolutions that demand Israel to return those lands.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries see East Jerusalem as subject to the U.N.
Resolution 242 because it was occupied by Israel in 1967, Jordanian
Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-Khatib said after meeting with his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who was speaking to reporters along with al-Khatib,
underlined the Arab stand on the issue of East Jerusalem is
final and is one that insists on the liberation of this land.
</P>
<P>
He said Jerusalem is holy to Muslims, a fact that justifies
the aspiration of the Arabs and the Muslims all over the world for
complete control over Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers expressed hope the summit between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak at Camp David in the United States since July 11 can lead to
a final agreement on a fair peace.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Palestinian refugees, al-Khatib said any
agreement should consider the nearly 1.5 million refugees living in
Jordan, as well as the rights of Jordan that has been
hosting refugees for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordanian King Abdullah,
whose countries made peace with Israel in 1979 and 1994
respectively, held a telephone conversation on Friday to discuss
the Camp David summit. They called for a settlement that will
guarantee the Palestinians' legitimate rights, including that to
establish a state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib, who arrived in Egypt's Mediterranean port city for a
brief visit, said the two leaders are due to meet within the coming
days to further discuss the Middle East peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's public prosecutor ordered on
Saturday a journalist to stand trial for insulting the president of
Al-Azhar University in an article published in an independent
newspaper last November.
</P>
<P>
Public prosecutor Maher Abdel Wahed ordered the trial of
journalist Mohamed el-Gheiti in a criminal court on charges of
defaming and insulting Ahmed Omar Hashem by saying that Hashem
directed the university from bad to worse, the country's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In the article published in the newspaper Al-Meydan, el-Gheiti
was also accused of criticizing Hashem for turning the respectable
Islamic university into a private property.
</P>
<P>
Hashem filed a complaint with the public prosecutor against el-
Gheiti, who is originally a journalist with the Arabic-language
magazine Television and Broadcast.
</P>
<P>
In the investigations that started four months ago, el-Gheiti
claimed that he had no intention to offend the head of the
university but he was criticizing a faulty situation.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies U.S. Allegation on Kuwaiti MIAs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has denied the U.S. accusation
that it is obstructing the work of the International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) on the Kuwaiti missings in action (MIAs), the
official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Unites States Senate and Congress, Iraqi
National Assembly (parliament) Speaker Saadoun Hamadi said Iraq
will welcome the ICRC to Iraq "at any time" to settle the issue of
Kuwaiti MIAs during Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and the ensuing
Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi said Iraq has released all the Kuwaiti prisoners since
the ceasefire in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hamadi accused the Kuwaiti authorities of concealing
the truth over the fate of 1,150 missing Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has set up a "popular committee" to investigate the fate of
those Iraqis missing in the Gulf War. Neighboring Kuwait has a
similar committee to investigate the whereabouts of more than 600
Kuwaitis and other Arabs who went missing.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has denied it still holds any Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq admits it took prisoners after its occupation forces were
evicted from Kuwait, but says it lost track of them during an
uprising in southern Iraq after the Gulf War.

<P>
GAZA, July 22 ( Xinhua ) -- Over 1,000 Palestinians in Gaza and
the West Bank on Saturday staged rallies to show support for the
Palestinian delegation's insistence on the full sovereignty of
Jerusalem in the ongoing Camp David talks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
They urged Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to clutch to the
Palestinian rights regarding the issues of refugees, Jerusalem,
borders and water.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation turned down a U.S. idea that would
grant the Palestinians partial control over the sovereignty of east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Jerusalem is the foremost stumbling stone at the
Camp David negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Arab eastern part of Jerusalem during the
1967 Mideast war. Israel has repeatedly stressed Jerusalem is the
undivided capital of the Jewish state, while the Palestinians
demand that Jerusalem be the capital of their future state.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Urged to Fight against Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ethiopian official
has urged all walks of life to work closely in the fight against
rape, which has become a serious social vice in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tadelech Haile-Michael, head of the Women's Affairs Section in
the Office of the Prime Minister, told a national workshop on rape
and abduction organized by the Ethiopian Psychologists'
Association (EPA) Friday, that psychologists in particular had the
responsibility of preventing the prevalence of rape through
raising public awareness on their negative impacts and providing
counseling services for the victims.
</P>
<P>
According to Tadelech, the government was exerting utmost
efforts to ensure women's rights of equality.
</P>
<P>
She said the adoption of the National Women's Affairs Policy
and the new Family Law are testimony to the government's
determination to bring an end to discrimination against women.
</P>
<P>
According to EPA officials, sexual abuse is becoming rampant
particularly in the rural parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Federal Police Commission of Ethiopia shows
that three young girls are raped every day in the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 689 young girls and 412 adult women were raped in
the first half of this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The police commission pointed out that the figures could double
if all rapes were reported, saying threats and stigmatization are
the main reasons why rape victims do not report such violence to
the police.

Western donor countries suggested the Ethiopian government use

<HEADLINE> (Update with more details)U.S. PAC-3 Missile Again Hits Target Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The PAC-3, an improved version of the Patriots used against
Iraqi Scud missiles during the Gulf War in 1991, intercepted and
destroyed the incoming tactical ballistic missile target.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth successful "hit-to-kill" intercept in a row
for the PAC-3 since the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
The test program for the new Patriot, part of the U.S. Theater
Missile Defense (TMD) system, will include another 13 shots at
different types of target missiles.
</P>
<P>
So far, the PAC-3 has successful completed six missions. The
first two were development tests with special instrument packages
instead of the seeker.
</P>
<P>
Unlike a planned U.S. National Missile Defense (NMD) effort to
protect the whole country from long-range attack, the theater
program is designed to protect U.S. troops and bases from short-
and medium-range "theater" missiles.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan to develop anti-missile interceptors violates the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty between Moscow and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the TMD and NMD, opposed by the
international community, will not only spark a new arms race, but
also threaten security and stimulate nuclear proliferation,
instead of promoting security and stemming the spread of nuclear
weapons.

LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain has announced new sanctions
against Fiji following its unrest which ended a hostage crisis but
denied its ethnic Indian minority any significant role in
government.
</P>
<P>
The BBC quoted John Battle, Foreign Minister, Saturday as
saying that "financial assistance would be cancelled, along with
planned Royal Navy visits and joint military exercises".

Stressing the importance of an early return to full "democracy",
Battle said Britain would not issue licenses for any arms or

Earlier this week, the island's weeks-long hostage drama ended
with a deal which saw rebel leader George Speight and several of
his supporters included in a new cabinet but no cabinet role for
anyone from the Indian population.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Battle said: "We are determined to pursue a
commitment by the Fijian authorities to a timetable for return to
democratic government based on a fair constitution."
</P>
<P>
"We are pressing our EU partners to impose restrictions on
travel by George Speight and his associates. We are cancelling all
foreign office funded assistance to Fiji's government," he added.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Witness Big Fall in State Debt: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Belgium will witness a drastic
fall in its huge state debt in the next five years, according to
the latest forecasts by the country's High Finance Council, local
newspapers reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The forecast report, prepared for the government to draw up its
2001 budget in autumn, said that the debt ratio could fall to 85.7
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2005, down from 114.3
percent of GDP at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Since the launch of the euro, Belgium has rivaled Italy in the
euro zone as the country with the highest ratio of public debt to
GDP.
</P>
<P>
The latest projections also show the debt ratio falling below
100 percent of GDP in 2002, a year ahead of schedule, according to
a report in Belgian newspaper Financeel Economische Tijd.
</P>
<P>
The report of the High Finance Council confirmed that, thanks
to higher than expected growth in revenues, the government is
likely to balance its budget in 2000, two years earlier than
foreseen when the current budget was published last October.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the report is likely to reassure Belgium's
euro zone partners, which have urged the Belgian government to do
more to cut its debt, which peaked in 1993 at around 138 percent
of GDP.

CAIRO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Bahrain's telecommunications company Batelco signed a
2.2-million-U.S. dollars contract with the Middle East Logika
Company to operate a developed system for the service of the
Internet users in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The new system will provide customers with speedier access to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- An agricultural technopark, called GAPROPARK, will be
built and operated by Turkish company Alarko Holding in the
country's southeast.
</P>
<P>
The project, which was introduced to government officials,
scholars, members of the parliament and businessmen Friday, was
prepared by Alarko Holding together with Lee Organization Inc. of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's Aegean Textile Industrialists (EGS) joint
holding company will invest in e-commerce by setting up a network
on the Internet to market textile products.
</P>
<P>
EGS Executive Board Chairman Ismail Cansever announced in Izmir,
Turkey's southwestern industrial center, on Thursday that nearly 3,
000 companies will be involved in this network, adding that through
the network project, distribution of all kinds of products will be
possible.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three or four years the project will be completely

</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government will issue an "ultimatum" to
order public institutions to pay their outstanding electricity
charges to the power supply company TEDAS.
</P>
<P>
Various public institutions owe some 426 trillion Turkish liras
(roughly 700 million U.S. dollars) to TEDAS.
</P>
<P>
If the public institutions still fail to pay their dues, the
Finance Ministry will either cut their budgetary allocations or
create additional funding at the worst.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government must develop ways to improve TEAS's
productivity and reduce electricity losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province in northwest China
is to inject another 2.2 billion yuan this year into upgrading its
telecommunications network, a leading telecom operator said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Shifu, president of Shanxi Telecom, said at the
inauguration ceremony of this branch of China Telecom here today
that his company will focus its development efforts on increasing
fixed-line usage and building an information expressway based on
its fiber-optical and broadband telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
Fixed-line phone users in Shaanxi so far exceed three million,
which means that one in ten persons in the province owns a fixed-
line phone, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications industry has been considered the fastest-
growing economic sector in Shaanxi for the past 20 years. Fiber-
optical telecommunication has become a reality in all counties and
most of the townships in the province. Meanwhile, the number of
phone users increased by 400,000 in 1999, and by 580,000 in the
first six months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Villagers Help Egrets Through Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Some 350 Chinese villagers in
south China are now fighting a battle against a long-lasting
drought that threatens the survival of a group of wild egrets.
</P>
<P>
The campaign began three weeks ago, when some primary students
of Nalan Village in Yongning County in the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, discovered two young egrets dead in a bamboo
grove near the village.
</P>
<P>
Soon, more egret deaths were reported, and the villagers
realized that they had died of starvation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yang'en, a 76-year-old villager of the Zhuang ethnic
group, said, "The ponds around our village have dried up, one
after another, leading to the disappearance of most fish and
shrimps."
</P>
<P>
To save the hundreds of local egrets, all the 350 villagers
pooled a total of 1,500 yuan (nearly 200 US dollars), almost the
total yearly income of a family there, to buy food for the egrets.
</P>
<P>
"We can't lose the egrets. They came to our village in the mid-
1980s, and have been helping us kill pests since then," said
villager Zhang Wenhui.
</P>
<P>
The local government has participated into the efforts to save
the egrets, but, according to experts, if the drought continues
the situation for egrets will get even worse.
</P>
<P>
"We will do our best to save the egrets," said Zhang Wenhui,
adding that his biggest wish at present is to have a whole-day
rainstorm.

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's charge d'affairs in
Sudan
Abdou Bishri said the two countries have agreed to issue unified
cards
to facilitate the crossing of cars and the safe movement and
passage
of Sudanese and Ethiopian nationals.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Alanbaa on Saturday quoted the Ethiopian diplomat as
saying that individuals from both countries will no longer need
visas to enter the other country when the accord takes effect.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ethiopian government had printed the cards and
presented them to the Sudanese Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
Relations between neighboring Sudan and Ethiopia deteriorated in
1995 and the level of Ethiopian diplomatic representation in Sudan
was reduced following a failed assasination attempt against
visiting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopian capital of
Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia accused Sudan was behind the attempted assasination
carried out by Egyptian Islamic militants. Ties between the two
countries have been improved since March when the Sudanese-
Ethiopian joint ministerial committee convened.
</P>
<P>
And the Ethiopian government has expressed support to the

ANKARA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Four shepherds, who had set a forest fire in Buldan of
Turkey's southwestern province of Denizli, were sent to jail. The
fire burned 1,050 hectares of forests to ashes.
</P>
<P>
In violation of a government decree on closing forests to
prevent fires, Ali Dogru, Mehmet Aydogan, Irfan Aydogdu and Osman
Aydogdu set a picnic fire in the forest area and did not put it
out.
</P>
<P>
After being tried in court, the four were found guilty and
sentenced to imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish government is adopting certain measures to
minimize the negative effects of the energy shortage.
</P>
<P>
There will be limitations on the use of energy within the
framework of a "national mobilization" to maintain the balance
between electricity production and consumption.
</P>
<P>
Limitations will be imposed on window illuminations of shops,
street lights and buildings. The measures will be discussed at a
cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- The Western world in general and the European Union (EU) in
particular have been calling on Turkey to amend Article 312 of the
Turkish Penal Code (TCK) in a bid to broaden the scope of freedom
of expression.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Ankara said that Turkey, which has been a
candidate for EU membership since December of last year, should do
something about the Turkish legal system, which curbs freedom of
expression.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China will build more highways in
its western region, including two linking the heartland with the
Tibet Autonomous Region, over the next five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
One of the roads will link Dandong city in northeast China's
Liaoning province with Lhasa, capital of Tibet, and the other will
link this capital of Sichuan Province with Zhangmu,also in Tibet,
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo told a meeting on transportation
development here today.
</P>
<P>
There are already three highways linking the inland areas with
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China will also build another 14 main highways in
the western region in the coming ten years.
</P>
<P>
He added that China will have completed a modern highway
network in the west by 2030.
</P>

At the moment, roads in the western region are poor and
insufficient. There are only 7.8 km of highways per 100 sq km in
the region, only half of the national average.
</P>
<P>
China has made the improvement of infrastructure the priority
in its program to develop the vast western region.

KUWAIT City, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Defence Sheikh Salem al-Sabah has said Kuwait
Minister of Defense is studying a deal on purchasing ammunition
from the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Salem said in an interview published on saturday by the Kuwaiti

dollars deal.
</P>
<P>
Salem said that the ammunition will be used to reinforce its
armed forces' capacity, support the country's security and protect

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's International Reserves Decrease Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's international
reserves decreased by 5 percent during the two weeks of July
compared with the figure by the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
The international reserves of Bank Neraga (central bank)
Malaysia amounted to 128.4 billion ringgit (33.8 billion U.S.
dollars) as on July 14, 2000 against 129.2 billion ringgit (34
billion U.S. dollars) as on June 30, 2000, the bank announced in a
statement Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in international reserves reflects higher debt
repayments and some outflows of portfolio capital, it said.
</P>
<P>
The underlying reserves position, however, remains strong, the
bank said, adding that of importance is that this reserves level
has been enhanced by strong trade flows and not by increases in
external borrowing.
</P>
<P>
The reserves are adequate to finance 5.7 months of retained
imports and amount to 6.5 times the short-term external debt, it
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, since August 1998, reserves have
increased by 13.6 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying that he
would not take part in the talks with the government until police
conclude an investigation into his alleged links with separatist
Tamil Tiger rebels, who have been fighting a 17-year war against
the government in an attempt to create an independent Tamil state.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that other members of UNP will continue the
talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was launched after state media reported early
this week that Wickremesinghe had met a senior member of Tamil
Tiger rebel group on a recent private visit to Singapore.
Wickremesinghe dismissed the alleged charges against him.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution hopefully to be adopted before the
parliament is dissolved on August 24 is aimed at isolating the
Tamil Tiger rebels from the minority Tamil community.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the UNP and the ruling People's Alliance of
President Kumaratunga reached agreement on most parts of a draft
constitution which will devolve powers to provinces, including one
administered by Tamils.

<P>
CAIRO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt will receive a report in August on the ill-fated
EgyptAir plane which nosedived in the Atlantic Ocean on October 31,
1999. The report will cover the technical analyses and the reasons

</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt has decided to launch direct flights to be operated by
foreign airlines to Hurghada, Sharm el Sheikh, Luxor and St.
Catherines's airports, Minister of Transport, Communications and
Civil Aviations Ibrahim Mohamed el-Demiri said Friday. The decision
was made in a bid to activate foreign tourism to these areas.

<P>
Al Gomhuria:

<HEADLINE> Bell Ranked First in Turkish Helicopter Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey listed the U.S. Bell company
as its first option for co-production of 145 attack helicopters and
the Russian-Israeli consortium Kamov-IAI second, Anatolia News
Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The vague announcement that the Bell has won Turkey's multi-
billion U.S. dollars defense project was made later on Friday
following a meeting of the Defense Industry Executive Committee
chaired by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that "as a result of our evaluations, it has been
understood that we had reached the level of contract negotiations.
The contract negotiations for production of 145 strike helicopters
will be held firstly with American Bell company, and secondly with
Russian-Israeli consortium Kamov-IAI in accordance with a priority
list."
</P>
<P>
He also tried to compose Italy's Agusta, the third bidder, by
saying that it would be "approached" if talks with the first two
groups proved "unsuccessful."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Ankara did not make a clear announcement of
one single winner for the tender, likely due to both political and
diplomatic consideration as well as desires to increase its bargain
chips.
</P>
<P>
It was no secret that when Turkey selected the winner of the 4
billion dollars tender, it had to make a tough choice between its
strategic ally the United States and regional rival Russia, which
has made a joint offer with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The winning company should also be elected by taking into
consideration such matters as local and joint production,
technology transfer and financing which can meet Turkey's
interests.
</P>
<P>
Because of difficulties in reaching a decision, the tender has
already been delayed four times.
</P>
<P>
Following Friday's decision, Ecevit said that "I want to state
that starting negotiations with the selected company would not mean
that we would carry out production with this company, and we would
absolutely accept the conditions put forward by this company."
</P>
<P>
He added that "we will never make concessions from the targets
of the project," referring to conditions in favor of Turkey, such
as technology transfer, selling to third countries and logistic
supports.
</P>
<P>
The premier expected to see the first helicopter of this co-
production project "in the second half of 2003."
</P>
<P>
After the last four meetings on the tender, France's Eurocopter
and U.S. Boeing company were eliminated. The three remaining
bidders, the Russian-Israeli Kamov/IAI, the Italian Agusta and the
U.S. Bell company have launched strong lobbyist activities to win
the tender.
</P>
<P>
While the Clinton administration and the U.S. lawmakers tried to
woo Ankara by praising the country in human rights and supporting
its efforts to join the European Union, senior officials from
Russia and Israel have gone to the Prime Ministry on several
occasions in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has geared up for the bid. This week, 38 American
senators wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, saying
that they were giving their full support for strong defense
cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Friday's announcement, some analysts suggested that the
U.S. Bell company has an important advantage in the tender.
</P>
<P>
They argued that apart from Washington's political weight,
Turkey's experience of U.S. arms purchases, working with Bell in
particular, will make the company a front-runner among the bidders.
</P>
<P>
Turkish-Italian relations have still not reached desired levels
since Rome refused to extradite Abdullah Ocalan, chieftain of the
outlawed separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) who hid himself
in Italy, to Turkey in 1998, they added.
</P>
<P>
They said that if Ankara gives the tender to the Russian
company, it will arouse criticism from within North Atlantic Treaty

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Denies Progress Made at Camp David </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- No progress has been achieved on any
of the crucial issues being discussed at Camp David, said Secretary
General of the Executive Committee of Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Mahmoud Abbas Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The gaps between the Palestinians and Israel are "still wide"
not only on the issue of Jerusalem also including the Palestinian
refugees, borders of a future Palestinian state and security, said
Abbas, who is also known as Abu Mazen.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the "Voice of Palestine" radio, Abbas, who
is currently at Camp David for the negotiations on a Palestinian-
Israeli peace deal, asserted that the Palestinian side strongly
opposes the postponement of resolving the final status issues,
particularly the fate of Jerusalem. Both sides want the holy city
as their capitals.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the firm Palestinian stance over East Jerusalem,
which is occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, saying it
should be returned to the Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side cannot make any concessions on the issue
since it had already approved the U.N. Security Council Resolution
242, as well as Resolution 194 pertaining to the Palestinian
refugees and their return to their homeland, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Palestinian leadership and the Palestinian
people cannot end the half-century conflict with Israel without
reaching a lasting solution, which is based on the Israeli pullout
to the borders before the 1967 war and the implementation of
relevant international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation rejected the U.S. and Israeli
proposals on sharing sovereignty over East Jerusalem, said Abbas,
reiterating that no agreement or peace can be made without the
return of the Arab East Jerusalem to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> India Releases Five Jailed Latvians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The President, K.R. Narayanan, commuted the five's life
sentence following an appeal by the Russian government, the PTI
quoted West Bengal Jail Minister Biswanath Chowdhury as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Latvians were released from the Presidency Jail in Calcutta
on Saturday morning under strict security and driven straight to
the Russian Consulate in the city, Chowdhury added.
</P>
<P>
The five, all crew members of a Russian AN-26 aircraft, were
accused of dropping a huge cache of arms and ammunition in Purulia
district of West Bengal on the night of January 17, 1995, and were
convicted of conspiring to wage war against the state in February
this year. They were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has made constant efforts to seek the
release of the five, and the Indian President's commutation came
ahead of Russian President Putin's scheduled visit to India in
October this year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seeks ILO Ratification of Pact Against Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Presidential adviser for children's affairs Anna Madrigal said
Saturday that the pact will protect children forced to work in
hazardous jobs such as mining, scavenging and firecracker
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
She said on a TV program that Labor and Employment Secretary
Bienvenido Laguesma is now working for the ratification of the
pact by the International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
According to Madrigal, it can be an effective instrument to
fight the "worst forms of child labor" in the Philippines once it
is ratified.
</P>
<P>
"We also have laws versus child labor for kids under 15 and
those against exploitative labor," Madrigal said.
</P>
<P>
An ILO study showed that there are about 73 million child
laborers worldwide forced to engage in prostitution and slave away
in hazardous jobs in factories, mines and quarry pits.
</P>
<P>
Philippine National Red Cross Governor Rosa Rosal urged
lawmakers to come up with a law penalizing parents who force their
children to work.

<HEADLINE> Fijian President Warns Fijians Against Divisive Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Making a plea for unity on national radio, Iloilo made pointed
remarks about disagreement between different factions, referring
to the squabbling over ministerial positions that has delayed the
cabinet swearing-in, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
The AAP quoted Iloilo as saying that indigenous Fijians would
not succeed if they continue to be "divided and fragmented."
</P>
<P>
Iloilo had planned to address the nation on television but
decided instead to speak to Fijians on radio Friday night.
</P>
<P>
His broadcast was aired again in full on Saturday at least
twice, indicating the urgency of his pleas.
</P>
<P>
Iloilo said Fiji's assets were its spirit of goodwill and love
towards other races and if Fijians had goodwill, "we will hate all
intimidation and greed."
</P>
<P>
"We will be looked upon with ridicule and contempt if we do not
respect the guidance and counsel of our chiefs and elders. We will
be looked at with contempt by others and we will lose the respect
of others and the quality that made Fiji," he said.
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in of the interim government was aborted last
Wednesday when Iloilo failed to show up.
</P>
<P>
Presidential aides and the prime minister-in-waiting, Laisenia
Qarase, told reporters that Iloilo was not feeling well, but it is
understood the president was threatened with harm if he went ahead
with the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Fiji plunged into crisis on May 19 when coup leader George
Speight stormed parliament and took over the government of
Mahendra Chaudhry at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
Iloilo became president after former President Kamisese Mara
was forced to step down by Speight and his group.

<HEADLINE> China Raises Five-Point Proposal for Relations With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tang, who arrived here on Friday evening on a one-day official
visit to India, held more than two hours of talks with his Indian
counterpart External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh here on
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the press following their talks, both Tang and Singh
described their discussions as "friendly, fruitful and
constructive". Tang added that the five-point proposal he brought
to New Delhi had been supported and agreed to by his Indian
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side attached great importance to and warmly
welcomed Tang's visit, his first as Chinese foreign minister and
the most senior level visit to India by Chinese officials since
New Delhi conducted nuclear tests in May 1998, Singh noted.
</P>
<P>
On the border issue about which the Indian side has shown great
concern, Tang said that China has made "positive proposals" on
this issue, adding that the Chinese side believes that focus
should be laid on accelerating the process of the checking and
clarification of the middle sector of the Line of Actual Control (
LAC).
</P>
<P>
The joint working group on the border issue between the two
countries should also try to raise its efficiency and accelerate
its work process, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said that during the recent state
visit to China by Indian President K R Narayanan, leaders of both
countries have set the tone and worked out the framework for the
future development of Sino-Indian relations.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that in the new century China and India can
achieve a neighborly-friendly, lasting and stable cooperative
partnership in a real sense," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about China's military cooperation
with Pakistan, Tang said that the Sino-Pakistani military
cooperation was a normal military cooperation based on normal
state-to-state relations, and was not directed against any third
party or country.
</P>
<P>
He also categorically denied allegations of China's nuclear
cooperation with Pakistan, stating that as a permanent member of
the United Nations Security Council and a signatory of the Non-
Proliferation Treaty, China has always taken a "strict, serious
and responsible" attitude toward the nuclear issue.

Inaugurating the first meeting of the National Commission on
Population, he also said that the government also proposes to set
up an Empowered Action Group to prepare area-specific program,
with special emphasis on states that are lagging behind in
containing that population growth to manageable limits.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Vajpayee highlighted the states
responsibility in containing the population, pointing out that "it
is virtually impossible for any state to meet the legitimate
requirement of its people if its population continues to gallop
from one high to another".
</P>
<P>
India is the second most population country in the world, and
with only 2.5 percent of global land, it is home to nearly 17
percent of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
The country has a high child mortality rate, with as many as
100 out of every 1,000 of children under five and more than 200
out of every 1,000 under 15 running the risk of a premature death.
</P>
<P>
More than half of Indian children under four are undernourished,
30 percent of newborns are underweight and 60 percent of women
anemic.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopeful on Safe Release of Remaining Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora made it clear that the
government will still stick to its no-ransom policy, while making
sure a premium is placed on the hostages' safety.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that we will succeed in our policy not to
launch military operations against the Abu Sayyaf. We will place a
premium on safety of the hostages and I think, after this, we will
correct whatever needs to be corrected," he said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which released Friday four more Malaysians held
captive in Jolo island, Sulu, since April, is still holding 14 of
the 21 mostly foreign hostages kidnapped from neighboring Malaysia
's resort island of Sipadan on April 23. The group had earlier
released two Malaysians and one German woman.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the 14 hostages, Abu Sayyaf bandits have also in
their hands four French and German journalists, and 13 Filipino
Christian evangelists who went to their jungle lair in Jolo to
pray for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Zamora made a fresh appeal to third parties not to offer ransom
for the release of hostages.
</P>
<P>
He said the Abu Sayyaf has shown its true colors during the
ongoing hostage negotiations by quietly dropping its political
demands.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf had demanded, among other things, the creation
of an independent Islamic state and the protection of fishing
rights of the residents of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that they are no longer pushing for their so-
called political demands. On our part, we have been consistent in
our position," he said.

<HEADLINE> G8 to Launch New Round of Talks on Trade Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of
Eight (G-8) nations agreed Saturday to launch a new round of talks
on global trade liberalization at the end of this year, Japanese
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached here on the second day of the three-
day Okinawa summit of the G-8 which is comprised of the United
States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Britain and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, chairman of the summit,
was quoted as saying, "I think we share the view that launching
the new round by the end of this year would be most desirable."
</P>
<P>
However, some G-8 leaders were cautious concerning the timing
of the new round of talks, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials also noted that it remains to be seen whether a
joint declaration, to be released by the G-8 leaders Sunday, will
recommend the talks' timing.
</P>
<P>
Since the ministerial talks of the World Trade Organization (
WTO) failed to launch the new round in Seattle last December, the
issue of its timing has grown contentious among major
industrialized countries and developing nations.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Determined to Raise Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is determined to raise its oil
output by self-reliance instead of oil contracts, the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Citing an official of the Iraqi oil ministry, the INA said that
even if Iraq does not conclude contracts with foreign companies to
develop oil fields, Iraq is still to raise its crude oil output.
</P>
<P>
Ever since 1998, Iraq has been implementing a wide-scale
development plan based on self-reliance to increase its oil
production, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid stated recently that
Iraq will upgrade its crude oil output to 3.5 million barrels per
day (bpd) by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's current production stands at some 3.1 million bpd, of
which 600,000 barrels are consumed domestically and the rest for
exports.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil output has been gradually increasing. According to a
report released by the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) on June
12, Iraq produced 3.03 million bpd in May, compared with 2.63
million bpd in April and 2.16 million bpd in March.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, Iraq has repeatedly claimed that its oil industry
hit by the decade-old sanctions is in a "critical" state because of
a shortage of oil equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Iraq has often accused the U.S. and British delegates
at the United Nations Sanctions Committee of blocking contracts it
signed with foreign countries to import food, medicine and oil
spare parts within the framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that only 21 percent of the oil contracts during the
past four phases of the U.N. oil-for-food deal were approved.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Iraq singed oil contracts worth 1.4 billion
U.S. dollars with foreign companies, but only 300 million dollars
worth of contracts were released.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, but the U.N. oil-for-food accord allows Baghdad to export
crude in return for U.N.-supervised imports of humanitarian
supplies.

BELGRADE -- Conclusive evidence shows that the killing of two
ethnic Albanians in Gnjilane, Kosovo, last July was committed by U.
S. soldiers rather than by Serbs, a military court in Gnjilane was
told Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five U.S. soldiers of the NATO-led peacekeeping force in
Kosovo on duty on the night of July 10,1999 have unanimously
testified that U.S. soldiers in an observation post shot and
killed the two Albanians, French international judge Patrice de
Charette told the court on Friday. He said the three Serb suspects
who were arrested that night and had been in custody in a U.S.
base prison near Gnjilane would be released soon, according to
Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug. (Yugoslavia-Kosovo-Killing)

Following 11 days of intensive discussions, negotiators from
the U.S., Israel and Palestine had agreed to hold a pick-up

Palestinians and Israelis, ... they're not divided up into sides."

<HEADLINE> G-8 Nations Adopt IT Charter in Okinawa Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of
Eight (G-8) nations on Saturday adopted a charter to deal with the
rapid development of information technology (IT) at their second-
day session of the annual summit in Nago, Okinawa Prefecture of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Okinawa Charter on Global Information Society, also called
the "IT Charter," aims to promote the growth of IT and IT-derived
macro-economies and maximize their positive economic impacts,
while setting up provisions to actively cope with possible risks.
</P>
<P>
The charter incorporates measures for seizing opportunities and
bridging the "digital divide" between rich and poor people and
countries.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the initiative is the establishment of a task
force to follow up and coordinate policies and activities among
governments, non-governmental organizations and private companies.
</P>
<P>
In the charter, the G-8 leaders shared the view that IT is "one
of the most potent forces in shaping the 21st century," and said
it must be used to create sustainable economic growth and enhance
public welfare.
</P>
<P>
They renewed their commitment to the principle of including all
people of the world in the benefits of the information society.
</P>
<P>
"Every one, everywhere should be enabled to participate in and
no one should be excluded from the benefits of the global
information society," said the charter.
</P>
<P>
The leaders vowed to exercise their leadership in advancing
government efforts to foster an appropriate policy and regulatory
environment to stimulate competition and innovation in the IT
field.
</P>
<P>
Citing the private sector's central role in IT development, the
charter asked governments to avoid "undue regulatory interventions
" that would hinder private-sector activities.
</P>
<P>
Rather, it called for building "information networks offering
fast, reliable, secure and affordable access."
</P>
<P>
Under the charter, the proposed task force will hold its first
meeting by the end of this year to discuss ways to implement
deregulation aimed at promoting IT in the private sector, G-8
policy coordination over taxation on electronic commerce, and
measures aimed at preventing computer hacking.
</P>
<P>
It will actively facilitate discussions with developing
countries and international organizations to foster IT policy and
infrastructure, improve network connectivity and nurture IT
experts.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the United States and Russia. The three-day Okinawa summit
is the first summit to take up IT as a major issue.

WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Regina Jacobs clocked the best
time of the year in the women's 5,000 meters final and improved
her own American record in the U.S. athletics Olympic trials on

<P>
Jacobs, 36, registered a time of 14:45.35 to win her second

The time was about seven second better than her previous
American mark of 14:52.49. But she said she won't attempt an
Olympic double, preferring to stick to the shorter distance.
</P>
<P>
In decathlon, Tom Pappas edged world championships bronze
medalist Chris Huffins to win in 8,467 points. Huffins collected
8,285 to finish second.
</P>
<P>
Huffins had been regarded America's top decathlete in the past
two years as Olympic champion Dan O'Brien battled injury.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Pappas said: "I'm kind of overwhelmed right now.
I thought I had a chance going into the second day if things went
right for me, and the vault gave me my chance."

<HEADLINE> Mori Holds Talks with Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori and U.S. President Bill Clinton held talks here
Saturday on the issues of reducing the land areas occupied by U.S.
military bases in Okinawa and the planned relocation of heliport
functions from the U.S. Marine Corps' Futemma Air Station in the
central Okinawa city of Ginowan.
</P>
<P>
Mori, during the talks, also raised a proposed 15-year limit
for military use of a new military-civilian airport to be
constructed to accommodate the Futemma helicopter operations, said
a Japanese official.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government reportedly pledged earlier to seriously
consider the 15-year limit proposed by the Okinawa prefectural
government and take it up in consultations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Japan and the United States agreed to vacate the
Futemma base on condition that its helicopter operations be
relocated within Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had planned to meet on Thursday afternoon in
Tokyo, but the talks were postponed due to Clinton's delay of
arrival because of his involvement in the Middle East peace
negotiations at Camp David, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Clinton flew directly to Okinawa on Friday morning for the
three-day summit of the Group of Eight leaders from France,
Britain, Italy, Germany, the United States, Japan, Canada and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Clinton said that the U.S. government would
keep its commitments and continue to do what the U.S. can to "
reduce footprint on this land."
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Mori and Clinton agreed that the two
countries would continue negotiations on renewing a five-year
agreement on the financial arrangements supporting the U.S.
presence in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
The two countries already reached an agreement in principle a
few years ago to cut Japan's annual 1.8-billion-U.S. dollar
financial support by up to 30 million a year.
</P>
<P>
Concerning bilateral trade deregulation talks, the two leaders
agreed to continue the talks into the fourth year and applauded a
deal reached earlier this week regarding interconnection rates
charged by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), one of
Japan's giant telecommunication corporations.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the fees NTT charges its competitors for access
to its local networks will be cut by 20 percent in the first two
years and the formula to calculate the rates will be reviewed in
the third year.

<HEADLINE> Finding of First Direct Evidence of Tau Neutrino Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Scientists Friday hailed the
finding of first direct evidence of the existence of tau neutrino
as a milestone in particle physics.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous milestone," said Stanford University
physicist Martin Perl, winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize for
discovering the tau lepton, the first sign indicator for the tau
neutrino.
</P>
<P>
"Finding the tau neutrino is very important and very exciting."
</P>
<P>
Physicists at the U.S. Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
announced Friday that they have produced the first direct evidence
for the tau neutrino, confirming the existence of an
extraordinarily elusive constituent of matter.
</P>
<P>
"This completes the picture of the subatomic constituents of
matter," said Phil Yager, a physicist at the University of
California at Davis, and a participant in the experiment.
</P>
<P>
"It's really important to see that this thing does in fact
exist and that it behaves the way we expected it to," he told
Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Yager said scientists can build another experiment that may
take physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary physics since
they can now detect the tau neutrino. "In the near future, there
is going to be a lot of even more exciting neutrino physics, " he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Standard Model postulates that virtually every conceivable
state of matter or energy can be embodied in a few particles and
the "matter particles" include six kinds of quarks, and six kinds
of leptons (The term lepton derives from the Greek word for "small
"). The neutrino resides in the lepton clan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier experiments had produced only indirect evidence for the
existence of the tau neutrino, which is massless or almost
massless, carries no electric charge and barely interacts with
surrounding matter.
</P>
<P>
The idea for the experiment that produced the neutrino evidence
came in 1994 from one of Yager's graduate students, Vittorio
Paolone, and a Fermilab physicist, Byron Lundberg.
</P>
<P>
The experiment was named Direct Observation of the Nu Tau, or
DONUT. Paolone, who was then a research physicist at University of
California at Davis, and Yager and others at Davis built a key
component of the experiment in 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
Overall, 54 scientists were involved in pinning down the tau
neutrino, from 21 institutions and four countries, including the
United States, Japan, Greece and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Physicist Wolfgang Pauli first proposed in 1930 the existence
of a neutral particle, later named "neutrino," for "little neutral
one," by Enrico Fermi. Experiments since have demonstrated the
existence of two species of neutrinos, the electron neutrino and
the muon neutrino, and suggested the existence of a third species.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Becomes Leading Candidate for Bush Running Mate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. former Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney has become the leading candidate for the running mate
of Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, an AP report
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Republican official as saying that Bush is
"very very close" to select Cheney, head of Bush's vice
presidential selection team, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, cautioned that Bush has not made his
final decision yet, but he is likely to make up his mind as early
as Monday, a week before the opening of the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Cheney, a Texas businessman, has changed his voter registration
from Texas to Wyoming to make him eligible to run with Bush, the
two-term Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Constitution forbids the Electoral College voters in
Texas from voting for both the president and vice president who
are "inhabitants" of their state. Cheney
</P>
<P>
Cheney served as defense secretary under Bush's father, former
President George Bush, from 1989-93 and successfully cut defense
spending in his tenure. He was also a key strategist in the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
A respected public figure with a long record of service, Cheney,
59, would be a low-risk pick, but his health would be a question
with three mild heart attacks by the age of 48, AP said.
</P>
<P>
He was mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate
for the older Bush in 1992.

</P>
<P>
He said, "we can conduct snap inspections to ensure (the banks)
follow the rulings. They have to be careful."
</P>
<P>
Currency traders said inspectors from the central bank began
showing up at the dealing rooms of banks, particularly foreign
banks, last week to ask questions about currency transactions and
to examine documents.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Bank Indonesia Acting Governor Anwar
Nasution said Friday the central bank had appealed to its
counterparts overseas to help curb speculation on the rupiah
abroad.
</P>
<P>
He did not provide any further details.
</P>
<P>
Many believe the rupiah has been heavily speculated on in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has been under pressure over the past couple of
weeks, plunging to a 21-month low of 9,570 against the U.S. dollar
early this week as political conflicts in the country escalated.
</P>
<P>
Although the local currency gained back some ground between
Tuesday and Thursday, analysts said the rupiah remained vulnerable
due to the continuing domestic political uncertainty ahead of the
General Session of the People's Consultative Assembly in August.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah closed lower at 9,025 to the dollar in late trading
on Friday, compared to its Thursday close of 8,890.

<HEADLINE> Medical Biotechnology Benefits Millions of Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 270 million people
worldwide have benefited from biotech drugs and vaccines,
according to a report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The first medical biotech product is less than 20 years old
and already 270 million patients have been helped by this
technology," said the report from the U.S.-based Biotechnology
Industry Organization (BIO), which represents some 900 companies,
academic institutions and biotech centers in 26 nations.
</P>
<P>
The BIO has conducted a study based on the approximate number
of people who have been helped directly by biotech drugs and
vaccines currently on the market. Biotech drugs and vaccines are
classified as those medicines developed through cellular or
molecular processes.
</P>
<P>
The rapid progress demonstrates the potential of the young
industry to develop cures and therapies for debilitating diseases
such as heart disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and various forms
of cancer, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The biotechnology industry currently has more than 350
medicines in late-stage clinical trials. Nearly 100 biotech drugs
and vaccines have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, according to the BIO.
</P>
<P>
Non-medical applications of biotechnology are also contributing
to the quality of life for people worldwide, the BIO said.
Agricultural biotech products are helping farmers produce stronger
and healthier crops and industrial biotech products are making
manufacturing cleaner and more efficient.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the BIO said, the biotechnology industry,
which as a whole remains unprofitable, makes substantial
contributions to the economy. Altogether, biotech companies
generated more than 430,000 jobs and 47 billion U.S. dollars in
revenues in 1999. Biotech firms' spending on research and
development totaled 11 billion dollars, and their tax revenues
amounted 10 billion dollars in the same year.

Montreal and Calgary-based Canadian National Railway (CN)
announced two deals Friday for sharing rail corridors in eastern
North America.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the former rivals said the agreements
were aimed at improving efficiency while keeping strong
competition between the two historic railways.
</P>
<P>
Under a five-year agreement, CN will be allowed to move forest
products and some other commodities from Quebec, Canada, to
destinations as far as New York City, Albany, Philadelphia and
Scranton in the eastern part of the United States.
</P>
<P>
CPR will receive reciprocal haulage from CN to ship the same
commodities into Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes in eastern
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The two companies also agreed on a three-year deal for sharing
CN's busy Toronto-Chicago corridor, according to the joint
statement.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came a day after CN and U.S. rail giant
Burlington Northern Santa Fe killed their seven-month-old merger
proposal because of a time-consuming moratorium imposed on the
deal on the part of the United States. The deal would have created
the continent's largest railway.

bridging the "digital divide" between rich and poor people and
countries.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the initiative will be the establishment of a task
force to follow up and coordinate policies and activities among
governments, non-governmental organizations and private companies.
</P>
<P>
Besides economic issues, the G-8 leaders are also expected to
confirm their stepped-up fight against AIDS and other infectious
diseases, and set numerical targets for their eventual eradication.

<HEADLINE> Camp David Talks Slow for Jewish Sabbath </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The three-way Middle East peace
talks at Camp David near Washington slowed down on Friday with the
beginning of the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
Following 11 days of intensive discussions, negotiators from
the U.S., Israel and Palestine had agreed to hold a pick-up
basketball game after sunset.
</P>
<P>
Describing this as a "new development," U.S. State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said earlier Friday that "the teams will
be mixed up between Americans, Palestinians and Israelis, ...
they're not divided up into sides."
</P>
<P>
Despite the lessening formality of the talks, Boucher said the
parties remained serious and committed to reaching a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Serious efforts are under way by the negotiators, led by their
leadership, to try to deal with these (final status) issues," he
said.
</P>
<P>
During daytime Friday, Boucher said, small groups of
negotiators continued to discuss the core issues of Israeli-
Palestinian conflict at the U.S. presidential retreat in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who stepped in when
President Bill Clinton is away in Japan for a summit of
industrialized countries, participated in some of the group
discussions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that Clinton has rearranged his
schedule in Japan to return a few hours earlier than scheduled on
Sunday afternoon to continue his mediation at Camp David.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Disappointed at G-7 Inaction on Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Friday expressed disappointment at the failure of the
Group of Seven G-7) most industrialized nations to provide the
promised debt relief to poor countries in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Britain, Canana, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and
the United States issued a statement in Okinawa, Japan, on Friday,
saying they would strengthen efforts agreed upon in Cologne,
Germany, last year to help 41 poorest nations. The statement,
however, spelled out no specific measures or new plans on how to
speed the process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said: "
For four years, we have had too many promises and too little
action."
</P>
<P>
Noting that last year the G-7 promised to cancel some 100
billion U.S. dollars of debt to some of the world's poorest
countries, Annan said: "But thus far only nine out of 41 heavily
indebted poor countries have qualified for relief worth some 15
billion."
</P>
<P>
"I recognize that there are no simple solution to the debt
problem. But where there is agreement in principle that debt
relief is essential, and where delays have a profoundly negative
impact on the lives of poor people, clearly more must be done,"
the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged all parties to commit themselves to resolving their
differences on this vital issue as a matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, the world's poorest
countries identified by the United Nations as highly indebted poor
countries owe about 200 billion dollars in nominal terms. Of that,
60 billion is owed to institutions such as the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, 20 billion is corporate debt, and the
other 120 billion is bilateral loans.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Rueful Over Fallout From Sacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A day after his scathing attack on
the House of Representatives (DPR), Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid Friday offered his apology with the legislative
body to let the interpellation matter rest in order to reduce
political tension in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent Friday evening to the House, Wahid insisted he
had already expressed his regret despite the House's demand for an
apology.
</P>
<P>
"In all sincerity, once again I'm sorry for all the effects
that should not have happened," he said, according to a copy of
the letter delivered to House Speaker Akbar Tanjung.
</P>
<P>
Akbar read out the gist of the letter latter in Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this (gesture) will be well received by all and marks
the start of an attempt to reduce tension and to build better
relations between us all," the president said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
The row with the House was prompted by his response at the
House on Thursday to an interpellation motion to answer questions
about his reasons for firing two ministers in April.
</P>
<P>
The president said the use of the interpellation motion,
submitted under a 1999 law, was a betrayal of the 1945
Constitution and that he was not under any obligation to answer
the House summons. The president refused to answer five questions
posed to him by the House.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's statement triggered angry and disappointments among
parliamentarians. Accusing of arrogant and not cooperative, some
parliamentarians demand the president to apologize to the House or
facing another motion.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House Akbar Tandjung said after the Thursday
meeting that the House will wait a comprehensive written answer
from the president by Friday afternoon at the latest.
</P>
<P>
"If the House does not satisfy with the response, we can file
another motion," Tandjung told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In April, the president dismissed two ministers, namely
Minister of Investment Laksamana Sukardi of the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle and Minister of Trade and Industry
Jusuf Kalla of the Golkar Party. Wahid said he fired them because
they were corrupt.
</P>
<P>
The two former ministers denied the accusations and angry
colleagues in the House then instigated the interpellation motion.

WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- German veteran Lothar Matthaeus

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Dominates Men's Doubles in Indonesia Badminton Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia maintained its supremacy
in the men's doubles while their women's singles seeded players
suffered upset in the quarter-finals of the Sanyo Indonesia Open
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the men's doubles, top seeded Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan
led Indonesia's campaign for the title. They fought tooth and
nail to beat Malaysian arch-rivals Choong Tan Fook and Lee Wan Wah
17-14, 15-11.
</P>
<P>
Sigit Budiarto and Halim Heryanto stole the attention of the
spectators in a thrilling match against Simon Archer and Nathan
Robertson of England. The Indonesian took the semifinals berth
after winning 15-13, 5-15, 15-9.
</P>
<P>
With Ricky Subagja/Rexy Mainaky and Flandy Limpele/Eng Hian
also making it to the semi-finals, Indonesia has now secured the
men's doubles crown.
</P>
<P>
In women's singles, former Indonesia's Uber Cup toast Mia
Audina, who is now playing for the Netherlands, became the biggest
seeded casualty as she was sent packing by her ex-teammate Lidya
Djaelawidjaja who won 8-11, 11-9, 11-0 for a place in Saturday's
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
"I caught a cold after Thursday's match and I didn't feel well.
I'm not disappointed with the result. If I can't win here, I'll
focus my attention on the Olympic Games," the fourth-seedd Mia
said.
</P>
<P>
Lidya said: "I tried to play long rallies but Mia was very good
in her strokes. I was very tense in the first game but in the
second she was powerless and started to make unforced errors. In
the third game I played more relaxed."
</P>
<P>
Lidya will meet top seed Camilla Martin of Denmark, who had to
stretch muscles to defeat fifth seed Kanako Yonekura of Japan 11-4,
7-11, 11-5.
</P>
<P>
In another match, eighth seeded Marina Andrievskaya of Sweden
bowed out to Wang Chen of Hong Kong, China 6-11, 4-11. Wang will
play Kelly Morgan of Wales, who won over Judith Meulendijks of the
Netherlands 11-4, 11-1.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles, giant killer Roslin Hashim of Malaysia
cruised to the semi-finals after eliminating Park Tae-sang of
South Korea 15-11, 15-8.
</P>
<P>
Roslin is scheduled to face Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia, who
had to struggle before overcoming Agus Hariyanto of Hong Kong,
China 12-15, 15-3, 15-11.
</P>
<P>
"The chance to win the event remains open wide. I have met
Taufik two times and I only won once," Roslin said.
</P>
<P>
The other semi-finals will see Johan Hadikusuma of Indonesia
against Ong Ewe Hock of Malaysia. Unseeded Johan fought
heroically against a nasty case of diarrhea Thursday evening
before eliminating Malaysian Yap Yong Jyen 15-8, 13-15, 15-8.

</P>
<P>
It warns, however, that the campaign, which was launched by the

1999, and is being led by the CPC, will be a "long-term, tortuous
and complicated" one.
</P>

The article said that the anti-science, anti-humanity and anti-
society cult has been turned into an anti-government political
organization and a tool for overseas anti-China forces.

According to the article, since May this year, the cult leader,
Li Hongzhi, has came out from behind the curtain to publish his
instructions via the Internet and repeatedly spelt out his
hackneyed remark about the "final chance for 'consummation'" to
urge his followers to come out "against the pressure", and risk
direct confrontation with the government.

<P>
One out of ten families like Suya's in Dongwuzhuer Town has
benefited from the program.
</P>
<P>
Hugging his son, a proud Suya said, "My boy is extremely
healthy. I don't see any need for a second son."
</P>
<P>
Suya and Qiqige take little Batu by tractor or horse to a
boarding school in town every Sunday, where the boy studies both
in Chinese and Mongolian. He lives there during the schoolweek,
and comes home on weekends.
</P>
<P>
Qiqige wants him to go to university in the region's capital
Hohhot or Beijing. "We wouldn't have enough money to do that if we
had more children."
</P>
<P>
Duan Yi, an official with the Hohhot government said that
although minorities are allowed to have more children, "we modern
Mongolians think that one healthy child is far more important."
The 41-year-old Mongolian official has a daughter.
</P>
<P>
Local government workers, in buses and on horseback, are now
distributing pamphlets on birth control and general reproductive
health throughout the 880,000-square kilometers of grassland.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Herdsman Suya Latu lounges against
his tractor, enjoying the afternoon sunshine over the grassland of
Inner Mongolia. Two new-born lambs compete for the business end of
the milk bottle held by Suya's wife Qiqige. His eight-year-old son
Audun Batu romps with his dog outside the family's tent, while his
flock of sheep graze contentedly nearby.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Mongolian man told Xinhua in an interview that
this bucolic existence is possible because of the 30 ewes provided
to him by the local government of Dongwuzhuer Town in Chenbaerhu
County. Under an agreement with the local government, all the
lambs produced by Suya's ewes are his, and he is allowed to pay
lower fees for grassland use.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, the Inner Mongolian government has carried out an
incentive program to make life easier for herdsmen by offering
financial assistance in return for single-child families.
</P>
<P>
China's family planning policy rules that a couple can only
have one child, but minority couples, including those of the
Mongolian nationality, may have two or three. Some ethnic groups
with population under 100,000 are allowed to have as many children
as they wish to guarantee the minority's propagation.
</P>
<P>
In times past, herdsmen used to have more than one child as a
result of the high infant mortality rate in the grassland area.
</P>
<P>
China's 55 minorities account for 8.98 percent of the huge 1.25
billion population. The country's first minority autonomous region
of Inner Mongolia is home to 49 minorities who make up 20.57
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the government's generosity and his improved
living condition, Suya and Qiqige, like most of their fellow
herding families, are choosing to have just one child.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that five million more people would have been
born in the region in the past three decades if the local
authorities had not adopted the family planning policy. The birth
rate there in 1999 was 13.32 per thousand, 7.87 per thousand fewer
than in 1990. And the country's average birth rate is 16.3 per
thousand.

BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are top legal news
events that took place in China last week.
</P>
<P>
 No Change in Death Sentence of Murderers of German
</P>
<P>
 Family
</P>
<P>
The death sentences handed down to the four men convicted of
murdering German citizen Juren Hermann Pfrang and his family are
not subject to change, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a regular press conference in response
to a question on a report that the German government and relatives
of the German victims petitioned for a lesser punishment for the
four defendants.
</P>
<P>
At midnight on April 1, the four accused, Zhong Weiyang, Liu
Guangyuan, Ding Shanyang, and Zhang Eryang, who are all from
Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, broke into the Nanjing residence
of the Pfrang family and stabbed to death all the family members
including Jurgen Hermann Pfrang and his wife, and their two
children.
</P>
<P>
 Special Task Force for Economic Crimes in Shanghai
</P>
<P>
An economic crimes investigation team affiliated with Shanghai
Security Bureau has uncovered 2,300 economic cases within a year,
seizing more than 1,400 suspects and recovering 770 million yuan (
about 93 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although the task force was still in its infancy, it has gained
popularity in this Chinese commercial hub.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Hacker Sentenced to One-Year Imprisonment
</P>
<P>
Wang Bo, the first convicted hacker in central China's Henan
Province, said he would appeal to the higher court after being
sentenced to one-year imprisonment Tuesday by a district court in
this provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 23, was charged with destroying computer data system. He
was a former employee of the China Pacific Insurance Company Ltd.
in Zhengzhou. He had hacked into the company's database five times
by June 15 last year, and altogether deleted 1,510 policy records
from the computer system, altered the premium and benefit payment
schedules of more than 10,000 policy records, and changed the
company's service telephone number.

<HEADLINE> Life Suspension for Cuban Weightlifter for Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A Cuban weightlifter was banned for
life after failing a drug test earlier this month, Cuba's National
Sports Institute (INDER) announced in a statement published in
local daily newspaper Granma here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Montoya Laurencio of the 105 kg plus category failed an
international dope test carried out July 6 at a local tournament
in the eastern province of Holguin. He was found to have traces
of a performance-enhancing drug identified as "mantandienona".
</P>
<P>
"The Cuban sporting movement has been, is, and will be
intransigent in the case of any evidence of doping, a harmful and
unacceptable practice," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is currently defending high-jump world record holder
Javier Sotomayor and three other weight-lifters, all of whom
failed dope tests at the Pan American Games in Canada last year
and had been banned by international federations.

LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The jury in the case of two former
British policemen accused of manslaughter after the deaths of 96
Liverpool fans at Hillsborough soccer stadium in 1989 ruled on
Friday that one of the officers not guilty.
</P>
<P>
Ex-Superintendent Bernard Murray was found not guilty of
manslaughter, a spokeswoman at Leeds Crown Court said.
</P>
<P>
The jury was still considering the charges against former Chief
Superintendent David Duckenfield who ran the policing operation.
</P>
<P>
The private prosecution by the Hillsborough Families Support
Group followed a government decision to turn down appeals for a
new inquiry into the deaths of the fans.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the families said the soccer fans died in a crush
after the two policemen allowed in more spectators than the
stadium capacity which led to a severe overcrowding in one of the
terraces.
</P>
<P>
The disaster was the worst in British sporting history when the
fans died after being crushed against railings at the 1989 FA Cup
semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the stadium
in Sheffield, northern England.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Dome Won't Close Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Millennium Dome will
remain open until the end of the year and its management will not
seek a further Lottery bail-out, said the Dome's chief executive
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pierre-Yves Gerbeau was responding to reports that the Dome's
directors were so alarmed about its financial situation that they
had called in lawyers to advise them on whether they could
continue to trade.
</P>
<P>
It was suggested that Simmons &AMP; Simmons, insolvency specialists,
were called in by the 12-strong board amid fears that the New
Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) would not be financially
viable unless receipts increase.
</P>
<P>
Further speculation suggested the situation was so critical
that a further injection of 30 million pounds (48 million U.S.
dollars) was needed to keep the project afloat until the year's
end, the planned closure date.
</P>
<P>
In May, the Dome was bailed out with 29 million pounds of
Lottery money on the back of disappointing attendance numbers and
revenues.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Gerbeau said: "As I've said many times before:
the Dome will be open for business until December 31 this year.
There is no question of an early closure. Our visitor numbers are
increasing - with superb levels of satisfaction -our costs are
down, and we are driving revenue up through food and merchandise
sales and corporate hospitality events."
</P>
<P>
The NMEC is now budgeting on having seven million visitors this
year - including one million free-admission schoolchildren.This
compares with the original estimate of 12 million visitors,which
was reduced to 10 million in February and then lowered to seven
million in May.

<HEADLINE> Mowlam Backs Bugging of Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein has accused the
intelligence community of trying to sabotage the Northern Ireland
peace process following an admission from Mo Mowlam,Britain's
former Northern Ireland secretary, that she sanctioned the bugging
of a car used by Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin
McGuinness.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet Office Minister told a television programme to be
screened on Monday night that she approved the bugging of a car
used by the Sinn Fein leaders during last year's talks to resolve
the decommissioning and devolution dispute.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance device was discovered by Sinn Fein and
displayed at a Stormont press conference in December just days
after the formation of the Northern Ireland executive.
</P>
<P>
The incident was described by Adams as a "hugely serious breach
of faith" which could have damaged the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It was also condemned by the Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
and Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Office officials, at the time, refused to
confirm military intelligence involvement in the incident.
</P>
<P>
However, Mowlam told BBC that the car was bugged in order to
save lives, with the driver believed to have been the target of
the security forces' operation.
