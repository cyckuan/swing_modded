<HEADLINE> News Analysis: UAE Uneasy Over Iran's Diplomatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami Thursday wrapped up his historic tour of Saudi Arabia
and Qatar, crowning a rapprochement between Iran and its Gulf
neighbors since the moderate leader came to power in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the prospect of closer relations between Iran and
some Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries put the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) at loss as its the long-standing dispute with Iran
over three strategic islands has become more sticky.
</P>
<P>
The islands of Abu Moussa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs, located
near the strategic Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf, are claimed by
both countries but have been controlled by Iran since Britain
retreated from the region in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Aware of its weakness, The UAE has over a long time used the
GCC, an alliance which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Bahrain and the UAE, as a means to exert pressure on Iran in the
dispute. Relying on the collective power, the UAE has effectively
held Iran at bay.
</P>
<P>
On March 4, for example, the UAE convened an emergency meeting
of GCC foreign ministers, discussing Iran's military exercises
near the three islands. The meeting ended with a collective
statement condemning Iran's actions as provocations. The UAE also
holds military exercises with its allies regularly to counter
the so-called Iranian threat.
</P>
<P>
Now the situation has changed. A series of visits between
Iran and some GCC countries recently have made a dent in the
UAE's collective strategy.
</P>
<P>
Before Khatami's landmark tour, Tehran had received Saudi
Defense Minister Prince Sultan ibn Abel Aziz and Bahrain's
Foreign Minister Sheikh Muhammed bin Mubarak bin Hamad Al
Khalifa. Undoubtedly, these exchanges of visits have cleared the
way for broad cooperation.
</P>
<P>
With these new developments, the UAE is no longer expecting
reliable backing from its Gulf brothers in its dispute with Iran.
GCC members will have to take sides. Traditionally, they should
lend their hands to the UAE, but now there will be a discount
inevitably.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, which calls for united actions among GCC members,
is apparently dismayed at the rapprochement with Iran while the
islands dispute remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
On May 10, just ahead of Khatami's landmark tour of Syria,
Saudi Arabia and Qatar, UAE President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al
Nahyan skipped a GCC summit in Jeddah, sending Abu Dhabi Crown
Prince Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan as his
representative. Analyst noted this was the first time Sheikh
Zayed had been absent at such a high-level gathering of GCC
members.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was held in line with a decision taken
at the GCC's last annual summit in Abu Dhabi last December,
discussed improvement of relations with Iran but ended in
silence, without any communique or statement showing a common
stand.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Takes Further Step in EU Membership bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has taken another step in
its bid for EU membership by joining an EU development program,
the Cyprus News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fifth Program - Framework for Research and Technological
Development of the European Union (EU) covers the EU policy on
research and technology issues for the period from 1998 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' EU accession course is proceeding satisfactorily and
the island's participation in the program is an additional step
to that end, said Cyprus Finance Minister Takis Clerides after
signing relevant protocol Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The document was also signed by President of EU Council of
Ministers, German Education Minister Edelgard Bulmahn and EU
Commissioner Edith Cresson.
</P>
<P>
Germany is currently holding EU's rotatory presidency.
</P>
<P>
The German minister said that Cyprus' participation in the
program will enable European and Cypriot researchers and research
centers to cooperate on programs for their mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has scored great achievements in the fields of research
and management of water resources, agriculture, genetics and
information, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
While expressing satisfaction over Cyprus' move, Cresson
praised the island's presence in EU's research programs.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and was engaged in
substantial accession talks with the EU in November 1998.

<HEADLINE> Qatar, Iran Call for Maintaining Regional Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Qatar and Iran Thursday called
for Gulf states to join their hands in maintaining security and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued at the conclusion of an official
visit to Qatar by Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, both
countries underlined the necessity for all Gulf states to foster
regional security and stability according to principles of the
United Nations convention and international laws.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi issue, the two countries expressed their
keenness on maintaining Iraq's independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity and rejected foreign intervention in its
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they urged Iraq to fully comply with related
international resolutions and resume cooperation with the United
Nations, the Kuwait News Agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Middle East peace process, Iran and Qatar
voiced solidarity with the Palestinian people and condemned
Israel's expansionist policies in the occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
They offered firm support to Syria in its continuous efforts
to end the Israeli occupation of the strategic Golan Heights, and
also stressed the need for Israel to withdraw from south Lebanon
and Western Bekka in line with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Khatami returned to Iran earlier in the day after wrapping up
his two-day visit to Qatar, the last leg of his eight-day Arab
tour, which also included Syria and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Dismisses Western Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa dismissed Thursday western media's misleading reports about
Africa, which describe the continent as full of civil wars,
dictatorship and closed economies, saying this is "oversimplified
generalization."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Fifth African-African American Summit in Accra,
Ghana, Mkapa said African continent is full of enormous potentials
in political, economic and human resources.
</P>
<P>
He said generalization of Africa into a single country,
ignoring the differences from one country to another and region to
region is wrong and should be discarded, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Partners willing to cooperate can still identify stability, new
 leadership and vision, and investment friendly policies in a lot
of African countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the majority of African countries are
practising democracies and are increasingly transiting from one
government to another without coup d'etat or civil strifes, citing
Botswana, Senegal and Tanzania which have gone through three terms
of government in succession peacefully.
</P>
<P>
However, Mkapa noted that there have been incidents of coups
d'etat and civil wars, which are not unique to the African
continent but also happen in other parts of the world. He called
for global efforts to redress the trend.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said Africa is faced with several tasks, one of which is
to fight corruption vigorously and improve governance with greater
attention to prudent economic, fiscal and monetary policies as
well as the social sector and development of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa is creating more space for the private sector,
citing 2, 718 transactions worth three billion U.S. dollars which
took place by 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, over 200 transactions took place in Tanzania, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president said economic growth in Africa was
fast, attaining 3.3 percent last year, highest among all regions
in the world. He added that the trend is likely to continue this
year.
</P>
<P>
He said according to forecast by the Economic Intelligent Unit,
among 20 fastest growing countries, nine are in Africa, eight of
which are in sub- Sahara Africa, Tanzania inclusive.
</P>
<P>
Return on investment in Africa was higher than in other
regions, he said, noting that over the last few years the rate in
Africa has seen five percent higher than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa invited American companies and individuals to invest in
his country, saying there are a lot of opportunities in
agriculture, mining, textile and manufacturing, tourism, as well
as hotel and banking industries.
</P>
<P>
"Investments in Tanzania are fully protected against arbitrary
nationalization and expropriation, and international financial
transactions are fully liberalized," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for debt relief, including debt cancellation for the
poorest countries and for continued aid, not simply as charity but
as a long-term investment in creating a conducive climate for
economic development.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to Americans to take the lead in fostering
cooperation with Africans which will lead to poverty eradication
and sustainable development of Africa.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of "Business, Trade and Investment" and "Africa
Can Compete", the week-long summit, which started Wednesday, has
brought together over 5,000 government officials, business
executives and tourists from the United States, Europe, Asia and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Previous summits were held in Cote d'ivoire, Gabon, Senegal and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agencies Plan for Refugees' Return to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) and other U.N. agencies have begun planning
for the return of up to 1.5 million Kosovo refugees and internally
displaced people to their homes, U.N. sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said in a 19-page report on the subject that plans
must be made despite "remote" prospects for the return at the
present time, a U.N. spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has set four possible phases in the effort to help
the return, which include planning and preliminary steps,
resumption of operations in Kosovo, repatriation and return, and
reintegration.
</P>
<P>
In the final phase, the UNHCR said, the process of
reconciliation will be "long and slow" given the fact that the
majority of Kosovars are Albanians and the minority are Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Province has nearly 2 million inhabitants, 90
percent of whom are Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) war
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, of which Kosovo is an
unalienable part, has forced some 800,000 Kosovars to flee their
homes, leaving an almost equal number of people displaced.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian disaster made neighboring countries such as
Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro refugees' major temporary
shelters.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP), the largest food aid
organization, appealed to the international community for an
additional 63.1 million U.S. dollars in emergency food program to
Kosovo refugees.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Hails Barak's Victory as Israeli PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President Omar
Juma hailed Thursday Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak's
stunning victory in Monday's prime ministerial election, saying
this was a beacon of hope of peace and tranquility in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Juma said in the State House that Tanzania was optimistic that
Israelis and Palestinians would soon agree in pursuing the Oslo
Accord aimed at reaching a mutual agreement on peace.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting Thursday with the Palestine's Ambassador to
Tanzania Farez Mehdawi, Juma said Tanzania appreciated the
patience shown by Palestinians when there was a deadlock in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mehdawi, who is the leader of the diplomatic corps in the
country, expressed thanks to Tanzania for its sustained solidarity
with the Palestinians in their struggle for just rights.
</P>
<P>
Barak, a 57-year-old former army chief, pledged Tuesday to
unite his divided country in a push for peace with its Arab
neighbors and with itself.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to withdraw Israeli troops from a south
Lebanon occupation zone within a year, restart stalled peace talks
with Syria and reach a final peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak asserted that he would retain Israeli control over all of
 Jerusalem, keep large blocs of Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip and ensure that a Palestinian entity would be
demilitarized.
</P>
<P>
Barak's landslide triumph against former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu raised hopes worldwide that the search for
peace in the Middle East would win a new boost after three years
of virtual stagnation under Netanyahu.

<TEXT>
<P>
During their talks, President Taylor expressed the readiness of
his government to find a solution to the disagreement that would
be acceptable to all parties.
</P>
<P>
Taylor Wednesday warned the international community against
seizing a stockpile of surrendered weapons in Monrovia, and
accused the west Africa peacekeeping forces or ECOMOG of plotting
to overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
Tension increased between ECOMOG and Liberian government when
arms were surrendered by about 21,000 factional fighters before
the 1997 election.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Thursday the arms should be handed over to his
country's armed forces and not be allowed to be used for
destabilizing his government.
</P>
<P>
"We will be fools not to protect these arms," Taylor reportedly
said Wednesday before sending troops to ECOMOG base where the arms
were stored.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1996 agreement signed by Liberia's disbanded
warring factions in Abuja, Nigeria's capital, the United Nation
and ECOWAS were to decide what to do with more than a million
surrendered arms and ammunition collected from Liberian
ex-combatants.

ABU DHABI -- The victory of Labor Party leader Ehud Barak in

Gulf countries, with some expressing hope that Middle East peace
process will be resumed soon, while others doubting real progress
can be made.

Oman is one of the Gulf countries that has hailed Labor's
victory over Likud in Monday's elections. Qatar is another GCC
country that echoed Oman's voice. In contrast, other GCC members,

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema Thursday expressed his worry about decline of public
opinion on the war against Yugoslavia because NATO has killed a
lot of civilians and caused much damage to civil properties since
it started the air campaign in March 24.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana at NATO
headquarters here in Brussels, D'Alema told a press conference
that the Italian government believed "there should be great care
to avoid tragic errors, which would increase the sense of
uneasiness and misunderstanding in public opinion".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some reports said a NATO missile hit a hospital in
Belgrade early Thursday, killing at least three people and
injuring two women in labor. At the same time, Swedish
ambassador's residence was also slightly damaged. The angry
ambassador said that it was an "unacceptable" incident.
</P>
<P>
A NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, told a daily news briefing that
one of eight laser-guided bombs targeted an army barracks in
Belgrade went astray over the intended target center, but he
declined to confirm that the damaged building was a hospital.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema also told reporters that the NATO aircraft during the
air war had so far dropped at least 143 bombs into Adriatic Sea
near his country, which he said certainly poses threat to tourism
and fisheries.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Continue to Help Govt After Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela said Thursday he would continue to support the African
National Congress (ANC) government after his retirement next
month.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the South Africa Broadcasting
Corporation television, Mandela said he would spend the first two
or three years of his retirement to write memos of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
However, he would always be ready to answer the call of the new
 government as he is a "loyal and disciplined" member of his
organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I will have no separate dreams and visions from that of the
African National Congress."
</P>
<P>
"If they ask me to render some service I will listen to that
most sympathetically."
</P>
<P>
Mandela is scheduled to retire from active politics on June 16
when his successor is inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear again that he would not be drawn into
international disputes that would take a long time to tackle.
</P>
<P>
He said he spoke to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic earlier Thursday to mediate
over the trial of two Australians in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But he said he intervened only because the matter was easy to
solve, otherwise South African issues would come "first and
foremost".
</P>
<P>
He said he is satisfied with the past five years.
</P>
<P>
"I regard them as the five years of unexpected achievement,
although there have been weaknesses and mistakes."
</P>
<P>
He said a bloodless revolution has been achieved and the
dignity of all South Africans has been restored. The country also
maintained political and economical stability.
</P>
<P>
During the interview Mandela said repeatedly that he regarded
himself as a member of his organization and attributed his
achievements to the ANC and the other elements of the liberation
movement including the Pan Africanist Congress and the Azanian
People's Organization.
</P>
<P>
"I did not walk that journey (to freedom) alone."

<HEADLINE> Moscow Urges UNITA to Release Russian Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Thursday urged Angola's UNITA to free the Russian crew of an An-26
plane.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the crew is an open violation of the principles
of international law and an act of international terrorism, the
ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Russian pilots have never served in the Angolan Air Force,
neither have they participated in implementing the Angolan Army
tasks or combat operations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the aircraft was a civil plane making only
commercial shipments.
</P>
<P>
The An-26 was shot down, apparently by a missile, near the
Angolan city of Luzamba, north Luanda province on May 12. Three
crew members were seized by UNITA opposition fighters, the
Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The plane was chartered by the Angolan company Avita nd
transported food and other civil cargo on Angolan internal routes
under a contract with that company, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement noted that in the past nine
months seven planes, including two belonging to the United Nations
and four with Russian crew on board, have been downed and
disappeared in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"In all these cases, UNITA rejected cooperation with the
international community in investigating these incidents," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian Foreign Ministry urges to immediately and
unconditionally release all Russian citizens seized and illegally
kept by UNITA," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Full responsibility for possible consequences of these
barbarous act, for security and health of Russian citizens rests
with the UNITA leaders," it added.

<HEADLINE> Tourists from Britain to Cyprus Expected to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists from the
Britain is expected to rise by 7 to 10 percent, Cyprus' Commerce,
Industry and Tourism Minister Nicos Rolandsi said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the new British High Commissioner to Cyprus
Edward Clay, Rolandis said that Cyprus boasts more than 1 million
visitors from Britain which constitutes around 44 percent of the
island's tourism.
</P>
<P>
He also said that 45 percent of the total income from
tourism, which is expected to exceed 900 million Cyprus pounds
(1,800 million U.S. dollars) this year, will derive from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis said, however, that there is a generally slow trend in
European tourism market because of the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
"But if the war is not prolonged, then in my opinion we will
have a normal increase of tourists from the U.K. ranging between 7
and 10 percent," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Clay expressed satisfaction over the level of relations between
Cyprus and Britain in the economic sector.

<HEADLINE> New Round of Tripartite Talks on Kosovo Starts in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Envoys of Russia, the United States
and Finland met here Thursday afternoon in a fresh round of talks
to find a solution to the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russian special envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari started their meeting at the government compound
Kuntsevskaya dacha at 20:45 local time (16:45 GMT), the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The trio had previously held a nine-hour session in Helsinki
and adopted a joint communique, but Russian official said that
sharp differences remained.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said that a draft of a U.N. Security Council resolution on
Yugoslavia "has been put on paper even though it does not cover
various controversial issues."
</P>
<P>
"Today everybody has realized the need for such a resolution,"
Ivanov told a news conference following his talks here with Eduard
Kukan, the U.N. secretary general's special envoy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that cessation of the air campaign against
Yugoslavia "would improve conditions for working on the
resolution."
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin held a telephone conversation
with Finnish President Ahtisaari earlier Friday, but the contents
of their discussion were not released.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Moscow's position on the possibility of NATO
sending ground troops into Yugoslavia, he said, "Russia strongly
opposes any action which might escalate the conflict."
</P>
<P>
Such actions "would reveal the true face of their
perpetrators," Ivanov said.

MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A janitor on Wednesday found "an
object which looks like an F-1 hand grenade without a detonator"
in a toilet at Lithuania's Ignalina nuclear power plant, the
Lithuanian Interior Ministry said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The janitor discovered the object in a toilet on the premises
of the first generating unit at 11:30 a.m., the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Baltic country's State Security Department is investigating
the incident.
</P>
<P>
Until now there have been no registered attempts to bomb the
nuclear power plant, which is guarded by security services,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The plant's first unit will be closed down Friday because of
licensing problems. This will bring the plant to a standstill
since the second unit has been undergoing routine repairs since
March, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Urges More Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin on Thursday reiterated his urge for more military
spending in the wake of NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chairing a government session for the first time since he was
confirmed as premier by the State Duma lower house of parliament
on Wednesday, Stepashin said the defense spending must be planned
at 3.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the 2000 budget
plan, up from the current 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The events in Yugoslavia show that the level of our defense is
such that no one would speak to us," Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would insist on the implementation of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's decree that increases defense spending
to 3.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin asked acting Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov "to
take into consideration this position in drafting the 2000
budget."
</P>
<P>
Zadornov, however, said Yeltsin had signed the decree "in a
somewhat different situation. It should be realized that 3.5
percent of GDP constitutes 35 percent of the budget expenditure."
</P>
<P>
He warned that rising military expenditure would mean reduction
in spending in other items, including the social sphere.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Zadornov said the Finance Ministry would consider
this request when drafting the 2000 budget and do its best to
increase defense spending.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Receives Over 95,000 Tons of Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission of Ethiopia said here Thursday that it has
so far received over 95,000 tons of food aid this year for people
threatened with food shortage.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the commission performance report to the House of
People's Representatives, Commissioner Simon Mechale said that
donors have pledged 140,000 tons of food aid for the needy in the
Horn of Africa country in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The disaster prevention commission estimates that 3.25 million
Ethiopians will need urgent food aid this year.
</P>
<P>
Simon told the parliament that his commission has distributed
72,478 tons of food grain among the needy in various states, while
non- governmental organizations also distributed 62,880 tons of
food aid to the needy.
</P>
<P>
He said that people in North and Southern Wollo and Southern
Tigray zones are exposed to food shortage because of dismal crop
caused by meager minor rains.
</P>
<P>
The minor rainy season in 1999, which usually fall in February,
were insufficient in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program said recently that a
year of war and poor rains have conspired to place hundreds of
thousands of Ethiopians in a state of "critical vulnerability"
because of food shortages.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- With blood spilled Thursday at
yet another American high school, U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged Congress to enact gun control legislation and asked all
Americans to protect the children from violence.
</P>
<P>
"The news this morning of another school shooting... in
suburban Atlanta is deeply troubling to me as it is to all
Americans," Clinton said before leaving for Littleton City of
Colorado State, where 12 students and a teacher were killed a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
"This incident again should underscore how profoundly important
it is that all Americans come together in the face of these events
to protect our children from violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the Senate debating gun control legislation 20 blocks away
from the sun-dappled Rose Garden, Clinton referred to the debate
and said American must "press ahead again with the national
campaign."
</P>
<P>
A student opened fire Thursday morning at Heritage High School
in Conyers Town of Georgia State, wounding six students. The
shooter was taken into custody and the victims were reported in
stable condition.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's shooting was exactly a month after the April 20
slaughter at Columbine High School in Colorado State, where two
students killed 13 people before taking their own lives.

TIRANA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian ecologists strongly
condemned the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia's chemical factories and
use of depleted uranium in the air raids, the Macedonian news
agency MIA reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These barbaric acts by NATO created pollution and ecology
catastrophe not only in Yugoslavia but also in the entire Balkan

threatening the world and the effect will be felt soon in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
It called on the Macedonian government to equip laboratories to
monitor the radiological and chemical pollution in the former
republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It will also be necessary to have cooperation with other
countries which are advanced in detecting and coping with
radiation and chemical pollution, the MEM said.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Top Leader Sentenced to Death in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Diyarbakir State Security
Court Thursday sentenced Semdin Sakik, second-in-command of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), to capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
The court gave Semdin Sakik the death penalty as he was
held responsible for the killing of 283 people in 191 acts
of violence carried out by the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The court also sentenced his brother Arif Sakik to capital
punishment for treason in the trial in Diyarbakir.
</P>
<P>
The court said that they will disclose the decision related
with the Sakik brothers and asked them if they have anything
to say in Thursday's hearing in Diyarbakir, center of the
southeast, where the PKK war has been fought for an
independent Kurdish state since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Semdin Sakik said that "I request the court delegation to
be both the judge and the lawyer for me. I was the one
who held the most radical struggle against the armed clashes,
because I saw that it was a terrorist incident. The people I
opposed to have weapons are now in Amonos mountains and in
the Black Sea. I request the court delegation to take these
into consideration. I always struggled against chief of the
terrorist organization and I want to continue this."
</P>
<P>
The court rejected his request to be sentenced to life in
prison, because of Sakik's "position within the organization and
the seriousness of the acts."
</P>
<P>
The court said that it decided to sentence Semdin Sakik
to capital punishment under Article 125 of Turkish Penal Code
as "defendant Sakik committed the crime of holding terrorist
activities aiming to separate some parts of the territories which
are under sovereignty of Turkish Republic."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured by Turkish
special agents in Kenya in mid-February and has been detained
on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province
of Bursa for trials on charges of treason.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan is awaiting the first hearing scheduled on the
Imrali Island on May 31.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Hits Another Record in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. trade deficit jumped to
another record for the third straight month in March, the Commerce
Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The March deficit of 19.7 billion dollars was 2.9 percent
higher than the previous record of 19.1 billion dollars in
February, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
To the end of March, the U.S. trade deficit is running at an
annual rate of 222.6 billion dollars, much higher than the all-
time high of 169.3 billion dollars set last year as the world
financial crisis continued to disrupt U.S. trade performance.
</P>
<P>
U.S. imports rose to a record 97.22 billion dollars in March
from 95.95 billion in February. The exports of goods and services
also increased to 77.52 billion from 76.80 billion dollars,
reflecting improving economic conditions in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the rise in March imports reflected higher
crude oil prices and an increase in the volume of steel products
as well as higher imports of autos and auto parts.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, U.S. exported more telecommunications
equipment and other industrial goods, the Department said. The
exports of civilian aircraft were up slightly in the month.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive U.S. deficit with Japan shot up to the highest
level in more than four years. The March trade gap jumped to 6.49
billion dollars from 5.27 billion dollars in February. It was the
highest monthly gap with Japan, the U.S. third largest trading
partner after Canada and Mexico. U.S. exports to Japan rose to
5.29 billion from 4.79 billion dollars while imports from Japan
jumped to 11.78 billion from 10.06 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that the trade deficit with China fell
to 4.14 billion in March from 4.62 billion dollars in February as
U.S. exports to China rose and imports fell slightly.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit with Western European rose to 3.16
billion in March from 2.25 billion dollars in February. At the
same time, the U.S. trade gap with its North American Free Trade
Agreement partners also increased.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has been arguing that the U.S. cannot
sustain such high deficits and other economic powers, especially
Japan and Europe, should do their part by serving as markets for
the countries in economic chaos.

ATHENS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Economy and Finance
Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said Thursday that an international

Greece was preparing its own national action plan, which is to
be ready by the end of June, he said, adding that the meeting
decided to create five working sub-groups with the task to collect

The five sub-groups will cover investments, infrastructure,

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Tightens Restrictions on Background Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Thursday
approved tighter restrictions on firearms transactions at gun
shows and pawn shops just several hours after another school
shooting in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Senate, by 79-29 vote, passed a Republican amendment to a
juvenile crime bill that would require background checks on all
firearms dealings at pawn shops and gun shows, reversing a
proposal it passed a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
The measure was adopted following a shooting at Heritage High
School near Conyers, a town east of Atlanta City in Georgia State,
on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
After approving the Republican proposal, the Senate turned to a
vote on a Democratic amendment that would allow three days to
complete background checks. The provision backed by the Republican
majority set a 24-hour time limit, after which the sale could go
through even if the background check were not completed.
</P>
<P>
A student opened fire Thursday morning at Heritage High School,
wounding six students. The shooter was taken into custody and the
victims were reported in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's shooting was exactly a month after the April 20
slaughter at Columbine High School in Colorado State, where two
students killed 13 people before taking their own lives.

<HEADLINE> Role of Small Business Praised In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The minister put forth the idea at an economic development
workshop attended by more than 100 women and youth in Makokoba of
west Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
She said it had been recognized all over the world that the
small business sector played an important, if not critical, role
in the socio- economic development of a country, and this applied
to Zimbabwe where the sector had been neglected for quite some
time.
</P>
<P>
"While the importance of large business for the growth of the
economy cannot be ignored, today there is ample evidence that the
labor absorption capacity of the small business sector is high,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"The average capital cost per job is usually lower than in big
business and its role in technical and other innovations is vital
for many of the challenges facing the Zimbabwean economy," Lesabe
said.
</P>
<P>
She said while there was an awareness of the dominance of big
business, constrained competition and unequal income and wealth
distribution, the government considered the small business sector
as an important force in the country's economic development
strategy and indigenization program.
</P>
<P>
The minister added, "It should be clear that the small business
sector plays a very crucial role on people's efforts to meet their
basic needs and help marginalized groups to survive during the
current phase of economic and structural changes where the formal
sector is unable to absorb the increasing labor supply and provide
adequate social support systems."
</P>
<P>
The one-day workshop was aimed at creating an awareness among
participants of the various facilities and programs available to
assist those wishing to embark on development projects.

<HEADLINE> Findings: GM Pollen Can Kill Butterfly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found that pollen of
genetically modified (GM) corn grown in the U.S. kills monarch
butterfly larvae in laboratory tests.
</P>
<P>
A team from Cornell University in New York, the United States,
has looked at Bt-corn which has been modified to incorporate a
gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).
</P>
<P>
The genetic engineering makes the plant tissue toxic to the
European corn borer, a significant pest that hides in the stalks
of the plant, making it difficult to control with chemical sprays.
</P>
<P>
The GM plant's tissue destroys the pest, but is supposed to be
harmless to helpful insects such as bees and ladybirds, and safe
for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
However, the new study by the Cornell team, published Thursday
in the science journal Nature, found that pollen from the GM crop
could have a lethal effect on the larvae of monarch butterflies if
it lands on the plant on which they feed.
</P>
<P>
The butterfly's caterpillars feed exclusively on milkweed,
which grows near the corn.
</P>
<P>
In the laboratory tests, the researchers found that Monarch
caterpillars fed on milkweed leaves dusted with Bt-corn pollen ate
less, grew more slowly and suffered a higher mortality rate than
those fed on leaves with normal pollen, or with no pollen at all.
</P>
<P>
The new findings "have potentially profound implications for
the conservation of monarch butterflies", the researchers
concluded, adding that more research on the environmental risks of
biotechnology in agriculture is essential.

<HEADLINE> Love Letters to Queen Elizabeth for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Forty-three passionate letters to
Elizabeth I from her favorite Earl of Essex Robert Devereux are
to be auctioned in London on June 11, Phillips Auctioneers said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The letters, detailing the extraordinary relationship between
the Queen and the Earl more than 400 years ago, form the most
important archive of Elizabethan documents still in private hands.
</P>
<P>
The letters belong to the Hulton family, who were originally
from Lancashire. They inherited them from William Jessop, who was
Clerk to the House of Commons at the time of Charles II's
restoration to the throne.
</P>
<P>
The sellers hope the success of the Virgin Queen on the silver
screen will spill over to the auction room and boost prices.
</P>
<P>
Clare Roberts, spokeswoman at Phillips, said buyers had already
expressed interest in the letters, which date from 1591 onwards
and are expected to fetch 200,000 pounds (over $320,000).
</P>
<P>
"(The letters) cover the span of Essex's time as the Queen's
favorite, and are remarkable for their explicit declarations of
passion," the auction house said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Devereux, the second Earl of Essex, was a young man when he
joined Elizabeth's court. He swiftly became her firm favorite
but, despite the passion revealed in the letters, doubts remain
over whether the two ever became lovers.
</P>
<P>
The earl, 30 years younger than the Queen, was accused of
plotting against his sovereign after a disastrous military
campaign and was executed for treason in 1601. The Queen returned
the letters to the earl's family after his death.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Congress Closer to Clear Majority in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Congress inched closer
Thursday to a clear majority in the 205-seat House of
Representatives as it has bagged 96 of the 173 declared seats on
the fourth day of vote counting.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist,
CPN-UML) remained the runner-up with 60 seats. The National
Democratic Party (RPP) came third with 8, the Nepal Sadbhavana
Party with 4, the National People's Front with 3, and the Nepal
Workers and Peasants Party and the United People's Front with one
each, the Nepal Television said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML) and the
RPP (Chand), which broke away from the CPN-UML and the RPP
respectively early last year, have not won a single seat yet so
far.
</P>
<P>
RPP (Chand)'s parliamentary leader and former prime minister
Lokendra Bahadur Chand was declared defeated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CPN-ML President Sahana Pradhan, General Secretary Bam Dev
Gautam and the party's two other influential leaders Chandra
Prakash Mainali and Radha Krishna Mainali and RPP (Chand)
President Rajeswor Devkota all lost.
</P>
<P>
Gautam's last chance rests in the No. 1 constituency of
Kathmandu where voting is rescheduled for June 8 following the
death of CPN-UML candidate Man Mohan Adhikari.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML and the RPP (Chand) are not recognized as national
parties yet. They have to win at least three percent of the total
votes cast for the status.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting started Monday evening after the second-phase
parliamentary elections concluded. The first-phase elections were
held on May 3.
</P>
<P>
Palten Gurung from the Nepali Congress was declared elected
unopposed on March 30 as he was the only candidate to file
nomination in Manang district, western Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Prices To Improve Next Year: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Barclays Bank predicted Thursday
that the world tobacco prices are set to improve in the next few
years as demand rises for quality tobacco from major producing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Director for agricultural services of the bank, One of
Zimbabwe's leading commercial banks, Duncan Hale said signs

low levels by next year and the following seasons.
</P>
<P>
"We remain optimistic and positive in our approach to tobacco
and we foresee tobacco coming out of the current trough of low
prices and moving into a period of better prices in U.S. dollar
terms for the next couple of years," the Zimbabwe News Agency
Ziana quoted Hale as saying.
</P>
<P>
Prices at the two tobacco auction floors, the Zimbabwe Sales
Floor and the Burley Marketing Zimbabwe, this year started
slightly higher than had been anticipated.
</P>
<P>
When floors opened on April 21, prices were around 1.23 dollars
per kilogram and had moved up to 1.45 dollars per kg by Wednesday

<HEADLINE> Barak Plans to Add Ministers to New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud
Barak said on Thursday that he wants to add ministers to the new
cabinet in a bid to form a broad-based coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remarks at a meeting in Tel Aviv, during which
he discussed with some Knesset (parliament) members about the
formation of the new government.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that he would initially appoint 18 ministers
following negotiations with other political parties.
</P>
<P>
Later, he said, he would appoint six more ministers after
amending the basic law of the government which currently limits
the number of ministers to 18.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Haaretz reported that Barak could add more
ministers by splitting existing ministries or naming new ones,
such as the portfolio often mentioned for Shimon Peres -- minister
of the peace process. Peres is viewed as the number two in the
left-wing One Israel coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak won a landslide victory over outgoing Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in May 17 elections. He would have 45 days
to form a coalition government.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Will Sign Bill Funding for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
on Thursday that he will sign 15 billion U.S. dollars emergency
funding package, including money for the air war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Our effort in Kosovo was strengthened by the vote in the House
of Representatives to approve the supplemental funding we
requested," Clinton told reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely imperative that the Senate follow suit
without delay."
</P>
<P>
"The measure will allow us to keep bringing aid to the refugees
until they go home, to help the neighboring countries feeling the
brunt of the crisis," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The House on Tuesday passed the emergency spending measure,
which includes 11.9 billion U.S. dollars to cover the cost of the
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia and address what Republicans
said were long-neglected military needs.
</P>
<P>
The total was nearly double the sum requested by Clinton and
included numerous items related to spending items sought by
individual lawmakers. Critics had urged Clinton to veto the
measure.
</P>
<P>
The emergency funding also included one billion U.S. dollars
for hurricane-battered Central America, 100 million U.S. dollars
for Middle East ally Jordan and for other programs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, facing the waning of support for the NATO bombing
against Yugoslavia, insisted that the alliance would not
compromise on its demands for any possible ceasefire with
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our military campaign until the conditions
are met," Clinton said in a brief remarks in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls here have shown Americans opposing the war were
increasing as they saw nothing reasonable to justify the military
action.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact of dwindling support, Clinton still said that
the United States "is speaking with a single voice."

WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday nominated Army General Henry Shelton to serve a second

Shelton became the 14th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

<HEADLINE> Internet Calls Boom Boosts BT Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON May 20 (Xinhua) - British Telecom (BT) has enjoyed
record profits on the back of the explosion in internet usage and
the growth of calls to mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
Profits rose 22.4 percent in the last quarter to leave 1998-99
profits up 4.5 percent at 3.3 billion pounds even before an
exceptional windfall of 1 billion pounds from the group's failed
attempt to buy US group MCI.
</P>
<P>
Much of this growth came from a 9 percent increase in domestic
call volumes and a near doubling of internet access customers
compared with the last quarter of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
An announcement by BT Wednesday showed that 18 percent of local
residential calls during March were surfing on the internet, up
from 15 percent in December and 8 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Iain Vallance, the BT chairman, said the company was
traditionally a bellwether for the UK economy and the strong
growth in turnover "reinforces the view that things are getting
rather better than they were before".
</P>
<P>
However, BT's robust performance also re-ignited speculation
that it might be tempted to join the merger mania that is sweeping
the telecoms sector.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a cross border merger, Peter Bonfield, BT chief
executive, said: "If we can get good value and good growth, we are
open minded about these things. We want to be a major global
player."

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has granted license
to Yaronafm, an independent radio station, which will broadcast
within a 40-km radius of the capital Gaborone, South African Press
Association reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the independent radio has broken a 33-year
government monopoly on broadcasting in Botswana, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Moraki Mokgosana, general manager of the radio, was quoted as
saying that the station would be on the air within four months and
was expected to attract 50,000 listeners.
</P>
<P>
Yaronafm has links to South Africa's Union Alliance Media which
has a 25 percent stake in South Africa's YFM.
</P>
<P>
A second license application is pending for a station under the
umbrella of Thari Investments, a group comprising investors from
South Africa and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Since independence in 1966, radio broadcasting in Botswana has
been the monopoly of the government with Radio Botswana
broadcasting news, information and entertainment, and Radio
Botswana 2 broadcasting mostly music.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Back Home from Arab Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
returned home Thursday afternoon from an eight-day trip to three
Arab states, the first one by an Iranian head of state since the
Iranian Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The visits to Syria, Saudi Arabia and Qatar were seen by world
opinion as a turning point for the relations between Iran and the
Arab world, the Gulf states in particular.
</P>
<P>
During the visits, President Khatami exchanged views with
leaders of the three Arab states on various regional and
international issues and focused the talks on regional cooperation
to maintain security and to stabilize the oil market.
</P>
<P>
Khatami reiterated his foreign policy of easing tension and
establishing relations with other countries, particularly Iran's
Gulf neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the Gulf Arab states have been in mistrust for two
decades since the stormy Islamic revolution, which toppled the
former Iranian shah regime and posed threat to the Gulf
states. The strained relations were also due to the Iran-Iraq war
in 1980-88 during which the Gulf Arabs supported Iraq. But
relations between the two sides have been improved after President
Khatami came to power in 1997 with a detente policy.
</P>
<P>
Observers and diplomats here believed that Khatami's
ground-breaking Arab trip indicated the normalization of the ties
between Iran and the Gulf states, although the two sides still
need to remove some obstacles for future cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Calls on Zambians to Depend on Themselves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
Thursday called on his countrymen to work hard and develop their
country by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of people in Mpika, northern Zambia, he
said the responsibility of developing the country lies squarely on
Zambians and that the international community can only help up to
certain extent.
</P>
<P>
It is only by working hard that they can be respected as truly
independent people, he said, noting there is no dignity in begging
hence the need for a very Zambian at any level to do something.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said his government will not appease people by giving
them free food but will continue to provide an environment
conducive to doing business and other income generating
activities.
</P>
<P>
On economy, he said "we have so far privatized almost 80
percent of the economy and that before the end of this year the
whole of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) will be
privatized."
</P>
<P>
Privatization does not mean that the government should wash its
hands completely off whatever is happening in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to have a say in certain strategic
 activities for the good of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
On agriculture, Chiluba said the government is fully committed
to ensuring that agriculture is given all the necessary support
and attention because it is through it that the dignity and
respect of the nation are built around.

JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African government

Revolutionary United Front (RUF) .
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire is set to take effect Monday with peace talks due

PARIS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- France extradited Hans-Joachim Klein,
suspected accomplice of international terrorist Carlos in the
hostage-taking of OPEC ministers in 1975 in Vienna, to Germany
Thursday evening, Agence France-Presse quoted French and German
authorities as saying.
</P>
<P>
Klein was taken away from a prison in Caen, northern France, on

Germany, after he was handed over to German police.
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old German, arrested on September 8, 1998, in
France after 12 years on the run, was under an international
arrest warrant for voluntary manslaughter and hostage-taking.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of taking part of the hostage taking operation
in December 1975 against OPEC oil producing countries' oil
ministers, which was organized by international terrorist Ilych
Ramirez Sanchez who was also known as Carlos and is serving a life
sentence in France.
</P>

</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 20, (Xinhua) - American Republican Senator, Jack
Kemp, on Thursday called on American businessmen to turn their
attention to Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon at the Fifth African American Summit in
Accra, Kemp said Africa was marginalized in global economic and
political affairs as against its abundant socio-economic
potential, he added it is time for white American businessmen to
turn their attention to Africa.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 African and African-American politicians and
businessmen are attending the five-day summit.
</P>
<P>
Kemp said Africa is not home only to blacks, but to all
humanity and, therefore, the continent's welfare should be the
concern of all.
</P>
<P>
He said he would work to get Republicans in the US senate to
support the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act and press the
American government to relieve Africa's debt burden.
</P>
<P>
The US senator also promised to be a "voice among white
Americans for the institution of a Marshal Plan to fight AIDS
and other diseases affecting Africa".

<HEADLINE> Welfare Reform Bill Narrowly Passed in UK Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The controversial proposals on
welfare reform were passed through the Commons on Thursday with a
majority of 40 votes.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition of 65 Labor MPs, the government managed
to have 310 votes for the welfare changes while 270 MPs voted
against the reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill now face a rough ride in
the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measures fear that as many as 170,000 people
could be made worse of by the bill.
</P>
<P>
Defending the reforms in the Commons debate, Social Security
Secretary Alistair Darling said: "The idea that our reforms are
designed to save money is not true."
</P>
<P>
Introducing the rebel amendment, Roger Berry MP, the secretary
of the parliamentary disablement group, said the effect of the
bill would be "to reduce benefits for disabled people who are

As a result, Haiti has an illiterate rate of more than 55

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Assures Peace in His Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Lt-General Omar
Hasan Ahmed Al Basher Thursday said that his country will soon
hold elections on the thorny issues bordering its federation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Presidential Plenary Session of the Fifth
African- African American Summit underway in Accra, Ghana, Basher
said,"I can assure you today that there is peace in Sudan. At
least we have been able to resolve the thorny issues bordering on
our federation and very soon an election will be held to finally
decide on the issue,"
</P>
<P>
The president said six out of the seven groups involved in the
Sudanese "crisis" have signed an agreement to take part in the
election.
</P>
<P>
"Conditions are now favorable for our liberalization policy and
 democratization process," he reassured.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese president appealed to the over 4,000 African
Americans attending the summit to chart a new course for Africa.
</P>
<P>
The week-long summit, which is under the theme "Business,Trade
and Investment: `Africa Can Compete'", is a platform to launch
Africa into the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
At least the last decade of the African history has been
characterized by strong political and economic reforms, which have
propelled the continent to about four percent growth annually.
</P>
<P>
Basher said Sudan has also gone through the reform process,
especially in the area of education, health and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The new vision for Sudan demands greater attention of the
global investment community to take advantage of the reforms and
take part in our privatization process," he said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, Sudan has established 25 universities in
the last three years and privatized a number of state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
But little of these achievements is known to the West.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these powerful nations are rather waging a propaganda
war against us, creating the impression that there is instability
in Sudan..."
</P>
<P>
" As we open our economy we invite you all to feel free and
take advantage of the numerous opportunities in Sudan and share
the profits with us," he said.

<HEADLINE> Seminar to Discuss Non-Self-Governing Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. special committee
will hold a seminar next week to discuss political advancement and
social and economic development in the remaining 17
Non-Self-Governing Territories, U.N. sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The seminar scheduled for St Lucia, a Caribbean country from
May 25-27, will make proposals for measures that the United
Nations and the administering powers can take to enable the
the territories to choose their political future, the General
Assembly said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. information, the territories have a combined
population of nearly 2 million.
</P>
<P>
They include Western Sahara in Africa, and American Samoa
(U.S.), East Timor (Portugal), Guam (U.S.), New Caledonia
(France), Pitcairn (Britain) and Tokelau (New Zealand) in Asia and
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Others are Anguilla (Britain), Bermuda (Britain), British
Virgin Islands (Britain), Cayman Islands (Britain), Falkland
Islands/Malvinas (Britain), Gibraltar (Britain), Montserrat
(Britain), St. Helena (Britain), Turks and Caicos Islands
(Britain), and U.S. Virgin Islands (U.S.) in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in
1976, is to hold a public ballot by those aged above 17 among the
800,000 inhabitants on the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
They will choose between autonomy and independence on August 8,
based on agreements between Indonesia and Portugal after long
negotiations mediated by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly declared 1990-2000 as the
International Decade for Eradication of Colonialism. In its
session last year, it called on the administering powers to take
steps to enable the peoples to exercise fully their right to self
determination.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mortgage Rates Jump to Highest Level in 18 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The average interest rate on
30-year fixed-rate mortgages jumped this week to 7.23 percent, its
highest level since November 1997, the mortgage company Freddie
Mac reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge of the 30-year mortgage rate, which was up from 7.10
percent the previous week, was an expected reaction to a Federal
Reserve warning it might raise a key interest rate, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve officials said Tuesday if signs of inflation
continue to show up in the U.S. economy, they were leaning toward
raising, later this year, the interest rate banks charge each
other.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government reported consumer prices rose by 0.7
percent in April, the biggest monthly jump in nine years.
</P>
<P>
"With... the Fed's announcement of its bias toward higher
interest rates, mortgage rates began to climb," said Frank
Nothaft, deputy chief economist for Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, mortgage rates, along with other interest
rates set by financial markets, are extremely sensitive to the
disposition of Fed policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
Low mortgage rates have helped bring about a record home-buying
boom, accompanied by spending on new furniture, appliances and
other household items. That activity has kept the U.S. economy
strong amid widespread financial troubles abroad during the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
But now that some demand for American products overseas is
recovering, continued low unemployment in the United States and
robust consumer spending make inflation a bigger worry.
</P>
<P>
Before March, mortgage rates had held below 7.0 percent since
last summer. This week's rise -- the sharpest of five straight --
brought the 30-year mortgage rate to its highest level since the
first week in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,
averaged 6.83 percent this week, up from 6.71 percent. That is the
highest since 15-year rates were at 6.85 percent during the last
week of April 1998.
</P>
<P>
On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 5.76 percent this week, up from 5.71 the
week before.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Supports Efforts to Global Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said Thursday that Fed supports Clinton
administration efforts to make the global financial system less
susceptible to future Asian-style currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan and outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin voice
the same reform themes in a joint appearance before the House
Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told the committee that a number of steps have already
been taken to strengthen rules to encourage greater financial
disclosure by developing countries and to put into place
guidelines that will discourage these countries from taking too
many risks when they borrow money.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan continued to signal to financial markets that he and
other Fed policy-makers are working closely with the
administration to deal with the global crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We at the Federal Reserve are in broad agreement with the
approach outlined by Secretary Rubin and expect to continue to
work closely with the Treasury in this area," Greenspan said in
his committee testimony.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the ill-advised investing of recent years can
be avoided in the future if investors are more appropriately
forewarned that they will suffer losses.
</P>
<P>
Rubin in his testimony repeated a package of proposals the U.S.
administration first unveiled last month before the spring
meetings of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said countries need to put in place improved
financial reporting standards,citing in particular the need for
foreign central banks to publish accurate statistics on the amount
of foreign currency reserves they are holding.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I find it difficult to believe, for example, that the
crises that arose in Thailand and Korea would have been nearly so
virulent had their central banks published data prior to the
crisis on net reserves instead of the not very informative gross
reserve positions only."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan repeated that countries should manage their external
debt holdings so their reserves could carry them a full year
without any new foreign borrowing.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, signaling new flexibility, on Thursday
suggested limited Serb forces could remain in the province after
airstrikes end.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that a pull-out of all Serb forces from Kosovo
remains a key NATO goal, Albright told a Senate hearing that
"there is discussion" over whether, at some point, a Serb presence
might be permitted at certain holy sites.
</P>
<P>
"We have to see a movement of their forces coming out before we
would stop," she told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
foreign operations.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright added:"There is discussion about whether at
some phase, some Serbs would be allowed to be somewhere around
some of their holy sites."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright also hinted that American troops might
not necessarily have to join the security force that is going to
be deployed in Kosovo with NATO at its core after the current
air campaign ends.
</P>
<P>
"If there are not Americans in an international force, then the
Americans have to be part of a NATO command structure," Albright
told the senators.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who was meeting with
Albright and congressional leaders later Thursday, said all the
NATO allies had agreed not to send ground troops into Kosovo until
a cease-fire is secured in the region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes Democratic Gun Control Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate approved
Thursday a Democratic proposal to impose fresh restrictions on gun
transactions at gun shows and pawn shops as the debate on gun
control entered the 9th day at the congress.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which would require mandatory background checks
for all transactions at gun shows, was tied, 50-50. Vice President
Al Gore then cast his vote and broke the tie.
</P>
<P>
The provision, sponsored by Democratic Senator Frank
Lautenberg, also would require a mandatory background check for
anyone seeking to claim his or her own weapon at a pawn shop.
</P>
<P>
The vote wiped out a Republican proposal on gun control that
has passed moments earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Republican provision, passed by 79-29, would have limited
instant background checks to 24 hours, instead of the current
three days as proposed by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Republican Party wants immediate destruction
of background check records in cases where the purchases are
approved while the Democrats want to wait 90 days before expunging
the records.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's vote came one month after 15 people were killed in
gun shootings at a Colorado high school and only hours after a
second shooting at a high school in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The Colorado high school shooting has generated pressure on
the Senate to tighten laws governing gun sales, particularly at
gun shows.
</P>
<P>
The gun amendments were intended to toughen a sweeping, 5
billion dollar juvenile crime bill by Republican Senator Orrin
Hatch that would make it harder for kids to get guns and give
more serious punishments to those who use guns.

WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Thursday
approved a 15 billion U.S. dollars package financing the fighting
in the Balkans, aid to Central America and other programs and the
measure will be sent to President Bill Clinton for signature.
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the measure on a vote of 64-36. The House

<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Clinton said that he will sign the
emergency funding package although he did not support some
provisions of the package.
</P>
<P>
Until last week, administration officials had threatened a veto
because Congress doubled the defense spending Clinton sought and
included provisions on mining, fishing and tobacco that he
opposed.
</P>
<P>
"There are some things in the bill that I did not support,"
Clinton said. "But it is terribly important that this aid be
released as soon as possible."

<HEADLINE> Most Americans Support Tougher Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Two-thirds of Americans
support tougher restrictions on guns, according to a poll
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People
and the Press, also showed that three out of four women say
increasing restrictions on guns is more important than protecting
the rights of Americans to own them.
</P>
<P>
Support for gun control was slightly higher than in a Pew poll
in December 1993. The percentage of people who feel television
news contains too much violence also grew.
</P>
<P>
The poll indicated that almost two-thirds think television news
contains too much violence, compared with half who felt that way in
1993.
</P>
<P>
The latest Pew poll was taken prior to Thursday's school
shootings in Georgia and one month after the nation's worst

<HEADLINE> G-8 Diplomats on Kosovo Peaceful Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior diplomats from the Group of
Eight (G-8) said Thursday they had achieved "essential progress"
in hammering out a draft resolution for U.N. Security Council on
Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
But a final breakthrough will not appear until after their
discussion on Friday, said the diplomats who are attending a G-8
political director meeting in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
G-8 includes Russia and seven leading western industrial
countries: U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said they expected on Friday to work out a clear
timetable to end the Kosovo war under the G-8 foreign ministers'
statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, foreign ministers from G-8 passed a
statement of "general principles" on a peaceful solution to Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The director level meeting, which began on Wednesday, was held
as a further step under the statement. Diplomats are expected to
translate those "general principles" into a more detailed U.N.
resolution draft at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Romania Worried About Yugoslav War's Impact on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Ministry of Water,
Forestry and Environmental Protection keeps monitoring the area
likely to be affected by the Yugoslav war, in order to identify
possible pollution.
</P>
<P>
Even if no major impact has been noticed so far on Romania's
territory, ecological consequences may still come out in the
future, to damage both the Danube River's and the Black Sea's
water life, as well as the land wildlife in neighboring areas,
sources at the Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry worked out a complex monitoring program of the
environment's condition on Romania's territory for at least one
year. An investigation is to be carried out to detect toxic heavy
metals and other wastes in Danube's waters and sediment, Danube's
Delta included.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports of the official Rompres news
agency, several acid rains fell recently in Romanian border area
near Yugoslavia, and plants growing in the area displayed
physiological alterations consisting in necrosed adult leaves, and
the partial or total destruction of the undergrown leaves. The
forest vegetation was also afflicted in the area of the Danube's
banks.
</P>
<P>
Cross border pollution could be the cause of the phenomena, as
there are no other main industrial pollutants on the Romanian
side, specialists noted.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, dust, smoke and powder clouds were hanging
over Romanian territory as a byproduct of the NATO's bombing
against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes Juvenile Crime Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A month after the school
massacre in Colorado, the U.S. Senate broadly approved a juvenile
crime bill thursday night that contains the nation's most sweeping
restrictions on gun possession in five years.
</P>
<P>
The 73-25 Senate vote for the overall bill represented a
coalition of Democrats who favored the gun control provisions and
Republicans who supported measures to crack down on juvenile
crime.
</P>
<P>
The Senate's legislation requires the sale of safety devices
with handguns and expand a system of background checks for
firearms purchasers.
</P>
<P>
The bill would spend one billion dollar in each of the next
five years to prevent, prosecute and punish violent juvenile
crime. Some offenders as young as 14 could be tried as adults.
</P>
<P>
The gun control provisions include a ban on possession of
semiautomatic assault weapons and their high-capacity ammunition
clips by young people. The bill will also ban imports of such
clips and require child-safety locks on handguns.
</P>
<P>
The last major gun control measure to pass Congress was a ban
in August 1994 on 19 types of assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday, no gun control legislation had passed Congress
since Republicans won control of the House and Senate in November
1994.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Vice President AL Gore cast a dramatic
tie-breaking vote on a Democratic amendment that would require
background checks on all buyers at gun shows and pawn shops. The
51-50 victory reversed last week's 51-47 rejection of a similar
proposal.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the Senate bill sent the measure to the House,
where Speaker Dennis Hastert, a Republican, has signalled support
for fresh restrictions on guns. Republican and Democratic leaders
were discussing plans to bring the issue to the House floor as
soon as mid-June.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Senate action came as President Bill Clinton met in
Colorado with families of the victims of the school shooting
tragedy in which 15 people were killed and 12 hours after another
school shooting in Georgia, that left six students injured.
</P>
<P>
The shocking school violence has generated pressure on the
Senate to tighten the gun-control legislation to protect children
from violence.

WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Isaiah Rider scored a playoff
career-high 27 points as the Trail Blazers escaped with an 84-81
victory over the Utah Jazz, earning a split of the first two games
of the best-of-seven series in Salt Laker City last night.
</P>
<P>
Portland survived when John Stockton's potential tying layup
rolled around the rim before falling out with two seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
"I should have made it," Stockton said. "I had an opportunity
to make it and I didn't. I probably got fouled but it doesn't
matter. "
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone led Utah with 23 points and 17 rebounds. Rasheed
Wallace scored 11 points and Arvydas Sabonis added 10 for the
Blazers, who shot a respectable 41 percent (30-of-74) from the
field. Portland scored 23 points off 18 turnovers while giving the
ball away only eight times.
</P>
<P>
"We just tried to play some really tight defense on them, "
Wallace said. "We were more close-kit tonight."
</P>
<P>
Stockton, who hit the winning shot in Game Four against the
Kings, was limited to eight points on 3-of-9 shooting and nine
assists in 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Greg Ostertag grabbed 14 rebounds for the Jazz, who shot 39
percent (29-of-75) but held a 52-41 advantage on the boards.

UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council held a meeting Friday morning to consider the U.N.
oil-for-food program for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats, the Security Council is expected
to vote next Monday on extending the program for another six
months under which Iraq is allowed to sell 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil to by necessities for its people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq complained to the United Nations early this week that the
oil-for-food program was useless and the only way to alleviate the
suffering of the Iraqi people was lifting the sanctions
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. The oil-for-food program, which began in
December 1996, is designed to offset the impact of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The current phase of oil-for-food program will expire next
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Enjoy U.S. Trade Privileges for Another Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai exporters will enjoy trade
privileges given under the U.S. Generalized System of Preference
(GSP) for at least one more year, a Commerce Ministry report
available Friday said.
</P>
<P>
Pracha Charutrakulchai, director-general of the Department of
Foreign Trade, said in the report that no Thai products were
mentioned in the latest U.S. government's review of imports
although several Thai goods risked losing the trade privileges
last year due to their increasing market shares in the U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
Washington may remove foreign goods from its GSP program if
their market shares exceed a certain percentage of its total
imports, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. GSP program, launched in 1967 to help developing
countries export more goods to the U.S. market, is based on three
criteria.
</P>
<P>
Under the criteria, a country's maximum per capita income must
not exceed 8,600 U.S. dollars, market share of any specific
product from one country must not exceed 50 percent of total
imports of that product, and imports of a specific product from a
particular country must not be higher than 85 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government was negotiating with the U.S. government to
extend its GSP for certain Thai goods that have more than 50
percent of market share, including dried papaya, rice flour, baby
calms, processed longan and lychee.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has reportedly benefited most from the GSP given by
Washington to the third world, with tariff reductions totaling
2.69 million dollars or 16.5 percent of all preferential tariffs
given to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Products benefited most from the GSP program are color computer
monitors and televisions, video players, ornaments, photograph
frames and fans.

<HEADLINE> China, Malaysia to Sign Pact for Wider Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and China,
celebrating the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations Friday,
will sign an agreement on widening the scope of bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar is scheduled to go on a
five-day visit to China from May 30 and to sign the cooperation
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement's scope on bilateral cooperation is very wide
and comprehensive covering trade and politics as well," Syed Hamid
said after a function to commemorate the 25th anniversary of
Malaysia-China diplomatic relations here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between Malaysia and China were pioneered
by Malaysia's second prime minister, the late Tun Abdul Razak
Hussein, who visited China in May 1974.
</P>
<P>
A special award by Malaysia and China to commemorate the
services of the late Tun Abdul Razak was received by his wife, Tun
Hajah Rahah Tan Sri Mohd Noah, at the function.
</P>
<P>
He said China is also Malaysia's important trading partner
where bilateral trade has reached nearly 4 billion U.S. dollars a
year and in Malaysia's favor.
</P>
<P>
In his speech earlier, Syed Hamid said Malaysia looked forward
to further enhanced bilateral relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia views China as an emerging economic player and
as a potential lucrative market for its products.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize the pivotal role that China, as a permanent
member of the United Nations Security Council, is playing in
promoting peace and stability in the region and the world at
large," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia Guan Dengming said that during
the 25 years, China-Malaysia relationship of good-neighborliness
and friendship had been strengthened and great developments
achieved in various fields.
</P>
<P>
"In international and regional affairs, both countries share
wide common interests and have always maintained good coordination
and cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government too appreciated important
contributions made by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and other
Malaysian leaders.

LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Three university students, accused
of taking part in an Irish republican terrorism plot to bomb
targets in Britain, were sentenced to jail between 22 and 25 years

The three were sentenced by an Old Baily court jury which found
them guilty of conspiring to cause explosions in mainland Britain,

Anthony Hyland, 26, was jailed for 25 years, Darren Mulholland,
20, and Liam Grogan, 22, were both jailed for 22 years.

<HEADLINE> Thai Commercial Banks Agree to Keep Deposit Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Four major commercial banks in
Thailand have agreed to maintain their deposit rates unchanged
since they have been under fire over the wide interest margins,
Chairman of Thai Bankers' Association Bantoon Lamsam said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Bantoon announced the interest
rates direction for the association, saying the country's four
largest banks, namely, the Bangkok Bank, Krung Thai Bank, Siam
Commercial Bank and Thai Farmers Bank, agreed to freeze deposit
rates at the current level of around 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Bantoon, who is also president of Thai Farmers Bank,
said he was not sure how long the freeze would last.
</P>
<P>
The commercial banks are recently criticized for exploiting the
public by cutting deposit rates while keeping lending rates at
"high" levels.
</P>
<P>
While the deposit rates have been cut to 4.5 percent, the prime
lending rate is still kept high, ranging from nine percent for
some big banks to 11.25 percent for others.
</P>
<P>
Experts here criticized the banks for punishing their good
customers by charging them higher rates as a means of subsidizing
non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
They urged the banking authorities to force banks to raise
sufficient equity capital from the market to meet loan-loss
provision requirements and to cease passing the burden on to their
good customers.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans have become the major burden of commercial
banks in Thailand, which accounted for almost half of the total
outstanding loans.
</P>
<P>
Bantoon said the non-performing loans are still expanding
although at a slow pace.

<HEADLINE> 3-Year Economic Target Unlikely to Be Achieved in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's 1999-2001 economic target
is unlikely to be achieved due to poor performance in such fields
as manufacturing and mining industries, according to a Standard
Chartered Bank publication available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its 1999 budget, the Zambian government projected 4.5
percent annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth over the three
years, driven by annual expansion of five percent to six percent
in agriculture, manufacturing and mining and an increase of 15
percent annually in non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
Since few of these targets are likely to be achieved this year,
growth in the two subsequent years will have to accelerate to
average 5.75 percent a year to reach the targeted 14 percent
increase in real GDP over the three years.
</P>
<P>
The six percent annual growth target for mining certainly won't
be achieved in 1999 when output is projected to decline further,
said the publication titled Business Trends Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, the pace of recovery will depend primarily on
global market conditions which, on current forecasts, are unlikely
to facilitate such expansion, it added.
</P>
<P>
The growth projections also assume a quantum leap in the level
of investment from last year's 16 percent of GDP to 20 percent by
2001.
</P>
<P>
For this target to be attained, three prerequisites will have
to be satisfied: the long-run decline in public sector investment
spending will have to be reversed, which in turn will depend in
part on increased post-privatization investment in the copper
sector; increased donor disbursements to help fund a higher level
of public investment and a marked improvement in the global
outlook for copper, without which mining sector investment is
likely to remain weak, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
Monetary aggregates, anecdotal evidence and official employment
figures all suggest that GDP fell a good deal more than two
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Formal sector employment figures show a loss of 20,000 jobs,
four percent less since 1995, over which period GDP is estimated
to grow a total of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Good rains will mean increased agricultural production this
year, though sources concerned question whether the entire six
percent loss experienced last year will be recouped.
</P>
<P>
Crop forecasts have yet to be finalized, but in the meantime a
maize crop of over 1.08 million tons is expected - the largest
harvest since 1996 and an increase of 65 percent over 1998,
according to the commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, Zambia will still need to import between 150,000
and 250, 000 tons of maize, staple food of the country.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural growth of at least five percent will add one
percent increase to GDP and is likely to be the main single
influence contributing to a return to positive economic growth
this year, said the bank.

program to enhance the competitiveness of domestic industries will
never sacrifice the rights of workers.
</P>
<P>
"We need to fast-track recovery and enhance competitiveness,"
he said at the 20th national conference of the Employers
Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP). "The Filipino masses
cannot wait any longer for jobs to multiply and incomes to rise."
</P>
<P>
Estrada urged business leaders to inform his administration how
the government can help them adjust to the challenges of the new
global order, especially in the areas of export development,
technical upgrading and skills training.
</P>
<P>
In acknowledging the role of employers as his administration's
partner in the campaign against poverty, Estrada thanked the ECOP
and its sister organizations for helping the government formulate
economic and social reform measures.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Estrada also thanked the labor sector for acting
responsibly and helping his administration contain a wage and
price spiral which could have threatened the country's economic
recovery program.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Remain Apart on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Disagreements persist between Russia
and the United States on a Balkan settlement, Russia's acting
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The biggest disagreements are over the presence of an
international security force and the withdrawal of Serbian troops
and police from Kosovo, the Interfax news agency quoted Ivanov as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He urged a "complete halt" in NATO's air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"As for announcing a pause in the bombing, all the conditions
and possibilities exist," Ivanov said. "The main thing is
political will."
</P>
<P>
A draft U.N. Security Council resolution on Kosovo is being
prepared within the G8 framework, he said, referring to the seven
major industrialized countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"This work could proceed faster and more efficiently if the
air strikes in Yugoslavia are stopped," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely clear that the NATO military operation
against Yugoslavia will end. Therefore, the international
community must be prepared to start an operation for resolving the
urgent problems of a post-conflict settlement," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the death of a Russian citizen who had allegedly
fought for the Yugoslav army against the Kosovo Liberation Army,
Ivanov answered: "This information is being thoroughly verified.
We will release a special statement upon analyzing all the
information."
</P>
<P>
He said the entire range of issues pertaining to a Kosovo
settlement was addressed at Friday's consultations with U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan's special envoy Karl Bildt and Greek
Foreign Minister George Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
"Both priority tasks and a post-conflict settlement were
discussed," Ivanov said without further elaboration.
</P>
<P>
"The current objective is to work toward halting the military
operation against Yugoslavia," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Scolds NATO For Blunders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada has firmly warned NATO
commanders that their most recent bombing blunders could derail
delicate negotiations to find a diplomatic settlement of the
Kosovo crisis, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Errant bombs like the one that hit a Belgrade hospital "are a
serious mistake, and they come at a time when it is very important
that we accelerate and underline the important search for a
resolution of the conflict," Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
At Canada's insistence, NATO ambassadors met in Brussels with
NATO commanders "to determine the cause of these mistakes, these
errors," Axworthy said during a conference in Norway.
</P>
<P>
The alliance is in a delicate stage of diplomacy, and the
bombing can't run counter to or out of sync with what we are
attempting to achieve," Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, NATO's missiles attacked the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, killing three journalists and injuring more
than 20 other people.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Russia, which is playing an important role as
intermediary with the Belgrade government, want NATO to halt its
bombing campaign, said the Canadian leading newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Canada still supports the air campaign, but Ottawa wants NATO
commanders to think carefully about the targets they are choosing,
said James Wright, a senior official in the Foreign Affairs
Department in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
Canadian warplanes have flown about 470 sorties over Yugoslavia
since the start of the air campaign. CF-18 fighters hit an
explosives factory and a petroleum plant early Thursday morning,
the newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: COMESA on Way toward Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Summit of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) is scheduled to
open in Kenyan capital Nairobi on Monday and Tuesday
</P>
<P>
Following are some of the major progresses the African
sub-regional economic organization has made toward its goal of
establishing a free trade area by October 31, 2000. Since its
establishment in 1994, COMESA has made remarkable progress in
trade liberalization, transport facilitation, tariff barriers
removal, and financial and monetary systems.
</P>
<P>
For the final removal of all tariffs on goods and service
originating from within the COMESA countries, 14 of the 21 member
states had already reduced their tariffs by 60 percent to 90
percent by February 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Most member states have removed their non-tariff barriers such
as foreign exchange restrictions and import quotas in support to
the establishment of a COMESA free trade area.
</P>
<P>
Member states of the regional group have agreed on the
introduction of a Common External Tariff of zero, five percent,
15 percent and 30 percent on capital goods, raw materials,
intermediate and finished goods respectively.
</P>
<P>
COMESA member states have also adopted a single COMESA Customs
Document to replace the previous multiplicity of documents,
installed customs management systems to facilitate data and
revenue collection and introduced a Customs Bond Guarantee Scheme
to reduce the cost of financing transit goods.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the above measures, the intra-COMESA trade had
increased from 734 million U.S. dollars in 1985 to 4.2 billion
dollars in 1998, with an annual growth rate of 20 percent, and
trade with third countries is also growing at about seven percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in order to facilitate the movement of goods and
services, COMESA had introduced the Harmonized Road Transit
Charges, Carrier License and Maximum Vehicle Dimensions, and
adopted the common regulations for axle load and motor vehicle
insurance scheme.
</P>
<P>
Other measures for better transportation among COMESA member
states, include the liberalization of air traffic rights for
cargoes and harmonization of maritime transport policies as well
as the promotion of inter-state telecommunications
inter-connectivity.
</P>
<P>
Transport facilitation measures have resulted in a reduction of
 transport cost by 25 percent in the member states, according to
Erastus Mwencha, Secretary-General of the COMESA secretariat.
</P>
<P>
A COMESA court, temporarily based at its Lusaka secretariat in
Zambia, has been in place for trade disputes between the members
states.
</P>
<P>
COMESA has completed its Trade Information Network and set up
its own Web site to provide information to business interests and
opportunities from within and outside COMESA.
</P>
<P>
At the coming COMESA summit meeting in Nairobi, the Heads of
state and government of the member states will review the
progress COMESA has made since its establishment in 1994 and
discuss further preparations and removal of remaining barriers
for realizing a free trade area by October 2000.

NEW DELHI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A powerful bomb exploded and
another one was detected Friday at two places on the road leading
to Imphal airport of the northeastern Manipur state just minutes
before Indian caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
arrived for a visit.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that no damage was
caused in the bomb explosion triggered by underground militants in
the area at 10:30 Friday.
</P>

Earlier this morning, a powerful bomb was recovered from the
side of the airport road in Imphal, 2,440 km east of here by road,
barely two hours before Vajpayee's scheduled landing at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
PTI said that the state capital wore a deserted look as all
shops, markets, oil pumps and entertainment houses remained closed
following a boycott call by Manipur People's Liberation Front
comprising three banned separatist organizations.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, accompanied by several high-ranking officials of his
caretaker government, went to the state for a two-day visit,
during which he will kick off his election campaign in the area.

<HEADLINE> Direct Balloting in East Timor Set One Day Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to move the date of the direct balloting on a wide-ranging
autonomy for East Timor a day earlier from August 8 to August 7.
</P>
<P>
"August 8 is a Sunday and the East Timorese go to church. We
have to respect that," Justice Minister Muladi said before joining
the Economic and Financial Resilience Council's meeting chaired by
President B.J. Habibie here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations have agreed to hold
on August 8 a direct balloting in East Timor to determine if its
people would accept or reject a special autonomous status under
the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognizes the move.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, the Indonesian government announced that it is
ready to release East Timor if the alternative to provide wider
autonomy is refused by the people in the region and the
international community.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: COMESA Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following are some of the major figures about this African
sub-regional economic organization:
</P>
<P>
The COMESA Covers an area of 12.88 million square kilometers
with a population of 380 million.
</P>
<P>
The regional body had a total of gross domestic product (GDP)
of 155 billion dollars in 1997 and the 1998 GDP was estimated at
165 billion dollars, representing the nominal growth of 4.5
percent in 1997 and 3.14 percent in 1998 respectively.
</P>
<P>
COMESA's total exports in 1998 was estimated at 23.97 billion
dollars, while imports 38.83 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Intra-COMESA trade in 1998 is estimated about 4.2 billion U.S.
dollars representing a growth rate of 20 percent every year since
the founding of the regional body. Trade with third countries is
growing at about 7 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, total external debt of COMESA was estimated at 130
billion dollars, which constitutes a heavy burden hindering the
development of its member countries.
</P>
<P>
With 90 percent arable land, 95 percent of water resources
unexploited and together with its rich cultural heritage, minerals
deposits, oil and gas reserves and other resources remain almost
untapped, the region has a vast potential for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In the region, 60 percent of the land area is covered by rivers
and lakes and 95 percent of the water is economically unexploited.
</P>
<P>
Only four percent of the energy potential from the numerous
rivers and lakes including the Congo, the Nile, the Zambezi, the
Victoria, the Owen Falls and Aswan has been developed.
</P>
<P>
With a total hydroelectric potential of 700 billion kw, of
which 96 percent remains to be exploited.
</P>
<P>
Except for electricity generation, the water and lake resources
have enormous potential for exploitation for water transport,
irrigation and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA is proud of its huge mineral wealth, including 300
billion tons of phosphate, 105 billion tons of iron ore, 200
billion tons of petroleum and large proven deposits of gas,
uranium, nickel, copper and cobalt.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Songosongo gas reservoir in Tanzania, if fully
exploited, can provide enough gas to meet needs of the region.
</P>
<P>
The region has enough mineral potential to support large-scale
industries such as steel mills, fertilizer plants and other
factories to meet the regional needs.
</P>
<P>
The region also has many of the natural and man-made wonders of
the world for tourist destinations. They include great pyramids in
Egypt, great rift valley in Kenya, Masai Mara and Serengenti game
reserve bordering Kenya and Tanzania, great Victoria falls in
Zambia and the cradle of mankind such as Lake Turkana in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Just as Kenyan Minister Nicholas Biwott once said, the
resources and heritage in the region offer a diverse package for
tourist industry, with a guided tour of the ancient Egyptian
pyramids, a cruise down the Nile, a safari in the Masai Mara and
Serengenti game reserve, a view of the Gorillas in the lush
Ruwenzori in Uganda and a visit to the magnificent Victoria falls.
</P>
<P>
With rich natural resources to be exploited, the COMESA region
has been an attractive destination for both local and overseas
investment.

<HEADLINE> UK Says NATO to Continue Forcing Belgrade to Meet Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Friday that NATO
will continue its air campaign against Yugoslavia until President
Slobodan Milosevic starts to meet the alliance's demands.
</P>
<P>
NATO will keep the pressure on Milosevic "until you (Yugoslavia)
start to meet these conditions," Armed Forces Minister Doug
Henderson told a press conference held in the Defense Ministry
when asked whether NATO might halt its airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
NATO repeatedly demanded Belgrade to end the military action in
Kosovo, pull out its forces from the province, allow refugees to
return and agree to deploy an international peacekeeping force
with NATO at its core.
</P>
<P>
"If you (Yugoslavia) withdraw your troops, and if you then
agree in principle to the establishment of an international
peacekeeping force, then progress (towards a political solution)
can be made," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The comments were made when Henderson was asked whether NATO is
considering an Italian proposal to stop air strikes before
Belgrade accepts all NATO's conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The (NATO) position is unchanged," he said.

<P>
The COMESA, with its headquarters in Lusaka, capital of Zambia,
was established in 1994 to replace the Preferential Trade Area for
Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA) which had been in existence
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
The treaty establishing the COMESA was signed on November
5,1993 in Ugandan capital Kampala and was ratified a year later in
Lilongwe, Malawi on December 8, 1994 when the first COMESA summit
was convened.
</P>
<P>
The second COMESA summit was held on April 20, Lusaka, Zambia,
focusing on promoting regional trade, economic integration,
security and peace.
</P>
<P>
The third summit was held in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of
Congo on June 29, 1998 under the theme "Information - A Tool for
Increased Trade and Investment in COMESA."
</P>
<P>
The third summit set the target to establish a COMESA free
trade area by the year 2000, the establishment of Comtel, a
private company limited to provide a framework for regional
telecommunications interconnectivity, and the expanded membership
of the Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the agenda set by the COMESA Treaty, the
sub-regional organization will pass stage by stage on its way to
achieving its mission for an increased cooperation and integration
in all fields of development, particularly in trade, customs,
monetary affairs, transport and others.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, zero tariffs should be achieved among COMESA
members (free trade status).
</P>
<P>
And by 2004, a common external tariff, or customs union, will
be established with less restricted movement of people (common
market status).
</P>
<P>
By 2025, a monetary union, free movement of people including
right of establishment (economic community status) will be
established.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the COMESA has 21 members: Angola, Burundi, the
Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia,
Rwanda, Seychelles, the Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the COMESA is to facilitate the removal
of all structural and institutional weaknesses of member states,
and the promotion of peace, security and stability so as to enable
them to attain sustained development individually and
collectively.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Ugandan Currency Plunges Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan currency shilling has
experienced an unprecedented depreciation of 18.9 percent against
the U.S. dollar over the past 10 months, making the local foreign
exchange market much more volatile than ever.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between the two currencies stood at 1,230
shillings to one dollar last July when the new fiscal year
started. But it plummeted to a record low of 1,520 shillings to
one dollar by the end of April this year, triggering more and
fresh concerns over the stability of the local currency.
</P>
<P>
In response to public pressure, the Bank of Uganda, the
country's central bank , has pumped large sums of hard-earned
foreign exchange into the market to rescue the falling shilling,
but failed to save it from dropping to the rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
The off-season coffee, fish ban by the European Union, delayed
fund from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and insecurity in
the region are widely held responsible for the sharp shilling
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Coffee exports, which account for some 60 percent of Uganda's
foreign exchange earnings, have been on the decline over this
period.
</P>
<P>
In April alone, the coffee exports nose-dived to 173,031 bags
(50 kilograms per bag) from the previous level of 288,033 bags,
representing a decline of 40 percent in volume. The coffee
returns dropped by 43 percent to 13.45 million dollars in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the Uganda Coffee
Development Authority, coffee prices in the international market
have been low because of the sharp increase in Brazil's coffee
exports.
</P>
<P>
The fish ban imposed by the Ugandan government and the EU
respectively helped make the scarcity of dollar a sure thing in
the money market.
</P>
<P>
Since fish poisoning was discovered in Lake Victoria in March
this year, the government banned fish sales in the domestic
markets, followed by the EU ban of fish product exports from the
region.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been the largest buyer of Uganda's fish products.
In the wake of the EU fish ban, Uganda loses one million dollars
each week.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the IMF and other donors delayed their funding to
Uganda, saying the country's defense spending is shooting up to "a
dangerously high level."
</P>
<P>
The defense budget of this financial year was 150 million
dollars, some 2.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product,
while the prescribed rate should be 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and other multilateral financial institutions providing
fund to Uganda have urged the Ugandan government to slash the
defense spending and this was set as a precondition to their
further funding to this fund- thirsty country.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has delayed 18 million dollars pledged to the country
so far this year. Other donors made similar demands.
</P>
<P>
Under the mounting pressures from this donors, the Ugandan
leaders have to agree to reduce the defense spending in the next
fiscal year to 121 million dollars and to earmark all the donated
money for the top priority areas like health, education and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Insecurity in the country and the region as a whole is also to
blame for the weakening shilling. The spilling war in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, frenzy rebel attacks on soft targets
and the recent spate of bombings in capital Kampala are the key
causes of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
This increasing insecurity has scared away prospective
investors and sent foreign investors drawing money from banks to
deposit it in a third country.
</P>
<P>
The safety concern acted as the prime killer to the country's
young but booming tourist industry. The Bwindi massacre in early
March this year, in which eight foreign tourists were killed by
Rwandan Hutu extremists, almost brought the business of tourist
agents to a standstill. Lots of foreign tourists have called to
cancel their planned trips to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the free fall of shilling, the central bank did not
hesitate to come to its rescue. In April, it injected a total of
25.6 million dollars to calm the market and in early May another
eight million dollars were sold out to stabilize the shilling.
But these efforts did not reverse the falling trend of the
currency.
</P>
<P>
Senior economists and officials with the central bank said at a
press conference Thursday that with the coming of another coffee
season at the end of this month, coffee exports would recover and
the demand for dollar would naturally be brought down.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the shilling would gain against the dollar
very soon.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Hold Republic Referendum on November 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Australians will go to the polls
on the first Saturday in November to choose whether their nation
should become a republic, Australian Attorney-General Daryl
Williams announced Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"The government has confirmed that its preferred date for the
referendum on whether Australia should become a republic is
Saturday, November 6, 1999," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The date is not a surprise after Australian Prime Minister John
Howard accidentally let slip earlier this month to a group of
schoolchildren that the referendum would be held on the first
Saturday in November.
</P>
<P>
But the timing of the announcement came as a surprise for many
analysts here as the focus of attention of Australia has been on
the crucial negotiations this week between Prime Minister Howard
and the Australian Democrats Party on the government's proposed
tax reform bill.
</P>
<P>
Despite growing support for Australia to become a republic
among ordinary people, even among leading members of the ruling
Australian Liberal Party, the prime minister has said personally
he is a monarchist, but he would keep his election promise to hold
a referendum on the issue and he would respect the results of the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Williams said legislation giving the go-ahead for Australia to
become a republic, should the referendum be approved, would be
introduced into the Australian parliament next month.
</P>
<P>
A Joint Select Committee would begin examining the bill later
this month and report back to the parliament in August, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the legislation would need to be passed by August 20 to
enable the referendum to go ahead on November 6, but both the
Labor party and the Democrats had indicated their support for the
legislation.

<HEADLINE> COMESATEX '99 Exhibition Opens in Kenyan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 21 (xinhua) -- The Trade Exhibition of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, dubbed as COMESATEX '99,
the first of its kinds along with the meetings of the COMESA
policy organs, opened here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The major trade fair was officially opened by Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi, the in-coming chairman of the COMESA Authority of
Heads and State and Government, attracting over 300 companies from
18 COMESA members states and four non-COMESA countries.
</P>
<P>
On display are vehicles, satellite telecommunications
equipment, computers, power facilities, electrical and machinery
equipment, textiles, furniture, office utilities, sanitary
equipment, ceramics, traditional handicrafts, medicines and
foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said at the opening ceremony that the exhibition
provided COMESA member states with the opportunities to market
their products and to strengthen their economic ties at the
regional level.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Africa is moving forward and is on the way to
playing its role in the globalization, and hoped the member states
to "increase their awareness in promoting cooperation and trade
within the region for sustainable economic development and the
well-being of our people."
</P>
<P>
"COMESA has a population of 400 million. That is a big
market," he said, hoping that investors from Europe, America, Asia
and elsewhere would build their industries in the COMESA region by
tapping local rich resources.
</P>
<P>
He pledged more investment in the regional programs for a
sustainable development in the COMESA.
</P>
<P>
Moi also said that African states should depend upon themselves
for economic development, not on the outsiders, adding that
education be conducted to create awareness over it among the
people.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is the greatest demand. Without peace, there is nothing
but poverty," Moi pointed out, referring to the violent conflicts
in the sub- region.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the companies from Japan, China, India and Malaysia
for participating in the exhibition to show their products to the
COMESA members.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha, Kenyan Trade Minister
Joseph Kamotho and Minister for East African and Regional
Development Nicholas Biwott also took the floor at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
They spoke highly of the involvement of the private sector to
the exhibition and their commitment in supporting the COMESA
governments' efforts to realize a free trade area by October 31,
2000.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition provides an opportunity for COMESA members to
display their sample goods and services so that later they can buy
what they need from within the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
COMESATEX '99 will last for 10 days.

<HEADLINE> All Aboard Saved After Liner Sinks Off Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- All of the 1,104 people on board
a cruise ship have been rescued Friday after their luxury liner
sank off the coast of Malaysia in the early morning.
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers from the sunken ship, Sun Vista, have
been flown back to Singapore, yet some 70 others have chosen to
stay on in Penang, western Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The ship's Singapore owner, Sun Cruises, said in a statement
that a power failure had resulted from a fire in the main engine
room Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some 16 passengers were slightly injured during the accident
which occurred off Penang in the Strait of Malacca at 01:20 Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
A British passenger said white smoke occurred on the ship but
it was a long time before they were told to put on their life
jackets and leave the sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
He said he had lost everything with him and reports said that
many others also had their belongings lost.
</P>
<P>
Some survivors said they struggled to quell down the panic by
singing the song from the movie "Titanic".
</P>
<P>
A passenger said it was lucky there were no heart attacks among
the elderly people and that had not been the calm water there
would have been much loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
Sun Cruises said there were 472 passengers and 632 crew members
on board and most of the passengers were from two dozen countries,
among them 10 Singaporeans.
</P>
<P>
Making an apology to all aboard the ship, the ship's owner has
suspended all cruise operations and said it will compensate those
from the sunken ship and those affected in future cruises.
</P>
<P>
The passengers, on a six-day cruise, were on their way to
Singapore from Thailand's Phuket island when fire broke out near
Malaysia's Pangkor island Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
All aboard abandoned the ship in the early evening and were
transferred to life boats before being picked up by passing ships
and Malaysian rescuers.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what actually caused the sinking and an
investigation is still under way.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Accuses Taliban of Purging Shiites in Herat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan opposition alliance
Friday accused the ruling Taliban of launching ethnic cleansing of
Shiites from the western province of Herat, according to a report
of News Network International of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Reports from alliance commanders in Herat have confirmed
accounts that the occupying Taliban militia has commenced a
systematic purge of Shiites in Herat city," General Sayed Husain
Anwari, chief military commander of Harakat-e-Islami said.
</P>
<P>
Anwari, from Kunduz in northern Afghanistan, said that in a
dramatic move, the Taliban soldiers began attacking residential
properties of prominent Shiite Heraties two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Early reports alleged that at least 25 civilians were killed
while 75 were injured in these raids. Many more have been arrested
and transported to unknown destinations.
</P>
<P>
The general said that the Taliban have been known to transport
non-Pushtun Afghans to Pushtun dominated regions of Afghanistan in
a clear move to dilute resistance in northern and western
provinces of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban have also banned public gathering in the province.
Congregations of even small numbers of Heraties on the streets of
the city are now deemed punishable," said Anwari.
</P>
<P>
He said house-to-house searches continued to single out Shiites
in the city. With the atmosphere growing tense, most retail
outlets and shops were closed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He continued to say that the Taliban sealed Afghanistan's
border with Iran on May 19 in a bid to contain reports of Taliban
"atrocities" reaching the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Remembering Heroic Deeds of Chinese Press in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua journalist Shao Yunhuan
of the Belgrade Bureau was killed by NATO that she fiercely
criticized and this is why her death has been so disquieting,
according to her boss, the editor-in-chief of the "News Reference",
Xia Haitao.
</P>
<P>
Xia told a gathering of 3,500 people in Beijing today that when
they bombed a passenger train, U.S.-led NATO said it was a "
mistake", when they bombed a residential area, they said that it
was a "mistake", and when they bombed a hospital, it was still a "
mistake". The peace-loving Shao then wrote: "When Will NATO's
'Mistakes' End?"
</P>
<P>
Only a week after that story was released, Shao was dead and
NATO went as far as to claim that this again was a "mistake". Xia
said he was so indignant that he choked.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was held in Beijing's Great Hall of the People in
commemoration of the heroic deeds of the Chinese press and
diplomats in Belgrade. Vice President Hu Jintao was present at the
event.
</P>
<P>
Xia's comments and others from the father of a journalist
couple from Guangming Daily who were also killed in the attack and
three diplomats were met with tremendous applause and tears.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy head of the Publicity Department of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, Liu Yunshan, said that the
reports were vivid and an in-depth education in patriotism.
</P>
<P>
A soldier from the audience told Xinhua after the meeting that
"we must turn our grief into action to rejuvenate the Chinese
nation so as not to let her be bullied by anyone in the world."
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was jointly organized by the Publicity
Department, the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Education, the
General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, and
the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Ban Baboon Meat Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa authorities have
refused to issue permits to allow the export of baboon meat and
body parts from an abattoir about to be built in Warmbaths, some
150 km north of Pretoria, the Star newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its stern statement, the environment department of Northern
Province said it had refused to allow the export of baboon meat
because investors in the abattoir had not compiled an ecology
impact study to determine the effect their venture might have on
baboon populations.
</P>
<P>
The export of baboon meat is likely to result in negative
effect on local tourism industry and populations of the animals,
the department said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a group of businessmen intended producing
salami, polony, ribs and canned baboon meat for human consumption
in central Africa and parts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Baboon's body parts such as teeth, nails and hands are intended
for export to Asia for use in aphrodisiacs.
</P>
<P>
The Warmbaths Tourism Board has stared a petition to try to
stop construction of the plant because of concern about the
negative impact it might have on tourism.
</P>
<P>
Although baboons are not considered a threatened or endangered
species in Southern Africa, no studies or counts have been done to
determine their exact numbers.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Registers Trade Surplus with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea registered a trade
surplus of 464 million U.S. dollars with the United States in
March this year, a three-month streak of surplus, the Korea Trade-
Investment Promotion Agency said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which suffered a trade deficit of 271 million
dollars with the United States last December, swung back to a
surplus of 530 million dollars in January this year and 620
million in February.
</P>
<P>
As a result, South Korea's accumulated trade surplus with the U.
S. in the first quarter of the year amounted to 1.61 billion
dollars, down 500 million dollars from the same period of last
year, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency attributed the increasing surplus to booming
American economy which is helping to expand South Korean exports
at a time when other export markets are experiencing a slump.

<HEADLINE> Penalized British Insurance Company Says It Will Cooperation With Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Sedgwick Insurance &AMP; Risk
Management Consultants (China) Limited, which Chinese authorities
recently suspended as a result of improper business practices, has
denied media reports that it has referred the matter to the
European Commission and says that it will cooperate fully with the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued today by J &AMP; H Marsh McLennan
Inc., which now owns Sedgwick, no one with authority in their
organization has been authorized to raise the matter with the
European Commission or to make any statement on it to the news
media. The company said it agrees with Sedgwick's advice that they
cooperate fully with the China Insurance Regulatory Commission to
overcome the ostensible shortcomings in Sedgwick's operations
during the three-month suspension.
</P>
<P>
They said they are committed to seeing to it that Sedgwick
conforms to the regulatory commission's guidelines and carries out
the required rectification program. The commission last week
announced the suspension from May 10 to August 10 because of
Sedgwick's failure to get a license and other offenses.
</P>
<P>
The company was established in 1993 with a 140,000 U.S. dollars
worth of registered capital with People's Bank of China approval.
It reported a turnover of nearly 14 million yuan in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Accuses Taliban of Purging Shiites in Herat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan opposition alliance
Friday accused the ruling Taliban of launching ethnic cleansing of
Shiites from the western province of Herat, according to a report
of News Network International of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Reports from alliance commanders in Herat have confirmed
accounts that the occupying Taliban militia has commenced a
systematic purge of Shiites in Herat city," General Sayed Husain
Anwari, chief military commander of Harakat-e-Islami said.
</P>
<P>
Anwari, from Kunduz in northern Afghanistan, said that in a
dramatic move, the Taliban soldiers began attacking residential
properties of prominent Shiite Heraties two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Early reports alleged that at least 25 civilians were killed
while 75 were injured in these raids. Many more have been arrested
and transported to unknown destinations.
</P>
<P>
The general said that the Taliban have been known to transport
non-Pushtun Afghans to Pushtun dominated regions of Afghanistan in
a clear move to dilute resistance in northern and western
provinces of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban have also banned public gathering in the province.
Congregations of even small numbers of Heraties on the streets of
the city are now deemed punishable," said Anwari.
</P>
<P>
He said house-to-house searches continued to single out Shiites
in the city. With the atmosphere growing tense, most retail
outlets and shops were closed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He continued to say that the Taliban sealed Afghanistan's
border with Iran on May 19 in a bid to contain reports of Taliban
"atrocities" reaching the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Prospect of Zambian Copper Industry Bleak: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's copper exports fell 23
percent to less than 34,000 tons in the first two months of this
year while production declined another five percent in the first
quarter, according to Business Trends Zambia published by Standard
Chartered Bank.
</P>
<P>
With prices down 16 percent in the first quarter, projections
for a 16 increase in the volume of copper exports and five percent
in their value during this year are unlikely, and the same applies
to the optimistic projections of an eight percent recovery in
total exports this year, said the publication available here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
While the worst may be over for the copper slump, in terms of
falling prices, few forecasters see a strong recovery in the
medium-term, it said.
</P>
<P>
Far from increasing during this year, the probability is that
production will again decline this year to around 260,000 tons
from 298,000 tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Given the global commodity price outlook and the continuing
delays in finalizing copper privation of Zambia, one of the world
biggest copper- producing countries, the recovery thereafter is
likely to be only gradual.
</P>
<P>
The clear implication is that the country will have to look to
agriculture, manufacturing and tourism to increase the tempo of
growth over the next two years, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
The already-precarious financial situation at Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) continues to deteriorate. One
estimate is that ZCCM owes its suppliers some 240 million U.S.
dollars with the figure escalating by 20 million a month.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the entire supplier sector on the Copperbelt in
the north of the country is at serious risk necessitating a major
government initiative to avert collapse by ensuring that payment
arrears are settled.
</P>
<P>
Failure to do so will throw up yet another obstacle in the way
of resumed investment in the copper mines, said Business Trends
Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former President Soeharto Denies Time Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto Friday appeared on television, strongly denying a report
of the U.S. news magazine Time which alleged that he had amassed
15 billion U.S. dollars during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
"The (Time) report is not true. It is a lie. If the magazine
cannot show me the facts, it is slander and defamation," Soeharto
told the private station RCTI on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In its latest issue, Time reported the Soeharto family's 15
billion U.S. dollars wealth comprised cash, shares, corporate
assets, real estate, jewelry and fine arts.
</P>
<P>
"It is more cruel than murder," said the former head of state
who resigned from office exactly a year ago following massive
student protests in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of four
Trisakti University students.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said he has the right to bring the leading American
magazine to court if it is unable to show proof that the Soeharto
family is worth 15 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
His appearance on television has quelled rumors spreading
around since the first day of the election campaign on Wednesday
that he has fled the country.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's lawyers also issued a warning letter to Time
magazine on Wednesday, saying they are ready to sue, based on
either civil or criminal codes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Golkar Party general chairman Akbar
Tanjung has urged the Attorney General's Office not to ignore the
Time report.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib Wednesday said his office will
invite the representatives of Time to explain the article.
</P>
<P>
He said his office will set up a legal team to ask for
confirmation from Time's Jakarta representatives about the report.

<HEADLINE> China Developing High-Quality Early Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China recorded 530,000 hectares
more of high-quality early rice this year amid a reduction in the
total acreage of early rice, and agronomists agree that this shows
that the country is paying more attention to the quality of grain
crops rather than yields.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the country planted 7.
6 million hectares of early rice this year, as most early-rice
growing provinces decreased the amount of land in rice. Of the
total, the land planted in high-quality strains stood at 2.8
million hectares.
</P>
<P>
After several years of good harvests, China now has sufficient
or even excess grain supplies, said a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Early rice is an important part of Chinese grain production,
but, for a long time it has been known for its unpalatability and
lack of quality. In 1996, there were only 1.5 million hectares of
high-quality rice fields in China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the ministry began to make an effort to improve the
quality and research institutes, including the China Rice Research
Institute and the Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, joined
in the effort.
</P>
<P>
However some specialists say that China should do more to
improve the quality of early rice and point to problems like the
imbalance in development in different areas and low quality of
most strains.

LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Three people were lightly injured
early Friday morning by a device that exploded outside two bars in
a nationalist area of west Belfast, the provincial capital of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
BBC report said the incident occurred just after midnight

No group has claimed responsibility, but police and
politicians believed it fitted the pattern of more than 50 attacks
committed this year in the name of two recently outlawed anti-

The groups have thrown dozens of pipebombs and grenades at

<HEADLINE> Veteran Chinese Diplomat Says No One Can Insult Strong Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Ling Qing, the former permanent
representative of China to the United Nations, condemned the NATO
raid on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia and said he did not
accept the explanation that it was a mistake based on an outdated
map, but was planned and premeditated.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old diplomat said the raid was meant to put
pressure on China, which strongly supports Yugoslavia, to make
China's internal problems more severe and to divert China's
attention from economic development to a new arms race to slow its
economic progress.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO missiles have rung an alarm telling us that we can no
longer live with an illusion about the United States and Western
countries," Ling said, adding that it is only a strong and
prosperous China that can confront the hegemony of the super power.
</P>
<P>
Ling is a distant relative of Lin Zexu (1754-1850), a hero of
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) who is known for his firmness in
suppressing the opium trade.
</P>
<P>
Ling Qing has called for persistence in carrying out the
reforms and opening-up drive and in making economic development
China's central task.
</P>
<P>
On the night of May 7, NATO warplanes attacked the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade with missiles, killing three journalists,
wounding 20 other people, and seriously damaging the embassy
buildings. The incident sparked an uproar and protests and
demonstrations around the country.

BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese officials are saying

developing high-tech industries to support the domestic economy.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has ended his 10-day tour of the northern region with calls for
local people to increase homestead income and to safeguard
security.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued late Thursday evening by the President's
Office said that Museveni extended amnesty to rebels of the Lord
Resistance Army and their leader Joseph Kony if they come out
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who have been fighting the government for 13 years,
would be forgiven for what they had done to the people if they
surrender their arms and come out at an agreed time, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
In discussions with local leaders, Museveni talked about issues
 concerning health, local environment, infrastructure construction
and security.
</P>
<P>
He urged soldiers there to protect the country by neutralizing
the rebels and their criminal activities. He was shown an
assortment of arms captured from the rebels there.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also called on the people of Arua District to grow
high value crops in order to get high monetary returns and
eradicate poverty from their homesteads.
</P>
<P>
He commended their leaders for encouraging them to grow Arabica
coffee but advised them to also grow clonal coffee in addition to
tobacco and cotton.
</P>
<P>
The president visits the northern region once in a while to
give advice and boost soldiers' morale since this region is
relatively backward in agricultural development and vulnerable to
rebel attack.

<HEADLINE> Eximbank Seminar for African Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-six senior economic
officials from 13 African countries took part today in a China
Export and Import Bank (Eximbank) seminar on the Chinese
government's soft loans for foreign countries and export buyer's
credit.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank President Yang Zilin said at the seminar that China
and Africa complement each other in various ways and that there is
great potential for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Soft loans of the Chinese government play an important role in
developing friendly relations with developing countries in Africa
and other parts of the world, and in promoting economic
development in these countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank, the Chinese government's conduit for these soft loans,
has had close cooperation with African governments, financial
institutions, and enterprises since its founding in 1995, and has
managed a number of soft loan for projects in textiles, machinery,
resources development and other industries.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that these projects have played an active role in
promoting economic development of some African countries, bringing
in more taxes and offering job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The projects have also created favorable conditions for Chinese
enterprises to increase their international presence, get involved
in international markets and strengthen cooperation with local
partners for mutual benefits and development.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is aimed to help African economic officials better
understand China's financial system reforms and Eximbank's main
business and basic business procedures.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Advised to Set Up Small Firms to Create </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) has suggested that Tanzania should set up more
small enterprises to create greater job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
ILO Deputy General Secretary and Regional Director for Africa,
Elias Mabere, said at a meeting in Dar es Salaam that most
flourishing economies in other African countries were driven by
small enterprises and Tanzania should follow suit.
</P>
<P>
He said the country should open market and provide training and
credit funds to people so that they are able to set up small
enterprises, The African newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mabere listed Namibia, Nigeria, Mauritius, Uganda as countries
in the Sub-Saharan Africa whose economies rested on the small
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Small enterprises, the paper said, contribute some 35 percent
of the national income employing 20 percent of the country's labor
force. The sector generates output of 3.32 billion shillings
(about 4.7 million U.S. dollars) with an added value of 2.05
billion shillings. Average salaries of employees in small
enterprises are 2.5 times over that of the minimum government
wage.
</P>
<P>
Mabere, who is based in Geneva, Switzerland, arrived in
Tanzania to participate in a three-day national round-table
meeting on employment policy review which closed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he said ILO will assist the Tanzanian government to
review, update and implement the national employment policy of
1997.
</P>
<P>
He said due to the seriousness of unemployment in Tanzania, the
private sector, civil societies, and the government must make
joint efforts to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
At present, unemployment rate in Tanzania is higher than 40
percent.

LHASA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 90 percent of the poor
farmers and herdsmen of the Tibet Autonomous Region now have
adequate food and clothing thanks to an aid-the-poor project of
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The regional government allocated 212 million yuan last year
for 18 poor counties to help them with 99 cultivation, processing,
and infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Tibet had a GDP of 8.8 billion yuan (1.06 billion U.S. dollars)
last year and farmers had their 11th consecutive year of good
harvests, and, as a consequence, their per capita income rose to 1,
150 yuan, up 6 percent from the previous year. The number of
poverty-stricken people in Tibet has dropped from 210,000 in 1997
to 147,000.
</P>
<P>
Tibet had more than 400,000 poverty-stricken people in 1996 and
the regional government responded to the dire situation by setting
a goal of eradicating poverty by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Plans for this year call for the other 100,000 poor people to
have better lives.

So far this year, a total of nine Israeli soldiers have been
killed and scores of others wounded in south Lebanon in their
conflicts with Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movements spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli forces and its ally South Lebanon Army out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after Israeli Labor leader Ehud Barak swept to
a landslide victory in the country's prime minister election on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to withdraw Israeli troops out of south
Lebanon within a year by signing an agreement with Lebanese and
Syrian governments, a claim Beirut said is not different from his
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu's.
</P>
<P>
Natanyahu's government last April adopted the 20-year-old
United Nations Resolution 425 and offered to apply it in return
for security guarantees from the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria firmly rejected the offer, citing the
resolution calling for a unconditional Israeli withdrawal from
Lebanon is not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
With 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, Syria has been
seeking a comprehensive settlement with Israel, which will also
covers a pullout from its Golan Heights captured by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Says NATO Needs To Explain Embassy Missile Attack (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Hu Jintao said here
today that NATO needs to take full responsibility for the attack
on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and to give a full explanation
in response to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO, disregarding the UN Charter and
international conventions and principles of international
relations, went so far as to attack the Chinese embassy, seriously
infringing upon China's sovereignty and constituting an open
provocation to the 1.2 billion Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the remarks
during a meeting here today with a Revolutionary Party of Tanzania
delegation, headed by its Secretary-General Philip Mangula.
</P>
<P>
Mangula told Hu that they were shocked to hear that the Chinese
embassy attacked and called it "an appalling and inhumane crime",
conveying condolences to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
He said that international conflicts should be settled through
dialogues instead of force and that a new world order should be
established on the basis of the principle of peaceful co-existence.

Hu went on to say that the Chinese government unswervingly
pursues an independent foreign policy of peace, strongly opposes
hegemony and power politics, and firmly safeguards state
sovereignty and national dignity. The Chinese people are ready to
make a concerted effort with people elsewhere to support each
other and cooperate closely in promoting the lofty cause of peace
and development.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, he said that China and Tanzania have a
traditional friendship and their bilateral relations have had
constant growth thanks to the efforts of several generations of
leaders and the Communist Party of China is willing to reinforce
its exchanges and cooperation with the Revolutionary Party of
Tanzania to advance those relations.
</P>
<P>
Mangula said that Tanzania and China should further their
bilateral friendly cooperation in the economy, politics, and other
areas and he expressed the hope that China can resolve the Taiwan
issue at an early date and realize the peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania delegation is in China at the CPC's invitation.

<HEADLINE> S. African TV Cancels Election Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's state
television, under the South Africa Broadcasting Corporation
(SABC), has canceled a debate between leaders of the four major
political parties in the country after it failed to put them
together.
</P>
<P>
The planned debate, involving leaders of the African National
Congress (ANC), the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the New National
Party (NNP) and the Democratic Party (DP), was originally set to
be broadcast two days ahead of the June 2 election.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the four parties Thursday, producer Maryanne de
Villiers said the program had been canceled because the SABC was
unable to get the leaders of the invited parties together.
</P>
<P>
ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe confirmed Thursday night that his
party was not prepared to allow its leader Thabo Mbeki to
participate, but said it was prepared to field other people in his
place.
</P>
<P>
The IFP also said its president, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, was
unable to participate, because he had a hectic campaign schedule
that day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NNP said the cancellation of the special debate
was a clear indication that Mbeki was not prepared to enter into a
debate with its leader, Marthinus van Schalkwyk.
</P>
<P>
DP spokesman Douglas Gibson said his party's leader, Tony Leon,
was outraged as the debate had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
He called on the SABC to inform the public which leader had
"chickened out" of the planned debate.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's spokesman Masebe accused the opposition and the SABC
of wanting to use Mbeki to draw the crowds.
</P>
<P>
The election is believed to be a foregone conclusion with the
ANC set to win.

<HEADLINE> EU Boosts Goods Quality for COMESA States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has given the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) a grant of
2.5 million U.S. dollars for strengthening certification of
standards of goods produced in the region.
</P>
<P>
A three-year program is already in place and will facilitate
efforts to expand the capacity of COMESA members' products
standard bureaux, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
John Opio, senior program officer in COMESA's industry
division, said Thursday that the region risked being sidelined in
international trade if its products failed to meet standards set
by external markets.
</P>
<P>
The World Food and Agriculture Organization has also offered
340,000 dollars to help the COMESA handle the quality of fish
exports, Opio said.
</P>
<P>
Change of attitude was necessary to stop the tendency of taking
locally manufactured products as inferior to imported ones, he
added.

staged by the Turkish security forces in southeastern Turkey, an
official statement said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the office of the Emergency Regional

Semdin Sakik, second-in-command of the PKK, to capital punishment,
claiming that he was held responsible for the killings of 283
people in 191 acts of violence carried out by the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The court also sentenced his brother Arif Sakik to capital
punishment for treason in the trial in Diyarbakir.

<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Some Buddhist relics consecrated at
Beijing's Lingguang Temple were taken to Hong Kong today by
special plane to be enshrined and worshipped for seven days there.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Buddhist Association (HKBA) asked for them to be
brought for Buddha's birthday on April 8 of the lunar calendar (
May 22). Zhao Puchu, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference National committee and head of
the Buddhist Association of China (BAC), was among those
accompanying the relics.
</P>
<P>
The birthday ceremony will be the first big cooperation between
the BAC and HKBA since July 1, 1997, when China resumed exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The birthday was approved by the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) as a public holiday this
year, and, to celebrate it, the HKBA asked the Central Government
and BAC for the relics to be brought to Hong Kong for a week.
</P>
<P>
A grand ceremony is scheduled for Saturday to receive the
relics.
</P>
<P>
Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, was said to have left two
teeth as relics after his death. The one has been worshipped in
Beijing, and the other in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The one in Beijing was taken to Myanmar and Sri Lanka for
pilgrimages in 1955, 1961, 1994 and 1996.

<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 250 photos of the NATO
attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia were displayed at the
China Art Gallery here today.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yansong, of People's Daily, took the photos and is still in
Yugoslavia. He spoke over the phone with Hu Xijin, one of the
organizers of the exhibition, half an hour after it started and
said that it took less time than he expected to organize it.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Siqing, the vice-chairman of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference National Committee, and Slobodan
Unkovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to China, attended the opening
ceremony for the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhongtian, the editor-in-chief of People's Daily, accused
NATO of a barbaric act and asked Chinese reporters to work harder
to increase China's strength.
</P>
<P>
A Yugoslav embassy official said that this was the first time
for him to see so many photos of the embassy attack and Zheng
Mengxiong, the first vice-chairman and secretary general of the
All-China Journalists Association, said that the photos help
people learn the truth and that NATO should reply.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the exhibition was not easy to organize because of
telecommunications and transportation problems in Yugoslavia, but
that people with a sense of justice helped a lot.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Trade Output Stagnates in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Africa's trade performance
stagnated or fell last year, according to the latest statistics
provided by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA).
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Friday quoted secretary-general of
the COMESA Erastus Mwencha as saying that globalization posed
great challenges to vulnerable and less competitive nations on
the global market.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha attributed the decline in trade for 1998 to reduced
commodity prices which fell sharply, pushing the share of primary
products in world exports to less than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total 5,583 billion U.S. dollars worth of world
exports, the COMESA region contributed only 23 billion dollars,
only 0.41 percent of world trade, Mwencha said Thursday during
the opening of the 7th COMESA Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
With the phasing out of some preferential treaties with the
European Union (EU) and the signing of a Free Trade Area
Agreement between the EU and South Africa, market access into
Europe is becoming even more difficult, Mwencha warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin left
for the Black Sea resort of Sochi Friday on a two-week vacation,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The vacation came after two victories in the past week for the
Russian president: the failure of the State Duma (the lower house
of parliament) on May 15 to start formal impeachment proceedings
against him and the easy confirmation last Wednesday of his prime
ministerial nominee, Sergei Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin replaced Yevgeny Primakov, who was sacked on May 12
together with his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Yeltsin might have signed the first
package of decrees concerning the appointments to the new cabinet,
primarily defense and interior ministers, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the ministers for defense, foreign affairs,
interior, emergencies and heads of the country's domestic and
foreign intelligence services in the Primakov cabinet would retain
their jobs under Stepashin.

<HEADLINE> North China Province continues Opening up: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A local official said today
that his province will continue to open up to the rest of the
world in spite of the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Niu Maosheng, governor of north China's Hebei Province, said
that developing the economy and opening up to the rest of the
world is the country's central task and no hostile foreign force
can change this course.
</P>
<P>
He told those attending the province's ongoing economic and
trade fair that the majority of the people in NATO countries are
friendly and like doing business with the Chinese people, but the
small number of decision-makers are adopting a hostile attitude
towards China.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade fair which opened here earlier this week
is the first major provincial-level international business event
in China since the Chinese embassy was raided on May 8. Leading
entrepreneurs from more than 40 countries and regions, including
the United States, are participating in the fair.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the fair, investors from the United States,
Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK) signed contracts on
27 cooperation projects about agriculture, food processing and
power with seven cities of the province including Shijiazhuang,
Baoding and Qinhuangdao.
</P>
<P>
Among the 27 projects, there are ten which will use more than
10 million U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of the challenges in the coming century, we shall
continue to promote economic changes and trade and cooperation in
other fields with overseas while adhering to the principle of
independence and self-reliance," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Ranking the sixth in China economically, Hebei centers around
the Chinese capital, Beijing, and the north China commercial and
trade center, Tianjin, and it will make good use of the geological
advantages and promote the growth of its export-oriented economy,
the governor added.
</P>
<P>
The province is now having discussions on ten major high and
new technology projects with overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
Hebei has many tourist attractions and in the first four months
of this year, it hosted more than four million domestic and
overseas tourists, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Cotton Being Shipped From Northwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China's railways are taking urgent
steps to move a large amount of cotton from the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region to other areas and expect to finish the job by
June 25.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is China's largest cotton producer and accounts for a
third of the country's total. Last year, it purchased 1.48 million
tons of cotton from peasants, bringing the amount of cotton it
possesses to 1.61 million tons, and by April it still had 575,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that if this large amount of cotton can not be
moved out of Xinjiang, it will seriously affect peasants'
initiative and cotton production next year and China could lose
good export opportunities from the rising cotton price on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's top governing body, allocated 4.2
billion yuan for solving the problem and said that it had to be
completed by June. The Railway Administration of Urumqi,
Xinjiang's capital, organized a special group to supervise the
process and managed to load 320 freight cars of cotton daily by
May 19.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways has also allocated empty trains from
Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Liuzhou for adequate transportation
facilities.
</P>
<P>
From May 4 to 18, there were 57 trains, or 2,300 freight cars,
moved to Urumqi, and a special railway line was opened for moving
the cotton on May 10.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Produce over 280,000 Vehicles This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran expects to produce 280,000
vehicles of different types during the current Iranian calendar
year which started on March 21, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Industries Minister and head of Industrial Development
and Renovation Organization Akbar Torkan made the remarks on
Thursday in Iran's northern province of Mazadaran.
</P>
<P>
Torkan said that if the plan is fully implemented, over
150,000 people will find employment. Currently more than 450,000
people are employed in this sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the vehicle-making industry is not
to get any help from oil revenues and try to be self sufficient
in generating foreign exchange for production.
</P>
<P>
Iran's industries are scheduled to become self-sufficient by
2004 in generating foreign exchange, but the vehicle production
industry is expected to fulfill this goal two years earlier than
the other sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Torkan said the automobile manufacturing, in collaboration
with the oil ministry, registered a 16 percent growth in the last
Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
The official said last year that Iran's auto industry, by
securing 23 percent of the gross domestic products, is becoming
the number one industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said Iran manufactured 206,000 vehicles of
various types during the past Iranian year.

<HEADLINE> Obesity: Growing Problem For Chinese Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that obesity
is a growing problem among Chinese children, not the least of
which is a problem with disease.
</P>
<P>
Specialists have found that obesity among children has grown 9
percent annually over the past decade, indicating that the number
of fat children will double in a decade. They also say that in
some poverty-stricken areas, the annual increase of obesity among
children is close to 30 percent, higher than in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The obesity is not caused by hormone injections, glandular
problems, or hereditary factors, but on increased nutrition and
insufficient exercise.
</P>
<P>
The domestic media have given a lot of coverage these days to
Deng Xuejian, the 11-year boy whose weight had hit 174 kilograms,
a world record, and who has lost over 60 kilograms thanks to a
combined acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, sports therapy,
and a strict diet regimen.
</P>
<P>
Specialists have pointed out that obesity among infants is
closely related to adult obesity and suggest that women should
prevent rapid weight increases during their first three months of
pregnancy and also recommend breast feeding, which can help them
to avoid over-feeding the child.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said he had never invited former President Milton Obote to come
back from his exiled life in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Museveni has made it clear that "he did not, could not and will
never invite Obote," said a press release issued Friday morning by
the President' s Office.
</P>
<P>
It said that Obote, who ruled Uganda in 1960s and 1980s
respectively, is somebody who made a lot of mistakes in history.
He abrogated the 1962 Constitution in 1966, broke up the Uganda
National Liberation Front in 1980 and people working under him
killed a lot of people in Luwero while he failed to stop it.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said that President Museveni had invited Obote
to come back from exile and that he would be forgiven when back in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Obote has been accusing Museveni as a dictator and vowed not to
come back unless Museveni steps down.

<HEADLINE> S. African Teachers Open Fire on Students, Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shooting took place at Zithokozise High School on the South
Coast.
</P>
<P>
The victims, all male and aged 19, were part of a group of
students who came under fire from their principal and a teacher
following an altercation between students and staff.
</P>
<P>
The dispute stems from an excursion to Umzinto Wednesday for
which students each had to pay 10 rand (1.6 U.S. dollars) for
transport.
</P>
<P>
The students were unhappy about the cost of the trip, since
public transport to Umzinto costs only eight rand (1.3 dollars)
for a return trip. Their demand for a refund culminated in their
stoning the teachers, who took cover in a staff room.
</P>
<P>
The principal and a teacher then emerged from their hiding
place, brandishing pistols, the paper said. Several shots were
fired and four of the students were left sprawled on the ground,
one dead and three seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
The shooters were arrested and charged with murder and
attempted murder.

Minister Edith Nawakwi as saying that the process to privatize the
two state firms began sometime back through a decision in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
But she refused to give further details and referred all
queries to the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA).
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi announced in January in this year's budget that a key
feature of the privatization program in 1999 would be the new
government policy guidelines on private sector participation in
strategic areas of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the government intends to offer a minority
share holding of 20 percent in Zamtel to a private strategic
partner.
</P>
<P>
The government also intends to float some shares of ZNCB on the
Lusaka Stock Exchange as part of a comprehensive policy to divest
its shareholding in the bank.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 280 state enterprises in the working portfolio of
the ZPA, 223 companies had been privatized by the end of 1998,
this program will continue over the duration of the country's
medium term economic program, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Gold Demand Up in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Gold demand in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) rose by 5 percent to 26.6 tons in the first
quarter this year from 25.3 tons in the same period last year, the
Khaleej Times daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the UAE compensated for a fall in demand in
Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar by 0.2 ton, 0.1 ton and 0.7 ton
respectively, a press release from the World Gold Council (WGC)
said.
</P>
<P>
The release said gold demand in Saudi Arabia declined to 63.1
tons in the first quater from 70.1 tons in the same quater last
year. Oman registered a 0.2 ton growth.
</P>
<P>
In the opening quarter this year, the world's total demand for
gold reaches 788 tons, a rise of 62 percent over the same period,
just a fraction lower than the record for first quarter demand set
in 1997 and just 2 percent below the all-time record for any
three-month period set in the fourth quarter 1998, said the
release.
</P>
<P>
According to D.V. Pathy, WGC manager in Gulf region, demand in
the UAE was stimulated by a combination of factors, including the
"Dubai City of Gold" promotion, the prevailing bargain price and
the wide range of product offerings in gold.
</P>
<P>
He said that in some Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia,
gold demand was hit by a decline in economic activities following
the oil price fall.
</P>
<P>
Lower number of visitors to Saudi Arabia also contributed
to the decline in demand for gold in this kingdom, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Sends City Slum Dwellers Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
started sending the many urban slum dwellers back to their home
villages under a humanitarian aid program, newspapers here
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Krishi Bank is sponsoring the scheme, which was
started on Thursday and under which collateral-free credits,
ranging from 5,000 taka (103.1 U.S. dollars) to 150,000 taka
(3,092.8 dollars), will be given to the rootless people who intend
to return to their abandoned homesteads and start life anew on
their own.
</P>
<P>
Under a pilot project in the first phase of the program, 1,000
people will be rehabilitated to their respective villages with
loans for making a livelihood. And based on the success of the
pilot project, the government will take a five-year scheme.
</P>
<P>
Launching the back-to-village program, Prime Minister Sheik
Hasina handed certificates and cheques for loans to a first batch
of 125 slum residents.
</P>
<P>
"We want to ensure a better life for every poor person of the
country. We want to rescue them from this sub-human life," said
Hasina.
</P>
<P>
"I'll also go back to my village home after completing my job,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said her objective was to revive the village
economy and upgrade the lifestyle of the rural masses. "I am
working to ensure a square meal, home and a better life for all,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Krishi Bank, which initially has earmarked 25
million taka (515,460 dollars) for rehabilitating the city slum
dwellers to their villages, shows that about 90 percent of the
city slum dwellers want to return to their homesteads if they can
get facilities for resettling.
</P>
<P>
In Dhaka, there are about 3 million slum dwellers -- nearly
one-third of the total city population -- who have once deserted
their villages out of distress, according to Mayor Md. Hanif.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Achieve Record Cereal Harvest in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will harvest a record 22.5
million tons of rice and wheat in 1998-99, despite the century's
worst flooding that ravaged the country last year and the severe
drought this year, the Ministry of Agriculture said.
</P>
<P>
The production of rice will reach 20.5 million tons in the
fiscal year 1998-99 while the farmers have already gathered two
million tons of wheat.
</P>
<P>
The total acreage of cultivable land in the country is 12.5
million hectares, of which 3.43 million hectares were planted to
rice during the fiscal year, The Bangladesh Observer newspaper
Friday quoted a source from the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government has estimated the shortfall of foodgrains at
about 4.3 million tons after the worst flooding the country
experienced in a century last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the government met the shortfall by importing 3.5-4.0
million tons under the private sector and one million tons through
the public sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government has initiated a number of ambitious
schemes to recover the foodgrains shortage through cereal
production of rice and wheat, which included extended irrigation
facilities, sanction of agricultural loans and other inputs to the
farmers like the use of high breed seeds.
</P>
<P>
The country's annual needs of foodgrains is 21 million tons,
leaving a net surplus of 500,000 tons of foodgrains during the
current fiscal year after the earmarked one million tons as seeds.
</P>
<P>
The expected bumper harvest is mainly attributed to the
uninterrupted supply of power to the diesel-run irrigation pumps
and the favorable climate although the country experienced this
century's worst flooding and the severest drought in 50 years
during the current fiscal year, the source said.

BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A recent spot check by the State
Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision (SBQTS) indicates that
the quality of 79.2 percent of China's disposable syringes are up
to national standards.
</P>
<P>
The sample survey of 44 syringe producers in 15 provinces and
municipalities including Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shandong, Hubei,
Sichuan, Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin shows that 38 out of 48
products tested are qualified.
</P>
<P>
All the blood-transfusion syringes tested were found to be up
to standard, and 77.3 percent of the infusion syringes are of good
quality, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
An official of the SBQTS said that China's syringe producers
are paying more attention to the safety of their products.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that there are still some major
problems with the infusion syringes.
</P>
<P>
He said that related departments will further strengthen their
supervision of enterprises whose products fail to meet standards.

Production from the plant would largely substitute for
engineering plastics that GE Plastics had been importing and
marketing in Thailand.

<P>
In Thailand, the market for engineering plastics is estimated

main customers being the computer industry, office equipment
makers, the electronics industry and others including the
automotive industry.

<HEADLINE> Thai Pensioners Risk Poverty: ADB Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Unless Thailand's pension system is
overhauled, many retirees will run short of cash, said a report by
the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which is available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, members of pension funds receive
monthly payments amounting to between 20 percent and 30 percent of
their salary at the time of retirement. The payments are not
increased in line with inflation.
</P>
<P>
The percentage was obviously not enough to ensure an adequate
quality of life, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The ideal monthly payments should equal between 60 percent and
70 percent of the pensioner's final salary, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The ADB report is expected to lead to improvements, including
the setting up of a center directly responsible for the welfare
system.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 900 pension funds operate in Thailand, with
the total funds of 145 billion baht (3.97 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
State enterprise employees and civil servants benefit from
government contributions, while other funds require contributions
by employers and employees.
</P>
<P>
While the current system of state pension subsidies helps
workers employed in industry and services, farmers remain poor and
miss out, the report said.
</P>
<P>
To correct the imbalance, the report suggests a phased
reduction of state contributions matched by increased welfare
benefits for the poor, particularly farmers.

<HEADLINE> New Terracotta Warrior Find at Qin Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A well-preserved and brightly colored
terracotta warrior was brought to light recently at the tomb of
China's first emperor, Qin Shihuang, in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The warrior was found in a kneeling position in the second pit
of the Qin Shihuang Tomb which contains a large underground
terracotta army buried as his guard in the netherworld. .
</P>
<P>
The warrior is posed gracefully, with delicate features that
make him seem lost in thought. His body armor is bright red, and
the left hand is extended across his chest at a 90 degree angle.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have described this new discovery as "the most
exquisite warrior ever found at the Qin Shihuang Tomb."
</P>
<P>
Most of the 8,000 warriors and horses from the tomb of Qin
Shihuang, the first man to unify China, have lost their color as
they are highly sensitive to temperature changes and suffered
further from drying out when they were excavated from the damp
earth.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Chinese and German scientists developed a method to
prevent the color of the terracotta warriors in the tomb of
Emperor Qin Shihuang from eroding.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.S. Rate Rise May Not Burn Asian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Asian currency and stock markets
have remained relatively calm in the past two days despite a
possible interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve, as the
move is unlikely to have a grave adverse impact on the recovering
economies in Asia.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to leave U.S.
interest rates unchanged, but warned that it stood ready to raise
them should inflationary pressures build.
</P>
<P>
A rise in U.S. interest rates will impact heavily on financial
markets in the world, as the higher rates will encourage investors
to move out of developing countries and shift to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
But in the past two days, the Asian markets have remained
relatively calm. The Japanese yen has fallen to its seven month
low against the U.S. dollar, putting pressures on regional
currencies, but the Singapore dollar, the Thai Baht, the
Indonesian Rupiah and the Philippine peso dipped only slightly.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean won, strengthened by an improving outlook for
the country's economy and expectations of further foreign
investment, posted gains against the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
Asia's stock markets have not seen big tumbles either on
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that a statement or decision by the U.S.
Federal Reserve not long ago would have sent a shiver through
Asia's financial markets, but this time Asian markets are a
different picture of calm compared with the turmoil in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
What has led to such a change in the financial markets in Asia?
</P>
<P>
In the past when regional currencies were fixed, Asia was more
of a slave to changes in U.S. interest rates because of the need
to maintain currency levels, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
But now, most Asian currencies are not pegged to the U.S.
dollar and higher U.S. interest rates will not presage the end of
Asia's rate cutting cycles, they said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they said, Asian banks now have more deposits than
they have people to lend to, and therefore Asia's interest rates
will come off regardless of higher U.S. rates.
</P>
<P>
Another factor which provides a cushion for Asian economies is
their current account surplus. In 1997, Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea had a combined current
account deficit of 26 billion U.S. dollars. But it turned into a
surplus of 68 billion dollars last year, mainly due to weak import
demand in these countries.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank estimated recently that Southeast
Asian countries could continue to see a surplus of 4.4 percent of
their gross domestic product (GDP) in 1999 after their current
account moved to a surplus of 5.2 percent of GDP in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Those surpluses mean that U.S. dollars are pouring into central
bank coffers of Asian countries, boosting foreign exchange
reserves and keeping the pressure off interest rates in Asia,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth quarter of last year, Asian countries have
been cutting their interest rates to stimulate an economic
recovery. In some crisis-hit countries like the Philippines and
South Korea, interest rates have been lowered near the pre-crisis
level.
</P>
<P>
As higher U.S. interest rates are unlikely to have a great
impact on their rate-cutting cycles, central banks in Asia could
continue to lower interest rates when necessary to speed up the
recovery process.
</P>
<P>
"As long as current accounts remain in surplus and inflation
low, there is no reason for regional economies to follow U.S.
short-term rates upwards," said Pauline Gately, an equity
strategist with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, when the U.S. Federal Reserve raises its interest
rates, Asian economies may not be burnt as some people worried
about.

the U.S.-led NATO's recent "barbaric acts of invasion of

"If an organization illegally gains the benefits by bullying a

Charter, international laws and international conventions by
unjustly using their manpower, regional power, financial or

unholy alliance or an evil group," it said.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Internet Goes Beyond Marketing Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A survey released on Thursday
indicates that electronic commerce not only allows firms to reach
the broadest possible audience, it also provides better customer
service and cost efficiency.
</P>
<P>
According to the new poll of 1,400 chief financial officers (
CFOs) in U.S. firms, the Internet has been regarded as a tool for
expanding a company's market reach, as well as a medium to improve
customer service.
</P>
<P>
The survey was developed by RHI Management Resources, North
America's largest consulting firm. The CFOs were asked to identify
the greatest benefits for customers by providing e-commerce in
their business over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
While one-in-three CFOs said they looked to e-commerce to
expand their client base, one-fifth believe that value-added
service to customers will be the primary benefit. Seventeen
percent of them cited reduced operational costs as the chief
advantage.
</P>
<P>
Faster service or product delivery was also cited by 13 percent
of the CFOs surveyed.
</P>
<P>
The consulting firm said that electronic commerce enables
businesses to meet ever-increasing client expectations for easier
access to product information, accelerated ordering and
fulfillment, and more competitive pricing.
</P>
<P>
Web-based business-to-business transactions can also result in
significant savings, particularly within a company's purchasing
department, the firm said. Handling orders via e-commerce can
promote better inventory control and enhanced cash flow.

CHENGDU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Investors from 14 countries and

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Election Committee Issues List of Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Election Committee
(PPI) issued a permanent list of 11,583 legislative candidates on
Thursday night after it was delayed for one day.
</P>
<P>
PPI Chairman Jacob Tobing said the legislative candidate list
had been signed by the 48 political parties contesting the June 7
polls and approved by the PPI on Wednesday, Antara news agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 38 military representatives in the House of Representatives
are not included in the list, as legislators from the Indonesian
Military will be appointed.
</P>
<P>
It was not until Thursday that the announcement was made
because it took a long time to process the input data on the
legislative candidates, Jacob said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,064 legislative candidates failed a scrutiny, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the General Election Commission (KPU) has
distributed 80 percent of the 430 million ballot papers to be used
in the June 7 polls to all district-level election committees.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to complete the sending of the ballot papers in the
next one or two days," head of the KPU's subcommission on
communication Darwis Gafar said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the KPU had wanted to complete the sending of the
ballot papers on May 15 but there had been a delay in the printing
house and the transportation.

<HEADLINE> Number of People Leaving Indonesia Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of people leaving
Indonesia from Soekarno Hatta International Airport in Jakarta has
increased in recent weeks, The Indonesian Observer Friday quoted
airport official as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The people are leaving the country amid fears that unrest could
erupt during the ongoing general election campaign, it said.
</P>
<P>
Airport head Arifin Razak has confirmed there has been a sharp
increase in the number of people taking domestic and international
flights from Soekarno Hatta Airport.
</P>
<P>
About 350,000 people went abroad from the airport in April and
the figure is likely to reach 400,000 this month.
</P>
<P>
From May 1-20, more than 300,000 people flew out of Indonesia
from Soekarno Hatta Airport.
</P>
<P>
The main destinations are Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia,
Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and countries in western Europe, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Indonesia's national flag carrier
Garuda has been particularly busy, and now has 79,000 ticket
holders waiting for flights to European countries, 77,000 to
Australia, and 50,000 to Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The country's 128 million eligible voters will elect 462
candidates to the 500-seat House of Representatives (parliament)
on June 7. The remaining 38 seats are reserved for the Armed
Forces which do not vote.
</P>
<P>
Violence frequently occurred in previous elections held under
the strictly controlled New Order regime of former president
Soeharto. In the most recent election in 1997, police estimated
more than 200 people were killed in sporadic clashes and
election-related traffic accidents nationwide.
</P>
<P>
There are fears that unrest at election rallies this year will
be worse than ever, because as many as 48 parties are contesting
the polls.

<HEADLINE> Revenues From Web Development, Software to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Revenues from worldwide Web
authoring and design software are expected to rise to over one
billion U.S. dollars by the middle of 2002, according to a report
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As more and more people create Internet and Intranet sites, the
market for tools to create them is boosting, said report by a U.S.
market research firm, the International Data Corporation (IDC).
The growth in this market can be attributed to the large number of
small and medium-sized businesses that have recently come online
because of the leaps in ease of use.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the worldwide revenues rose 144 percent from 1977 to
reach 243 million dollars, said the IDC. The United States
accounted for 58 percent of the total worldwide Web market with
the revenues of 140 million dollars and growth in the U.S. market
will peak in 1999. By 2001, the international market will be
larger, it added.
</P>
<P>
Web authoring software is a Web site development system that
allows Web pages to be visually created like a desktop publishing
program. The IDC said that Web authoring design tools have
improved in two major areas: sophistication, which pleases the
high-end Web design firm, and in ease of use.
</P>
<P>
In another report released Wednesday, the IDC said that the Web-
to-host browser market worldwide is moving full steam, with
revenues increasing 370 percent to 112.4 million dollars in 1998
and expected to reach one billion dollars by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The IDC splits the Web-to-host market into Internet, Extranet
and Intranet. Currently, most sales occur in the Intranet market.
In 1998, this segment accounted for almost 70 percent of revenues.
The IDC expects the Internet segment, which accounted for less
than five percent in 1998, to account for more than a third of
sales by 2003.

<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is emerging from its
year-long recession with at least one percent gross national
product (GNP) growth seen in the three months to March, the
Philippine Star newspaper said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla was quoted as

<P>
Imports of raw materials have resumed growth after more than a
year of decline, he said. The services sector "is still strong."

<HEADLINE> 99th Birthday Celebration For Zhang Xueliang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 people gathered
Thursday at the former residence of Marshal Zhang Xueliang in
Shenyang, the capital of China's Liaoning Province, to celebrate
Zhang's 99th birthday, which is on June 4.
</P>
<P>
Zhang actually lives in Hawaii, after having spent decades
under house arrest in Taiwan under the Kuomintang government.
Zhang was known as the "Young Marshal". He was born in 1901 in
Haicheng in Liaoning, the son of the "Old Marshal" Zhang Zuolin, a
warlord in northeastern China from the 1911 Revolution until his
death from a Japanese Kwantung Army bomb in 1928.
</P>
<P>
The younger Zhang and General Yang Hucheng arrested the
Kuomintang (KMT) leader Chiang Kai-shek in the Xi'an Incident on
December 12, 1936 to try to force him to end the civil war in
China and to coordinate resistance with the Chinese Communist
forces against the Japanese. Chiang was released unharmed after
negotiations in which Zhou Enlai played a vital role and was
himself imprisoned by the KMT leader.
</P>
<P>
Today's celebration was held by 16 organizations and included a
show of items related to Zhang's life and three exhibitions on
some of his favorite hobbies: painting, calligraphy, Peking Opera,
and orchids. He asked a friend to bring back 13 pots of rare
orchids to Shenyang for his last birthday.
</P>
<P>
A traditional Chinese painting entitled "Spring" from the China
Tongze Institute of Calligraphy and Painting and a 2-meter scroll
of facial changes in the Peking Opera from the Liaoning Provincial
Arts School will be sent to Zhang's present home later.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ruling Golkar Urges Action on Soeharto Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian ruling Golkar Party
leader Akbar Tanjung has again urged Attorney General Andi
Muhammad Ghalib to follow up on a news story carried by the U.S.
Time magazine on the alleged wealth of former president Soeharto
and his family abroad.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after addressing a Golkar campaign rally
on Thursday in Jambi, capital of Jambi province, he said the news
report by the world's best-selling magazine was based on a
four-month investigation and appeared to be worth acting on.
</P>
<P>
In its latest weekly issue, Time reported that the Soeharto
family amassed a 15 billion U.S. dollars fortune during his 32
years of rule.
</P>
<P>
Akbar said the Attorney General's Office should therefore make
a serious effort to probe the wealth which the Soeharto family had
accumulated during the former strongman's 32 years of rule.
</P>
<P>
He said that after reading the Time report he was surprised and
could hardly believe the Soeharto family's wealth reached 15
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"If the story is true, it means Soeharto's and his family's
wealth equals half the state budget," he was quoted by Antara News
Agency Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Akbar noted that Attorney General Ghalib had responded to
Golkar's appeal by setting up a special team to follow up on the
report.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib Wednesday said his office will set up a legal team to
ask for confirmation from Time's Jakarta representatives about the
report.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his statement that Soeharto has no wealth
stashed overseas.
</P>
<P>
"He has nothing. There are (assets) of his children. Therefore,
don't confuse his wealth with the assets of his children," Ghalib
said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that lawyers of Soeharto Wednesday issued a
warning letter to the Time magazine, saying they were ready to
file a suit, based on either the civil or criminal code.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Kaligis said the team gives Time until May 24 to supply
them with supporting legal evidence concerning a report in the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto asserted in a recent private television interview that
he did not own a single cent in foreign banks and he challenged
the government and the general public to trace whatever wealth he
possessed overseas.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Rice Agency on Cooperation With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI) said Friday that China is an essential
partner in the efforts to improve the well-being of present and
future generations of rice farmers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The IRRI, founded in 1960 as part of the Consultative Group on
International Agriculture Research, said Chinese scientists have
had many important roles in promoting international cooperation in
rice research.
</P>
<P>
One of the first activities between China and the IRRI was a
shuttle breeding program between the institute and the China
National Rice Research Institute, the IRRI said in a report.
</P>
<P>
This led to the release of four rice varieties, the institute
said.
</P>
<P>
China and the IRRI had conducted basic research on hybrid rice
during their first decade of collaboration, it said.
</P>
<P>
Training programs and visits involving Chinese scientists are
another component of the Chinese-IRRI collaboration.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, a total of 591 Chinese scientists have participated
in the IRRI's training program, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the China-IRRI Liaison Office in
Beijing in November 1997, relations between the IRRI and Chinese
rice scientists were further strengthened, it said.

<HEADLINE> East China Province To Do Away With White Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province, one
of the country's economic powerhouses, will eliminate white
pollution, a big headache caused by discarded plastic packing
materials, by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to a massive plan announced recently by the
provincial government, Jiangsu will accomplish the goal by three
steps, with the Yangtze River, Taihu Lake and major railways doing
away with the pollution by October.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life have been mobilized to join in
the effort to clear away plastic waste along highways, railways,
rivers, and in scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
Railway stations in the cities of Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang
and Changzhou have banned the use of plastic-foam food containers
since the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen enterprises have been engaged in the production
of food containers using straw or paper as the raw material.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that Jiangsu annually has more than 200,000 tons
of waste plastic packing materials.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the country produces more than six million tons of
plastic products and discards one million tons as waste every year.
</P>
<P>
Facing a serious pollution problem, China's large cities, such
as Dalian, Chongqing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, have all announced a
ban on the use of plastic bags or plastic-foam food containers.

Agitok Sangma and Tariq Anwar questioned Congress President Sonia
Gandhi's credentials to occupy the post of prime minister in India
in view of her Italian origin.
</P>
<P>
"The three are expelled from the primary membership of the
party for six years," Mukherjee said, adding it was an
overwhelming majority decision of the CWC, the decision-making
body of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in the absence of Sonia Gandhi, who
resigned on Monday, and the rebelled leaders, who refused to
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted by the meeting said the CWC met on May 15
and the issue was raised whether the country's constitution should
be amended to the effect that only Indian born citizens could hold
the post of the president, vice-president and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
On May 17, the resolution said, the CWC discussed a letter the
three wrote to Sonia Gandhi and rejected the inclusion in the
party's election manifesto the suggestion for a constitution
amendment. Their note of dissent was recorded in the minutes of
the CWC meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, despite being senior Congress leaders, these
three members of the CWC did not show any respect to the majority
decision of the CWC and publicly stated that they will agitate on
the issue of amending the constitution as they desire," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
It said the CWC, before taking disciplinary action against the
three, wanted to give them an opportunity to place their views
before it.
</P>
<P>
In his fax message to the CWC, Sangma indicated that he would
be available in the meeting and the notice of the meeting was duly
communicated by the CWC to all the three members through letters,
fax and telephonic information.
</P>
<P>
However, the resolution added, "non of them considered it
necessary to attend the meeting of the CWC and explain their
position."
</P>
<P>
A large number of Congress leaders and workers considered that
the act of the rebel leaders by raising the issue of constitution
amendment only helped the BJP and its allies to carry on their
"slanderous and malicious" propaganda against Sonia Gandhi,
according to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Hearing the news of Sonia Gandhi's resignation from the
Congress president's post, the rank and file of the party
converged in Delhi from different parts of the country, demanding
stern action against the three.
</P>
<P>
Chief ministers in the Congress-ruled states of Madhya Pradesh,
Rajasthan, Orissa and Delhi, the CWC members and a large number of
party leaders and secretaries tendered their resignations to Sonia
Gandhi in a bid to convince her to withdraw her resignation.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi, who did not indicate any reconsideration of her
decision following the move of the three leaders, canceled all
public engagements Friday except a visit to her husband's tomb to
mark his death anniversary.

<HEADLINE> China Unveils New Policies to Spur Medical Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Labor and
Social Security unveiled new policies Thursday in a bid to spur
the ongoing medicare reform.
</P>
<P>
Three regulations, which cover all urban employees subject to
the government-financed medicare service, lay down specific rules
on medical institutions, pharmacies and medicine prescriptions
where the costs are borne by the government, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Those covered by the medicare insurance system can sign
contracts with three to five medical institutions to obtain
medical treatment," the newspaper quoted the regulations as saying.
</P>
<P>
The contracts will last one year, and the employees covered by
the scheme are allowed to switch to other hospitals if they find
the service they received at the contracted hospitals is not
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Patients are encouraged to use community hospitals for minor
ailments, as the diagnosis and treatment of these illnesses are
more expensive at higher-level hospitals than community hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Along with the new regulations, a list has been made public,
which defined the type of prescribed medicines whose cost will be
reimbursed by the state to the patient. The production and import
of such medicines should be approved by the State pharmaceutical
supervisory departments, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Nutrition supplements, medicines made from animal products or
animal organs, and alcoholic products made from traditional
Chinese medicine are excluded from the list.
</P>
<P>
Overall reform of the medicare system, launched early this year,
is scheduled to be concluded by the end of this year.

<P>
ALMA ATA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The population of Kazakhstan has
dropped by 7.7 percent from 1989 to under 15 million, according to
the latest census published by the Kazakh Statistics Agency on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decline is mainly a result of the emigration of ethnic
Russians after Kazakhstan declared independence in 1991 as well as
drops in the nation's birth rate, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The share of ethnic Kazakhs in the entire population went up by
13.4 percentage points to 53.4 percent because many of them
returned home from abroad after the independence, according to the
census conducted between March 25 and April 7.
</P>
<P>
The proportion between the male and the female is unbalanced
with the female accounting for 52.8 percent of the population.

BRUSSELS -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema Thursday
expressed his worry about decline of public opinion on the war
against Yugoslavia because NATO has killed a lot of civilians and
caused much damage to civil properties since it started the air
campaign in March 24.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana at
NATO headquarters here in Brussels, D'Alema told a press
conference that the Italian government believed "there should be
great care to avoid tragic errors, which would increase the sense
of uneasiness and misunderstanding in public opinion".(Italy-

<P>
The Dannish team, led by world number one Peter Gate
Christensen and defending world champion Peter Rasmussen,
dominated the courts and attracted home crowds applause once and
again in the Brondby Hall this evening.
</P>
<P>
At the last world championships in Glasgow, Scotland two years
ago, four Dannish players made their way into the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
The only three players which elbowed their way into the top
eight were Sun Jun of China, Fung Permadi of Chinese Taipei and H.
Hendrawan of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Top seeded Gade Christensen, who has been dominating the world
ranking for 12 months, had an easy way into the top eight, beating
Yong Hock Kin of Malaysia 15-9, 15-3.
</P>
<P>
And at the same time, Rasmusen, who beat Sun Jun in the final
in 1997, overplayed Chinese Chen Gang after three-set gruelling
match, winning his quarter-final berth at 3-15, 15-6, 17-15.
</P>
<P>
Other two Dannish players who repeated their fate this time
were Poul-Erik Hoyer Larsen and Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen. Larsen
defeated Malaysian veteran Rashid Sidek 17-14, 15-5 while Stuer-
Lauridsen edged Japanese player Kaita Masuda 17-14, 15-5.
</P>
<P>
The only Dannish new comer in the quarter-finals was Kenneth
Jonassen, who beat Budi Santoso of Indonesia 15-11, 10-15 and 15-5.
</P>
<P>
After three-day competitions, the mixed doubles have produced
top four with defending champions Liu Yong and Ge Fei favourites
to retain the crown.

<HEADLINE> Business Delegates Urge More Liberalization of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Before the G-8 summit scheduled for
June in Cologne, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)
Thursday called for a more liberal world trade system and an end
to trade wars between industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of the Paris-based organization presented German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder with a statement, saying a new round
of trade negotiations would give the world economy a positive
signal.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and the delegates agreed at their meeting it was an
urgent task to strengthen the world financial system, and campaign
against corruption must continue.
</P>
<P>
As a tradition, the ICC, a world business organization
including 137 members, sends a delegation to meet with the head of
the country which hosts G-7 or G-8 summit.
</P>
<P>
G-8 includes Russia and seven leading western industrial
countries (G-7): U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and
Japan. This year's G-8 summit is expected to be focused on the
reforms of world trade and finance system.
</P>
<P>
The next round of trade negotiations, which has been planned to
begin at November's World Trade Organization (WTO) minister
conference in Seattle, U.S., will help the world economy
recovering from the recent financial turbulence, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The ICC also demanded new multilateral trade regulations secure
long-termed direct investment in developing countries and swelling
markets.
</P>
<P>
"The new round must be based on a much broader conception of
market entrance, which means international regulations allowing
enterprises to compete with each other freely and equally," said
the delegation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Shuttlers Make Three in Top Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese women shuttlers
have advanced into the top eight after third round matches in the
women's singles of the World Badminton Championships here Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
After China's top favorite Ye Zhaoying crashed in the first
round, sixth seed Zhou Mi was ousted in the third round, seventh
seed Gong Zhicaho became the latest victim at the tournament,
losing to Hartono Kusumu Cindana of Indonesia 11-9, 4-11 and 11-6
on Thursday, making Dai Yun, Gong Ruina and Zhang Ning the only
three Chinese survivors in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Dai Yun, seeded fourth, managed to squeeze her way into the top
eight with a 11-7, 5-11 and 11-3 victory over Indonesian Lidya
Djaelawidjaya Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Chinese Taipei Open earlier this year almost
lost her concentration in the final set in which she was obviously
tired and tried to use her last gear for the match.
</P>
<P>
"I was too tired and felt pain in my right thigh," Dai Yun said
at the court side after the match.
</P>
<P>
Dai Yun had her right thigh injured in Wednesday's match. "I
could not play at the net in today's match because of the pain,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
Both Gong Ruina and Zhang Ning enjoyed smooth path en route to
the quarter-finals. Second seeded Gong Ruina, gold medal winner at
Swedish Open earlier this year and Brunei Grand Prix Finals last
year, beat Mette Pedersen of Denmark in straight sets at 11-3, 11-
5 and Zhang Ning, fifth seed, trounced Miho Tanaka of Japan 11-3,
11-5.
</P>
<P>
"We are a little bit disappointed that three women players have
not made the quarter-finals due to various reasons," said Chinese
team headcoach Li Yongbo. "But we still have big chance to win the
gold here."
</P>
<P>
In other matches of the day, Welsh shuttler Kelly Morgan, who
had an astonishing victory over defending champion Ye Zhaoying of
China in the first round, continued her winning pace on Thursday,
beating Ella Karachkova of Russia 11-6, 11-1 for a place in the
top eight.
</P>
<P>
"I have put my aim at top 16 before the tournament. Anything
further will be bonus for me," said the 23rd ranked player, who
will be 24 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Other quarter-finalists include Mette Sorensen, Camilla Martin
of Denmark, Lee Kyung Won of South Korea and Hartono Kusuma
Cindana of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The quarter-finals are slated for Friday evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Welsh promising shuttler Kelly
Morgan is making bonus for herself after she moved into the top
eight of the women's singles event at the World Badminton
Championships here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Games champion, who will be 24 on Saturday,
brushed aside Russian rival Ella Karachkova in straight sets at 11-
6, 11-1, setting up a showdown with Dannish Mette Sorensen in the
quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"Before the tournament, I have put my aim at top 16, and
everything further will be bonus for me," she said after the match.
</P>
<P>
Morgen, the best badminton player in Britain, has already put
her name in the book of badminton when she eliminated top seed Ye
Zhaoying of China in the first round, preventing the favourite
from becoming the first one to win world crown three times in a
row and making it the first time that a world champion had been
lost in the first round.
</P>
<P>
With the victory over Ye, Morgen found back much confidence. "
After the draw was made, I thought I might have little chance to
reach my aim," said the Welsh girl, who was in awe of Ye Zhaoying.
"But now, I think it is a lucky one for me."
</P>
<P>
For the Welsh girl, victory over Ye Zhaoying and reaching the
last sixteen have been a very tasteful birthday cake for her, and
every step further would just put icing on the cake.
</P>
<P>
"Keep winning will be the best birthday prize for me," she
added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook called here on Thursday for preparations for a Balkan force
to ensure the safe return of Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Cook made the call prior to his meeting with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
"We have to prepare so that we are ready to take advantage of
that success and take the refugees home. As the (U.S.)president
said, no option is off the table and that planning goes ahead," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cook told reporters outside the British embassy here that there
was no strain between Washington and London over the deployment of
ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"There are no closer allies within the (NATO) alliance than
Britain and the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We agree totally on the objectives. We are totally behind the
campaign and today we will be working out how we take that
campaign forward and how we make sure that we do secure that
objective... of the refugees going back under our protection,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
It was vital now to "build on the success of the air campaign,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said earlier on Thursday that the
air campaign in Yugoslavia is working and did not talk about the
ground troops issue. He said on Tuesday that no option is off the
table relating to Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Daley Expects More Monthly Record of Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government officials
and economists said record trade deficits are likely to continue
as long as the U.S. economy stays strong while Europe, Asia and
the rest of the world remain weak.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary William Daley said Thursday he expects more
monthly record deficits and the total for all of 1999 was likely
to top last year's record of 170 billion dollars deficit.
</P>
<P>
"I would imagine that it (the 1999 U.S. trade deficit) will be
a record and that next month's will probably be a record," Daley
said at a press conference after his department released the
March's record trade deficit of 19.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"To improve our trade balance, we will have to continue to
focus on improving economic conditions abroad and ensuring that
foreign markets are open to American firms," Daley said.
</P>
<P>
David Orr, chief economist at First Union, said in his analysis
of the data: "Until the pace of economic growth in the United
States slows and the rest of the world picks up, the deficit will
continue to grow. It is just that simple."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said today's trade figures showing
a decline in exports are worrisome for U.S. business and
illustrate the pressing need for the removal of trade barriers. It
said Clinton administration needs to remove self-imposed obstacles
to U.S. exports and pursue opening foreign markets.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved lower

rates in reaction to report on lower claims for unemployment
benefits last week.

Poor's 500 index fell 5.40 at 1,338.83. The technology heavy
Nasdaq index fell 35.17 at 2,542.23.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the number of Americans
filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 12,000 last
week to 299.000, renewing fears among investors that tight labor
market could prompt wage rise and push inflation higher.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve hinted Tuesday more signs of inflation
could prompt an increase in interest rates some time this year.
</P>
<P>
Reports on slightly lower manufacturing growth in April and
Dell Computer's disappointing earnings also dragged the market
lower.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 0.12 at 639.42. But American
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.67 to 792.03 and the
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.88 at 448.02.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Crisis Should be Solved Politically: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan stood
for a political solution to the Kosovo crisis on Thursday while
Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko expressed his reservation over
a political solution.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief paid a one-day visit to Albania Thursday, during
which he held talks with Majko and Albanian President Rexhep Meidani.
</P>
<P>
He told Majko that he was trying to find a political solution to
the Kosovo crisis. He said that he was hopeful of it although he had
not achieved it.
</P>
<P>
Once again, Annan emphasized that the United Nations had a leading
role to play in resolving the crisis and the U.N. Security Council
resolution should adopt a resolution.
</P>
<P>
All concerned parties had no disagreement on this point, Annan
said. What was important was that Yugoslavia should pull out its
troops from Kosovo to let an international force move into the
southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Annan, Majko said that the Albanian government
took a reservation over a political solution to the Kosovo crisis
and would not accept a halt to the NATO bombardment on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian prime minister said that there should be a loser in
the present war in Kosovo and that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic should be seen as a negotiator.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo crisis can only be resolved on the basis of the five
demands set by NATO, Majko said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who also visited refugee camps in Kukes, north Albania, said
that he hoped the refugees would be able to return home before the
Winter.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Vote Sends Missile Defense Bill to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Thursday approved
a bill for the establishment of an anti-missile national defense
system and sent it to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to sign the measure, which the Senate
modified to meet administration objections.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, passed 345-71, states that it is the policy of
the United States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible,
an effective system capable of defending U.S. territory against
limited ballistic missile attack.
</P>
<P>
It also states there will be continued negotiations with Russia
on arms reductions. Russia has opposed construction of a U.S.
missile defense system, saying it violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
The administration has said it will not decide until June 2000
on firm plans for an anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
Clinton vetoed similar legislation in 1995. He also opposed an
earlier House version passed March, saying it did not make clear
that the defense system would be limited and focused against
overseas threats.
</P>
<P>
The Senate changed the bill to reflect those concerns and the
House agreed to the revised version Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has budgeted 10.5 billion U.S.
dollars between 1999 and 2005 to develop a limited national
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
The system envisioned by both Congress and the White House is a
scaled-back version of the space-based Strategic Defense
Initiative, or "Star Wars" program, proposed by former President
Ronald Reagan in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Reagan's plan was aimed mainly at stopping an attack from the
former Soviet Union, while current research is designed more to
stop a limited attack from a rogue or terrorist state. It would
not be space-based.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said that the U.S. decision to set up the
anti-missile national defense system will aggravate the arms race,
thus affecting world peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Says Not Gain Support From NATO For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
admitted Thursday night that his meeting earlier with NATO leaders
in Brussels was probably unsuccessful in gaining support for his
plan for peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema, who met NATO Secretary General Javier Solana during
his four-hour visit to Alliance's headquarters Thursday morning,
said his hosts had nevertheless listened attentively to the
Italian position and judged it not out of line with the
alliance's.
</P>
<P>
"I know the Italian position isn't the official NATO one and I
don't think I convinced them. But they listened with respect," he
said.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's visit to Brussels was decided at the last minute and
aimed to smooth out misunderstandings over the Italian proposal to
halt NATO air-strikes when the United Nations Security Council was
ready to make the G8's conditions its own.
</P>
<P>
The Italian premier said earlier that he thought a 72-hour
pause would be sufficient to gauge whether Belgrade was ready to
accept the requests which at that point would be those of the
entire international community.

<HEADLINE> German Prosecutors Accuse Railway Company for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one year after Germany's worst
railway disaster, prosecutors on Thursday accused the country's
railway company, Deutsche Bahn AG, was guilty of negligence which
led to the train crash.
</P>
<P>
Some 101 people were killed and 119 injured on June 3, 1998,
when a high-speed train crashed at a speed of about 200 kilometers
per hour in the town of Eschede.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Juergen Wigger, quoting a study by the Fraunhofer
Institute, said the train crash should not have happened if
Deutsche Bahn had applied suitable testing methods to find worn
carriage wheels.
</P>
<P>
The study showed the crash was caused by a crack that led to a
wheel breaking as a result of metal fatigue, but Deutsche Bahn
failed to use tests which would have found the crack, even after
conductors had noticed irregular vibrations weeks before the
accident.
</P>
<P>
Material faults or manufactural errors were not the real reason
of the disaster as previously had been suspected, said the
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
German prosecutors have searched Deutsche Bahn's headquarters
in Frankfurt and seized documents, but criminal charges against
the company have not yet been filed, said Wigger.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bahn said it could not take the whole responsibility
at this stage of investigation, and it would reserve comments
until the company get a full text copy of the Fraunhofer study.
