<HEADLINE> Australian Councils Urged to Step Up Y2K Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government Tuesday urged local councils to renew their efforts in
dealing with the year 2000 computer bug or Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
A survey published in the latest Local Government National
Report showed that nearly one-third of the local councils surveyed
assessed the risk of the millennium bug to be moderate.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem means that, unless adjusted, computerized
systems could be disabled when their internal clocks tick over to
January 1, 2000, as the clocks only recognize years starting with
"19".
</P>
<P>
Local Government Minister Ian Macdonald said 30 percent of the
responding councils indicated that they were either fully prepared
or well advanced in preparations to deal with the bug.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than a quarter indicated that they were unsure
of their preparations, or only in the early stages of preparations
or had not started at all.
</P>
<P>
"All councils rely on computer-based date tracking systems for
payments, payrolls, customer reminders and other important
information, so this is a matter which requires close management
over the next 12 months," Macdonald said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Other areas which might be affected include building
management systems, security systems, environmental monitoring and
even water and sewerage systems.
</P>
<P>
"While we all look forward to the year 2000 with an air of
anticipation and excitement, many companies, public sector
authorities and councils still have some way to go to deal with
the looming problems of the year 2000 bug," he said.
</P>
<P>
Macdonald said local councils need to ensure they have a
strategy that implements solutions, tests systems and makes
allowances for contingencies to reduce the impact of Y2K-related
problems.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Implement Two Technical Programs for Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government will
implement two separate technical programs for Myanmar's Central
Forestry Development Training Center (CFDTC) and the Irrigation
Technology Center (ITC).
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the Japanese Embassy here
Tuesday, Japan, for the first program, will send two experts,
provide necessary equipment and training in Japan and third
countries, and share the costs of program activities from 1999 to
2000.
</P>
<P>
The CFDTC program, agreed upon by Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Forest Department of the Myanmar
Ministry of Forestry last December, aims to give aftercare to
Yangon division's Hmawby green area, built in 1988 with Japanese
aid.
</P>
<P>
For the second program for ITC, which will start in April this
year at Myanmar's Ngamoeik Dam project area in Hlegu, Bago and end
in 2004, Japan will send five experts to introduce and promote
water management technology during the five years, and provide
equipment and training in Japan, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has been in cooperation with the ITC
for 10 years to promote irrigation technology in Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Fischer: EU Must Reform Itself Before Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has to reform
its finances before taking in new members from the former East
Bloc, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said Tuesday on a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The EU itself must do its homework in order to complete
eastward expansion," Fischer emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He admitted it would be tough to achieve agreement on a
so-called Agenda 2000 -- reform of the Union's budget, farm
spending and aid to poorer regions.
</P>
<P>
As the current EU's rotating presidency, Germany has pledged to
adopt the Agenda 2000 deal among the bloc's 15 members by late
March, in order to reform the EU's policy of agriculture and
regional development aid.
</P>
<P>
Germany stressed that changing the way of the EU's disbursed
agriculture and regional development aid is a vital condition for
the admission of poorer and more agrarian East European states to
the EU.
</P>
<P>
Bonn is demanding a cut to its net annual contribution of 13
billion dollars to Brussels and has suggested individual EU
members begin picking up part of the farm subsidy bill which
devours nearly half of Union spending. This is fiercely opposed by
France which wants Brussels to remain the paymaster for Europe's
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Fischer denied Bonn had become cooler to enlargement under
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder as compared to ex-Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, and said there could be no doubting of Germany's resolve to
enlarge the EU.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. defense officials
reported a new incident in the no-fly zone over southern Iraq on
Tuesday, saying none of the U.S. warplanes involved in the
incident were lost.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, Major Joe LaMarca,
said further details are yet to be available as military experts
were still checking reports from the region.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said no U.S. aircraft were lost. Two F-15s
and two F-14s from the Navy were involved in the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
At least one air-to-air missile was fired at an Iraqi
aircraft in the no-fly zone, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zone was set up after the 1991 Gulf War. The
incident was the third of its kind since the United States and
Britain unleashed air strikes against Iraq last December.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes fired
air-to-air missiles at Iraqi aircraft Tuesday at about 2:30 EST
(0730 GMT) over the northern no-fly zone in Iraq, defense
officials said.
</P>
<P>
One of the officials said one of the Iraqi planes was believed
to have crashed, but apparently not by the U.S. missiles, after
running out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The American planes -- two Air Force F-15 strike aircraft and
two Navy F-14 fighters -- returned safely to the carrier Carl
Vinson where they took off for patrolling the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
David Leavy, spokesman for the White House National Security
Council, said Tuesday that President Bill Clinton had made it
clear the United States would enforce the no-fly zones vigorously.
"The Iraqi violations are at their own peril," he added.
</P>
<P>
The incident marked an escalation of tensions between Iraq and
the United States and Britain over enforcing the "no-fly" zones in
northern and southern Iraq. Iraq considers the restrictions
illegal.

won by German Joerg Hoffmann in 3:47.06.

<HEADLINE> Tax Collections Go Up in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Total tax collections
increased by 7 percent to 940 billion rupees (22.12 billion U.S.
dollars) in India during April-December 1998, an official press
release said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But indirect tax collections continued to decline with customs
duty year-on-year recording a negative 16 percent growth last
month, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The 7 percent growth registered in the first nine months of the
current fiscal year, which began on April 1, was mainly due to
buoyant direct tax collections which went up by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indirect tax collections grew by a mere 3 percent in the same
period mainly because of positive growth in excise duty
collections which increased by 10 percent last December as
compared to the same month of 1997.

WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan is
going to call President Bill Clinton at the White House on his way
home from six months of cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
He also plans to go to London when he leaves Washington, and
then back home to Jordan in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein has played a supporting role to Clinton at the
talks in Wye Plantation, Maryland, in October that produced an
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians over the Israeli
pullout of a further 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has decided
against a trip to Israel because of the suspension of the Wye
agreement. Instead, she sends senior adviser Dennis Ross there.
</P>
<P>
Ross is due to meet in New York this week with Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon and will then fly to Israel to speak to and
attend a meeting in Tel Aviv next week of the governing board of
the Peres Center for Peace.
</P>
<P>
James Rubin, spokesman for the State Department, Monday
dismissed an Israeli report that Albright had refused to meet with
Sharon because of the Israeli refusal to implement the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion that there's some problem between us and the
Israeli Foreign Ministry is simply incorrect," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't Announces Extra Cash to Fight Flu Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
Tuesday an extra 159 million pounds (267 million U.S. dollars) and
2,200 initiatives to help the National Health Service tackle the
latest flu outbreak in the country.
</P>
<P>
At least 45,000 people went down with the disease over the
Christmas period and hospitals have struggled to cope with
increased demand.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Frank Dobson revealed details of how the extra
money will be spent, including details of the thousands of
individual proposals from across the country on ways to tackle the
problem.
</P>
<P>
According to Dobson, the elderly and other at-risk groups are
at the heart of government proposals, with suggestions of more
help for emergency response teams and community nurses.
</P>
<P>
More money will be spent on educating people about how to avoid
becoming ill in the first place, while outpatient services like
night sitting will help prevent needless readmissions.
</P>
<P>
Dobson said, "Every winter brings extra pressures, but this
winter is proving even more challenging than ever."
</P>
<P>
"But extra money is not enough on its own. The extra money
needs to be matched by extra ingenuity and effort," he added.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Public Health Laboratory Service Simon Barber
said that in England and Wales an average of 80 cases of flu per
100,000 people per week were recorded up to 27 December.
</P>
<P>
"I would imagine there was a slight under-representation of
illnesses over the Christmas break, so it may well rise in the
next few weeks," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Calls on Eritrea to Accept OAU Peace Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin Tuesday called on the international community to put "meaningful and
effective pressure" on Eritrea to force its to accept the peace proposals
endorsed by the summit of Central Organ of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing organized for members of the diplomatic
community in Addis Ababa and foreign and local press Tuesday afternoon,
Seyoum said: " It is now almost eight months since the Eritrean aggression
against Ethiopia and since the forceful occupation of Ethiopian territory
by Eritrea."
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Foreign Minister reviewed peace efforts made by the OAU
and the international community since the border crisis between Ethiopia
and Eritrea took place in May last year and said "The diplomatic effort is
clearly stymied by Eritrean obduracy and intransigence."
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said, the OAU Central Organ Summit held in Ougadougou in mid
December " has placed its proposal on the table and has called for its
speedy implementation."
</P>
<P>
 He stated that "Ethiopia has accepted the proposal", noting that
Eritrea continues to talk about amendments to " the core issue which
demands its withdrawal from Ethiopian territory and the return of the
Ethiopian administration."
</P>
<P>
 He called on the international community to put meaningful and
effective pressure on Eritrea so that the OAU can succeed in its effort to
solve the Ethiopia-Eritrea crisis.
</P>
<P>
 The Central Organ of the OAU Mechansim for Conflict Prevention,
Management and Resolution held its fourth ordinary session at the level of
heads of state and government in Ouagadougou on December 18, 1998. The
Summit endorsed the proposals for a framework agreement, submitted by the
OAU high level delegation, for a peaceful settlement of the dispute between
Eritrean and Ethiopia. The 11-point proposals include immediate cessation
of hostilities, creation of conditions conducive to a comprehensive and
lasting settlement of the conflict, withdrawal of Eritrean troops from
Badme Town and its environs to positions they held before May 6, 1998,
redeployment of a group of military observers and demarcation of the border
between the two countries within six months.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Calls on Eritea to Accept OAU Peace Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin Tuesday called on the international community to put "meaningful and
effective pressure" on Eritrea to force its to accept the peace proposals
endorsed by the summit of Central Organ of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing organized for members of the diplomatic
community in Addis Ababa and foreign and local press Tuesday afternoon,
Seyoum said: " It is now almost eight months since the Eritrean aggression
against Ethiopia and since the forceful occupation of Ethiopian territory
by Eritrea."
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Foreign Minister reviewed peace efforts made by the OAU
and the international community since the border crisis between Ethiopia
and Eritrea took place in May last year and said "The diplomatic effort is
clearly stymied by Eritrean obduracy and intransigence."
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said, the OAU Central Organ Summit held in Ougadougou in mid
December " has placed its proposal on the table and has called for its
speedy implementation."
</P>
<P>
 He stated that "Ethiopia has accepted the proposal", noting that
Eritrea continues to talk about amendments to " the core issue which
demands its withdrawal from Ethiopian territory and the return of the
Ethiopian administration."
</P>
<P>
 He called on the international community to put meaningful and
effective pressure available on Eritrea so that the OAU could succeed in
its effort to solve the Ethiopian-Eritrean crisis.
</P>
<P>
 The Central Organ of the OAU Mechansim for Conflict Prevention,
Management and Resolution held its fourth ordinary session at the level of
heads of state and government in Ouagadougou on December 18, 1998. The
summit endorsed the proposals for a Framework agreement, submitted by the
OAU high level delegation, for a peaceful settlement of the dispute between
Eritrean and Ethiopia. The 11-point proposals include immediate cessation
of hostilities, creation of conditions conducive to a comprehensive and
lasting settlement of the conflict, withdrawal of Eritrean troops from
Badme Town and its environs to positions they held before May 6, 1998,
redeployment of a group of military observers, and demarcation of the
border between the two countries within six months.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Lifts Fish Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Health Ministry announced
Tuesday to Lift the ban on the consumption and processing of fish in
northern Mozambique's Cabo Delgado Province.  Though the province is still
plagued by cholera, the health authorities have not found any cases of food
poisoning related with fish in the past three weeks, the ministry said in a
statement said. It is reported that some fishermen in the areas used
insecticide in catching and processing fish, which resulted in deaths, and
serious illness in the areas since the latter half of 1998. The
government issued an order on December 2, banning the catching and
processing of fish in the province for 45 days. There has been no report
of fish poisoning ever since issuing the ban there, the statement said.
Dried fish in stock in the province can be sold and consumed after tests by
health authorities, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Rises in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. construction spending
rose 0.9 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 677.8 billion U.S. dollars, the Commerce Department said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the volatile series posted six
consecutive gains since 1993. And it was the largest increase
since July because of strong gains in housing and government
projects.
</P>
<P>
Low interest rates also have fueled robust construction, both
of new homes and commercial projects, and overall construction
spending in November was 8.8 percent higher than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In November, however, commercial spending edged down 0.1
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 174.6 billion U.S.
dollars, the first decline in four months. Sizable gains in
spending on offices and retail stores did not quite offset big
drops for hotels and motels and factories.
</P>
<P>
Spending on housing jumped 1.2 percent, propelled by a 1.8
percent advance in single-family homes.
</P>
<P>
Increases for schools and streets and highways helped push
government spending up by 2.1 percent in November, almost making
up for a 2.7 percent decline in October.
</P>
<P>
Separately, U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in December for
the seventh straight month as global economic problems continue to
hinder exports.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing Management said Monday
that its monthly index of business activity fell to 45.1 percent
last month, down from 46.8 percent in November.

ATHENS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis Tuesday called for a peaceful solution to the
crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with visiting Serb Deputy Prime Minister Ratko
Markovic, Kaklamanis expressed the grave concern of the prolonged
crisis in Kosovo, saying that the problem must be resolved through
peaceful means, chiefly on the initiative of the countries of the
region rather than powers outside the Balkans, according to the

</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Greek speaker stressed that the rights
for the ethnic minorities in Kosovo must be recognized within the
framework of respect for the present borders of Yugoslavia.

<P>
Greece's Deputy Foreign Minister Yiannos Kranidiotis also met
with Markovic, who briefed the Greek official on the latest

<HEADLINE> Footslogger Aims at World Record Stranded in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan footslogger named Lucio Dos
Santos who wants to set a world record by covering 54 African countries is
stranded in Chipata, about 500 kilometers east of Zambian capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos who arrived in Chipata before Christmas is stranded because
his Panasonic sate lite dish has been stolen, Zambia News Agency ZANA
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with ZANA Tuesday in the eastern city, Dos Santos said
the equipment was stolen from his hospital bed in Chipata General Hospital
where he was admitted to receive medical treatment for his legs that were
nearly paralyzed after walking long distances between Lusaka and Chipata.
</P>
<P>
The footslogger said the loss of the equipment was more of a worry to
him because he could not leave Chipata to continue his travel to Malawi as
the U.S. and South African governments as well as Table Network News (TNN),
Cable News Network (CNN) and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) were
monitoring his movement by using the equipment that was stolen.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the equipment belonged to the U.S. government and he was
supposed to hand it back on completion of his Africa tour, Dos Santos added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chipata police confirmed receiving a report on the lost
equipment and the U.S. Embassy in Lusaka had been informed about it through
the Angolan Embassy here, said ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos began his adventure Africa tour on January 2, 1994 from
South Africa and he has so far covered 50 countries and there are four
others such as Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa to be covered.
</P>
<P>
After arriving in South Africa, the Angolan traveller will fly to Las
Vegas in the U.S. for medical checkup.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos' African tour is sponsored by Nike, an American company
based in Las Vegas which specializes in sports equipment and by Translux, a
South African bus company.
</P>
<P>
According to his contract with the two sponsors, Dos Santos will give
20 percent of his money that he expects to receive at the end of his tour
to the poor in all the 54 countries he passes through.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, India Renew Transit Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India agreed here
Tuesday to renew the Treaty of Transit, which guarantees Nepal's
continued but easier access to the transit points and ports in
India for foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Minister for Commerce and Youth, Sports and Culture
Purna Bahadur Khadka and visiting Indian Minister of Commerce Ram
Krishna Hegde signed the letters of exchange in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The transit treaty was signed on December 6, 1991 for a period
of seven years. It was extended for one month before its expiry on
December 5, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to renew the treaty up to January 5, 2006,
and a provision for automatic renewal of the treaty for yet
another seven years has been made as requested by Nepal, the
Nepali Ministry of Commerce said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"With such a provision for automatic renewal, uncertainties and
apprehensions on the continuation of transit facilities at every
time of the expiry of the treaty have been removed," the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
India also agreed to Nepal's demand for reviewing every seven
years the operational modalities as contained in the protocol and
memorandum attached to the treaty, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that under the renewed treaty, the importers and
exporters have been given an option to use open trucks, marine
containers, container trucks or rail wagons for the transportation
of transit goods.
</P>
<P>
Only those transit goods which are specified as sensitive by
the Indian government with prior intimation to the Nepali
government shall be allowed transportation by marine containers,
container trucks or rail wagons, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The provision on the duty insurance has been made applicable
only to the specified sensitive goods both for imports and
exports," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, importers and exporters trading on the sensitive
goods have also been given the option of submitting bank guarantee
in place of the duty insurance requirements, it added.
</P>
<P>
Both governments have agreed through exchange of letters to
continue the present arrangements and operational modalities for
the transit routes of Radhikapur and Phulbari in India for the
movement of Nepal's transit trade to and through Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Under the renewed treaty, India also agrees to offer additional
leased area at the Calcutta port to Nepal, specify the shortest
road route connecting Calcutta with all the 15 border entry/exit
points and allow importers to submit the original copy of the
Customs Transit Declaration Form after cross border verification
to the concerned Indian border customs instead of the Calcutta
Customs.
</P>
<P>
Indian Commerce Minister Hegde said the renewed treaty would
help promote Nepal's trade with third countries.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that "both of us have to be careful with those
people who would like to create troubles like smuggling and
encouraging terrorists."
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India share a 1,750-kilometer-long border which is
open to each other.
</P>
<P>
As a landlocked country, Nepal depends largely on the transit
points and ports in India for foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> French, Spanish Oil Groups Discover New Oilfield in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The French oil group Total and its
partners Repsol of Spain and OMV have discovered a new oilfield in
the basin of Murzuk in southern Libya, said Total Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The oil reserve of the field is estimated at between 100 and
200 million barrels, said Repsol, which is the operator in the
field.
</P>
<P>
Primary tests showed that the quality of the oil, which is a
light kind, is very good, said the oil companies.
</P>
<P>
"The new discovery reinforces the stand of Total in the upper
area of Libya and confirms its interest in the basin of Murzuk,"
said Total in a communique.
</P>
<P>
Total, Repsol and OMV have been operating another oilfield in
the same basin since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield, called El Sharara, is producing 140,000 barrels
of crude oil per day and is expected to produce 200,000 this year.

<HEADLINE> economic Growth in Africa Slashed by Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Africa's steady economic growth over the
last three years has been slashed by almost half partly due to the east
Asian financial crisis, a newsletter of the Alliance for Africa's
Industrialization (AAI) has said.
</P>
<P>
The newsletter, Africa Industrial, said in its latest issue that Africa'
s
trade prospects have been worsened by this crisis due to the huge
devaluations of Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
"As it is, Africa's declining share of world trade is now below one
percent," said the newsletter which was released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newsletter said a major slowdown of Africa's economic growth or
gross domestic product (GDP) occurred last year when it fell to 3.2 percent
from a healthy 5.8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
For sub-Saharan Africa, it said, GDP growth declined from five percent
in 1996 to 3.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"More ominous is the drop in Africa's export earnings which will be
reduced significantly due to a persistent decline in world commodity prices
by a fifth," said the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
Exports of Africa's textiles, garments, cocoa, wood, rubber, palm oil,
vegetable oils and other products were also hit by more competitive
Asian products following the devaluation of Asian currencies in the wake of
the financial crisis, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said economic recovery of sub-Saharan Africa which started in 1994-
95 will be eroded.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, commodity prices are declining partly due to the Asian
crisis because of weak demand from Asian countries," it said. But, it said,
prices of raw materials and food and beverages may take a positive
turn this year.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investment in Africa is also adversely affected because
international capital has become more cautious, costly and difficult to
attract," it said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Denies Plot to Oust Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) - Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon Tuesday denied rumors that he is rallying support from Likud
members and seeking to oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Sharon is planning to break away from
Likud and to form a new party in a bid to enable the
right-wingers to win the elections, to be held in May.
</P>
<P>
The reports came after surveys showed that Netanyahu is
chasing after opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak by some 10
percentages in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Sharon will try to persuade Likud defectors
Dan Meridor and Benny Begin, who have separately announced their
candidacies for the premiership, and wavering cabinet ministers
Yitzhak Mordechai and Limor Livnat to join his new party.
</P>
<P>
Sharon denied any involvement in such reported conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed at a meeting of the Likud Central Committee last
month that he will not challenge Netanyahu for prime minister, but
several days later he said he would not rule out the possibility
of entering the race "under exceptional circumstances."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli parliament Monday gave its final approval to early
elections, slated for May 17.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Ministry officials told the Central Election
Committee Tuesday that there is no budget for the elections
since the parliament has failed to pass the national budget
for 1999 by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
This is the second consecutive year that the country entered a
new year without a budget. Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman
resigned last month, frustrated by the disarry in the coalition
which hindered the passage of the budget.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Resettle 20,000 Flood-Prone Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announces Tuesday that over
20,000 farmers living in flood-prone areas of the western Gambella Region
will be resettled in five years beginning this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Deputy head of the Gambella
Region, Gach Ress, said at a press conference held at Gambella Town, some

flood.
</P>
<P>
Gach told press that thousands of these residents have faced repeated
displacements due to irresistible flood occurences.
</P>
<P>
The places where the farmers are to be resettled will be conducive to
farming and are going to supplied with social and economic infrastructures,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Gambella Region is located at western part of the country,
bordering with the Sudan. The lowlands of the region is vulnerable to be
flooded during heavily rainfalls.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Deputy PM Pays Ice-breaking Visit to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister
Abdel Aziz Dekheel Al-Dekheel Tuesday paid a one-day ice-breaking
visit to Amman in a bid to end the eight-year strains in bilateral
ties following the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dekheel, also Kuwaiti Minister of State for Cabinet
Affairs, conveyed Jordanian Crown Prince and the Regent Hassan Ibn
Talal a letter from his Kuwaiti counterpart Saad Al-Abdullah
Al-Salem Al-Sabah on bilateral ties and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dekheel conveyed good wishes to Jordanian King Hussein, who
is expected to return home soon after cancer treatments in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
He also discussed with Hassan efforts to strengthen bilateral
cooperation and matters of regional concerns, reported the Radio
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Al-Dekheel appreciated Hassan's efforts in
urging Iraq to release more Kuwaiti prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
The Regent made the appeal at an emergency meeting on Iraq by
Arab parliamentarians in Amman on December 27, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dekheel was the highest-ranking Kuwaiti official to visit
Jordan since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait cut off its relations with Jordan as Jordan sided with
Iraq during the war.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Amman say Al-Dekheel's visit would help build up
the momentum of normalizing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah
Sunday invited his Jordanian counterpart Abdul Ilah al Khatib to visit
the Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
Such a visit would officially melt the ice in bilateral ties,
Sheikh Sabah was quoted as saying by Kuwaiti press.
</P>
<P>
The Marathon rapprochement process began in May 1995, when
Amman apparently distanced itself from Baghdad, and called for
political change in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Once Planned to Kill Karadzic: Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
once planned to assassinate the two key Bosnian Serb leaders,
Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, said a new book published this
week.
</P>
<P>
French journalist Gilles Delafon and American journalist Thomas
Sancton said in their book, "Dear Jacques, Cher Bill," that "a top
military officer of NATO" told them that Chirac raised the
possibility of killing Karadzic and Mladic during a meeting with
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Paris on December 14, 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the two authors said that the revelation was "partially
denied" by the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
They quoted an advisor of the French president as saying that
Chirac "would not want to assassinate someone supposed to go on
trial, but it is true that the idea was discussed by the secret
services" of France and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The two authors of the book also said that during a meeting
with Clinton, the then German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair in May 1997 in Paris, Chirac suggested
that Karadzic be captured by NATO forces deployed in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
They said that a plan to capture Karadzic, named "Operation
Amber Star," is sleeping "in a deep drawer of an advisor at the
Elysee palace."
</P>
<P>
The plan, which envisages the dispatch of a U.S. commando and a
French commando to capture Karadzic, is still valid, said the two
authors.
</P>
<P>
Delafon, who works for the weekly newspaper Le Journal de
Dimanche, and Sancton, who is Paris bureau chief of the Time
weekly, said they had access to the top officials in the Elysee
palace and the White House.

Clinton made the initiative in a statement, which also

</P>
<P>
A year ago, all cash transfers from U.S. residents to needy
Cubans were barred. In March, Clinton reinstated the remittances,
allowing Cuban-Americans to send up to 1,200 U.S. dollars a year
to relatives.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to ease that restriction further,
permitting any U.S. resident to send money to the island up to the
1,200 U.S. dollar annual limit.

<HEADLINE> Arms for NATO Forces in Macedonia Detained in N.Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Customs officials in Greece's
northern port of Thessaloniki have detained 18 containers with a
quantity of arms destined for the NATO multinational force being
deployed in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The customs officials took the action after they found the
cargo was not accompanied by the required shipping documents.
</P>
<P>
The containers with rifles and other light weaponry were loaded
onto a Honduras-flag merchant ship on New Year's Eve together with
other weaponry destined for the 2,000-strong multinational force
being deployed in Macedonia to protect international observers in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But a customs check revealed that the cargo was not accompanied
by the necessary shipping documents, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) quoted port authority sources as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The order to detain the containers was given by Thessaloniki
Prosecution Office Director Haralambos Vourliotis immediately
after being alerted by Greece's Merchant Marine Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The cargo was detained until the sender and recipient were
ascertained, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government and military have denied that it was a
case of weapons smuggling.
</P>
<P>
It would be very difficult, if not impossible, for someone to
try to smuggle weapons on a ship transporting weaponry to the
multinational force via the port of Thessaloniki which was now
full of NATO officials and where stringent checks were being
carried out, a Greek military source said.
</P>
<P>
Massive quantities of military equipment are currently being
shipped to Macedonia via Thessaloniki for the multinational force,
which is expected to be fully deployed by mid-January.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- About 80 African students blocked
the entrance to the residence of the Sierra Leonean ambassador to
Russia Tuesday evening, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
However, a duty officer in Ambassador Melrose B. Kai-Banya's
residence denied the report.
</P>
<P>
"There were no students blocking the residence," said Rhoderick
Bernard, reached by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said the blockade was triggered by the death of a
Sierra Leonean student Tuesday morning from cancer.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the protesting students accused the ambassador of
failing to perform her official duties as the embassy had refused
pleas for help from his fellow students four months before,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Several students also broke into the Sierra Leonean Embassy on
Rublyov Avenue, Interfax said, quoting local law enforcement
sources.
</P>
<P>
A duty officer in the embassy, reached by telephone, refused to
give any comment.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything," he said. "We're resting. Please call
tomorrow morning."

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Offer Soft Loan to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will offer Egypt
600 million U.S. dollars soft loan for the implementation of
projects in the coming 18 months, resident representative of the
bank Khaled Akram said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Akram told Egypt's Middle East News Agency that the country's
economic and political stability and growing international
confidence in its economy encouraged the bank to finance the
projects proposed by the Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started in 1991 economic reforms sponsored by the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, loosening control over
and privatizing state-run enterprises. Since then, Egypt's economy
has grown from 2 percent to more than 5 percent and inflation
fallen from 20 percent to under 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Egypt attracted about 2 billion dollars of foreign investment
in 1998 due to its sound investment environment. Many
multinational companies have been cooperating with the country in
its oil and gas fields and promising projects.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official said the bank will focus, in the coming
phase, on financing Egypt's infrastructure, health, education and
social projects.
</P>
<P>
Of the 600 million dollars, 100 million dollars will be used in
irrigation and drainage projects in some Delta governorates aimed
at improving agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has decided to offer 80 million dollars to
improve the infrastructure in southern Egypt and increase the
number of small projects in a bid to reduce unemployment and
promoting the standard of living there.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with Egypt's Ministry of Electricity, the bank
is to provide 20 million dollars to a project to generate
electricity with diesel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 300 million dollars will be offered to farmers for
the use of state-of-the-art technology in farming and improving
agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> Greek Fishermen to Continue Strike Against EU Directive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Greek fishermen decided Tuesday
to continue their strike in protest against a European Union (EU)
directive limiting fishing zone.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen are protesting against EU directive 1626 which
effectively reduces the distance from the coast in which fishing
is permitted and increases the mesh size of nets.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Panhellenic Union of Trawler Owners decided not
to go out fishing Tuesday and Thursday and to moor their boats in
protest along the Thessaloniki seafront, as they did Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen said that implementation of the measure would result
in a 50 percent reduction in fish catch because smaller-sized fish
would escape their nets, but the Turkish trawlers would continue
to catch those fish and channel them to the Greek market.
</P>
<P>
Trawler owners in Greece are seeking postponement of
implementation of the directive until May 31, when the fishing
season ends for trawlers, and immediate commencement of procedures
for its amendment or indefinite postponement.
</P>
<P>
The panhellenic Union of Trawler Owners numbers more than 190
members who own some 150 trawlers that supply all the fish markets
in Greece.

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian budget minister
said Tuesday that his country saw a record-low budgetary deficit
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 deficit was 1.3 percent of the country's gross
domestic product, as against the government's prediction of 1.7
percent from last February and against the previous record low of
1.4 percent posted in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Budget Minister Herman van Rompuy described the low budget as
the "best performance ever achieved by the country's budget."
</P>
<P>
He added that the favorable deficit would be able to help the
country to achieve an economic growth of 2 percent in the past
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
But Belgium was still up in the neck in debts. The country's
debt total as of December last year equaled to 116.5 percent of
its gross domestic product.

UNITED NATIONS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Tuesday said that it would commit itself to the
objective of the humanitarian program in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council was briefed on the
humanitarian situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Council President Celso Amorim of Brazil
said, "There was a general expression of commitment to the
objective of the humanitarian program and to the importance of
meeting the humanitarian meeds of Iraqi people among the council

The diplomats said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will make
formal response to Iraq's request by stressing that it is the
Untied Nations that decides the international humanitarian workers
in Iraq, and the council is expected to meet on Iraq during the
following days.
</P>

Iraq Monday officially asked the the United Nations to replace
one American and 13 British humanitarian workers in the country on
grounds that it could not guarantee their safety because of

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie, Iraq to Be Discussed Between S. Africa, Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Lockerbie impasse, trade, Iraq,
and African conflicts will be among issues discussed when British Prime
Minister Tony Blair visits South Africa this week, South African officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad told reporters that it was of great
importance that the impasse on the Lockerbie bombing be resolved as it was
creating a climate conducive to further terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of a Pan America airliner in 1988 over the Scottish town of
Lockerbie killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said South Africa welcomed a recent agreement by Britain and the
United States to hold the trial of two Libyan bombing suspects in The Hague,
 the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to get a briefing by the (British) prime minister on what they
perceive to be more outstanding problems so that we can, if necessary,
discuss this with the Libyan government.
</P>
<P>
"We will convey to them what the Libyans see as obstacles and I am sure
we will discuss what the British government sees as obstacles to having the
trial started," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said everything possible should be done to ensure that the
suspects were delivered to the Netherlands for trial as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Blair would reportedly ask South African President Nelson Mandela to
intervene personally on the matter when the two leaders meet.
</P>
<P>
Essop Pahad, deputy minister in the office of Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki, said that the United Kingdom-South African Bilateral Forum meeting,
due to take place Thursday, would serve to strengthen ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
An important aspect of the meeting would be the signing of a
declaration of intent on industrial cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other matters on the agenda included European Union-South African trade
negotiations, and the Commonwealth Conference due to be held in November
this year.
</P>
<P>
He announced that Britain's Queen Elizabeth II would attend the
conference and pay a state visit to South Africa at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said Britain was South Africa's largest investor, and welcomed an
announcement by Blair that Britain would invest 40 billion Rand (6.8
billion U.S. Dollars) in the country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are still discussing how the money would be invested.
</P>
<P>
The two countries were also expected to discuss the recent U.S. and
British bombings of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz Pahad said South Africa supported a United Nations resolution that
Iraq dismantle its weapons of mass destruction, but disagreed with the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
"Our own information convinces us that the bombing does not solve the
problem and does not serve the objectives of destruction of the Iraqi
weapons of destruction, and neither does it serve the stated objective of
removing Saddam (Hussein)."
</P>
<P>
The conflicts in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo were
also on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said South Africa would brief Blair on African efforts to end the
conflicts and seek international support for the continent's initiatives.

WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate will begin
impeachment trial proceedings against President Bill Clinton
Thursday, Majority Leader Trent Lott announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lott, a Republican lawmaker, said he had met earlier in the day
with Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle and Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, who will preside over the first presidential

</P>
<P>
Lott offered no other details of the trial, in which the Senate
will rule on two articles of impeachment the House of
Representatives approved on December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The articles allege that Clinton committed perjury and
obstructed justice in an attempt to cover up his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
"We have a constitutional duty here. It is a very serious one.
It is one we must carry forward," Lott said. "We will do our very
best to do this in a proper way."
</P>
<P>
Lott spoke for only a few moments, and took no questions from
reporters, leaving unclear precisely what events will occur
Thursday, and what the timetable will be for Clinton's trial.

CAIRO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait wishes the planned Arab
foreign ministers meeting a success, said Kuwaiti permanent
representative to the Arab League Abdel al-Kanei Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Arab League chief
Esmat Abdel-Meguid, Al-Kanei said that Kuwait is the first country
to express readiness to take part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is intended to discuss a call for an

against Iraq, had been slated for last Wednesday, but was put off
to January 24 for better consultations and coordination.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti diplomat said that he discussed with Abdel-Meguid

<P>
On the agenda of the meeting, Al-Kanei said participants will

In what the United States claimed as a retaliation for Iraq's
defiance of the United Nations weapons inspections, the U.S. and

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Violate Iraqi Air Space Again, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 5 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi military spokesman
said Tuesday U.S. warplanes again violated Iraqi airspace, Iraqi
News Agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said formations of U.S. warplanes flying
from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait violated Iraqi airspace in the
so-called no-fly zone over southern Iraq at 8:56 a.m. local time
(5:56 a.m. GMT).
</P>
<P>
He added that when Iraqi warplanes confronted them at 10:23
a.m. local time (7:23 a.m. GMT), the U.S. planes fled back to
their bases.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be the first time that Iraqi warplanes
confronted U.S. warplanes over the no-fly zone since its
imposition.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman confirmed all Iraqi warplanes returned to their
bases safely.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said earlier Tuesday that one Iraqi plane was
believed to have crashed, apparently after running out of fuel in
the confrontation with U.S. warplanes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain imposed no-fly zones over northern and
southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the minority Kurds in the north and Shiite Moslems in
the south from the Iraqi central government's oppression.
</P>
<P>
Iraq considers the no-fly zones illegal and has vowed recently
to fire at U.S.-British warplanes patrolling there.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of last month, Iraqi air-defense forces and
U.S.-British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones have exchanged
fire several times, leading to the deaths of five Iraqis and
injury of another nine.

In his administrative program, Posser pledged that his government will
adopt a policy of cutting government expenditure in a bid to revitalize the
economy of the tiny west African country.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minster pointed out that after an era of successive

establish the authority of the state.

He said that his government will commit itself to changing the abject
poverty in Sao Tome and Principe by attaching importance to the development
of agriculture and the exploration of off-shore oil.
</P>
<P>
The Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe-Social
Democratic Party (MLSTP-PSD) won 31 out of the 55 seats in parliament on

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S. of Lying on Dissidents Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Tuesday accused the
U.S. of spreading lies that Iraq had arrested Shiite Moslem
dissidents in southern Iraq and executed hundreds of them.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi spokesman for the Ministry of Information and Culture
was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying the allegations
were aimed at covering the U.S. failure in achieving the goals for
its latest aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubin said earlier
Tuesday that there had been reports of mass arrests in the Shiite
region of southern Iraq over the past six weeks in addition to
hundreds of executions of dissidents at two prisons.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that the U.S. was playing the game of
changing the subject, "a flagrant game which had been played by
(U.S. President Bill) Clinton himself when he ordered the attack
on Iraq to avert the world attention from his shameful scandal
and impeachment proceeding."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain raided Iraq on December 16-19 for four
consecutive nights in an operation code-named "Desert Fox."
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-British attacks killed hundreds of children, women and
elderly people, and by striking Iraq, the U.S. had separate itself
from the framework of the international legitimacy, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The White House bears hatred toward Iraq and by launching the
continuous aggressions on Iraq and imposing the unjust embargo,
the U.S. remains antagonistic to Iraqi people and its leadership,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, which touched off the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. officials have felt the bitterness of failure these
days, therefore they searched in their old notebooks for news and
information which they feel serve to disinform the international
public opinion," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution Closes Case Against Soldiers Charged With Treason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The prosecution Tuesday closed the six-
month-old case against 77 army soldiers who were charged with treason for
attempting to topple President Frederick Chiluba's elected government in a
military coup in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), Mukelebai Mukelebai, told trial
judge Japhet Banda in the Lusaka High Court that the prosecution has closed
its case after the 108th and last witness Tuesday testified in the court,
according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
The defense welcomed the announcement and stated that they will start
making submission within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
And they will Wednesday lodge an application in the Lusaka High Court
for the release of six unnamed suspects who so far have not been implicated
in the case by any of the 108 prosecution witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Judge Banda allowed the defense's request, adding that he will also fix
the dates for hearing of submissions for both parties Thursday, said ZANA.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution have intended to call over 170 witnesses and only 108
of them have so far testified in one of the most complicated trials in the
Zambian history.
</P>
<P>
The treason trial started last June and initially 77 soldiers and
four civilians including two opposition leaders and a senior cadre of the
ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) were on trial for allegedly
taking part in the short-lived military coup on October 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Kaunda, Zambian former president and leader of the country's
largest opposition party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP),
and his chief of security were charged with imprisonment of treason.
</P>
<P>
However, they were released as soon as the trial began after the state
entered a nolle prosequi, saying it was not "proper" to continue with the
case against them.
</P>
<P>
Dean Mung'omba, president of opposition Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC)
 and Nakatindi Wina, former chairperson of women affairs of the MMD and
parliament member, were charged with treason together with the 77 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Mung'omba and Nakatindi Wina who were detained for about one year were
also discharged last month after the state entered a nolle prosequi since
no witnesses testified against them in the court.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Lusaka High Court Monday ordered the state to
compensate the duo for wrongfully detaining them over treason charges,
arguing that there were no reasonable grounds for the state to have
commenced criminal proceedings against them.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Deputy PM Calls On Iraq to Free Pows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister
Abdel Aziz Dekheel Al-Dekheel Tuesday called on Iraq to fully
comply with U.N. resolutions and release all Kuwaiti Prisoners
of War (POW) detained since the 1990 Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Amman, Al-Dekheel said Kuwait will
continue to freeze its contacts with Iraq until Baghdad fully
comply with U.N. resolutions on Iraq adopted after the 1990 Gulf
Crisis, which was triggered by Iraq`s invasion of the Gulf
emirate.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Kuwait respects territorial integrity of Iraq
and supports humanitarian aid to the Iraqi people by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has been blaming Iraq for keeping hundreds of Kuwaiti
nationals and POWs in detention after the Gulf War ended in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dekheel, also Kuwaiti Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs,
is in Amman for a one-day visit, which was aimed at ending the
eight-year strains in Kuwaiti-Jordanian relations.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Jordan were severed after the Gulf
war during which Jordan sided with Iraq together with a few other
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
As to the reopening of Jordanian embassy in Kuwait, he said
that the proposed visit by Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah
AL Hatib to Kuwait will help normalize relations between the two
countries, declining to give exact date of event.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Al-Dekheel met Jordanian Crown Prince and
the Regent Hassan Ibn Talal, and conveyed him a letter from his
Kuwaiti counterpart Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah on
bilateral relations and regional developments.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dekheel, the highest ranking Kuwaiti official to visit Amman
since 1990, also had discussions with Hassan on efforts to
strengthen bilateral cooperation and matters of regional concern.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Amman believed that Al-Dekheel`s visit to Amman
would help build up the momentum of normalizing bilateral ties
despite some opposition from the Kuwaiti public and parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Marathon rapprochement process between Kuwait and Jordan
started in May 1995, when Amman apparently distanced itself from
Baghdad, and called for political changes in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Enhance Solid Mineral Industry in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Finance Minister Alhaji Usman said
here Tuesday that his government would allocate more funds to solid mineral
industry in a bid to diversify government revenue in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The minister said at a press briefing on the breakdown of the 1999
budget
that substantial allocation has been made in the budget for the airborne
geophysical survey of the country's solid mineral deposits to boost their
exploration and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Funds have also been allocated for the procurement of three drilling
rigs and laboratory equipment in order to speed up sample drillings at
identified mineral deposit sites which would be carried out across the west
African country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Usman pointed out that the Nigerian Mining Corporation had been provided
with adequate funds for further exploration of minerals such as barytes,
kaolin, feldspar, talc, rock salt and gold.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the Nigerian mineral appraisal and monetization
program project, currently at some 65 percent completion, will be pursued
vigorously this year, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of facilities in the various coal mines, the minister
said, will continue this year to prepare coal deposits for private
investment.
</P>
<P>
In his budget broadcast last Friday, Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar said that "If proper attention is given to the solid
minerals sector, it is capable of generating substantial revenue and
employment to supplement those derivable from the oil and non-oil sectors."
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Nigerian government approved the new Solid Mineral Policy,
and revised laws and regulations to make the sector competitive while
generous incentives were provided for prospective investors.
</P>
<P>
On the briefing occasion, Usman also noted that the Nigerian government
had accorded priority to projects termed "vital" to the successful
implementation of the transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture received high priority in 1998 as a step toward achieving
self-sufficiency in food production, the minister said ,adding that the
tempo would be sustained this year.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis will be on the production of seeds and seedlings, soil
conservation, animal traction, tractors and agricultural equipment
rehabilitation as well as poverty alleviation projects, he stressed.

WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate will begin
impeachment trial proceedings against President Bill Clinton
Thursday, Majority Leader Trent Lott announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lott, a Republican lawmaker, said he had met earlier in the day
with Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle and Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, who will preside over the first presidential
impeachment trial in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
Lott offered no other details of the trial, in which the Senate
will rule on two articles of impeachment the House of
Representatives approved on December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The articles allege that Clinton committed perjury and
obstructed justice in an attempt to cover up his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
"We have a constitutional duty here. It is a very serious one.
It is one we must carry forward," Lott said. "We will do our very
best to do this in a proper way."
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that every senator is consulted and the
House and the White House feel this process is fair to them," Lott
said, adding that despite pressures to conclude a trial quickly,
"it has to be done not only expeditiously but fairly."
</P>
<P>
Lott spoke for only a few moments, and took no questions from
reporters, leaving unclear precisely what events will occur on
Thursday, and what the timetable will be for Clinton's trial.
</P>
<P>
The new 106th Congress is scheduled to convene Wednesday, and
the impeachment trial in the Senate -- the first of a president
since Andrew Johnson in 1868 -- towers over the agenda. A
two-thirds majority would be needed to remove Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lott has been struggling to find a formula for a trial, but has
been buffeted with criticism from some Republicans who opposed a
proceeding that was likely to end after only a few days.

<HEADLINE> Greek-Cypriot Joint Defense Pact Still </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Government Spokesman
Christos Stylianides Monday dismissed press suggestions that the
joint defense pact Cyprus has agreed on with Greece is null and
void.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said the Joint Defense Pact, signed in 1993 between
Greece and Cyprus, still stands and efforts to upgrade it will
continue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the decision not to deploy the Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in Cyprus was taken having considered
the overriding national interests of Cyprus and Greece.
</P>
<P>
"When the decision was taken, we took into account Cyprus'
accession course to the European Union, Athens' goal to join the
European Monetary Union and to avoid isolation of Hellenism from
the international community," Stylianides told his daily press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
President Glafcos Clerides announced on December 29, 1998, that
the S-300 missiles, ordered in 1997 for Cyprus' air defense, will
not be deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said a strong European Greece is a precondition
to help Cyprus on vital issues that concerning the island.
</P>
<P>
"What we have to bear in mind as an important consideration is
that Hellenism has the political will to defend Cypriot
Hellenism," he added.
</P>
<P>
The decision not to deploy the missiles has come under strong
criticism both in Cyprus and in Greece and forced two ministers of
Cyprus' Socialist EDEK party to resign.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into two parts since 1974, when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says no Back Down from Enforcing No-Fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that it would not back down from enforcing no-fly zones
in Iraq in spite of a clash between U.S. and Iraqi warplanes.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to enforce the no-fly zones," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters. "It's an important part
of our containment policy."
</P>
<P>
Lockhart's comment came after U.S. warplanes fired air-to-air
missiles at Iraqi aircraft earlier on Tuesday over the southern
no-fly zone in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Defense Department officials said one of the Iraqi planes was
believed to have crashed, but apparently not by the U.S.
missiles, after running out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The American planes -- two Air Force F-15 strike aircraft and
two Navy F-14 fighters -- returned safely to the carrier Carl
Vinson where they took off for patrolling the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The clash marked an escalation of tensions between Iraq and
the United States and Britain over enforcing the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the no-fly zones were designed to limit Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's ability to threaten his neighbors and
repress his people.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain airstruck Iraqi defense and
security installments in mid-December in an effort to reduce its
capability to develop weapons of mass destructions and
equipments that carry them.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S.-British bombing of Iraq, there have been three
clashes taking place between the United States and Iraq. Iraq
claimed any patrol by Western warplanes would been seen as
violation of its air sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Saddam was probably testing U.S. resolve on the
no-fly zones out of frustration at his isolated position.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Peace Process Uncertain After Back on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1998 witnesses
two dramatic changes in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
First, Israeli and Palestinian leaders signed a long
overdue land-for-peace agreement at the White House on October 23,
putting the peace process back on track after a 19-month stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, and more dramatically, the fragile right-wing
coalition of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu quickly
crumbled over the peace deal and the Knesset (parliament) decided
by an overwhelming vote to hold early elections, resulting in a
new stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the upcoming election would further delay
the implementation of the latest interim accord and help reshape
the whole peace process. No one can predict exactly at this
moment in what direction the process will move.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the interim accord, namely, the Wye River
Memorandum, is a result of the pragmatic strategy adopted by
Netanyahu and a greater mediating role played by Washington this
year.
</P>
<P>
Ideologically, Netanyahu might sympathize with those far
right-wingers who oppose the peacemaking with the Palestinians.
But politically, many people believe, he is a pragmatist who
realizes that his future lies in the peace process, which is
supported by more than three-fourths of the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
For the last two and a half years, Netanyahu has been torn
between his desire to get an agreement with the Palestinians and
the equally strong desire to retain the support of his right-wing
voters. He had done all he could to avoid making a choice, till he
could no longer find an excuse to play.
</P>
<P>
On its part, Washington tightened its screw on Netanyahu this
year because it had been painfully aware that the stalemate in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process has eroded American influence
across the Middle East, a point driven home by the lack of Arab
support in its standoffs with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It put forward its own bridging proposal on the further Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank in January, sent its Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross to shuttle between Israeli and Palestinian sides
frequently, and pushed them into direct negotiations which broke
down early last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, top U.S. leaders held several separate or joint
talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and issued sporadic
warnings to Netanyahu that Washington would reconsider its
mediating role if he refused to accept its proposal.
</P>
<P>
And in an unusual move in U.S. diplomatic history, President
Bill Clinton "locked" the two sides at the rustic and secluded
Wye Plantation for nine days in October and devoted scores of his
own time to the talks till an agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
American officials later disclosed that although Netanyahu
had rebuffed U.S. ultimatums one after another, pressure from
Washington was in fact essential to dislodging the defiant prime
minister from a position of endless maneuvering short of a deal.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the peace accord has for a moment restored the
mutual-trust between Israel and the Palestinians, re-ignited the
enthusiasm among the two peoples for the peace process, and raised
hopes that the frozen Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese talks
would also be resumed.
</P>
<P>
However, the trust, enthusiasm and hopes quickly evaporated
after the two sides were locked into a series of disputes over the
implementation of the agreement. One of the most serious disputes,
the one over the release of Palestinian prisoners, sparked weeks
of bloody clashes in occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
And the peace process was stalled again as Netanyahu put the
agreement on hold in a futile attempt to save his cracking
government from falling apart. He charged the Palestinians of
failure to fulfill their obligations to fight terrorism, and set
new conditions for continuing the deal despite opposition from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
In fact, ever since he signed on the Wye River Memorandum,
Netanyahu has been caught between his hard-line coalition partners
rejecting the peace process and the center-left opposition who
wants to move it forward.
</P>
<P>
His government has been clinging to power only by a 61-59
majority in the 120-seat Knesset, since former foreign minister
David Levy resigned over disputes on the national budget in
January and all five Knesset members from his Gesher party quitted
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
By skillful maneuvering, Netanyahu has succeeded in pulling
together the brittle coalition in various crises. But after he
crossed a fateful political threshold at Wye, his coalition was
thrown into irreparable disarray.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than half of his ministers voted for the agreement when
it was approved in the cabinet, and it was only due to the support
of the opposition bloc that the accord was ratified by the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
After his attempt to broaden the coalition by bringing back
Levy and the Gesher Party failed and his call for a national unity
government with the Labor Party was rejected,
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had no way to go but early elections.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Reports on Transferring Islands to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Grigory Karasin on Wednesday denied as "unfounded" Japanese
newspaper reports on a possible interim agreement on transferring
two South Kuril islands to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Karasin, who is in charge of drafting a peace treaty with
Japan, said such reports "are aimed at disrupting public
opinion," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Japanese mass media recently reported that Tokyo is
considering the possibility of concluding an interim agreement
with Moscow on the transfer of two of the four disputed South
Kuril islands to Japan and continuing talks on the territorial
status of the remaining two islands.
</P>
<P>
The four islands, known as the Northern Territories in Japan,
have stalled relations between Moscow and Tokyo for decades.
</P>
<P>
The long island chain was given to Japan in 1875 by Russia in
exchange for the northern half of Sakhalin Island. During the
Second World War, Russia retook the islands from Japan along with
the southern half of Sakhalin.
</P>
<P>
In 1951, Japan relinquished all claims to the islands but
later reversed its stance on the southern Kurils, stating that
these islands had always been Japanese possessions.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the governments of the two countries restarted
discussions over territorial sovereignty and fishing rights in
order to find a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
At a regular press conference Wednesday, Russian Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin also denied the Japanese
reports as "sheer fabrication."
</P>
<P>
Moscow is guided by the "need to find a mutually-acceptable
solution to the territorial problem without affecting the two
countries' state interests, political positions and dignity,"
Rakhmanin said.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects U.S. Demand Over Nuclear Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- India Wednesday rejected the
demand of the United States for it to spell out in concrete terms
its requirements for minimum nuclear deterrence, asserting that
there could be "no fixity" on it.
</P>
<P>
"This is entirely a matter of top secret assessment of the
country after taking into account possible threat perceptions," an
External Affairs Ministry spokesman said here.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Press Trust of India (PTI) Tuesday,
the U.S. ambassador to India Richard F. Celeste asked India to
specify in "concrete terms" its requirements of nuclear deterrence
so that it is not seen as an "open-ended threat" to its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy also asked New Delhi to spell out how many
missile systems and warheads India needed to have such a
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
"In a fluctuating environment," the Indian spokesman said, "how
can you have a fixity? How can you determine the numbers or
range?"
</P>
<P>
He said India had made its position clear that in a situation
where there was no control over proliferation, nuclear deterrence
could not be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Informed circles here expressed their surprise over the revival
of the U.S. demand on the eve of a scheduled new round of talks
here later this month between the two sides on nuclear-related
issues.
</P>
<P>
Indian Minister of State for External Affairs Vasundhara Raje
also said on Wednesday that India had a "transparent" nuclear
policy and he ruled out any further clarification on it.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with PTI, Celeste said India's nuclear tests
last May "marked a kind of punctuation point" in relations between
Washington and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"Some expression of what India really wants and needs and
strives to achieve in a reasonably specific time, not specific in
numbers, but a range, is important to not only help the U.S.
understand but also specific neighbors to understand....So that
there isn't an open-ended threat," Celeste said.

<TEXT>
<P>
There was no problem in the budget, facilities and
preparations as a whole and things had been going on as
scheduled, said Ronnie Wong, secretary of the Hong Kong Amateur
Swimming Association and chairman of the championships' organizing
 committee.
</P>
<P>
Following an earlier promise of financial backing from the
Hong Kong Sports Development Board and the Hong Kong Tourist
Association, the world championships have now obtained a title
sponsor -- the China Travel Service (Holdings) HK Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Wong said more than 500 swimmers and 230 officials from 61
countries and regions had already been entered for the April 1-4
event in the Hong Kong Coliseum, Kowloon. This year's could be
the largest ever short-course world championships, Wong said,
compared with a field of some 700 swimmers at the Gothenburg,
Sweden championships four years ago.
</P>
<P>
A 25-meter portable pool, similar to the ones used in the two
previous world championships, will be installed in the fully
air-conditioned arena and a warm-up pool is scheduled to be
installed in March this year outside this largest sporting
facility in Hong Kong with some 8,500 seats.
</P>
<P>
Semi-finals for 50- and 100-meter events are to be added to
the competition schedule for the first time, according to a
revised program proved by the International Amateur Swimming
Federation (FINA), the sport's world governing body.
</P>
<P>
And Hong Kong will host the 13th FINA World Sports Medicine
Congress on April 5-7, immediately after the championships, Wong
said.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to act according to the principle of economics,
but we will do everything we can to make the event a success,"
Wong added.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman Denies UNHRC Envoy Entering Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi Wednesday denied a report on the
dispatch of an envoy of the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC)
to probe a chian of murders in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran does not allow any individual or
group to interfere in its domestic affairs, Asefi was quoted by
the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian morning daily reported on Wednesday that an
Iranian woman representing the UNHRC had arrived in Tehran to
collect information on the recent spate of mysterious killings.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the government institutions in charge of
following up the crimes are strong enough to identify and arrest
those involved in the killings.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Intelligence Ministry announced on Tuesday night that
some of its agents were involved in the recent killings of
an opposition leader and several dissident writers.
</P>
<P>
Darious Forouhar, secretary general of the Iran Nation Party,
and his wife were stabbed to death at home in November and
three other Iranian dissident writers were also mysteriously
slain in Tehran in December.
</P>
<P>
Following the murders, the UNHRC planned to dispatch a
fact-finding team to Iran, but the proposal was rejected by
the Iranian authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, the morning daily Zan (Women) reported on Wednesday
that Elaheh Sharifpour, an Iranian woman in the UNHRC said
that she would come to Iran within two weeks to probe into
the killings.
</P>
<P>
But it is not clear whether Sharifpour will insist on coming
to Iran following the admittance of the Iranian Intelligence
Ministry about the involvement of its agents in the killings.

economic recovery and maintain Hong Kong's position as a leading
business center in the world.

Tsang said the government has also introduced two specific
programs to ensure Hong ong remains alert to and on top of
competitive challenges.
</P>
<P>
These programs include the Services Promotion Program and the
Helping Business program.

<P>
The former looks systematically and comprehensively at the

community needs to take to ensure Hong Kong remains the premier
services center in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The letter reviews ways the government can help the business
sector by cutting red tape, reducing cost of compliance,
identifying activities for transfer to the private sector, and
introducing new and improved services in support of the business
community. The overall objective is to ensure that Hong Kong
remains the best place in the world for business.

<TEXT>
<P>

offensives, during which they seized major towns like Makeni and
Lunsar, and are reportedly in control over the northern half of the
country.

In an attempt to seize Freetown, the rebels have captured Port Loko and
other towns on the outskirts, though Port Loko was later retaken by the
peace-keepers.

In the last few days, ECOMOG warplanes and artillery had been bombing
rebel positions on the hills overlooking Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The rebels launched an attack on Hastings on the east outskirts Monday
and had overrun it to reach the eastern city gate before they were beaten
back by the ECOMOG.

<HEADLINE> Two Million Ethiopians Need Food Aid in 1999: WFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) said
Wednesday that some two million people in Ethiopia need 181,871 tons of
food aid in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held at the United Nations Conference
Center here, WFP Country Director, Judith Lewis, noted that over 40 percent
of Ethiopia's farm households are food insecure, and they do not produce
enough food and income to meet their household's basic nutritional
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Lewis said that of the total relief food aid needs for 1999, 35 percent
are required for the Amhara region, 33 percent for the Oromia region and 20
percent for the Tigray region, adding that the balance is required for the
rural districts of Jijiga and Harar towns and for the displaced in Addis
Ababa, with a contingency of 5 percent which may be used in pastoral or
other regions as needed.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the relief food aid of 181,871 tons for 1999 does
not include relief food needs for Ethiopians displaced by the Ethio-Eritrea
border conflict nor relief needs for pastoral areas.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Ethiopia estimates that 67,652 tons of relief food
aid is needed for almost 400,000 displaced people and for Ethiopians
expelled from Eritrea," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, the WFP Country Director said taking into consideration that
carry over pledges and stocks of relief food aid from 1998 into 1999 amount
to some 60,539 tons, the net relief food aid requirement for 1999 are
estimated to be 121,332 tons.
</P>
<P>
The press conference followed a month-long food needs assessment by the
FAO-WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission to Ethiopia last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the mission, Ethiopia is expected to harvest 11.69 million
tons of crops in 1998/99, 36 percent increase from 1997/98's poor harvest,
but slightly less than the record 11.79 million tons of 1996/97.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India to Finalize Power Deal This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani delegation is
expected to visit New Delhi this month to finalize the proposed
sale of 2,000 megawatt of electricity to India, a senior official
from the Ministry of Water and Power disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India signed an agreement on power purchase during
their first round of talks held in Islamabad in October, 1998 and
agreed in principle to finalize its modalities in the second round
of talks, previously scheduled to be held in New Delhi in
December, 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the second round did not take place as scheduled as
Pakistan had not completed its proposals in this regard, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
"Now officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have informed
the Indian authorities about the new schedule of the talks," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani delegation will start its visit after receiving
the new schedule of India and the two sides will finalize affairs
relating to the rate of power, guarantee and transmission line
during the visit, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in October last year, Pakistan will
export 2,000 megawatt of power to India in different phases with
500 megawatt to be supplied in the first phase, starting from the
year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Firms Turn Eyes on Beyond-Region Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Singapore firms have turned
their eyes to places beyond the region to look for new
opportunities and new markets, local TV Wednesday quoted the
country's top trade executive as saying.
</P>
<P>
Barry Desker, chief executive officer of Singapore's Trade
Development Board (TDB), made the assessment in an interview with
A.M Singapore. But he gave no exact figures.
</P>
<P>
Desker said companies have the regional crisis to thank for
their new venture into unknown markets.
</P>
<P>
"I think what is happening is that as easy opportunities in the
region have declined, our companies have begun to look for markets
beyond the region," Desker was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have for example seafood traders who have found excellent
opportunities in markets like Eastern Africa, Bangladesh, India,
which they never explored previously," he said.
</P>
<P>
Desker said the TDB will focus on developing Singapore as a
leading trade exhibition hub and as a shipping and logistics
center.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that marketing services will also be developed in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The TDB plays a key role in charting the course for Singapore's
trade.
</P>
<P>
Export is Singapore's key locomotive of economic growth.
Singapore's principal markets for export include the U.S.,
Malaysia, Japan, Hong Kong, Britain and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
As one of its measures to tide over the current economic
recession, the Singapore government is making efforts to help
local companies explore and penetrate new markets to offset the
fall in regional demand.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Airport is One of World's Finest: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
Wednesday hailed the Hong Kong International Airport as one of
the finest in the world and one in which all Hong Kong people can
take pride.
</P>
<P>
During a two-hour tour of the new airport, Tung inspected both
cargo operations and passenger services and was shown various
improvements since its opening last July.
</P>
<P>
He said he was impressed by the smooth operation of airport
services and their high level of efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"I was happy to note that the airport was recently described
as one of the world's premier airports and was voted the annual
Critics' Choice Award by a leading international travel
magazine," he said.
</P>
<P>
While visiting the Super Terminal One cargo facility operated
by Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL), Tung was told
that the facility was now handling an average of 5,000 tons of
cargo a day. At the height of the peak period last year, a total
of 6,500 tons of cargo were handled in one day.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he was pleased to see the airport cargo systems
operating smoothly since HACTL resumed full services last August.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the departure level of the passenger terminal
building, Tung said he was extremely pleased to see that there
had been significant improvements in services and facilities
since his last visit here in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Airport Authority figures show that about 75 percent of
flights are departing on time or within 15 minutes of schedule.
Arriving passengers are waiting no longer than 15 minutes at
immigration counters and, on average, are able to reclaim baggage
within 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he was impressed by the fact that the airport
smoothly handled an average of around 100,000 passengers a day, a
record for the new airport, during the busy Christmas and New
Year period.
</P>
<P>
"This augurs very well for our busiest time of the year, which
is coming up shortly - Chinese New year," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay at the airport, Tung also visited retail ou
tlets, Airport Operations Control Center, the Baggage Sortation
Hall and the Security Screening Control Room.
</P>
<P>
Tung wrapped up his visit by meeting Airport Authority senior
management, and he encouraged them to keep up their good
performance.

<HEADLINE> Iran Needs to Repay 4.7 Billion Dollars in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran needs to repay 4.7 billion
U.S. dollars of its foreign debts in the new Iranian calendar year
to start March 21, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report from the Central Bank of Iran, IRNA said that
the country's total due debts in the current Iranian year was 3.76
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign debts, comprising short-term, medium-term and
long-term debts, stood at 11.9 billion dollars by the end of the
first half of this year, some 168 million dollars
less than that at the end of the past Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
The report put the total debts and foreign undertakings of the
country at 22.4 billion dollars by the end of the first half of
the current year, which also include probable undertakings and
future interests.
</P>
<P>
Iran's foreign debts dropped from 22.7 billion dollars in
March 1995 to 12.1 billion dollars in March 1998, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's oil incomes declined by half this year as a result of
oil price slump.
</P>
<P>
A report by Iranian Customs said recently that the country only
earned 2.1 billion dollars from non-oil exports during the first
nine months of the current year, a 11.3 percent drop from the same
period of the last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's imports during the period stood at 11.4
billion dollars, a 11 percent decrease from the corresponding
period last year.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Capital Has Fewer Road Accidents in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- About 4,630 road accidents were
recorded in Uganda's capital city of Kampala in the year 1998, a five
percent decrease from the previous year, a senior police officer told
Xinhua Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Xinhua Wednesday morning, Grace Turyagumanawe,
police commander in charge of traffic safety in Kampala Region, said: "
Accidents have decreased over the years.
They were 8,068 in 1995 and 5,566 in 1996. Pedestrians still suffer most in
all these cases."
</P>
<P>
In the year 1998, 318 people, most of them pedestrians, were killed in
road accidents and 2,577 injured, with altogether 6,537 vehicles involved.
</P>
<P>
Some 361 pedal cyclists were involved in accidents because there is no
bicycle lane on the roads, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the key causes of accidents, the police commander listed speeding,
 drunk driving, careless pedestrians as well as using forged driving
permits.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the police scrutinized 6,576 driving licenses and found that
6,332 were forged. The police authorities have taken effective measures
against use of forged driving permits over the years and as a result, road
accidents reduced dramatically.
</P>
<P>
Turyagumanawe, who was recently posted to police headquarters as an
assistant commissioner in charge of traffic and road safety, said that laws
must be put in place to deal with mobile phone usage while driving and
safety belt use to curb accidents.

<HEADLINE> Shahak Under Fire after Aiming at Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Former army chief Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak came under immediate fire Wednesday from both the
ruling Likud and the opposition Labor Party after he criticized
the two main parties while declaring his candidacy in the coming
elections.
</P>
<P>
Members of the two parties said Shahak did not provide
anything new when he kicked off his election campaign and made
public his platform at a nationally broadcast news conference in
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Likud officials also blamed him for launching a "personal
attack" against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and described
him as a leftist rather than a centrist he has claimed.
</P>
<P>
Firing his first shot, Shahak said Netanyahu has failed to
bring "peace with security" to Israel as he promised before being
elected as prime minister in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Today there is no peace, no security. The economic situation
is bad and the social situation is sad," the popular former chief
of staff said. "Netanyahu is dangerous to Israel, Netanyahu must
go."
</P>
<P>
As head of a new centrist party, Shahak said neither the Likud
nor the Labor can represent the Israeli public, adding that a new
leadership is needed for a country which is divided over social,
religious issues as well as peacemaking with Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging as a political novice, Shahak stressed
that he had been entrusted by slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
as a representative to negotiate peace with the Palestinians and
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian state can not be established until a permanent
agreement has been reached, he said, adding that a solution to
Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon can be found only through
negotiations with Damascus.
</P>
<P>
His party is expected to take votes away from all parties in
the elections set on May 17, but mainly from the Labor, which is
led by another former chief of staff Ehud Barak, also a protege
of Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Shahak has discussed coordination in the elections with Likud
defector Dan Meridor, who is also forming a centrist party, but
failed to reach agreement on who should be the head of a merged
list.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Indian Babies Threatened With Anemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Millions of babies born every
day in India were at the risk of deformity and other
life-threatening diseases even before their birth due to maternal
anemia, an Indian expert warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The risk arose as maternal anemia led to malsecretion of
several important hormones, said N. Kochupillai, head of
Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the All-India
Institute of Medical Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that this condition was hardly diagnosed or
treated in the country due to inadequate professional expertise
and lack of reliable and cost-effective testing methods, and most
of the testing kits had been imported.
</P>
<P>
According to Kochupillai, the disease could be prevented by
hormone replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the importance of hormone replacement therapy in
fighting several diseases, he said deficiency of thyroid hormone
at birth, which causes mental retardation in children, was 10-20
times higher in many parts of the country than in other countries.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
have appealed to the United Nations and international relief
agencies to provide humanitarian aid to the refugees who arrived
recently in Afghanistan from Iran.
</P>
<P>
The militia also urged the U.N. and international relief
agencies to exert pressure on Iran to stop "the forced expulsion"
of Afghan refugees, according to reports reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mulla Amir Khan, who is in charge of the Taliban's information
and cultural affairs, was quoted as saying that the refugees who
were forcibly expelled from Iran desperately need international
humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
He said the influx of the refugees is continuing and the
condition of them is "very deplorable."
</P>
<P>
Although the Taliban are trying their best to provide all
possible assistance to the refugees, they alone could not provide
them with adequate aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.N. and the relief agencies to pay immediate heed
to the problems of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban's Radio Shariat said that about 10,000
Afghan refugees had been forcibly expelled from Iran in the past
16 days.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Supreme Head of
State Tuanku Ja'afar said here Wednesday that the bilateral ties
in the political, economic, military and cultural fields between
Malaysia and China enjoyed rapid development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The ruling parties of the two countries have established ties,
people-to-people exchanges have been increasing steadily and
tourism between the two countries is also flourishing, the king
said during a farewell call by outgoing Chinese Ambassador Qian
Jinchang at the King's Palace here.
</P>
<P>
Tuanku Ja'afar said the economic and trade cooperation between
the two countries has bright prospects.
</P>
<P>
The past five years when Qian served here as the Chinese
ambassador was a period witnessing the great development of the
relations between Malaysia and China, he said, citing frequent
exchange of visits by the top leaders of the two countries,
including three visits by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
Malaysia and his own visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The king also noted the smooth development of the relations
between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and
China, and praised China for its role at the informal meeting

</P>
<P>
Tuanku Ja'afar said Malaysia and China are close neighbors and
the friendship between the two countries and the two peoples
should pass on from generation to generation, and that the
ASEAN-China relationship should also be further strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Designate Returns Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister designate
Yalim Erez announced here Tuesday that he had returned the mandate
for the formation of the 56th government to President Suleyman
Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Erez, the incumbent industry and trade minister, made the
announcement after a 30-minute-long talk with Demirel at the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Demirel had picked up Erez, an independent lawmaker, to form
the government late last December after the previous prime
minister designate and Democratic Left Party (DSP) leader Bulent
Ecevit failed to secure a majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Erez's decision to return the mandate came two days after the
True Path Party (DYP) leader Tansu Ciller lent a sudden support
for a proposal of a DSP minority government led by Ecevit, a
U-turn stance from last December, when she opposed the proposal of
a coalition of DSP, DYP and the Motherland Party.
</P>
<P>
Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz and Ecevit had also called
on Erez to return his mandate to Demirel, showing that they were
satisfied with Ciller's support to the proposal of the DSP
minority government.
</P>
<P>
Erez resigned as industry and trade minister in an earlier
coalition between Ciller's DYP and pro-Islamic Welfare Party in
April 1997, two months after the military forces warned the
government to strictly act on the secular constitution.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) - A Palestinian man died in
hospital after being shot by Israeli soldiers Wednesday morning
in the West Bank town of Hebron, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the soldiers opened fire when the man did
not stop running toward them with what they said was something
like a weapon.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Palestinian sources as saying that the man
was mentally impaired. The suspected weapon turned out to be a
toy gun.
</P>
<P>
This fatal shooting took place two days after unknown gunmen
wounded three Jewish settlers, one of them seriously, when they
were on their way to work in the divided town.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has sealed the town and imposed a curfew on
Palestinian residents living in the Israeli-controlled part since
that attack.
</P>
<P>
Hebron has become a flash point of conflicts after Israel
withdrew from most of the town under an agreement with the
Palestinians in early 1997 but maintained control over the rest
part, which accommodates about 400 Jewish settlers.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Erupts Again in Somali Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOGADISHU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Amid the Holy month of Ramada, there
are reports of renewed heavy armed clashes in and around the southern port
town of Kismayu in the early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the area said fierce fighting has begun between the
Majerten dominated clan militiamen of General Mohamed Saeed Hirsi Morgan
and those of the Marehan fighters for control of Kismayu Town.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the region, the unexpected fighting has
started after the Marehan forces launched an attack against the
militia bases of the mainly Majerten men outside the town.
</P>
<P>
 Heavy shelling from mortar rounds, heavy machine guns, anti-aircraft
37 and 23 mm guns mounted on battle wagons, RPGs and assault rifles were
used during the exchange of fire by both sides early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people from both sides are reported to have died and more
than 50 others were wounded during this bitter armed confrontation.
However, eyewitnesses in Kismayu said the bodies of 12 people from both
sides were seen in the streets of the town after the confrontation
eased just before noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
 Independent sources, however, confirmed that one battle wagon
belonging to the Marehan Somali National Front (SNF) faction was destroyed
during the fighting before the SNF fighters were forces to retreat back to
their former militia bases outside the town.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said the Marehan fighters have captured the airport of
the town early in the morning before they were chased away by General
Morgan's men. The Marehan men are now being stationed at Gobwein village,
about 9 Km North of the city.
</P>
<P>
 The town of Kismayu, 500 Km South of Mogadishu, which had experienced
a relative calmness in recent days, was shocked Wednesday by the heavy
bombardment of the anti-aircraft machine guns and the mortar rounds which
hit several residential houses killing and wounding non-combatant civilians.
</P>
<P>
The supporters of General Morgan have claimed to have had the upper
hand and repulsed back the attack by the Marehan fighters.
</P>
<P>
General Morgan' s men also said that 10 men were captured from the
Marehan fighters as prisoners of war, a claim also admitted by the SNF
officials in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Marehan fighters here in Mogadishu said their men
have launched the attack on two fronts, one targeting the airport, while
the other aiming at capturing the former presidential palace of the town.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman furthermore said that his men had achieved military success
against those of the Mejertens in Kismayu by penetrating deep into the town
after crushing down the front defensive lines of General Morgan's men.
</P>
<P>
 The fighting for control of Kismayu has become one of the routine clan
 motivated clashes which would bring no success to anyone, but causes
destruction and heavy losses of human lives.
</P>
<P>
Kismayu town was calm Wednesday afternoon with the people bewildered by
the sudden attack of the Marehans which had caused a considerable damage
to the town.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UAE's GDP Falls 5.5 Percent on Oil Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) of the United Arab Emirates declined 5.5 percent last year
due to the fall in oil prices, Planning Minister Sheikh Ahmed
Al-Mualla announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The GDP declined to 46.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 from 49.2
billion dollars in 1997, according to a report on the country's
economic performance in 1998 and projections for this year.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, added that the non-oil GDP continued to
increase from 34.7 billion dollars in 1997 to 36.3 billion dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
The GDP is expected to recover to 48.1 billion dollars this
year because of a likely increase in non-oil GDP to 37.4 billion
dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the growth in non-oil GDP to the
government's plan to diversify revenue sources through industrial
activities.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that commercial activities and
wholesale and retail trade contributed 15.4 percent of the total
GDP in 1998 with the private sector playing the main role in this
field.
</P>
<P>
The real estate sector made up 13.7 percent of the GDP while
construction accounted for 12.2 percent, followed by
transportation, storage and telecommunications sector with 9.2
percent.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebel Leader Dismisses Capturing More Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBII, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD)
 engaged in a five-month rebellion against President Laurent Desire Kabila
has dismissed claims by Congolese government and its allies that they
recaptured key towns in the east and north of the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters in the Rwandan capital Kigali, the RCD C hairman,
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, said Tuesday that the situation is calm on the
battlefield, and that the rebels are still in control of the towns of Moba,
Fizi, Nyunzu and Kabalo, the Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
 He also denied reports from Kinshasa alleging that 1,000 Congolese
rebels were killed in Moba, and that Fizi had been bombed.
</P>
<P>
''They never took Moba, they did not kill one thousand as they claimed,
Fizi was never bombed,'' Wamba told journalists.
</P>
<P>
 Wamba and other rebel leaders including commander Jean
Pierre Ondekane were in stop-over in Kigali, coming from Kampala where they
held talks with Ugandan officials at the week-end.
</P>
<P>
According to Wamba, the visit to both capitals of their two major
backers was in the framework of regular tripartite consultations.
</P>
<P>
 He said that they need to get more on the experience
of the leadership in both countries about the liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
This visit occurred amidst wide-spread reports that the rebel movement
is rocked with internal rifts, and that senior officials are engaged in a
bitter rivalry.
</P>
<P>
The RCD chairman, however, played down divisions in the movement, by
saying that the rebellion is still strong and united.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the so-called divisions on confusing statements made recently
by some members which led to misinterpretations which made people believe
that the movement was breaking away.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed allegations that the RCD is pitted
against newly-formed Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC) of millionaire
businessman, Jean Pierre Bemba allegedly supported by Uganda.
</P>
<P>
''We are a rally for democracy which means that we rally political
formations, personalities of the civil society,'' Wamba indicated, saying
that contacts have already been engaged with Bemba with the objective of
finding out a precise relationship p of collaboration.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Nepal Striving to Attract Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nepalese government has
taken a number of measures to attract foreign direct investment in
the country since 1992 when the economic liberalization program
was launched.
</P>
<P>
Historically, private foreign investment had not been very
important in Nepal's growth strategy, and until before the
restoration of democracy in the country in 1990, only 86 foreign
investment projects had been approved with total foreign capital
investment of 5.9 billion rupees, according to the Spotlight, an
English weekly.
</P>
<P>
But the government's attitude has changed significantly since
the economic liberalization program started in 1992. That very
year, the Foreign Investment and One Window Policy, the Foreign
Investment and Technology Transfer Act and the Industrial
Enterprise Act were adopted, offering a number of incentives to
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
These include permission to set up 100 percent foreign-owned
enterprises in medium and large-scale industries with a few
exceptions, allowing repatriation by foreigners investing in
convertible currencies, legal provision to stop double taxation
for foreigners, concessions in taxes and provision of special
facilities with respect to land, water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a One Window Committee was established to provide all
facilities for the establishment, expansion and modernization of
industries and the license system was abolished for establishing
industries except in defense, public health and environment
sectors.
</P>
<P>
"Now the government intends to be a little government, not big
government, little bureaucracy, not big bureaucracy, little
regulatory function, not big regulatory function. This is the main
motto of the industrial policy," Govind Prasad Kusum, joint
secretary at the Ministry of Industry, told Xinhua in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the initiative of economic diplomacy was
launched in June 1996, Nepal's foreign missions have been doing
their best within given resources to promote foreign investment in
the country.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, 470 foreign investment projects have been approved
with a total foreign direct investment of 12.71 billion rupees, he
said, adding that India is the biggest investor in Nepal followed
by the United States, Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 205 projects have begun operation and 55 are
under construction.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has to enhance the foreign direct investment because many
priority sectors remain untouched, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We like to welcome all foreign investors just to invest their
resources, their capital in those sectors especially hydropower,
infrastructure development, agro-based industries, mining," he
added. "These are our potential areas where foreign direct
investment can be utilized properly."
</P>
<P>
Compared with other countries in the region, he said, Nepal has
enough opportunities and facilities for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He said Nepal has many more sectors open to foreigners and
there is no market problem here. "India is there, China is there,"
he explained.
</P>
<P>
"Now the areas where foreign investors can contribute are more
attractive to them, say, hydropower. We have enough water," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a company investing in hydropower in Nepal is
entitled to sell the electricity wherever it likes.
</P>
<P>
"Next, there is agro-based industries, we have many
potentialities, because being an agricultural country, we have
many agricultural products," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even a single agricultural product like tea has good market in
India, in other South Asian countries and European countries as
well, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors like tourism, infrastructure and mining also
offer good opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has enough mines including even petroleum, he said,
adding that last month a U.S. company signed an agreement with
Nepal to explore gas in the country.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that some bottlenecks like poor coordination
and lack of proper transportation and electricity deter the flow
of more foreign direct investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
But the government is trying its best to create a conducive
environment for investors, he added.

<HEADLINE> Railway Construction Proceeds Soundly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The fact that China increased
allocations for railway construction from 39.6 billion yuan in
1997 to 56.3 billion yuan in 1998 contributed greatly to the
nation's economic growth, according to Railway Minister Fu
Zhihuan.
</P>
<P>
 Fu made the comment during today's session of a related
national work conference.
</P>
<P>
 China completed new railway stretching 952 km. and
double-tracked railway line stretching some 1,127 km. during
1998, said Fu, adding that that construction of key projects in
southwest China is progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
 Statistics show a revival in the three-year slump in the
passenger transportation volume, with the 1998 volume growing 0.9
percent on an annual basis to 927 million.
</P>
<P>
 However, the freight transportation volume fell 5.3 percent
to end the year at 1.53 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
 Fu said the 1998 freight transportation volume for imports
and exports grew by 6.5 percent on the 1997 level to 9.22 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
 He also announced the delivery of the first order of metro
locomotives to Iran marked a major breakthrough in China's
exports of railway products.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Says Arabs Agree to Hold Meeting of FMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here on Wednesday that Arab countries "fully agree on
holding the consultative meeting" of their foreign ministers on
January 24.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League is not awaiting written responses from its
members because they all agree on its holding, thus its timing is
not in question," Moussa told reporters after a meeting with Arab
League chief Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries decided initially to convene a foreign ministers
meeting a week ago to discuss a Yemeni call for an urgent Arab
summit on the situation in the Arab world after U.S.-British
military strikes against Iraq last month.
</P>
<P>
Requested by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, the
meeting was put off to January 24 for better preparation and
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that he examined with Abdel-Meguid preparations for
the planned foreign ministers' meeting, briefing the Arab League
chief on the ongoing contacts for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and his counterparts of Oman, Saudi Arabia, Syria and
Yemen met Saturday in Egypt in a bid to reach an agreement among
Arab countries on issues to be raised at the upcoming foreign
ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on prospects for another five-way consultation on
the proposed meeting, Moussa said that it depends on whether the
ministers have time for such a gathering.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is approaching and several ministers have busy
schedules, he said. But he added that consultations and contacts
are continuing on various levels.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said his meeting with Moussa came as part of the
consultations with Egypt on the latest Arab coordination and the
preparations for the foreign ministers consultative meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Arab meeting will be held as scheduled and there is no
intention to postpone it once again, he said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of whether an Arab summit is to be held will be left
to the Arab leaders to decide in line with the results of the
January 24 meeting, he said.

direct confrontation between the United States and Iraq, instead
of helping solving the crisis caused by Iraq's suspension of
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"We have passed from a situation in which the international
community called on Iraq to meet its commitment of disarmament to
avoid a direct confrontation between the regime of Baghdad and
our American and British friends," he said.
</P>
<P>
France will present proposals in an appropriate time, which
are aimed at finding a way out of the crisis, ensuring a lasting
regional security and allowing the lifting of sanctions against
Iraq, he added.

<HEADLINE> Labor Body's Fresh Ultimatum to Nigerian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) has given the
Nigerian government a fresh 14-day ultimatum to resume talks on the issues
of the oil price hike and slash in approved minimum wages.
</P>
<P>
The renewed ultimatum was issued at a meeting held here Tuesday of the
13-member NLC caretaker committee and representatives of the 29 industrial
unions in the country, This Day newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place after Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami
Abubakar announced in his 1999 budget broadcast last Friday that "the
government is encouraging the petroleum marketers to enter into discussion
with consumers."
</P>
<P>
NLC caretaker committee Chairman Godwin Wodwin told reporters after the
meeting that labor is not comfortable with the head of state's directive
when the government is aware that no such group exists.
</P>
<P>
On the recent slash in the minimum wages for civil servants, he
disclosed that the 5,200-Naira (about 60.5 U.S. Dollars) minimum monthly
pay recently approved for civil servants would not be compromised by the
NLC.
</P>
<P>
On December 23 last year, the NLC issued a 12-day ultimatum to the
government to revert to the old pump price of fuel which was increased to
25 Naira (about 0.29 Dollars) from 11 Naira per liter.
</P>
<P>
The government reacted swiftly by summoning a meeting with labor
leaders and succeeded in persuading them to suspend the ultimatum, leading
to the setting up of two different committees to handle the issues of fuel
price hike and the slash in minimum wages.
</P>
<P>
Government officials last week met representatives of the two
committees to resolve the two controversial issues but could not reach a
compromise as both parties failed to shift grounds on their positions.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Speaker Hails Arrest of Serial Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A leading Iranian conservative on
Wednesday hailed the Intelligence Ministry for arresting some of
its agents in connection with the killing Iranian dissidents and
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
Majlis (parliament) speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri said at the
Majlis session that "national sovereignty and security, as well as
the interests of the system and people, is the principle."
</P>
<P>
"The system will severely encounter any individual or group
that tries to violate this principle," he said, quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Intelligence Ministry on Tuesday night expressed regret
that a few of its own "devious colleagues" were involved in a
series of mysterious political killings in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ministry said that it has succeeded in
breaking the criminal network and would bring them to justice.
But it did not say how many suspects were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Darius Forouhar, secretary general of the Iran Nation Party and
a prominent opposition leader, and his wife were stabbed to death
at home in November and several dissident writers were also
mysteriously slain in Tehran in December.
</P>
<P>
The killings shocked the public as the moderates, led by
President Mohammed Khatami, and the hard-line conservatives, who
control most of the powers in the Islamic regime, were engaged in
a bitter power struggles.
</P>
<P>
Khatami ordered the ministries of interior and intelligence to
form a special committee to probe into the cases, which led to the
discovery of the perpetrators inside the government establishment.
</P>
<P>
The conservative speaker, however, cautioned that the issue "is
more complicated than it seems." "If we follow up the news
transmitted by foreign news agencies and radio stations these
days, we will realize that our enemies are following other
objectives," he said without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
Some conservatives have blamed foreign enemies for the
murders. The speaker noted that it was not easy to say whether
foreign hands were behind these events, "it is not easy to answer
this question and it is not easy to rule it out either."

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Satisfied With Peso's Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Wednesday that the Philippine peso would settle
at 38-39 against the U.S. dollar this year.
</P>
<P>
The peso hit an eight-month intra-day high of 37.96 to the
dollar and closed at 38.00 Tuesday, the strongest level since
reaching 37.97 to the greenback on April 12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The currency continued to show its strength Wednesday and was
traded at 38.10 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"When I assumed office (at the end of June), the rate was 45
pesos to a dollar. Now it's 38 pesos to a dollar. So this is a big
improvement," Estrada said in an interview with reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that any further gain of the peso would affect
the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think 38-39 pesos will be just enough to stabilize the
peso, because if it drops lower than 38 pesos the exporters would
be adversely affected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson attributed the
peso's appreciation to investor confidence in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"It's a combination of factors, but the most important thing is
that the confidence of investors is returning and that speculation
is dying down," Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Singson also said the peso is likely to be stable at its
present rate this year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Takes Measures to Keep Goods Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Pricing Committee has
issued a circular on guidelines to manage and maintain stable
prices of goods while the value added tax (VAT) Law is in force,
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's VAT Law began in force on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the circular, the Vietnamese government asks ministries,
ministerial-level agencies, centrally-run agencies, and provincial
and municipal people's committees to re-examine the production
cost and set suitable selling prices of goods, strengthen the
management of production, transport and service costs, inspect
price tags and actual sale prices and monitor the fluctuation of
prices on the market with a view to maintaining stable prices,
especially during the days before the traditional lunar new year
festival (the Spring Festival).
</P>
<P>
The circular of the Vietnamese government calls on all
businesses to maintain the prices of goods and services at the
level in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government also asks ministries, branches and
localities to re-calculate the supply-demand balance of
commodities under their management in order to avoid unexpected
price hikes.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy General Director of Vietnam's Taxation
Department Nguyen Van Dau, the prices of goods on the market
basically remained stable during the first four days of applying
VAT. The prices of some essential goods and services that are
under state management such as electricity, petroleum, rice, post
and telecommunications and transport are unchanged.

<HEADLINE> China's Machinery Industry Expected To Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China's machinery industry is
scheduled to grow by 8 percent in 1999, with the sector's net
profits expected to hit 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars),
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Sun Changji, deputy director of the State Administration of
the Machinery Industry, said that the country's machinery
industry kept growing in 1998, in spite of the negative impact of
the Asian financial, when addressing a national conference on
China's machinery industry which opened in Shanghai today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sector's total output value increased by 3.1
percent to 451 billion yuan in the first 11 months of last year.
However, the sector's pre-tax profits plunged by 39.27 percent
on a year-on-year basis, standing at 5.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese machinery enterprises suffered losses in 1998,
accounting for more than half of the country's total. The total
losses were estimated at 13.6 billion yuan, up nearly 20 percent
from the same period of the previous year, because of increasing
numbers of unsold products.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese-made machinery products accounted for
65 percent of the share of the China market in 1998, however,
painstaking efforts should be made to expand the rural market for
Chinese machinery manufacturers and to develop more products to
meet the needs of Chinese consumers.
</P>
<P>
He said that a number of Chinese manufacturers of machinery
tools, food packaging and mining machinery were forced to reduce
their production in 1998, because of changes in China's foreign
trade policies and the financial crisis among Southeast Asian
states.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Share prices soared up on the
Singapore Stock Market Wednesday as foreign funds tricked in after
returning from the holidays.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) surged up 78.73 points
to 1,464.97 after an active session.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover ran up to 450.27 million units worth 657.76
million Singapore dollars (392.22 million U.S. dollars). Gainers
outstripped losers by 308 to 17 while 95 counters remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
CK Tang, a retailer, was the most favorite stock of the day
with a volume of 24.65 million units. SemCorp was the second most
heavily traded share with a turnover of 19.64 million units. ERL,
an electronics company whose takeover by U.S. computer distributor
Ingram Micro has helped to spark speculation about possible
takeover in other segments, was next with 17.02 million counters
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
F &AMP; N headed ascents of the day with a jump of 85 cents to 5.80
Singapore dollars. It was followed by OCBC F that surged up 80
cents to 12.00 Singapore dollars. Creative 50 climbed 70 cents to
finish at 24.80 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, DBS F was the biggest losers of the day with a
drop of 10 cents to 15.00 Singapore dollars. StarCru was next
retreating eight cents to 2.03 U.S. dollars. ITE Elec w00 sank
four cents to end at 0.09 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was boosted by foreign buying after
foreign funds returned from their holidays.
</P>
<P>
The rumors that OCBC and OUB, both among the Big Four Banks in
Singapore, would be announcing merger fueled buying of their
shares. But banks said they were not aware of such an
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also contributed today's strong hike to Wall Street's
overnight rally that encouraged U.S. and U.K. funds to get a
little more active.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they noted foreign funds traditionally set up
markets for rally at beginning of a year.

<HEADLINE> UK Says Iraqi Safety Claims "Bogus" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook Wednesday rejected Iraq's suggestion of popular unrest
threatening the safety of British aid workers in Iraq after the
U.S. and British air strikes against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion that popular unrest and feeling is going to
pose a risk to British or any other UN workers is a wholly bogus
argument," Cook told BBC Radio.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it feared for the safety of the Britons and
Americans who are working for the United Nations now in Iraq
because of "deep popular anger" after the air strikes on Iraq by
Britain and the Unites States, which had damaged schools,
hospitals, factories and other civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
"Let us remember these are humanitarian workers. On the whole,
what they do is overwhelmingly popular with the Iraqi people,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would contemplate pulling the British workers out
of Iraq, he said: "The safety of British citizens is always of
paramount concern."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary welcomed the outcome of the United
Nations meeting in New York, which rejected Baghdad's request to
replace British and U.S. humanitarian staff.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Enterprise Reform Tops Chinese Officials' Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The reform of State-owned
enterprises is the main concern of top Chinese officials in 1999,
according to a survey conducted by the Party School of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
The random survey sent out 125 questionnaires and 121 were
returned. The respondents are mainly government and Party
officials at the city and prefectural level across the country.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire listed 12 hot issues of the 1999 reform, and
respondents were required to arrange them in accordance with
their importance.
</P>
<P>
Results show that 40.5 percent of those surveyed regard the
reform of state-owned enterprises as the primary issue of the
1999 reform, followed by institutional restructuring, political
reform and housing reform.
</P>
<P>
The reforms of the social medicare, distribution system and
household register management, however, were not the main choices.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, officials in eastern and central parts of
the country showed greater concern about the reform of
state-owned enterprises than institutional reform. Officials from
western China took an opposite view.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 50.1 percent of those surveyed from the
west targeted institutional restructuring as the top concern, as
against 30.9 percent who chose the state-owned enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
As for factors affecting the state-owned enterprise reform,
34.7 percent of officials regarded the change of governmental
administrative functions as the most important, followed by
property reform and internal management of enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Economy Records 2.36 Percent Growth in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's economy recorded 2.36 percent
growth in 1998, down from 3.77 percent in 1997, Finance Minister
Ismaila Usman has said.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters Tuesday in Nigerian capital Abuja on the 1999 budget,
 the minister said the government recorded a deficit of 57 billion Naira
(one U.S. Dollar equals to 86 Naira) last year, compared with a projected
surplus of one billion Naira.
</P>
<P>
The government had projected an oil price of 17 Dollars a barrel in its
1998 budget, but the average price in the past year is only around 12
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The slump in the oil price has caused a great financial difficulty for
the government, which depends on oil export for more than 80 percent of its
budgetary income and above 90 percent of its hard currency earning.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the minister said the country earned only 6.8 billion
Dollars from oil export in 1998, 76 percent down from the 12 billion
Dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Namibian Illegal Immigrants in Botswana Reach 1,900 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,900 Namibian refugees
from the Caprivi Strip have crossed the border into neighboring Botswana
since last October, reports from Gaborone said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian refugees, who claimed they were fleeing political
persecution by their government, were arriving almost daily, although the
flow had diminished since last year, local media quoted Botswana Police
Service as reporting.
</P>
<P>
However, the Namibian government accused the so-called refugees of
being involved in a movement plotting the secession of the Caprivi Strip
from Namibia.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified Botswana police spokesman said that apart from the
initial group of Namibians, who were charged with illegal entry and
unlawful possession of arms and ammunition, most new arrivals have not been
charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
He said the current intake had not been budgeted for at the Dukwe
refugee camp, which has catered for up to 50,000 refugees in the past.
</P>
<P>
The Botswana Refugee Advisory Committee, which was reportedly
interviewing the illegal Namibian immigrants, would make a final decision
on whether to grant asylum status to them, Botswana officials said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Botswanan government and the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees said the Namibian secessionists would be returned
to their homeland only on a voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Namibian authorities said they would take a tough line with
the alleged secessionists.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Debt, Education Priority in Nigeria's 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has given top
priority of its 1999 budget to domestic debt service and education,
according to breakdown of the budget carried on major newspapers here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown, given by Finance Minister Ismaila Usman in Nigerian
capital Abuja Tuesday, shows that about 39 billion Naira (one U.S. Dollar
equals to 86 Naira) would be spent on domestic debt service, accounting for
13 percent of the total budgetary spending of 300 billion Naira.
</P>
<P>
For the second year, education is given the second largest share of 27.
7 billion Naira, or 9.2 percent of the total vote.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government announced a special refurbishing grant of 1.4
billion Naira to 17 chosen universities, education colleges as well as the
Nigeria Defense Academy.
</P>
<P>
The third biggest cake goes to defense, which will gulp nearly 26
billion Naira, or 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The police will receive 21 billion Naira, or seven percent of the
budget.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector is given 7.5 billion Naira, or a share of 2.5
percent, while 13.7 billion Naira, or 4.6 percent, is allocated to the
health sector.
</P>
<P>
The Independent National Electoral Commission, which is in harge of the
country's transition to civil rule program, is granted 1.2 billion Naira.
</P>
<P>
The government announced a modest investment of one billion Naira in
the power sector, which, according to the minister, will be mainly spent on
rural electrification projects.
</P>
<P>
Due to the slump in the international oil price, Nigeria, which depends
more than 80 percent of its budgetary income on crude oil export, is
expecting a deficit of 34.1 billion Naira in 1999, representing 1.05
percent of its projected gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief to Visit Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The IMD Managing Director will lead a 19-
man team to visit Nigeria in mid-January to finalize discussions on the
Staff Maintained Program (SMP) which is a pre-condition to negotiating the
Medium Term Economic Strategy (MTES) for Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In his briefing of the breakdown of the 1999 budget held Tuesday in
capital Abuja, Nigerian Finance Minister Mallam Usman said Nigeria and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) had agreed on virtually all the
conditions set for the commencement of the MTES, This Day reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While in the country, the IMF team will discuss with the Nigerian
government on the expanded version of the MTES which involves instituting
major market based reforms in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the IMF is currently negotiating on behalf of
Nigeria a debt relief from the Paris Club to which Nigeria owes more than
70 percent of 28 billion U.S. Dollars external debt.
</P>
<P>
But, the Paris Club is insisting that for it to grant the relief,
Nigeria must put in place some economic reforms which the IMF is willing to
support.
</P>
<P>
Some of the reform requirements include abolition of dual exchange rate,
removal subsidies and continuation of the privatization program, said the
paper, adding that most of them had already been implemented by the
Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is one of the highly indebted poor countries in the world which
are qualified for debt relief from the Paris Club if it successfully
implements its reform program.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is supposed to pay about 4 billion Dollars debt service
annually, but currently is able to pay 1.5 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
If Nigeria maintains a track record of performance, it could be
entitled to about 60 percent cut from its stock of external debts,
according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Toxic Pollution Attains Dangerous Level in Islamabad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Islamabad, the capital city of
Pakistan, is facing serious pollution problems as formaldehyde gas
in the environment has reached a dangerous level.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of an initial report based on a first ever
study of toxic pollution in the city being conducted by the
Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
According to sources from CDA, the central engineering
laboratory of CDA with the coordination of Haider Khawaja, a UNDP
consultant from Albany university, New York, took samples of air,
soil and water to examine level of formaldehyde, nitric acid and
other hydro carbons in Islamabad's sector I-8/1 and the suburban
village of Saidpur.
</P>
<P>
The comparative study of both areas will help determine the
level of pollution, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sajjad Ali Shah, assistant director of the central engineering
laboratory, said Wednesday that citizens of Islamabad are inhaling
in large quantity of suspended particles of less than ten microns
which contain poisonous materials.
</P>
<P>
He said the samples will be sent to New York for study and the
final report will be released within a few months.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the broad spectrum study of toxic pollution
is the first ever conducted in Pakistan and the result will help
concerned authorities take measures to control pollution.

election campaign Wednesday, making a long-awaited announcement

The former army chief emphasized that he was not in the right

conflicts between secular and ultra-religious should be solved
through negotiations.

Recent opinion polls have showed that Shahak would oust
Netanyahu easily in the elections set in May, but some say that

(DYP) leader Tansu Ciller declared her sudden support for a
proposal for a minority government led by Democratic Left Party
(DSP) leader and former prime minister designate Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Erez said that he will soon meet with outgoing Prime Minister
and Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz, Ecevit and other
party leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is the most important for me" and the country can not
remain without government, added Erez.
</P>
<P>
Following Ciller's decision to support a DSP minority
government, Yilmaz and Ecevit called on Erez to return his
mandate for the government formation to Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Erez, a businessman-turned-politician, was chosen partly
because he sided with the pro-secular establishment.
</P>
<P>
He resigned as industry and trade minister in a earlier
coalition between Ciller's DYP and pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP)
in 1997, two months after the military warned the government to
strictly act on the secular constitution.
</P>
<P>
On December 23, Demirel appointed Erez to form a new
government as Ecevit failed to get enough support in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said he believed an independent lawmaker could obtain
wide support from Turkey's bickering political parties.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Yilmaz, who is now acting prime
minister, collapsed in November in a no-confidence vote as a
result of his corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
Demirel did not appoint the leader of the largest party to
form a cabinet as such an appointment will bring the pro-Islamic
Virtue Party (FP) to power, thus infuriating pro-secular
military.

<HEADLINE> No Delay on Palestinian Statehood: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians will declare
an independent state on May 4 as Israel's settlement expansion and
suspension of a recent peace deal left them with no alternatives,
a senior Palestinian official has said.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no change in the policy of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) on this matter," PNA Planning Minister
Nabil Sha'ath was quoted Wednesday by The Jerusalem Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
What has made the declaration of statehood more necessary,
Shaath told the newspaper in an exclusive interview, "is the
total lack of implementation of the Wye agreement and the total
lack of progress on permanent status (talks)."
</P>
<P>
In response to his remarks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
spokesman Aviv Bushinsky accused Shaath of "announcing
unilaterally" on the establishment of a Palestinian state, saying
the Palestinians are to blame for the stalemate in the Wye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The recrimination has characterized the Israeli-Palestinian
relationship over the last several weeks since Netanyahu halted
the implementation of the Wye agreement citing alleged Palestinian
violations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians said they have fulfilled all their
obligations and blasted Netanyahu for procrastinating in order to
woo right-wingers and extremists.
</P>
<P>
As the election campaign is under way in Israel, the
Palestinian statehood has become a focus in the peace process as
well as in Israel's domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat has repeated his pledge that he
will declare a Palestinian state on May 4, when the five-year
interim period set in the Oslo accords ends, with or without an
agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
But since Israel sets the election date on May 17, two weeks
after the Oslo deadline, the Palestinians have been debating over
whether to go ahead with their plan to declare statehood and have
sent mixed signals on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Some officials said the PNA will be flexible on its agenda for
the statehood, fearing a unilateral declaration would help bring a
hard-line Israeli government to power.
</P>
<P>
Other officials, however, said the statehood issue has nothing
to do with the elections in Israel, vowing to go ahead as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Egypt and the European Union have tried in
recent weeks to convince the PNA that it is in the interest of
the Palestinians to postpone such a unilateral declaration until
after the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton later in the
spring to discuss the troubled peace process and the Palestinian
statehood is expected to be one of the major topics in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Infant Mortality Down, Death by Cancer Up in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics showed a
sharp decline in infant mortality and death by heart diseases but
a slight growth in death resulting from cancerous tumors in Israel
in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality rate has fallen by half in the decade but the
gap between Jewish and non-Jewish Israelis remains, according to a
recent book published by Israel's Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The overall infant mortality rate was 6.3 for every 1,000
births in 1997, with 5.0 among Jews and 9.3 deaths for every 1,000
births among non-Jews, almost twice as high, the figures show.
</P>
<P>
Between 1984 and 1995, the rate of death by ischemic heart
diseases -- when the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen to
work properly -- fell 23 percent among Jewish men and 18 percent
among Jewish women, according to the book.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, death by vascular diseases in the brain
fell 35 percent among Jewish women and by 17 percent among Jewish
men.
</P>
<P>
The book, which was quoted by the Haaretz daily Wednesday, said
that the Israelis are also spending less time in hospital.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Israelis spent 785 days in hospital for every 1,000
people, compared with 1,037 days in 1975. The average length of
hospital stay fell from eight days in 1975 to 4.3 days in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the figures also show that the rate of death by
cancerous tumors among Jews rose by 7 percent for males and 4
percent for females from 1984 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The daily calorie intake of the average Israeli increased 14
percent between 1990 and 1997, from an average of 3,089 calories a
day in 1990 to 3,570 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A study covering the period between April and September 1996
found that 7.8 percent of the population suffer from high blood
pressure, 3.7 percent have asthma, 3.3 percent have diabetes, and
2.6 percent of Israelis have heart blockages.

<HEADLINE> 7 Tamil Rebels Nabbed While Making Bombs in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Seven Tamil rebels who were in
the process of manufacturing bombs to be brought to the capital of
Colombo have been arrested by a team of army officers in Eastern
province of Sri Lanka, reports reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The raid last Sunday also arrested a police constable who had
been with the Tamil rebels at the time, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were arrested in an isolated house in Palaminmadu,
Batticaloa, while manufacturing the bombs, said the reports,
adding that the arrested policeman is from Tricomalee, also in the
Eastern province of the country.
</P>
<P>
The suspects have been identified as key members of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) responsible for
dispatching bombs to Colombo, the reports noted.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE used the police constable as a pawn for the smooth
transport of bombs to Colombo, a senior police officer was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting the government since 1983 for a
separate state in the north and east of the island nation.

<HEADLINE> Apple Unveils New Version of PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Apple Computer Inc. Tuesday
launched a new desktop computer for businesses, in a bid to
continue the momentum it has found in the mass market with its
wildly popular Mac, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The Power Mac G3 is the most powerful iMac ever built and the
most powerful PC in the industry, said Steve Jobs, interim chief
executive at the resurgent computer company.
</P>
<P>
The new desktop G3 is professional computer which aimed at
graphic designers and home users with a thirst for graphics-heavy
power, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Apple also is trying to increase its appeal to computer game
players. Analysts noted the company boosted the ability of its G3
computer to play games with three-dimensional graphics and
unveiled a new device that enables Mac users to play about 100
different software games designed for Sony's PlayStation video
game system.
</P>
<P>
The new version of the G3 comes as Apple also reports strong
sales of its iMac, which is aimed at easing users onto the
Internet. Since the iMac hit the shelves in mid-August, more than
800,000 units have been shipped, Jobs said during a keynote
address at the MacWorld Expo in San Franciso.
</P>
<P>
Building on the marketing momentum generated by the
translucent,turquoise-hued iMacs, Apple said it would offer the
new iMacs with a faster processor and colors ranging from lime to
blueberry at a price of 1,199 U.S. dollars, 100 dollars down from
a prior suggested price of 1,299 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The iMacs is now available in red, orange, purple, and green
as well as its original color, teal.
</P>
<P>
Most personal computers are sold in beige or sometimes black,
but the recent popularity of the iMac is leading other
manufacturers to break with convention.
</P>
<P>
Apple's sales peaked in its fiscal 1995. Since then, revenue
has tailed off during the past years. However, the company did
earn money in its most recent years after losing one billion
dollars in the fiscal 1997 year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Backpedals Nearly Half a U.S. Cent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
backpedaled nearly half a U.S. cent Wednesday, whittled away by a
stronger U.S. dollar and a near 12-year low in copper prices.
</P>
<P>
Westpac Banking Corporation chief foreign exchange dealer Peter
McGrath said the domestic currency pulled back from recent gains,
impacted by U.S. dollar strength against several currencies.
</P>
<P>
McGrath said despite gains in the Commodity Research Bureau
Index, weakness in base metals - particularly copper - had eaten
away at the commodity-sensitive Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trade the local unit was buying 61.98 U.S.
cents compared with 62.43 late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the day it traded between 61.95 and 62.30 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"There was just a little bit of a pull-back here today from
recent gains," McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
The euro, yen, Australian and New Zealand dollars were weaker
against the U.S. dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new European currency also fell against the Australian
dollar, finishing at 1.8899 Australian dollars from 1.8924
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
McGrath said there had been a long "run-down" in the U.S.
dollar recently and the strength was probably simply the result of
profit taking.
</P>
<P>
"Also, some of the rises in commodities in the last few days
have hidden some weakness in some of the base metals, which is not
good for Aussie," McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark three-month London Metal Exchange price Wednesday
hit its lowest level since May 1987, with three-month copper
quoted at 1,438/42 U.S. dollars a ton at midday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australian Bureau of Statistics retail sales data
out Wednesday had little impact on the market.
</P>
<P>
November retail sales were softer than expected, up a
seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent from an upwardly revised rise of
1.0 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
At the local close, the Australian dollar was trading at 69.74
Japanese yen from 69.57.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Monitor Fishing Activities by Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Deputy Minister of Agriculture
and Fisheries Isidora Faztudo has said the country will enhance its
monitoring on fishing activities in coastal areas through satellite
starting from this March.
</P>
<P>
The new system is aimed at cracking down on abuse of fishing by illegal
ships. It is estimated that the new system will cost 4.6 million U.S.
Dollars, the Noticias reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The program, said Faztudo on Tuesday, includes monitoring on fishing
boats and fishing activities. It will help detect ships fishing in the
Mozambican territorial waters to see if they have the licenses for fishing
in an approved area.
</P>
<P>
"In the circumstances, we need to obtain information on the catchments,
and specific resources within certain period of time, which means we need
to strengthen management on fishing activities," said the deputy minister.
</P>
<P>
The new monitoring system will involve the Mozambican navy.
</P>
<P>
"The monitoring on Mozambican coasts should engage the Mozambican armed
forces, since some ships illegally fishing on the Mozambican coast are
equipped with weapons," said Defense Minister Aguiar Mazula.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to deploy new patrol boats and establish a
monitoring center in the capital Maputo.
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary 15 boats will be equipped with electrical facilities to
detect and receive satellite signals, with all industrial and semi-
industrial fishing boats getting equipped later.
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, relevant laws and regulations are already on the way, while
technical personnel have been trained ready for deployment at the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
"The satellite monitoring system will benefit not only fishermen but
also be conducive to the assessment and reasonable exploitation of fishing
resources," said Faztudo.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique boasts a coast line of over 2,600 kilometers. However, due
to lack of capital and poor technical strength, there is little efficient
protection on its fishing resources.

<HEADLINE> India's Defense Ministry to Be Restructured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- In a significant move, India's
Defense Ministry announced Tuesday that it had initiated a process
to restructure itself which included integration of the three
services headquarters with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, according to the Times of India Wednesday, the
ministry would begin a series of presentations and interactions
between the ministry and the three services headquarters to
formulate concrete proposals.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting will be held on Friday and the blueprint is
expected to be ready by the end of this month, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The decision on restructuring was taken at the defense
minister's weekly meeting on Tuesday following the dismissal of
Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat from the post of Navy chief and the removal
of Ajit Kumar from the post of defense secretary in controversial
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal and removal of the generals raised vital
questions regarding coordination between the service chiefs and
the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Integrating the services headquarters with the Defense Ministry
has reportedly been a long-pending demand of the armed forces and,
over three months ago, Defense Minister George Fernandes asked the
three service chiefs to submit proposals for the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Indian armed forces do not have a role in the decision-making
process, let alone any significant authority relating to
purchases.
</P>
<P>
Although the three service chiefs enjoy the same status as
cabinet secretary, they can only submit proposals when it comes to
deciding on military equipment.
</P>
<P>
The decision-making power rests with defense ministry
bureaucrats who are often accused by the services of lacking both
commitment and in-depth understanding of defense issues, thus
relations between the armed forces and the ministry's bureaucracy
have historically been strained.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks Prepare for Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines banks have
started preparing its computer systems against any possible
introduction of the so-called "millennium bug" that threatens the
information technology at the turn of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here Wednesday, the Philippine
Presidential Commission on Year 2000 said that with the millennium
bug expected to strike less than a year from now, at least two
major banks are laying the groundwork for Y2K preparations.
</P>
<P>
One major bank is now in the midst of Y2K conversion of its
mainframe systems, and expects to complete the process by the
middle of this year, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
It said that another bank purchased new mainframes for its
computer system in 1997, and converted all transaction systems to
be Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission did not name the two major banks which
are preparing for the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that banks are one of the seven areas it
has warned to be prepared for the millennium bug due to their
crucial services in daily life.
</P>
<P>
Also deemed as crucial sectors are utilities,
tele-communications, transport, health care, manufacturing and
government services in the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in older computer systems
that use two digits to determine the date. Such computers may fail
on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Effects of the millennium bug include erroneous cancellation of
customer orders or shipments of goods and supplies, premature
expiration of licenses and credit cards, and miscalculation or
non-payment of salaries.

<HEADLINE> China to Export More Electronic, Machinery Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China plans to export 40
billion U.S. dollars in machinery products in the year 2000, the
"China Trade News" reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the machine building industry said they
were determined that China would grow into a major exporter for
machinery over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
They made the vow at the opening session of a national
conference focused on the sector's future, and stressed that
China is already one of the world's major machine-building
nations. They said they were planning to position the sector to
help it develop.
</P>
<P>
The machine-building industry is one of the most vigorous
growth points in China's industrial sector, with an average
annual growth rate of 14 percent over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China's machinery exports yielded about 30 billion
U.S. dollars in foreign exchange revenues which accounted for
some 20 percent of total exports.
</P>
<P>
Its output of power generating equipment ranks fourth in
the world, with the output of machine-tools holding sixth
place.

<HEADLINE> MKO Claims Responsibility for Failed Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's outlawed Mujahideen Khalq
Organization (MKO) has claimed responsibility for a failed
assassination on Tuesday, the Hamshahri daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After the failed attempt on the life of head of Tehran
province's justice department Ali Razini, the MKO announced to
take responsibility for the attack late Tuesday night, the daily

The report did not elaborate on how and where the MKO claimed
its responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Wednesday
that a 30-year-old passer-by was killed and five others including
Razini were injured in the assassination attempt.

Director General for Security Affairs of the Interior Ministry
Amir Hussein Motahhar told IRNA that two motorcyclists adhered
explosives to Razini's car in downtown Tehran when Razini was
driving home from his office.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Struggling to Achieve Budget's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Finance Minister
Bambang Subianto believed the 1999/2000 draft state budget
reflects the government's wish to let the economy recover soon,
and analysts said the realization of the budget will depend
largely on the political stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Set for the 1999/2000 fiscal year beginning in April and ending
in March next year, the tightened and balanced draft budget,
unveiled by President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday, assumes zero
economic growth, 17 percent inflation and a rupiah-U.S. dollar
exchange rate of 7,500 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The government's wish to bring about economic recovery could be
seen from the assumptions it had made about revenues and economic
growth, Bambang said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic revenues from non-oil commodities were projected at
119.8 trillion rupiah or higher than last year's figure of 99.5
trillion rupiah, while oil and gas revenue would make up just 14.9
percent of total domestic revenue compared with 33.3 percent in
1998/1999.
</P>
<P>
Such an assumption was realistic, and the government was
optimistic that the target would be achieved, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists questioned if it will be possible to
see zero growth given the unfavorable economic condition and
political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
"The result of the general election scheduled to be held in
June and the new administration will play a big role in economic
growth. Political stability will be the key to economic recovery
and growth," said Pande Radja Silalahi, a researcher from the
Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
Banking analyst Nyoman Moena said that the government target to
keep inflation rate at 17 percent and the rupiah at 7,500 against
the U.S. dollar is too optimistic considering that the government
will allocate more funds for food subsidies, foreign debt
repayments, and the social safety net program.
</P>
<P>
"The number of poor people this year is five times higher than
the figure before the economic crisis, thus the government should
provide more money for this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the zero-growth budget relies heavily on
foreign loans because prices of traditional revenue-earner oil are
projected to remain at record lows.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign revenues both in terms of program loans and project
loans will still be needed because domestic revenues cannot be
expected to fulfill the budget needs yet," President Habibie noted
when delivering the budget before the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The 1999/2000 budget expects foreign loans of 77.4 trillion
rupiah in 1999/2000 as against 114.6 trillion rupiah in 1998/1999,
with program loans contributing 47.40 trillion rupiah and project
loans making up 30 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
This is a big question mark, said Silalahi. "Could we get that
much (77.4 trillion rupiah)?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
The largest chunk of routine expenditures is allocated for
interest payments, costing about 44.43 trillion rupiah, on
government debts.
</P>
<P>
It is 31 percent lower than the amount allocated in the current
budget, due to the strengthening of the rupiah and last year's
agreement with the Paris Club creditor nations to suspend
principal payment on the country's bilateral borrowings for two
years starting 1998/1999.
</P>
<P>
Another huge burden for the budget is the 18 trillion rupiah
allocated for recapitalization of the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed fund for the bank restructuring is much higher
than those allocated to other sectors, making it politically
impossible to be accommodated by the House of Representatives,"
said Rijanto Sastroatmodjo, a leading banking observer.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the government need 34 trillion rupiah to
recapitalize troubled banks. The remaining 16 trillion rupiah will
be acquired by the government from the sales of assets of
take-over banks and suspended ones.
</P>
<P>
Analyst Didiek J. Rachbini said that the government is too
optimistic about the sale of assets of insolvent banks given the
unfavorable economic condition.
</P>
<P>
Economic observer Umar Juoro advised the government to carry
out strict measures to select the banks which would be given the
recapitalization assistance.
</P>
<P>
Outlining his first draft budget to the House, Habibie stressed
that the recovery of the country's economy from the 18-month-old
crisis would depend heavily on the success of restoring the
banking sector and the real sector.
</P>
<P>
Consistent with its recent moves to promote small businesses,
the government also plans to allocate a significant portion of the
development budget to foster small and medium-sized enterprises
and cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The government also aims to make agriculture the backbone of
the country's economy, earmarking 4.4 trillion rupiah to the
sector.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the draft budget, the Jakarta Post said there is
a larger and more telling "if" upon which the accuracy of the
government's financial planning hinges.
</P>
<P>
"The budget assumes that the markets and the public will have
strong confidence in the government, which in turn hinges on
political and social stability, neither of which can be
guaranteed," the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's N. Bank Announces Freeze on Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The cash-strapped National Bank of
Kenya (NBK) has announced an immediate freeze on further lending in efforts
to conserve liquidity and save the fourth-largest bank in the country from
collapse.
</P>
<P>
Also frozen are staff recruitment and expansion of branch network,
the new NBK Managing Director, Reuben Marambi, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
 Although lending was the main business of banks, it was vital that the
exercise was halted while the new management was trying to put in place
appropriate internal controls to ensure proper practices, he was quoted by
Wednesday's press reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Marambi emphasized that the new move was temporary and would
 be suspended as soon as the new team settles down.
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he said the NBK will take "appropriate steps" to recover
billions of Shillings owed by some high-profile Kenyans including two
cabinet ministers and the deputy speaker.
</P>
<P>
 The bank collected over 2.7 billion Shillings (about 45 million U.S.
Dollars) of the bad and doubtful debts last year.
</P>
<P>
Marambi also confirmed that the government is determined to sell off
its remaining 22.5 percent stake in the bank thereby reducing its influence.
</P>
<P>
The bank, with 23 billion Shillings in assets, has 29 branches across
 this east African country.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Incites to Topple Pro-U.S. Arab Governments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
on Wednesday called for overthrowing the Arab governments that
support the United States and Britain against Iraq, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised speech on the occasion of the
National Army Day, Saddam slammed those Arab governments that
"cooperate with U.S. and British forces in the Gulf region."
</P>
<P>
Saddam agitated Arab masses to "rise up" against what he called
"errant Arab rulers."
</P>
<P>
"It is time for you to revolt, sons of the Arab world, sons of
the Arab Gulf, to revolt against foreigners, to revolt against
their forces. It is time to kick them out of your countries," said
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
He said that one who antagonizes any Arab country is the enemy
of all Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Saddam condemned the presence of U.S. and British aircraft in
the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain imposed two no-fly zones in Iraq after the
1991 Gulf War to protect the minority Kurds in the north and
Shiite Muslims in the south from "Baghdad's oppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq calls the no-fly zones illegal and vows to fire at any
planes that violate its airspace. Since late last month, Iraqi
air-defense force and U.S.-British planes have traded fires four
times in the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Iraqi jets confronted U.S. warplanes in the
southern no-fly zone, the first time since the imposition of the
no-fly zones about eight years ago.

<HEADLINE> Most Automakers Report Strong Sales In 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Most American, European and
Japanese automakers Tuesday reported higher sales of cars and
light trucks for 1998, according to reports from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co., the second largest automaker in the United
States, said its sales increased 7 percent in December over
year-ago levels. For the year of 1998, Ford's sales rose 2
percent for its best year since 1978.
</P>
<P>
DaimlerChrysler also had its best year ever, with a 9 percent
increase over 1997. For December, sales were up 7 percent. The
figures do not include DaimlerChrysler's results for
Mercedes-Benz, which are reported separately.
</P>
<P>
Major European automakers, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW and
Volkswagen, said their sales zoomed in the year.
</P>
<P>
Mercedes-Benz set a record for the year, with sales up 39
percent. Volkswagen's sales for the year were up 59 percent, its
best year since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Other automakers including General Motors Corp., the world's
largest automaker in the world, planned to release their figures
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the Japanese automakers reporting Tuesday, Isuzu Motor
Corp.said its December sales jumped 31.6 percent and the sales
for 1998 were up 11.3 percent. Mazda Motor Corp. also had a 13.5
percent increase for December and an 8.4 percent increase for the
passing year.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Motor Corp. had a 16.7 percent rise of sales in
December, but had a slight decline of sales for the whole year.
In Nissan Motor Co Ltd, which had an 11.9 percent gain for
December, sales for the year dropped 14.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among S.Korean automakers, sales for Kia Motors Corp. products
rose 49.8 percent for 1998 while sales for Hyundai Motor Co.
vehicles were down 20 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and executives said a strong economy was behind the
surge of sales of vehicles in the United States and Europe, while
most of Japanese and S. Korean automakers are still struggling
for the improvement of future.

<HEADLINE> China Continues Pro-active Fiscal Policies in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to pursue
pro-active fiscal policies and expand financial expenditure in
1999 in a move to boost economic growth, Xiang Huaicheng,
Minister of Finance, announced at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
As one of the major steps, China plans to issue a total of
316.5 billion yuan in treasury bonds this year, with the
government budgetary deficit designed at 105.3 billion yuan, more
than the figure of 96 billion yuan in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the central government has no plan to issue
special treasury bonds in 1999 to recapitalize commercial banks,
but he did not rule out the possibility of issuing such bonds
when necessary.
</P>
<P>
He said that, considering the present low price levels and
economic operation conditions, the increased deficit will not
lead to inflation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the central government hopes to issue
a certain amount of state sovereignty bonds on the international
market this year, as it did last year, not because China is short
of 500 million or one billion US dollars but because it is keen
to become more involved in the global capital market.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1998 China's pro-active fiscal policies
yielded good results in boosting economic growth and readjusting
the investment structure, but warned that exports are still on
the downslide accompanied by sluggish enterprise investments and
domestic consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the financial expenditure was to be cut
this year, it would be difficult to maintain a steady growth of
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the devastating floods in many parts of
China last summer have created a huge demand for rebuilding and
rehabilitation, and the reform of state-owned enterprises is now
at a crucial stage, both calling for stronger financial support
this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will establish a basic financial framework
for public services in line with China's socialist market
economy, Xiang said, adding that the government has spent too
much in sectors that should not have been of its concern,
especially in the competitive production sectors, and too little
on social and public needs, which fall within the scope of
government obligations.
</P>
<P>
"Eliminating expenditure from the former sectors and inve
sting more in the latter is what setting up a financial framework
for public services should be about," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, however, China will maintain a moderately
tight fiscal stance, with a view to achieving a balanced budget,
and establishing a policy framework and institutional set-up to
promote enterprise investment and private consumption, the
minister added.

<HEADLINE> S. African Urged to Have Flu Vaccination 017 This story is from XH-PC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is very much likely to
be attacked by killer Sydney flu, medical experts have warned.
</P>
<P>
The Star daily reported Wednesday that medical departments are advizing
people in the country to have flu vaccination to guard against the killer
virus before winter comes this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Stephen Toovey, director of Medical Information, about 5,
000 South Africans died of flu last year.
</P>
<P>
Toovey urged people to get a vaccination this year, saying that it was
the only way to prevent the virus.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the epidemic has already hit Britain with thousands of
people contracting the H3N2 strain of Sydney flu over the Christmas period.
</P>
<P>
The strain can be fatal in the elderly and the very young, as well as
those with respiratory disorders, cardiovascular disease and poorly
functioning immune systems.
</P>
<P>
Based upon their recent studies, South African medical experts said
pregnant women are more prone to the symptoms of flu, and that the current
vaccination can be administered to them safely from the fourth month
onwards.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Currency Now Available to More Chinese Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Almost every family in the
cities of Beijing and Shanghai has some foreign currency of some
kind, a recent survey of the residents of these two cities found.
</P>
<P>
The survey was intended to find out how families in the two
cities got their foreign currency and what their attitude is
towards it.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen percent of those said they got it from their work,
and 11 percent said they got it from moonlighting. Some said it
was given by relatives, friends, or other sources.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six percent of those surveyed will put their foreign
currency in banks, to let it increase in value, because foreign
currencies have relatively higher interest rates than the
national currency renminbi, whose interest rate has been cut six
times since May, 1996. But, 22 percent of those surveyed still
prefer to stash their currency at home. When asked about
converting some of it into renminbi, 66 percent said they would
not, while 11 percent thought it was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange,
China's citizens have 80 billion US. dollars worth of foreign
currency, in addition to the state's 140 billion dollars in
reserves.

<HEADLINE> Computer-related Crimes Surging in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An increasing portion of hackers, however, are not merely
young computer whizzes, but rather electronic bandits who get
away with a tremendous amount of stolen assets. The Hao brothers
in east China's Jiangsu Province transmitted 260,000 yuan to
their own account from a local bank via a computer network, and
the two were sentenced to capital punishment last month.
</P>
<P>
Some other hackers maliciously broke into other computer
systems, paralyzing the entire network. Yang Wei, a post-graduate
at China's prestigious Fudan University, was prosecuted recently
for illegally using a company's network for over 2,000 hours and
causing 160 million yuan in economic loss.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard national security and penalize hackers, China's
latest Criminal Law has added new provisions to "combat
computer-related crimes." The government has also promulgated a
series of regulations to set criteria for information-system
security and oversee the testing and sales of computer security
products.
</P>
<P>
Apart from legal backup, the role of technical measures cannot
be overemphasized. "Given that all the hardware and computer
chips we use are made by foreign companies; the operating systems
are developed by foreign companies, and even the security
hierarchy of computer products are set by foreign standards, I
think 'security' based on alien technologies is unsafe and
unreliable." CASS's Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
He urges that China put more human and economic resources into
developing a comprehensive and copyrighted computer coding system
so that China will not have to completely rely on imported coding
products.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies are aware of the hacker problem, and China's
Network Security Ally organized by China's information security
departments will be established this May, with major network
users and corporate and individual computer security-product
producers as its main component.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, scores of computer network security companies are
emerging all over China, fostering a new growth outlet for
China's computer industry.
</P>
<P>
China's public security departments, now the only watchdog for
computer-related crimes, are busy introducing a nationwide
hacker-monitoring system to find these new-age criminals.

<HEADLINE> Credit Guarantees Help Private Economy In Southwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 6 (Xinhua)-- China's first private business
credit guarantee service center is helping private businesses in
Guiyang, capital city of Guizhou Province, to get easier access
to bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The Guiyang Reflection Film Co. Ltd., which is a member of the
Guiyang Credit Guarantee Center designed specially for private
businesses, recently borrowed a much-needed 1-million yuan loan
from the city commercial bank in just three days, something that
would have been almost impossible without the center sharing its
financial risk.
</P>
<P>
China is encouraging the private sector more by increasing
credit. For many small and medium-sized private companies,
however, it is still hard to get a mortgage or find guarantees
for a bank loan. But, with the new credit guarantee service, the
problem is more readily solved, according to Xiao Yue, a Guiyang
Administration for Industry and Commerce official.
</P>
<P>
The center got authorization from the People's Bank of China
Guiyang Branch and is now selecting 50,000 member firms from a
list of 72,900 businesses to build its trust fund up to 5 billion
yuan. The city government has also allocated 3 million yuan to
help the business.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector has shown its trust in the center's ability
and has offered a favorable credit rating to allow it to provide
1.5 billion yuan in loans to private firms.

<HEADLINE> New Euro Gains Against Kenyan Shilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The newly launched Euro currency made a
strong debut on the Kenyan money market to exchange with the Shilling at a
mean rate of 72.9325 Shillings, according to statistics released by the
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
 The Euro was bought at 72.6351 Shillings and sold at 73.2298 Shillings
at Tuesday's trading, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the CBK advised Kenyan investors not to replace all their
foreign exchange reserves with Euro, at least in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
 Local banks have equally been told to closely monitor movements of the
Euro in relation to other international currencies, noted the CBK weekly
update.
</P>
<P>
 Most of the local commercial banks traded the Euro beginning this week.
</P>
<P>
The Euro offered Tuesday at an average exchange rate of 72.94 Shillings
for buying, while average selling stood at 73.70 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
 The Kenyan Shilling edged lower against the Dollar in active trade on
Tuesday, and commercial bank dealers said the market had nearly adjusted to
the introduction of a single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
 Dealers also said they saw some Dollar demand from the corporates
sector and that Dollar inflows mainly from the tea sector have failed to
match that demand.

<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Coca Cola firm in Zambia is still
optimistic that the Zambian government will keep its promise to reduce the
high excise duty on Coca Cola, Zambia Daily Mail reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted company managing director Ian Ackerman as saying
that one day the governent will look at the issue of the duty, and bring it
to more economical le "We have continued hold meetings with government
and other relevant authorities over the matter, and we are hopeful that one
day the discussions would bear fruit," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his firm will not move out of the country despite losing
business, which has now slumped to about 75 percent to imported Coca Cola
from the country's neighboring countries and local produced juices.

Coca Cola has pledged some 75 million U.S. dollars investment over a
five-year program should the government abides by the agreement to reduce
the excise duty.
</P>
<P>
Last September the firm increased the prices of its products, Coca Cola,
 fanta and sprite by 80 percent from 500 kwacha to 900 kwacha a bottle
because of what it called high duty imposed on raw materials.

drinks from 25 percent to five percent, but failed to meet its promise.

these countries included Panama and Grenada, with which China has
no diplomatic relations.
</P>

Last March, a Chinese culture delegation attended an
international conference on cultural policies sponsored by United

<HEADLINE> Nyerere: Privatization Leads to Commercial Colonization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 DAR ES SALAAM, January 6 (Xinhua) --The on-going privatization move in
Tanzania will put the economy in the hands of foreigners and lead to the
commercial colonization of the country, Tanzanian founding president Julius
Nyerere has warned.
</P>
<P>
He told a religious seminar in the northern town of Arusha Monday that
developed countries' pushing for opening the market and privatizing the
economy is for their own gains, media reports here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The push for privatization in Tanzania is the push for the
foreignization of the economy, " Nyerere said.
</P>
<P>
The well-known African statesman also warned that developed countries
are preparing a law called the "Multi-national Investment Agreement" (MIA)
which would give their investors more freedom to invest in third world
countries at the expense of indigenous businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"When MIA becomes a binding law, it will be mandatory for authorities
in Tanzania to treat an investor from Michigan the same way as they treat a
Chagga tribe investor from Hai (in the north)," he said. "There is not a
single Tanzanian investor who can go to the United States and start a
business there."
</P>
<P>
Nyerere singled out the pending privatization of the National Bank of
Commerce (1997) Limited as being a result of pressure from the rich and
powerful developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"They come to Tanzania and tell us: 'Open up your market.' Then they
say: 'NBC is too big, we can't compete it...privatize it, break it up.'
Really, this is the arrogance of power," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, in their countries, when banks are in trouble, they don't
privatize them. Instead, they are helped by the State or merge with another
profit-making banking institution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere also said that the privatization of Tanzanian economy would
continue to increase the growing gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
"It is very easy to produce millionaires... What is difficult is the
abolition of poverty," he said. "It has always been true everywhere in the
liberalization and privatization of the economy, the small minority make
money, become rich and powerful while the vast majority become poorer and
poorer."
</P>
<P>
Nyerere made the remarks on Monday evening when addressing the fourth
Provincial Chapter of the East African Province of the Holy Ghost held at
the Spiritan Missionary Seminary at Njiro on the outskirts of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The chapter was attended by more than 30 delegates from Tanzania, Kenya,
 Uganda, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau,
Congo-Brazzaville, and countries from Europe and North America.

"I played much better and I was thinking more and took my
time," Dokic said.

signed cultural agreements with Central Africa and Yemen, new
executive plans with over 20 countries, and a memorandum of
understanding with Canada.

<HEADLINE> Famine Looms Large in N. Kenya Due to Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A famine disaster looms large in North
Eastern Province of Kenya as the effects of drought start to bite.
</P>
<P>
 Over one million people in the province are faced with an intense
shortage of food and water, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
 The government has already started distributing famine relief food to
alleviate the acute food shortage that has been caused by the drought,
Minister of State Gideon Ndambuki was quoted as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
For about two months, the short rains have failed in the major
district of
Garissa, Wajir, Moyale, Mandera, Marsabit and Isiolo as the reality of
starvation hit the province, said the report.
</P>
<P>
 An official with the World Food Program (WFP) also confirmed that the
 famine situation in the province is real and urgent action is needed to
curtail the calamity.
</P>
<P>
 "We are aware of the situation in the province though we cannot give a
 substantial account just yet though we are meant to believe that Mandera
is the worst-hit," said the official.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Appeals for Urgent Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick
Sumaye has appealed to the international community to provide urgent food
assistance to his country as 13 out of 20 Mainland regions are facing an
acute shortage of food.
</P>
<P>
From now to July, Tanzania will have a food deficit of some 600,000
tons, Sumaye was quoted by Wednesday's media reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing foreign envoys here Tuesday, he said a recent
government survey ending last week found that 13 regions on the mainland
are seriously affected by food shortage, with eight of them being
vulnerable to famine.
</P>
<P>
In the northeastern, central and coastal parts of the country, most of
the planted crops had dried up due to lack of precipitation in the short
rains season starting last October. The food situation is worsened by
attacks of pests, rodents and quelea quelea birds.
</P>
<P>
"In some regions, people are reported to have depleted their food
stocks and they are now facing serious shortages...this would lead to
famine for the poorest and most vulnerable of our people," the Prime
Minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that donors will come to assist us in solving this
serious food crisis," he said. Meanwhile, he added the government "is doing
all within its disposal to avert possible loss of lives among the general
public."
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said the government has released 35,000 tons of food from the
Strategic Grain Reserves to the market and will import 50,000 tons of food
on emergency basis.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has waived duties on maize imports to
encourage commercial imports, and advised farmers to plant drought
resistant and early maturing crops.

<HEADLINE> Russia Beats Canada to Win World Junior Hockey Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia defeated Canada 3-2 and
won the gold at the world junior hockey championship in Winnipeg
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in seven years that Russia grabbed
the gold of the world junior hockey tournament.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's game, the Russians dominated over their
Canadian counterpart from the beginning right to the end.
</P>
<P>
Russian player Artem Tschoubarov opened the scoring near the
end of the first period.
</P>
<P>
Canada tied the score 1-1 in the first half of the second
period, but was left behind after Russia scored in the second
half of the period.
</P>
<P>
In a power play of the third period, Canada scored for the
second time, thus tied the score 2-2 and forced an overtime.
</P>
<P>
It was Russian player Tschoubarov who brought an end to the
match, when he scored for the second time of the night, 5:13 into
the overtime.
</P>
<P>
To the disappointment of thousands of Canadian hockey fans,
Canada's hope to regain the title of world championship once
again fell apart.
</P>
<P>
However, it was a great improvement from last year, when
Canada was placed eighth at the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Slovakia beat Sweden 5-4 and won the bronze
medal.

<HEADLINE> Vegetables in Beijing Now Fresher, But More Expensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Most Beijing residents say they
are satisfied with the variety of vegetables now available in the
marketplace, but think that prices are a bit on the expensive
side, China Economic Times recently reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that this comes from a recent survey done by
the Horison Market Research Company, China Central Television,
and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Physiology Research
Institute. The 400 people surveyed ranged in age from 18 to 65.
</P>
<P>
It found that older people have a higher opinion of the
availability of vegetables and that those from 56 to 65 years old
are the most content. Only 11 percent think the prices of
vegetables are "low", and 1.2 percent, that they are "very low."
</P>
<P>
The survey found that price is only the second most important
consideration, and that freshness is what they care most about,
with 47.1 percent saying that freshness is a priority; whereas
price was most important for only 28.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The researchers also found that the tendency to bargain is not
related to sex, but rather to the age and the economic condition
of the buyer. People who sell vegetables on the open market,
where most people shop, usually set their prices to allow some
room for bargaining.
</P>
<P>
People between the ages of 18 and 35 either never bargain or
seldom do so, while older people tend to do so more, and, the
higher their incomes, the less likely they are to bargain.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say that Beijing residents are among the least
likely to bargin, while people in the South are more
price-conscious, and they attribute this to both natural and
social factors.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 6 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was seriously
wounded in a bomb attack in south Lebanon on Tuesday, the National
Broadcasting Network radio reported Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources as saying that a roadside
bomb was detonated by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, when an Israeli convoy passed by the Arnoun
village in the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied border zone.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the convoy were en route to an army base
near Beaufort Castle, a crusader fortress in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The wounded soldier was evacuated to hospital in Israel, the
radio added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first casualty the Israeli occupation force
suffered in the region since the start of this year. Last year, a
total of 24 Israeli soldiers were killed in south Lebanon while 42
Lebanese guerrillas lost their lives in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Israel carve out a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli troops from the
country.

<HEADLINE> Steffi Graf: Play Well and Enjoy Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Former World No.1 tennis
player Steffi Graf said here on Wednesday that she cares more
about playing well and enjoying the game than rankings.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who arrived here Tuesday night after a one-day delay due
to bad weather, will play in a three-day tournament along with
several top women players including Venus and Serena Williams and
Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
"In the last few weeks I was able to train very well ... and I
hope I can keep on going and it is good for me to have a couple
of matches to start the year," Graf told a press conference after
her first training session before the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"I need a few tournaments to gain confidence and get in the
rhythm," said Graf, who was ranked No.1 for a record 377 weeks
and is currently on 9th in WTA rankings.
</P>
<P>
"It took me quite a while to start off the year after a lot of
setbacks," including the wrist and knee operations. But now she
has "nothing to worry about physically since she went out at the
end of last year and played."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of retaining world's No.1, the
30-year-old German said it is something that she doesn't "worry
too much about." "For me it's about enjoying."
</P>
<P>
Having won 106 career titles including 21 Grand Slam events,
four Australian Open titles, five French Open tiles, seven
Wimbledon titles and five U.S. Open titles, Graf said: "I want to
play well and that's my main goal."
</P>
<P>
"It is a thrill to be in the court playing to tough players
and getting the atmosphere of the crowd -- they are really behind
me. I still enjoy so much. That's why I am still around."
</P>
<P>
Graf denied the rumor that she will retire soon.
</P>
<P>
Playing in the "Super-Power" Challenge Cup in Hong Kong for a
second time, Graf said she is happy to visit places she has been
to and will spend some time in local antique markets.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Ship Abducted in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A large commercial ferry transporting
miscellaneous goods was abducted by Somali gunmen Tuesday off the coast of
southern port town of Kismayu.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Wednesday said the vessel which sailed from the
port of Dar es Salaam on its way to India faced technical difficulties off
Somalia's shores very close to its sea border with Kenya two days ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the VHF radio reports in Kismayu, 500 km south of the
capital Mogadishu, the vessel was then brought forcefully to the natural
port of Bur Gabo village along the coast, a few kilometers south of Kismayu.
</P>
<P>
The vessel called Johana is also carrying 21 crew member mainly
Africans and Indians with a few Turkish and Greeks. Unconfirmed reports
said the ferry is transporting commercial goods worth a few million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gunman holding the vessel who belong to the Islamic fundamentalist
group of Al-Itihad Al-Islam said they brought all crew members down from
the ship to the village where they are being fed and treated well.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mohamed Ahmed who spoke for the Al-Itihad Al-Islam in Kismayu said
they are setting no conditions for the release of the ship and its crew
members. However, he said they will be asking the owners of the vessel to
reimburse them for the money they had spent for the services they have
rendered to the crew of the ship during their stay with them.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed who did not disclose how much money is involved in this
business also noted that they have tried to assist the ship technically,
but lack of spare parts made their efforts fruitless. It is known that
the Al- Itihad men will not at least loot the vessel, no matter how much
money they demand for release of the ship.
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time that a vessel is kidnapped in the southern
region of Lower Jubba by Somali gunmen. An Italian owned vessel, but
registered in Mombasa of Kenya is still being held in the coastal town of
Eyl of the northeast. A local court has fined the vessel for conducting
illegal fishing in Somali waters late last month.
</P>
<P>
The court had ordered the ship to pay 400,000 U.S. Dollars while its
Italian captain and his 32 crew members are fined a total of 100,000
Dollars after which they can still be substituted with a long term sentence.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls on Pakistan to Encounter Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran has called on Pakistan to
seriously confront the menace of terrorism and put the murderers
of Iranian citizens assassinated in that country on trial.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi issued
the call Tuesday during the three-day talks between Pakistani
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad Khan and Iranian officials, the
Islamic Republic News Agency IRNA reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A number of Iranian citizens have been murdered by
unidentified assailants in Pakistan during the past few
years. Tehran has been urging Islamabad to identify and bring the
criminals to justice.
</P>
<P>
Asefi told IRNA that Ahmad Khan praised Iran's self-restraint
in the wake of the recent developments and promised that Pakistan
would follow up the murder cases and punish the assassins quickly.
</P>
<P>
He said that both sides in the talks underlined the necessity
of strengthening bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian side described the practical and serious measures
taken by Pakistan to remove misunderstandings as a preface to
boost Tehran-Islamabad ties and considered it as a ground for
future visits to Pakistan of ranking Iranian officials, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that no date has been fixed for a visit by Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi to Islamabad after his Pakistani
counterpart Sartaj Aziz extended his invitation to Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ahmad Khan and Iranian officials also discussed
Tehran-Islamabad cooperation in economic, cultural and mass media
fields and it was decided that Islamabad would make new studies on
purchase of oil from Iran and the construction of a joint refinery
in that country.

<HEADLINE> India Dismisses US Demand to Specify Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
dismissed as inconsequential the demand by the United States to
spell out its need for the minimum nuclear deterrence, the
Hindustan Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Press Trust of India (PTI) here
Tuesday, the United States Ambassador to India Richard F. Celeste
asked India to specify in "concrete terms" its requirements of
nuclear deterrence so that it is not seen as an "open-ended
threat" to its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times quoted sources in the Ministry of External
Affairs as saying Tuesday that India had already clarified its
position on the U.S. demand in one of the earlier rounds of talks
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the ministry referred to a recent print media
interview in which External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said
"the minimum nuclear deterrent is not a fixity".
</P>
<P>
Informed circles here expressed surprise over the revival of
the U.S. demand on the eve of a scheduled new round of talks here
later this month between Jaswant Singh and U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott on nuclear-related issues.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with PTI, Celeste said India's nuclear tests
last May "marked a kind of punctuation point" in relations between
Washington and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"Some expression of what India really wants and needs and
strives to achieve in a reasonably specific time, not specific in
numbers, but a range, is important to not only helping the U.S.
understand but also specific neighbors to understand....So that
there isn't an open-ended threat," Celeste said.
</P>
<P>
Celeste said the Indian government should make it clear as to
"how many missile systems and warheads does India need to have a
minimum nuclear deterrent".
</P>
<P>
The American envoy felt it was a transition period for
Indo-U.S. relations in 1998 which he termed as a "difficult year".
</P>
<P>
No tangible results were made in the previous rounds of talks
between the two countries in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Secret Agents Involved in Iran's Recent Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Intelligence Ministry
has announced that some of its agents were behind the recent
mysterious murders of an opposition leader and several dissident
writers in Tehran, local daily Iran News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, a few of our own devious colleagues ... were
among those who committed these crimes," said a statement issued
by the ministry Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ministry has succeeded in identifying
and arresting the network responsible for the killings and handed
them over for prosecution. But it did not mention how many people
were arrested in the connection.
</P>
<P>
In November and December, leader of the Iran Nation Party
Darius Forouhar and his wife were stabbed to death at home and at
least two dissident writers were then mysteriously killed in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The killings aroused grave concern of the government and
President Mohammad Khatami ordered the ministries of interior and
intelligence to form a special committee to probe into the cases.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the Intelligence Ministry said it condemns
any crime against any human being and any threat against the
safety and security of citizens.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also vowed to uproot the elements instigating
political violence and guarantee security in the country and
continue to investigate the murders in order to identify other
culprits involved in the cases.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sets Targets to Reduce youth Suicides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Ministry of
Health has set targets to reduce the suicide rates to 30 for every
100,000 young men from the current 37.8 and five for every
100,000 young women from the current 13.9 in the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest ministry's report, the rate of suicide
among people aged 15 to 24 has not been improving in recent years
and suicide causes an average of 138 deaths a year in that age
group.
</P>
<P>
Although the male suicide rate has stabilized during the 1990s,
the female suicide rate has been rising since 1993, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, psychiatric problems, especially
depression, antisocial disorders and alcohol or drug abuse, are
major risk factors, with research showing that 90 percent of young
New Zealanders committing suicide have at least one mental
disorder.
</P>
<P>
The worsening suicide rates suggest that mental health
promotion needs improvement, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But other suicide risk factors include poor childhood
circumstances such as poor parenting and sexual abuse, poor
educational qualifications and low income, it added.
</P>
<P>
The targets for cutting the youth suicide rate should be
"challenging" because of its importance, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans to Close More U.S. Military Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will ask Congress for permission to close more U.S. military
bases to help defray the cost of a major increase in U.S. defense
spending, a White House official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to believe that we need authority from Congress
-- legislative authority -- to conduct two additional base
closing rounds," said Bob Bell, special assistant to the
president for national security affairs.
</P>
<P>
Bell said the administration wanted authority to start closing
bases from fiscal year 2001, which begins on October 1, 2000, and
estimated this would save "several billion" U.S. dollars during
the military's six-year budget window through 2005.
</P>
<P>
The request, which will be sent to Republican-held Congress on
February 1 as part of Clinton's new budget, would be the first
major increase in U.S. defense spending in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Closing military bases is highly unpopular in Congress, where
legislators are reluctant to antagonize the constituents who suffe
r when military facilities are shut down.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Defense Secretary William Cohen tried
unsuccessfully to win congressional authority for base closings
in 2001 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
Bell said Congress's refusal in recent years to allow the
Pentagon to close more bases is among the key reasons for a
decline in the readiness of some U.S. military units.
</P>
<P>
"In the longer term, of course, the savings would be much,
much greater," Bell added, saying it takes several years for the
lion's share of the savings to be realized.
</P>
<P>
As part of the administration's lobbying effort to get the new
military spending, the chiefs of U.S. military services on
Tuesday urged Congress to approve the money, saying it was the
minimum needed to keep troops and equipment ready for battle.
</P>
<P>
The heads of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps all
said they would favor closing more U.S. military bases to help
pay for increased modernization and readiness.
</P>
<P>
On January 2, Clinton said he would ask Congress for an
additional 12 billion dollars in defense spending next year as
the first part of a six-year, 110 billion dollars drive to
sharpen the readiness of the military.

Planning Commission and it is expected to be approved by the
Ministry of Finance shortly," A.K.M. Enayet Ullah, Bangladesh
Handloom board chairman, was quoted by The Financial Express daily
Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The credit was part of a 500-million-taka (about 10.31 million
dollars) credit program for the weavers, which was approved by the
Executive Committee for National Economic Council on November 4
last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The project was aimed at providing working capital to the
marginal weavers with a view to keeping the country's handlooms
operational, boosting the country's handloom fabrics, ensuring
employment opportunities and improving the socio-economic lives of
the poor weavers.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, the project would be implemented on an
experimental basis for two years from July 1998 to June 2000, and
the next program would be undertaken on the basis of the two
years' performance.
</P>
<P>
Some 41,267 handloom units were expected to come under the
credit program in the first phase.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest survey by the Bureau of Statistics,
some 184,808 handloom units out of a total 501,834 in the country
had to be closed down due to lack of necessary working capital.
</P>
<P>
And a large number of the 317,026 handlooms in operation was
facing closure due to lack of working capital and other logistic
support.
</P>
<P>
The weavers, having one to five handloom units, would be
organized through groups for disbursing loans. They would have to
deposit 10 taka (about 20.6 U.S. cents) a week in their savings
accounts and would be selected for the loans with their saving
performance of minimum 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate against the loans was fixed at 10 percent a
year, and the weavers would have to repay the loan in some 36
installments in three years.
</P>
<P>
The total demand for loan was estimated at 3.14 billion taka
(about 67.74 million dollars) in the country's handloom sector,
the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Rules out Republic in Time for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government Wednesday ruled out an Australian republic in time for
the Sydney 2000 Olympics, backing the prime minister as the person
to open the Games.
</P>
<P>
Acting Prime Minister Tim Fischer dismissed opposition calls
for the government to speed up the republic process so an
Australian president could open the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The government will hold a referendum on a republic in November
and, if successful, Australia will become a republic in 2001,
months after the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Fischer strongly backed Prime Minister John Howard, who has
renewed his push to open the Games.
</P>
<P>
"On the question of who opens, well it should be the prime
minister of the day," Fischer told the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation News Radio.
</P>
<P>
Fischer rejected suggestions Howard's partisan post should
preclude him from opening the Games.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister of the country is in this sense the
equivalent to the President of the U.S.A., and Ronald Reagan, Bill
Clinton, both very partisan, one Republican, one Democrat, opened
their respective Olympics," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite properly the role of the prime minister and we
should not get tangled up with the timing of important
constitutional change.
</P>
<P>
"A country does not change the timing of its constitutional
change to fit into the program and timetable of a particular,
albeit very major sporting event, the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Australian Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley wants the job
to go to Governor-General Sir William Deane or if Australia
becomes a republic before the Games, to the Australian president.
</P>
<P>
"It is common knowledge that the office of prime minister in
this country is a partisan one," Beazley said.
</P>
<P>
Beazley said if the referendum voted for the republic there
would be time for an Australian republic to be established in time
for the Games.
</P>
<P>
If the referendum voted down the republic, the appropriate
person to open the Olympics Games would be the Governor-General,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia has virtually ruled out any possibility of the Queen
opening the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Spate of Bombings Alerts Thais </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has issued orders to
protect people's lives and property and ensure social stability.
</P>
<P>
Major newspapers quoted intelligence reports as saying that the
series of bombings might be politically motivated and intended to
discredit the government and cause damage rather than take lives.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said: "According to the assessment of some intelligence
officials, the recent incidents could be aimed at creating
confusion to a point the government can no longer maintain peace."
</P>
<P>
But government officials refused to say who could be behind
the attacks. "I think they are not ordinary people but specialists
in explosives," Chuan noted.
</P>
<P>
A blast went off during the December 6-20 Asian Games, damaging
the Democracy Monument in downtown Bangkok. On the New Year's eve,
a bomb struck a police station, devastating its parking lot. An
explosion was also reported at the site of the residence of Chiang
Mai's prison warden early on Monday. Leaflets criticizing the
government were found on the scene. Also on Monday police defused
a bomb at a condominium in downtown Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Because of the bombings, some nightspots were deserted and
patrons were scared away, raising fears that the tourism industry
might be affected.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said leading figures in certain political groups
were suspected of involvement in some of the bombings and were
being watched.
</P>
<P>
The army and police were also carrying out internal
investigations into their own personnel that were suspected of
having a hand in the bombings. Press reports linked the police
station blast to a row among senior police officers who could not
agreed on the share of interests from an entertainment complex.
</P>
<P>
As part of security measures, army-police units have stepped up
routine patrols to prevent military personnel from moonlighting as
guards. The army is also taking measures to weed out unruly
officers from entertainment areas, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
But the army denied that military personnel were engaged in the
bombings. Earlier, Wattanachai Wuttisiri, deputy defense minister,
urged the media to stop speculating, saying it would only cause
confusion. But He pledged to cooperate with investigators in
bringing to justice any officers involved.
</P>
<P>
Pol Maj-Gen Pitthaya Charoenpanit, deputy commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police, said he had ruled out all non-political
motives in the police station blast.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there were conflicts between two senior
officers at the station but did not think they would have launched
the attack.
</P>
<P>
"They would know that they would come under close observation
or even under investigation if they did do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the blast can be blamed on mafiosi either,
because they know their own interests will be damaged if the
situation escalates," he said.
</P>
<P>
Police and government seem to have a pat explanation for the
blast, the real motive of which will remain a mystery, said a
source close to the investigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Peru's fish exports last year fell
from 1.4 billion U.S. dollars to 580 million dollars, the
Association of National Fisheries reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Four major fish products were particularly affected, said the
association.
</P>
<P>
Exports of fish powder amounted to 330 million dollars, while
fish oil reached 18 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, exports of tinned and frozen fish were
respectively 39 million and 180 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The association attributed the slump to the El Nino
phenomenon, which resulted in fewer fish in Peruvian waters.
</P>
<P>
The country's catch of fish last year was 4.1 million tons,
down 47 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the association predicted the fish catch and exports
would rise again this year.
</P>
<P>
The catch and exports are expected to reach 6.6 million tons
and 930 million dollars respectively.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia's Top Kosovo Official Raps OSCE Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's top
administrative official in charge of Kosovo Veljko Odalovic
alleged that observers of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) did not honor their obligations.
</P>
<P>
Odalovic was quoted by a Tanjug news agency report Tuesday as
telling the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that OSCE observers
in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo were not serious in doing
their job.
</P>
<P>
As provided by the agreement signed last October by
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke, the observers have the mandate to oversee a cease-fire
between Serb security forces and militant ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
According to Odalovic, Yugoslavia had observed the document
thoroughly by pulling its special forces out from Kosovo,
allowing NATO aircraft to fly monitoring missions over the area,
and working closely with international humanitarian groups.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, militant ethnic Albanians in Kosovo since
have launched over 400 attacks on Serb police and civilians,
killing more than 40 of them and driving many Serbian and
Montenegrin residents out from their homes in about a dozen
villages.
</P>
<P>
Besides blaming OSCE observers for inaction in stopping the
attacks, Odalovic said the OSCE personnel also forgot that the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia "is a sovereign state" and "has
the right to defend its borders."

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that Iraq has violated an agreement with the United
Nations by refusing to give visas to some American and British
workers from U.N. humanitarian programs.
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion by the Iraqis that American and British
workers cannot be protected is a rationale we regard as phony, a
blatant attempt to violate U.N. principles and disrupt U.N.
operations," State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on Monday sent the United Nations a message saying it
could no longer guarantee the safety of some U.S. and British
workers involved in U.N. humanitarian programs after the two
countries bombed Iraq, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 100
Iraqi lives.
</P>
<P>
The message listed one American and 13 Britons who would not
get their visas renewed or would have to leave when their
contracts for U.N. "oil-for-food" humanitarian programs expired.
</P>
<P>
Rubin declined to say what the United States would do if Iraq
persisted in excluding some Americans from the U.N. humanitarian
programs.
</P>
<P>
"What we can do is show that we're going the extra mile by
providing funds, assistance, expertise, and equipment to the
effort to help feed, clothe and provide medicine," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Adjusts Taxation Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
announced here today that China has decided to adjust a number of
taxation and revenue distribution policies effective on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng told a press conference
this morning that these taxation policies to be adjusted involve
foreign-funded enterprises, imported goods and economic and
technological development zones.
</P>
<P>
According to Xiang, the policy of tax rebates for
foreign-funded enterprises established before 1994 has been
terminated, while the policy of "no levy, no rebates" on the
exports by foreign-funded enterprises established before 1994
will be extended by two years to the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said that the import duty of 1,014 tax items in the categor
ies of textiles, toys and forestry products will be lowered by
eight to 78 percent.
</P>
<P>
Preferential taxation policies concerning some 50 economic and
technological development zones have also been revised.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that in 1999 the Chinese government will also
adjust and standardize the taxation policies governing processing
trade. The export tax rebates for general trade will be gradually
and selectively raised, while an overall clarification will be c
arried out on due tax break and exemption policies.
</P>
<P>
He said that the termination of due preferential taxation
policies and the cut of import duty will be conducive to further
standardizing levy system, rationalizing revenue distribution
relations and promoting the development of foreign trade, so as
to provide a good social environment for enterprises' fair
competition.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Not to Sacrifice National Interests For WTO Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supachai is one of the four major contenders bidding for the
post of WTO director general. The WTO Council will try to decide
this month who will replace current WTO chief Renato Ruggiero who
is scheduled to leave at the end of April. Thailand is hoping that
the United States, which has been tightlipped, will back Supachai.
</P>
<P>
The sources on Tuesday quoted Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
as saying Thailand would not offer anything in return for support
from the United States. Chuan would send a second letter to U.S.
President Bill Clinton to sound out the U.S. position, according
to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Despite mounting pressure among the 132 members of the world's
largest trading group to quickly decide which candidate should
take over the WTO post, the final decision may be further delayed
as the United States and European Union have not decided whom they
will support.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Foreign Ministry has convinced diplomats from
France, Portugal, Greece and Spain, and would try to do the same
with envoys from Austria, Italy, Chile, Pakistan, Germany,
Colombia, South Africa, Sweden and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said earlier that he was
confident Supachai's portfolio would impress the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Supachai is seen as a bridge between the developed and
developing countries because he has seen Thailand in crisis and
has implemented part of the reform process which is based on the
country's continued commitment to open trade.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. may not feel comfortable with the idea of a new chief
from a developing country leading world trade, analysts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka police have launched a
special operation to identify and initiate tough action against
policemen who are backing gangsters and working hand in glove with
underworld elements.
</P>
<P>
Kotakadeniya, senior Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of police,
said Tuesday that the upsurge in criminal activities in the
country could be attributed to certain police officers helping
underworld gangsters.
</P>
<P>
Information relating to such involvements is in the process of
being collated from police stations countrywide.
</P>
<P>
The DIG has also appealed for public assistance and cooperation
to accomplish the task of bringing to book policemen with
underworld connections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that police have determined to come down
very hard on all underworld criminals to arrest crime rates.
Kotakadeniya told media that they have 30 gang leaders to be dealt
with this year.

<HEADLINE> China to Standardize Levy Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
said here today that China's financial and taxation reform in
1999 will focus on the standardization of levy management.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng said at a press conference
this morning that the reform on the levying system will be first
carried out on roads and vehicles, which have been involved in
serious illegal and irrational charging problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts will be made to implement the reform
according to law as early as possible within this year.
</P>
<P>
The financial authorities are also designing a plan for rural
levying reform, which aims to clarify taxes and fees, rationalize
revenue distribution and cut the burden on rural residents in
three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 China revoked a total of 727 items of illegal or
irrational funds and fees, which helped cut a total of some 37
billion yuan as burdens on enterprises within the year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Makes Progress in Fight Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar continued its efforts in
drug eradication in 1998 and made progress.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1998, a nation-wide campaign to collect
baseline data on poppy cultivation and drug addicts was launched
with an aim of making correct assessment on the actual opium yield
and the number of drug addicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that in the country there were 61,236
hectares of poppy cultivation that would yield 665.28 tons raw
opium and could be refined into 66.52 tons of heroin. Total drug
addicts reportedly reached 66,463.
</P>
<P>
In February, Myanmar ceremonially burnt down for the 12th time
in Yangon a total of 5,759 kg of seized narcotic drugs including
898 kg of heroin, 4,587 kg of opium and 2.84 million stimulant
tablets.
</P>
<P>
In the same month, experts of Myanmar and the United States
carried out poppy yield surveys in the country's Shan state for
the fourth time since 1993 under the two countries' anti-drug
program.
</P>
<P>
In March, a mission of the United Nations Drug Control Program
(UNDCP) visited Yangon and worked with Myanmar officials to draft
a 10-year project for the elimination of poppy cultivation and
development of opium substitute undertakings in the country.
</P>
<P>
Of the four UNDCP integrated rural development projects in
Myanmar, three have been completed and the remaining one is under
implementation.
</P>
<P>
In the same month, a 21-country regional seminar on alternative
development for poppy cultivation was held in Yangon with Japan's
financial support to exchange information and experiences in the
fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
In July, a national training workshop under a six-country
(China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam) memorandum
of understanding for sub-regional cooperation on drug control took
place in Yangon to strengthen the capacity of the signatories in
project design and management, following the work-out in Bangkok
in July 1997 of 11 projects on law enforcement, supply reduction
and demand reduction.
</P>
<P>
In December, the Kokang area in northern Shan state began
commercial production of buckwheat, a kind of opium-substitute
crop.  The formal launching of buckwheat production marked one of
Myanmar's achievements in its endeavor to eliminate drugs in the
year.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimation, in the 1998-99 fiscal year
which began in April, a total of over 5,898 hectares could be
placed under poppy substitution crops including paddy, corn,
sugarcane and Japanese buckwheat.
</P>
<P>
It is further estimated that a total of 4,916 hectares could
also be put under other substitute crops in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Besides in the first six months of 1998, Myanmar seized a total
of 4,927 kilograms of narcotics including 219 kg of heroin and
4,471 kg of opium, destroying 15 heroin refineries and 8,000
hectares of poppy plantations.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has laid down two strategies of eradication of narcotic
drugs -- designating drug eradication and prevention activities as
a national duty and gradual elimination of poppy cultivation by
promoting the standard of living of the national races.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has vowed to totally eliminate poppy cultivation in 15
years.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Issue 500m U.S. Dollars in Samurai Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand plans to issue 500
Million U.S. dollars in Samurai bonds by March to be insured by
the Japanese government as part of its bail-out plan for regional
economies, the Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda was quoted as saying
that the bonds would be issued by the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year bonds would be guaranteed by the Finance Ministry
and denominated in yen. After the issue, funds raised would be
swapped for U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said the Japanese Ministry of Trade and Industry would
provide credit insurance for the bond issues, which would be
privately placed in the Tokyo market.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials are selecting underwriters for the bonds.
</P>
<P>
The plan offers 30 billion U.S. dollars in financial aid to
crisis-stricken Asian countries. South Korea, Malaysia and
Indonesia have signaled interest borrowing from the program.
</P>
<P>
Japan had earlier approved 1.85 Billion U.S. dollars in
assistance through the plan for Thailand in the form of medium-and
long-term loans from Japanese Export-Import Bank and Japan's
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund. The fund will be used to
support industry development and social welfare program.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Iraq Against Challenging No-Fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that its patience was limited with Iraq's repeated
"violation" of no-fly zones and warned it could stage a
"surprising" new air strike against the country.
</P>
<P>
"We have shown our willingness to strike with surprising force
in the past, and that remains an option in the future," Pentagon
spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after a clash earlier in the day when U.S.
Air Force and navy warplanes fired six missiles at four Iraqi
fighters over the southern no-fly zone in Iraq. The Pentagon
claimed the missiles missed their targets.
</P>
<P>
It was the third confrontation in eight days, showing an
escalation of tension between the United States and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said it would no longer recognize the no-fly zones
imposed after the Gulf War in 1991, saying they were an "illegal
action, outside U.N. Security Council resolutions and
international legitimacy".

<HEADLINE> Albania Urges Unification of Kosovo Albanian Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Rexhep
Mejdani, in his first open meeting with the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) leaders on Tuesday, urged the unification
of rival ethnic Albanian political groups in Serbia's province of
Kosovo in order to find an acceptable political solution to the
Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
During a two-hour meeting with KLA political representative
Adem Demaci, Mejdani said, "It is time to have an authoritative
voice for this dramatic reality in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Mejdani said a pan-Albanian group should be found for the
factious Kosovo Albanian political community, which has so far
failed to agree on a common strategy for resolving the Kosovo
issue.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani expressed his readiness to discuss and boost contacts
with all forces in Kosovo to reach a more realistic position.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo and People's Assembly
speaker Skender Gjinushi made a similar call in separate meetings
with Demaci later on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Milo called on Kosovo Albanian factions to coordinate their
positions and take joint political actions internationally so as
to find a fair settlement for the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Milo said he and Demaci agreed that the
only way to end the Kosovo conflict is through a combination of
diplomacy and decisive intervention by the international
community including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
</P>
<P>
Demaci said the KLA is willing to solve the Kosovo crisis
through peaceful means, but also determined to stage non-peaceful
resistance.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the Albanian leaders to meet KLA
representatives. Albania has repeatedly denied having relations
with the KLA.

COLOMBO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A new Governor for Sri Lanka's
Northwestern province has been appointed to replace Hector

The new Governor Siripala Jayaweera is a senior administrative
officer who has served in several state institutions, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Arawwawela has been shrouded in mystery. He
was appointed Governor in 1995 and reportedly had a series of
disagreements with the Northwestern Provincial Council during its
tenure which was administered by the then United National Party,
the country's main opposition.
</P>
<P>
Arawwawela's resignation and the new appointment of Jayaweera
comes at a crucial time when the Northwestern Provincial Council

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic's Budget Deficits Record High in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials from the Czech Ministry of Finance said here on
Tuesday that the country failed to fulfill its budget-balancing
program for 1998, which set both revenues and expenditures at
536.6 billion krone (about 17.88 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Instead, as economic experts here pointed out, the Czech finan
cial condition had one of its worst years in 1998, with revenues
totaling 537.5 billion Krone (about 17.92 billion U.S. dollars)
and expenditures 563.8 billion krone (18.79 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic enjoyed a short-lived financial soundness
following the adoption of the market economy. In 1994 and 1995,
the country recorded a financial surplus of 10.4 billion krone (
about 347 million dollars) and 7.3 billion krone (243 million
dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Czech's budget failed to strike a balance as an
economic downturn set in. Financial deficits in that year totaled
1.6 billion krone (53 million dollars). The figure rose to 15.7
billion krone (523 dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The parliament of the Czech Republic recently endorsed a finan
cial budget for 1999 with a deficit of 31 billion krone (1.03
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
To make up the huge deficits, the country has taken to issuing
national debt bonds.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Capital Market Reacts Positively to new </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's local bourse reacted
positively to the 1999/2000 zero-growth State Budget announced
Tuesday by President B.J. Habibie, with blue chips gaining ground
in moderate trading.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah (national currency) also perked up on news of the
conservative budget, rising to 7,825 against the U.S. dollar from
7,925 at the close of the previous day's trading, dealers said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new budget, unveiled by the president, is balanced at 218.2
trillion rupiah (about 29 billion U.S. dollars), 17.3 percent
decline over that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The budget assumes zero economic growth, 17 percent inflation
and a rupiah-U.S. dollar exchange rate of 7,500 rupiah, which
Habibie considered a reflection of positive economic developments
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The present budget, which ends March 31 1999, assumed economic
contraction of minus 12 percent, inflation of 77.63 percent and a
10,600-rupiah per dollar exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
At the closing trading Tuesday, share prices surged through the
key 400-point level, ending 3.6 percent firmer as investors bought
shares across the board.
</P>
<P>
"The market believed that all the macroeconomic assumptions in
the 1999/2000 State Budget seemed realistic," a chief dealer with
a joint venture bank said.
</P>
<P>
Money market dealers said the rupiah, which opened at
7,925/7,950 per dollar, was dull in the morning trading session,
but ultimately strengthened.
</P>
<P>
They said the rupiah's gain could also be attributed to the
27-month high of the Japanese yen to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Taking their lead from the rupiah, share prices on the Jakarta
Stock Exchange soared, with the main bench-mark price index rising
14.24 points to 408.70 on the total turnover of 221 million shares
valued at 191.47 billion rupiah (24.54 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts and brokers said the market was bullish on
Tuesday because the budget's macroeconomic assumptions were in
line with the country's dire economic condition.

LANZHOU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
has launched a campaign to rectify the local coal mining industry,
with hundreds of illegal small mines subject to closure.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that Gansu has 1,374 coal coal mines,
of them 1,300 being small ones.
</P>
<P>
Mines operating without permits or production certificates, as
well as those failing to meet environmental protection standards
will be closed, according to a provincial official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that at least 523 coal mines are subject to closure.
</P>
<P>
"Most small mines are poorly equipped and lack the technology
to guarantee safe production," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said small mines not only waste resources, prone to
accidents and create pollution, but also adversely impact the
normal order of the coal market. He cited the aforementioned
factors as the reason for the current coal inventory of 2.2
million tons.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exports to Grow 3 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Business
Economics of the Thai Commerce Ministry believes the value of
Thailand's exports will grow by 3 percent this year from an
estimated 54 billion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The revival of local financial institutions, a stable baht and
improved efficiency by exporters were behind the optimistic
forecast, Karun Kittisataporn, director-general of the department
was quoted Wednesday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
As government measures to reform the domestic financial sector
bear fruit, local lenders are expected to resume extending credit
to exporters. As well, the stability of the baht would improve
Thai exporters' confidence in entering new transactions with
foreigners, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many exporters postponed transactions in 1998 because of
fluctuations in the value of the baht, especially in the first
half of the year. Changes of one or two baht to the dollar in a
single day made it very difficult for exporters to calculate costs
and prices.

<P>
The estimated 54 billion U.S. dollars value of exports in 1998
was six percent lower than in the previous year, but the
department was sticking with its forecast of 3 percent growth for
this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of 1998, exports in dollar terms were a
6.4-percent decline to 45.27 billion U.S. dollars. Exports in
October alone were down by 12.7 percent from the same month of
1997 to 4.63 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Cuts Sports Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Prospects for Indonesian
sports this year include a potentially desperate struggle to meet
financial needs after the government has slashed the yearly
budget allocation to 60.6 billion rupiah (8 million U.S.
dollars) from 86.7 billion rupiah last year.
</P>
<P>
The fate of sports in the Southeast Asian country was sealed
here on Tuesday with President B.J Habibie's announcement of the
national budget, which has also seen an overall reduction of 17.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
"This is of course not good news for the Indonesian sports
community. And it was far from a respite for us in the wake of
the upcoming Southeast Asian Games and Sydney Olympics," said
Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Agung Laksono in response to
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister was apparently trying to brave the
stingy financial budget by saying that he remained optimistic
about prospects.
</P>
<P>
"We must be thinking positively about the next challenges. We
should all exert everything we can to do the best we can," he was
quoted by the Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which has just arrived back from the Bangkok Asian
Games last December, will be competing in the 20th Southeast
Asian Games in Brunei this August before preparing for another, e
ven tougher event in when the Olympics are held in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"We need as much as between 100 billion rupiah to 150 billion
rupiah every year including financial assistance for KONI
(Indonesian Sports Council)," he added.
</P>
<P>
The daunting shortage of funds will certainly leave the sports
world highly dependent on business entities, which have so far
traditionally borne the brunt of the financial backup.
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of funds, the minister both Southeast Asian
Games and the Sydney Olympics should be the country's priority.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, we would seem to be curtailing potential
athletes," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also did not see the reduction as a serious
threat to sports development in the country, as the government
has offset the financial aid to be given directly to the
provincial administrations.
</P>
<P>
The bailout, which is not included in the budget, earmarked
athlete scouting and the provision of sport facilities at the
provincial and regency levels.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The launch of the euro by
11 European Union countries could benefit Mexico if brokerages,
banks and the government make urgent adjustments to avoid a fall
of the peso against the new currency.
</P>
<P>
Leftist Democratic Revolution Party Senator Jorge Calderon, a
prominent economist, said on Tuesday that the peso would
eventually recover against the euro in the medium to long term.
</P>
<P>
He said that a weaker peso could even be positive for Mexican
exports to Europe if immediate adjustments were made to boost the
country's participation in European markets.
</P>
<P>
Calderon said that banks and brokerages should urgently seek
means to launch Mexican bonds on European stock markets to have
access to resources stemming from the implementation of the new
currency.
</P>
<P>
He said that Europe's single currency would modify the rules
of the international financial system by counter-balancing the
yen and the U.S. dollar.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt a positive
financial policy and expand financial expenditure in 1999, said
Xiang Huaicheng, Minister of Finance, at a press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year the financial policies yielded good
results in boosting economic growth and readjusting investment
structure, but warned that exports still on the downslide which
is accompanied by sluggish enterprise investments and consumption
demand.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the financial expenditure was to be cut this
year, it would be difficult to maintain a steady growth of
national economy.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the devastating floods in many parts of
China last summer have imposed a huge task of rehabilitation and
the reform of state-owned enterprises is now at a crucial stage,
both calling for more financial expenditure this year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Send Junior Shuttlers to SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia plans to field juniors in the Southeast Asian (SEA)
Games in Brunei Darussalam in August.
</P>
<P>
The association's deputy chief of athletes development Hadi
Nasri told reporters on Tuesday that the organization would bring
up the plan in discussion with the National Sports Council soon.
</P>
<P>
"It remains an idea but we hope the council will understand.
Our young players lack experience of a team event, while their
world-class compatriots have demonstrated their great
achievements in the Thomas and Uber Cup championships, the Asian
Games and the Olympics," Hadi was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We must give our juniors an opportunity to handle a bigger
responsibility and we think the SEA Games is the right moment.
The SEA Games is the right arena for our young players to
demonstrate their prowess," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's top guns would likely miss the Games for
bigger events such as the World Championships and the Sudirman
Cup mixed team championship, both scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
In the last SEA Games here, the Indonesian badminton team was
at full strength as it made a clean sweep.
</P>
<P>
Hadi said that second stringers like Rony Agustinus, Johan
Hadi Kusuma, Irwansyah, Yudi Suprayogi in the men's singles and
Ellen Angelina in the women's singles were expected to fill their
seniors' shoes in the August SEA Games.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to send our juniors to as many international events
as possible this year," Hadi added.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Asian Airlines' Bumpy Road to Rehabilitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the same time, air crashes, which have claimed four times as
many as lives in Asia as the rest of the world in the past 18
months, cast a shadow on increase in traffic volume.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 people have died in major airline accidents in
Asia in the past 18 months, one of the region's worst periods in
aviation.
</P>
<P>
Partly because of the financial crisis, and partly because of
the air safety problem, growth of traffic volume in the region
slowed down to about 4 percent in the 1997-98 fiscal year from 8-9
percent before the crisis.
</P>
<P>
To tide over the crisis, Asian airlines have undertaken
restructuring programs. The AAPA said that a number of its members
have either deferred or canceled their aircraft orders, while
others sold their planes to co-members.
</P>
<P>
Garuda Indonesia is undergoing a restructuring program with a
leaner fleet of 45 aircraft, from the original 57 planes, by this
year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from reducing capacity, several AAPA members have
undergoing route restructuring programs.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Asiana Airlines and Korean Air discontinued their
Seoul-Europe and Guam-Spain passenger services. Other Asian
carriers, such as Ansett Australia, Air New Zealand and Qantas,
have dropped flights to South Korea at a short notice.
</P>
<P>
As part of their restructuring programs, some of the region's
major airlines have, or are considering joining one of the global
alliances, because alliances can help airlines reduce cost in the
shorter term by sharing facilities and staff, consolidating
suppliers and canceling redundant flights.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific Airways has announced that it would become part
of the new "oneworld" alliance, comprising Cathay, British
Airways, American Airlines, Canadian Airlines and Qantas Airways.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Airlines has not disclosed its plan for joining an
alliance, but it has cooperative agreements with Lufthansa and Air
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there is a good possibility that Singapore
Airlines will join the Star Alliance, which has already included
United Airlines, Lufthansa, Air Canada and Thai Airways. And Air
New Zealand, Ansett International and Ansett Australia have
planned to join the alliance this month.
</P>
<P>
With all these rehabilitation measures in place, airline
officials estimated a recovery may still take two to three years,
and by then, traffic will growth by 5 percent a year.

<HEADLINE> hke010604 - Feature: Asian Airlines' Bumpy Road to Rehabilitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The temporary closure of the
Philippine Airlines (PAL), Asia's oldest airline, last September,
reflected the worst-case scenario for the region's carriers, which
struggled with the financial crisis in 1998.
</P>
<P>
For Asian airlines, the year 1999 could still be a very tough
one, as financial problems, lower traffic volume, and air safety
will make their road to rehabilitation very bumpy.
</P>
<P>
Take PAL as an example. Despite President Joseph Estrada's
promise that the government will rescue PAL at any cost, the
57-year-old airline would fold up again if it fails to find a
strategic partner in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The government has made it clear that the state will not
provide any money to save PAL, and the airline has to find support
from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Since it resumed domestic and international flights last
October, PAL has not found a way to make good on some 2.1 billion
U.S. dollars in debts, although its secret talks over a
partnership with the Hongkong-based Cathay Pacific Airways and the
U.S.-based Northwest are reportedly going on.
</P>
<P>
Financial difficulties, compounded by a series of labor
strikes, forced PAL to seek relief from payment of 2.1 billion
dollars in debts last June due to cash flow problems.
</P>
<P>
PAL registered a net loss of 6.1 billion pesos (153 million
dollars) in the first half of the 1997-98 fiscal year ended last
September, compared with a net loss of 2.1 billion pesos (52.7
million dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Just like PAL, many Asian airlines suffered financial loss in
1998. National flag carrier Malaysian Airline System posted a net
loss of 441.1 million ringgit (116.1 million dollars) for the
first half ended on September 30, compared with a net profit of
23.5 million ringgit (6.19 million dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Also, Singapore Airlines' net profit fell 24 percent in the
first half ended in September.
</P>
<P>
Based on figures from the Association of Asia-Pacific Airlines
(AAPA), which groups 19 carriers based in the region, combined
passenger revenue of members for the 1997-98 (October to
September) fiscal year slipped 4.5 percent to only 37.869 billion
dollars from 39.670 billion dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
What has caused the financial difficulties for Asian airlines?
</P>
<P>
The drop in value of some Asian currencies by 15 to 60 percent
against the dollar has caused immense difficulties for Asian
carriers, because dollars are the currency in which aircraft are
traded and aviation fuel is priced, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the financial crisis has also forced many Asia
airlines to slash fare, abandon routes and cancel orders for new
aircraft as passengers have stopped flying.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian President Names New Premier As Economy Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori said Tuesday that he has named Prime Minister Victor Joy
Way as finance minister to replace Jorge Baca Campodnico.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Fujimori said that Joy Way Rojas would
continue the free market policy which began in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said that Baca's removal was part of a political bid
to set up a new ministerial team for the last one and half years
of his term which will end in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle was designed to create a ministerial team able
to inject new life into Peru's slump economy, Joy Way said.
</P>
<P>
In the broader cabinet reshuffling, nine other ministers were
also removed.
</P>
<P>
The four ministers who remain in office are Interior Minister
Jose Villanueva, Defense Minister Julio Salazar, Energy and Mines
Minister Daniel Hokama, and Foreign Minister Fernando de
Trazegnies.
</P>
<P>
Nine ministers, including those responsible for agriculture,
justice, health and industry, will be replaced and two others
rotated, he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Alberto Pandolfi will move to the
Transportation Ministry, replacing Antonio Paucar, who will move
to the Fisheries Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori ruled out any changes in the economic policy, but
added that some "adjustments" were possible in the future so that
"the program's benefits have concrete effects on the country's
microeconomy."
</P>
<P>
After growth of more than 7.4 percent in 1997, Peru's economy
grew by just an estimated 1.5 percent in 1998 due to the Asian
economic crisis and damage caused by the El Nino phenomenon,
which changed weather patterns.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, Laos Agree to Quicken Port Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and Laos has agreed to
accelerate the ongoing construction of a sea port on Vietnam's
central coast and the route leading from the port to central Laos,
official reports here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came at the 21st meeting of the Vietnam-Laos
Inter-Governmental Commission for Economic, Cultural, Scientific
and Technological Cooperation which was held here Tuesday on the
official visit by Lao President Khamtay Siphandone.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the two counties reviewed the work done in
1998 and discussed cooperation plans for 1999, which cover the
fields of trade, personnel training, agriculture, tourism,
transport and communications, and power.
</P>
<P>
On transport and communications, the two sides agreed to focus
their cooperation on major projects and programs, striving to
complete the construction of the Vung Ang port in Vietnam's
central province of Ha Tinh and the road linking this port with
Laos.
</P>
<P>
Both the projects are scheduled for completion by the year
2000. Then landlocked Laos will be able to use the route and the
port in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province to transport its shipments to
other countries.
</P>
<P>
This year, Vietnam will train 450 Lao students who major in
these fields and send between 20 and 25 Vietnamese students to
Laos.
</P>
<P>
According to leading press here, Vietnam's Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai told visiting Lao President Khamtay Siphandone that
"comprehensive cooperation between Vietnam and Laos would be
further developed, especially in economy, agriculture, industry,
energy and transport and communications."
</P>
<P>
The Lao top leader replied that "Laos and Vietnam should work
out a strategy for their long-term cooperation, particularly in
economy, agriculture, forestry and farm produce processing,
transport and communications and energy in order to better exploit
each country's potential and strength for their peoples' happiness
and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Khamtay Siphandone arrived here Monday for a four-day official
visit to Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Bank Loans Encourage Private Auto Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Bank loans have resulted in
increasing private purchases of automobiles in Shanghai, China's
largest financial and economic center.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai branches of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China (ICBC) and the China Construction Bank (CCB) introduced auto
loans on October 13 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai CCB branch has granted 130 automobile loans valued
at over 10 million yuan. In addition, the Shanghai Branch of ICBC,
China's largest bank, reports a contracted loan volume of 2.2
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shanghainese are enjoying constantly rising income levels which
have prompted an increasing number of people to purchase
automobiles. Nonetheless, the private ownership of automobiles has
grown slowly due to high licensing costs of 20,000 yuan, a
dramatic drop on the previous, amazingly high figure of 160,000
yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Shanghai has a mere 8,000 private
automobiles, compared to 400,000 units in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The availability of automobile loans and constantly improving
road conditions will inevitably boost automobile sales, according
to local economists.

</P>
<P>
The central bank said in its weekly report that the decrease

The central bank said that net reserves remained above the

</P>

Bank Indonesia reported that gross foreign exchange reserves,
which include net foreign exchange reserves plus outstanding
foreign exchange contracts, fell by 360.8 million dollars to 23.6

<HEADLINE> Chile Earmarks 161 Million Dollars for Drought-Plagued Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chile's agriculture minister
Carlos Mladinic on Tuesday said that the ministry will allocate
161.7 million U.S. dollars to help farmers affected by a one-year
drought.
</P>
<P>
Scarce rainfall made 1998 the third driest year in Chile in
this century, only surpassed by drought in 1924 and 1968.
</P>
<P>
The scarce rainfall came as a result of weather changes caused
by the periodic warming of tropical Pacific waters, a phenomenon
known as El Nino, which is followed by droughts caused by La Nina.
</P>
<P>
The drought forced the government to declare an agriculture
alert in 120 locations in an extensive area in the center of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the authorities' claim that vegetable and fruit crops
will not be affected, farmers were warned that crops like wheat
and leguminous plants needing irrigation would be hurt.
</P>
<P>
The drought is also expected to affect electricity supplies
mainly generated by hydraulic power stations.

<HEADLINE> Large Firms Support Qingdao Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Large enterprises and groups are
becoming an increasingly important factor promoting economic
growth in Qingdao, a major port city of east China's Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
State-owned industrial enterprises and non-state firms with
annual sales of more than five million yuan each had a combined
industrial value-added of 22.5 billion yuan for the first 11 months
of 1998, up 16.5 percent on the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The total output of 88.7 billion yuan for related enterprises
between January-November represented an increase of 10.3 percent,
with the sales-to-production ratio hitting 96.5 percent for the
1998 period.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao has placed priority on development of the sectors of
biological engineering, electronic information, household electric
appliances, shipping, vehicle manufacturing, food and beverage,
and power equipment over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The city invested 6.6 billion yuan in industrial technological
renovations during 1998, with some 57 percent of the total going
to the top 10 enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao's technical renovation inputs are expected to total 15
billion yuan over a three-year period, according to a municipal
official.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that large enterprises made extremely important
contributions to the rapid expansion of Qingdao's industrial
sector in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Total industrial production for the Haier and Hisense groups,
two group companies which account for one fourth of the city's total
economy, surged 82 percent and 44.9 percent respectively during
the first 11 months of last year.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Foresees Success of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema said Tuesday that he foresees the success of the euro,
the single European currency launched on January 1.
</P>
<P>
"No one could foresee how the euro would grow, but it's
success was predictable," D'Alema said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He said that this was can be seen from the fact the euroland's
currencies stayed unaffected by the Asian economic crisis last
year. The euro was successful "even before its birth," the
Italian prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his recent private visit to the United States,
D'Alema said that there was initially some reservation vis-a-vis
the euro among Americans, but "now there is respect for the
European currency."
</P>
<P>
The Americans are calling it the "eurodollar," which is a sign
of respect for Europe's potential, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that when he saw how the European bourses in the
euro-area soared and when he read the negative data coming out of
the London stock exchange, he thought what would have happened to
Italy if the Italian lira had not managed to enter the euroland.
</P>
<P>
"We would have had a sense of defeat, of having been shunted
to the sidelines, and now it was a historic victory for Italy to
enter the euroland," D'Alema added.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players to Vote Wednesday on Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- NBA players will have a
chance to decide on the league's final proposal Wednesday, and a
negative vote will likely prompt the cancellation of the entire
season -- a first in pro sports history.
</P>
<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern rejected the final proposal from
the NBA union, which then decided to put the league's last
proposal to a vote.
</P>
<P>
Stern then reaffirmed that the nine-member labor relations
committee to the Board of Governors to vote to cancel the
remainder of the season on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
No talks are scheduled, which means the future of the season
--and perhaps the sport -- will come down to Wednesday's vote of
more than 400 players.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the union's 19-member negotiating committee
unanimously rejected the final proposal from the NBA, which Stern
mailed directly to each player.
</P>
<P>
Stern also indicated that in the absence of an agreement,
teams would be outfitted with replacement players for the
1999-2000 season. The declaration was designed to put pressure on
the players.

<HEADLINE> Bassett Blasts Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Dave Bassett lashed out at the
manner of his departure from Nottingham Forest on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bassett, 54, accepted his sacking after 22 months at the City
Ground as "part and parcel of football" but was left fuming at
how news of his exit had been leaked out.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's rude and disgusting to hear that you have been
sacked through the columns of a national newspaper," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am upset that the club have not seen fit to deal with the
matter in a much more dignified way.
</P>
<P>
"I was sacked earlier in my footballing life at Watford and
that was done with a great deal of dignity.
</P>
<P>
"I was called to meet Elton John, we discussed things, had a
glass of champagne and went our way with the shake of a hand.
We've remained friends ever since - and that's the way it should
be."
</P>
<P>
Bassett led Forest to the First Division title last season but
the top flight's bottom club recently set a new Premier League
record when they went 17 games without a win.
</P>
<P>
In a short statement, Forest chief executive Philip Soar
confirmed Bassett's departure and revealed that assistant manager
Micky Adams would take charge of first-team affairs at Coventry
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The Board of Nottingham Forest Football Club regrets
to announce that Dave Bassett will be leaving the club.
</P>
<P>
"The Board wishes sincerely to thank Dave for everything he
has achieved with the club in the past two years and wishes him
the very best in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The club will make an announcement about the appointment of a
new manager in due course.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, it is proposed that Micky Adams will take
charge of the team against Coventry City this Saturday."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Ron Atkinson has confirmed long-running speculation
by revealing that he has been approached by the club to be
Bassett's successor.
</P>
<P>
The former Manchester United, Aston Villa and Sheffield
Wednesday boss said from the West Indies, where he is on holiday,
that he would consider the offer and make his decision by next
week.
</P>
<P>
Bassett had insisted reports of his demise were premature on
Saturday when supporters chanted for him to be sacked following
the 1-0 home defeat by Division One strugglers Portsmouth in the
FA Cup third round.
</P>
<P>
But with Forest one point adrift of Southampton at the foot of
the league, Bassett conceded that it could be time for a change
in scenery.
</P>
<P>
"It's part and parcel of football and it's one of those things
you know can happen when you enter the world of football
management."
</P>
<P>
The former Wimbledon, Crystal Palace, Watford and Sheffield
United boss was appointed as Forest's general manager in February
1997, with former favorite Stuart Pearce in charge of team
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He was unable to save Forest from the drop despite being
appointed first team boss in May, but his team romped to the
First Division title last season with Dutch striker Pierre van
Hooijdonk scoring 29 league goals.
</P>
<P>
However, it was van Hooijdonk who contributed to Bassett's
downfall when he went on a one-man strike, claiming he was angry
with the club's lack of ambition.
</P>
<P>
Van Hooijdonk ended his strike after three months but by then
Forest were struggling badly without his firepower and firmly
entrenched in the relegation zone.
</P>
<P>
Bassett refused to comment today on whether he felt he had
been let down by van Hooijdonk or any other players.

<HEADLINE> American Heart Association Recommends Homocysteine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 5 (Xinhua) -- An American Heart
Association Science Advisory has urged doctors to begin screening
high-risk patients with a personal or family history of heart
disease for elevated homocysteine levels.
</P>
<P>
The advisory, carried on the current issue of the association's
weekly journal Circulation, comes in the wake of a number of
recent studies, including a 14-year study at the Harvard School of
Public Health involving 80,000 women, which concluded that high
homocysteine levels play a central role in cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
At normal levels, homocysteine is an amino acid used by the
body to help build and maintain body tissue. Too much
homocysteine, however, causes blood patelets to clump together and
damage the lining of arteries.
</P>
<P>
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the
United States, costing the country 150 billion U.S. dollars a
year. An estimated 20 million Americans, more than one of every
three people with heart disease, experience high levels of
homocysteine, according to the advisory. Screening for the problem
could significantly reduce the likelihood of heart attacks and
strokes among certain high-risk patients.
</P>
<P>
Elevated levels of homocysteine can be reduced with a change in
diet, the advisory said. Because high levels of homocysteine
directly correlate to low levels of folic acid and vitamins B12
and B6, in addition to screening, the advisory also urges all
Americans to increase their intake of foods containing folic acid
and vitamins B12 and B6 such as leafy green vegetables, fruits and
legumes.
</P>
<P>
It will probably soon be as common to have one's homocysteine
level checked as it is now to have one's cholesterol level
checked, the advisory said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Republican lawmakers of the
U.S. House of Representatives Tuesday chose Chief Deputy Majority
Whip Dennis Hastert to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker of the
House.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Hastert, a six-term House Republican lawmaker, is
to be formally elected speaker with the convening of the first
session of the 106th Congress. Vote is expected to be formality
since Republicans control the House.
</P>
<P>
Hastert's surprise rise to the leadership spot followed
Gingrich's decision to resign in the wake of Republican losses in
the November elections last year and the announcement last month
by Gingrich's expected successor, Bob Livingston, a Republican
lawmaker, that he had had extramarital affairs and would not seek
the speakership.
</P>
<P>
Hastert, 57, will take over a House deeply divided by the
impeachment of President Bill Clinton and paralyzed by partisan
clashes.

<HEADLINE> 1998 A Record Breaking Year for IPE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON January 5 (Xinhua) - Volumes of trade on the
International Petroleum Exchange's (IPE) futures and options
contracts in 1998 rose overall by almost a third to 19.4 million
contracts, the Exchange announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last year was the most successful ever in the eighteen year
history of the IPE. This compares with 14.7 million contracts
traded in 1997, the IPE said.
</P>
<P>
Brent Crude futures made up 70 percent of the volume traded,
averaging just under 54,000 lots a day. This volume represents
about 54 million barrels of crude oil or just under three quarters
of total world daily oil production.
</P>
<P>
Over the year as a whole 13.6 million lots of Brent Crude were
traded, compared with 10.3 million lots the previous year, an
increase of 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gas Oil futures were up almost 25 percent on the previous year
at 5.0 million lots. Options on Brent Crude and Gas Oil traded
439,110 lots, up 40 percent on 1997.
</P>
<P>
The highest percentage increase was for Natural Gas futures.
1998 was the first full year of trading for the Natural Gas
contract, which was launched on 31 January 1997, according to the
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Lynton Jones, chief executive of the IPE said: "The
exceptionally low price levels in 1998 have clearly demonstrated
the value of hedging."
</P>
<P>
"The dramatic growth in the volumes we have traded in the year
indicate that people appreciate the range and quality of risk
management tools that we provide," he added.

<HEADLINE> London Stock Market at Five Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON January 5 (Xinhua) - UK's FTSE 100 has joined the New
Year rally on world markets Tuesday as merger hopes and a robust
start to Wall Street lifted it to a five-month closing high.
</P>
<P>
The leading index closed up 79 points at 5958, although off its
highs for the day.
</P>
<P>
The market took little notice of a growing view that the Bank
of England will hold UK interest rates steady this week rather
than ease policy as many have been hoping.
</P>
<P>
Telecoms were again the market's shining light, as shares were
puffed on the back of strong subscriber figures unveiled by
Vodafone and Orange.
</P>
<P>
Vodafone admitted that it is in talks with US telecoms group
AirTouch about a merger. AirTouch has already been the subject of
a 45bn US dollars bid from Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Compare with London, European markets were in a more cautious
mood after Monday's big rallies sparked by a bout of
euro-euphoria.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax index lost ground Tuesday as investors took
a more somber view after euro-euphoria had sent the index more
than 5 percent higher the day before.
</P>
<P>
The index ended 26.95 points down, or 0.51 percent at 5263.41.
"People are still cautious, choosing to consolidate rather than

Paris stocks notched up healthy gains in choppy trade on
Tuesday, the index still buoyant but in a more reflective mood
after a 5 percent jump on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Cac 40 index closed up 53.28 points, or 1.28 percent at
4200.78 points. "People felt the market got carried away on Monday
and ran up too quickly to give them the chance to buy in the
stocks they want in this year's portfolios," said a trader.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that disappointment that Wall Street failed
to follow the rising lead set by European bourses subdued trade a
little, and the forthcoming earnings season was another worry.

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain fell
slightly again in December, according to the latest housing survey
by the Halifax bank, the biggest mortgage lender in the country.
</P>
<P>
Fears about job security are making buyers reluctant to splash
out. But the fall in prices, 0.1 percent, was less than the 0.7
percent fall recorded in November.
</P>
<P>
However, compared to last year, house prices are still on the up,
by 4.5 percent in December, but down on the November figure of 4.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The average price paid for a house in the U.K. in December was
73,124 pounds. First-time buyers paid an average of 51,637 pounds
while for new houses the average price was 77,306 pounds.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax said there were signs that the underlying rate of
house price inflation had slowed slightly since the Summer, with the
annual rate of increase falling below 5 percent in the last two
months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
This is consistent with the expected easing in house price growth
during 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank added that housing remained at highly
affordable levels, in an historical context, and with interest rates
falling many homeowners were seeing their mortgage payments fall.
</P>
<P>
These factors should support the market, helping to offset the
adverse impact of deteriorating economic conditions and ensuring
that the softening in the market proves modest.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax predicted that house prices would rise by 4 percent
over the year.

NEW YORK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite a sharp drop in the
U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, blue-chips captured broad

<HEADLINE> Americans Foresee Financial Flabbiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES January 5 (Xinhua) -- One-third of Americans
predict that their finances will be in no better shape by the year
2000 than they are now, even with the soaring stock market and the
strong economy.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey released Tuesday, 22 percent of Americans
said the biggest obstacle in achieving fiscal fitness for 2000 is
lack of time. Other obstacles include too much debt such as credit
card debt, impulse spending and not enough financial know-how. Six
percent cited dreams of winning the lottery.
</P>
<P>
The survey of over 1,000 adults in November 1998 was sponsored
by Quicken, a California-based personal finance software program.
</P>
<P>
Quicken said in a report that only 40 percent of Americans
surveyed actually plan to set any financial goals for the year
2000. For those who have plans, half indicate that their goal will
be for future fiscal needs, including retirement, money in the
bank and for a college education. Additionally, more than
one-quarter of adults look to make large purchases, including a
house, expensive vacation and a car. However, it is only the
remaining 21 percent that plan to pay off credit card debt and
their mortgage.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to financial priorities, the generation gap
widens, Quicken said. While adults 35 years or older are more
likely than their younger counterparts to cite retirement as their
financial priority, those under 35 are more likely to set a goal
for the purchase of a home. In addition, paying off credit card
debt is more important to people 35 years of age or older. Yet,
saving money is more important to people under 35.
</P>
<P>
One of the suggestions Quicken offered is saving on a regular
basis and reinvesting interest or dividends.
