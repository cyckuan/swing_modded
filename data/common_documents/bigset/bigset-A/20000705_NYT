<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 5:
</P>
<P>
   New data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
confirms that people living in states with strict gun laws are not
insulated from guns imported from other states. This is largely
traceable to Congress' failure to enact nationwide standards on
interstate gun trafficking. The data, which appears in a new study
by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., shows that four states with weak
gun control laws _ Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas _ were
the source of nearly a quarter of the 30,454 guns used in crimes
committed elsewhere last year that could be traced back to dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Only 769 guns used in out-of-state crimes originated in New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut or Massachusetts. These states have
relatively strong gun laws that discourage straw purchasers and
otherwise deter criminals from obtaining weapons. But fully
two-thirds of guns used in crimes in New York, and about 70 percent
of those used in New Jersey, came from other states.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, Virginia and South Carolina, which enacted strict gun
laws several years ago, saw their ranking as out-of-state guns
suppliers begin to drop as a result. Virginia, for example, the
third-largest supplier of out-of-state crime guns in 1997, now
ranks seventh. South Carolina, which ranked third in 1996, has
fallen to 13th on the list.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably not a coincidence that states with the worst
records also tend to be popular locales for gun shows where, thanks
to a loophole in the Brady law, criminals and other people
disqualified by law from buying guns can easily purchase them
without undergoing any background check. This is not a minor
problem. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has found that
nearly a third of the illegal guns recovered in gun trafficking
investigations between July 1996 and December 1998 were originally
purchased at a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of sensible steps Congress could take to
crack down on this one-way gun-trafficking trade, including
requiring licensing and registration of handguns and limiting
handgun purchases nationwide to one per month, as a number of
states have done. Though these ideas have gone nowhere in this
Congress, modest progress is still possible if the Republican
leadership stops dithering over a measure that would require
background checks on prospective purchasers before all gun show
sales.

EDITORIAL: WRONGFUL VERDICT IN IRAN  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 5:
</P>
<P>
   The recent conviction of 10 Iranian Jews in Iran on charges of
spying for Israel is a brazen violation of international human
rights standards and the due process of law. President Clinton and
leaders of the European Union have rightly called on the Iranian
government to overturn these unjust convictions.
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami, the leader of Iran's reform
movement, has been silent on this case, except to say that the
prosecution and trial would be fair. That promise has proved
illusory. He should condemn the verdicts and make clear he is
dissatisfied with a warped legal system that is controlled by
Iran's conservative clerics and used for judicial persecution.
</P>
<P>
   The spying charges against the Jews drew international attention
because the charges were unfounded and the prosecution unfair.
Iran's virulent hostility to Israel added to the impression that
Jews had been singled out for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 Jewish defendants, three of whom were acquitted, were
imprisoned in March 1999 and not allowed access to lawyers until
just weeks before their trial began in May. The trial was closed
and the evidence against the men was kept secret. The defense
lawyers say that there was no evidence against the men other than
their own statements made during interrogations without the
presence of legal counsel. Even after the trial, the court gave few
details about the alleged illegal activities. The Jews were
convicted of belonging to an illegal spy network, recruiting others
and cooperating with Israel, though it was unclear what cooperation
they could have given Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Political reformers, journalists and others disfavored by the
religious hard-liners have also been victims of a system where
judges act as investigators, prosecutors and judges in the same
case. Khatami and his reformist supporters in Parliament say they
want to depoliticize the courts. The Iranian people in the recent
parliamentary elections showed they want relief from rigid
fundamentalist rule. But progress for human rights in the face of
the conservative clerics who hold power over the judiciary and the
security forces is slow and fitful. This case shows how far Iran
has to go to meet the expectations that Khatami has set.

GOLD CUP FIELD COULD BE STRONGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Sunday's $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup
shapes up weaker than many of its first 60 runnings but stronger
than recent races to which it might more fairly be compared.
</P>
<P>
   One of those races was held Tuesday at Belmont Park, the New
York track that is Hollywood Park's intersectional rival in the
early summer. The $500,000 Suburban Handicap, which is Belmont's
counterpart to the Gold Cup, was won by Lemon Drop Kid by 2 lengths
over Behrens in a near-record 1:58 4/5 for 1 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of triple Grade I winner Behrens and 1999 Belmont
Stakes winner Lemon Drop Kid, the second- and sixth-ranked horses
in last week's NTRA poll, made the Suburban the racing highlight of
the July 4 weekend. But overall the Gold Cup should be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Cup promises to have more horses (eight to six), more
graded-stakes-winning horses (seven to four), more horses with
50-percent-plus win percentages (one to zero), more cross-country
shippers to challenge handicappers (three to zero), and more Hall
of Fame and Eclipse Award-winning jockeys (four to two) and
trainers (three to two). The Suburban had the edge in millionaire
horses (three to two) and horses coming out of victories (three to
one). Overall edge: Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   By most of the same standards, the 2000 Gold Cup also looks
better than the 1999 Gold Cup, a four-horse race won by Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The expected field for Sunday's race: General Challenge (Corey
Nakatani riding), the Santa Anita Handicap winner and No. 7 in the
NTRA poll but unraced in three months; Cat Thief (Pat Day), winless
since the 1999 Breeders' Cup Classic; San Bernardino winner Early
Pioneer (Victor Espinoza); the Richard Mandella-trained duo of
Californian winner Big Ten (Alex Solis) and Mervyn LeRoy winner Out
of Mind (Eddie Delahoussaye); and David (Aaron Gryder), Chester
House (Kent Desormeaux) and Pleasant Breeze(Jorge Chavez), all from
out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is 5-year-old Irish-bred Blueprint, an
English Group 2 winner who was purchased from Queen Elizabeth last
month by Bill Bianco and David Shimmon, a pair of trainer Bob Hess
Jr.'s owners. If he runs, Blueprint will be ridden by Chris
McCarron, the Hall of Famer who hasn't won the Gold Cup but
finished second nine times from 1980 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup will be determined Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Milestone for Baze: Russell Baze became the sixth jockey to
win 7,000 races, riding This is the Moment to a half-length victory
Tuesday in the Pleasanton Stakes at the Alameda County Fair.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Moment is trained by Jerry Hollendorfer, with whom
Baze dominates San Francisco Bay Area racing.
</P>
<P>
   Baze, 41, trails Laffit Pincay (8,937), retired Bill Shoemaker
(8,833), Pat Day (7,753), retired David Gall (7,396) and retired
Angel Cordero (7,057) on the all-time list. Chris McCarron (6,904)
should be next to reach 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   __ More on the Suburban: Lemon Drop Kid ($3.60) won for the
fourth time in his past five starts as he and Edgar Prado came
within three-fifths of a second of In Excess's 1991 Belmont record
of 1:58 1/5 for 1 miles. Prado kept Behrens and Chavez in a box
while pushing pacesetter Wild Imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Lager finished third. Almutawakel, disappointing again, was
last.
</P>
<P>
   __ At Hollywood: Dark Moondancer ($5.80), who was pulled up
after cutting a foot early in the Charlie Whittingham Handicap in
May, bounced back in the $150,000 American Handicap on Tuesday,
winning under McCarron by 1 lengths over Sardaukar. It was the
5-year-old English-bred's 10th victory in 20 starts.
</P>
<P>
   __ Elsewhere: Trainer Bob Baffert went 1 for 2 with his star
fillies at Monmouth Park in New Jersey, Silverbulletday losing a
photo to Lu Ravi as an even-money favorite in the $300,000 Molly
Pitcher Handicap after Chilukki romped at 1-5 in the $75,000 Regret
Stakes. Corey Nakatani rode both.

PROBLEMS OF LOW-WEIGHT INFANTS BROADER THAN ONCE THOUGHT, STUDY
FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (CLARIFIES headline)  
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Babies born weighing less than 5 and a half pounds are almost
four times less likely to graduate from high school by age 19 than
their normal-birthweight siblings, according to a study in the June
issue of the American Sociological Review.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of the study, apparently the first to follow
low-birthweight children to age 19, are far more dramatic than the
academic problems documented in previous studies tracking children
for fewer years. And the extent of the educational gap came as a
troubling surprise to some experts in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge effect, four times less likely to graduate from
high school,'' said Greg J. Duncan of the Institute for Policy
Research at Northwestern University. ``And it's a little puzzling,
since most studies have shown that most effects of low birthweight
fade out in the preschool years. But a sibling comparison is a very
good way to look at it, since it gets around all kinds of variables
that make it hard to compare low-birthweight children with
normal-birthweight children from different families.''
</P>
<P>
   In the families studied, 57.5 percent of the normal-birthweight
siblings graduated from high school by the time they were 19,
compared with 15.2 percent of the low-birthweight siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Timely high school graduation is an important indicator,
sociologists said, because those who do not graduate on time are
more likely to receive an equivalency diploma and less likely to go
on to a four-year college than those who complete high school on
time. The study did not examine the cause of the educational lag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be for some future researchers to investigate
whether it's health problems, slowed cognitive development or other
mechanisms,'' said Dalton Conley, a sociologist at New York
University, who, with Neil G. Bennett of the Baruch School of
Public Affairs, wrote the study. ``Our contribution was to follow
these kids years longer than other studies. And as a policy matter,
I think our findings argue that programs to help low-birthweight
kids need to extend well beyond the early years.''
</P>
<P>
   Conley's study is based on data from the University of
Michigan's Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which has followed
thousands of families since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research has found that low-birthweight children have
an increased risk of academic difficulties in early childhood, but
the gap was not as dramatic as the gaps found in the new study.
</P>
<P>
   In one study following 2,000 low-birthweight children to age 8,
researchers found that among those weighing less than 2.2 pounds,
more than a third had already failed a grade, and 12 percent were
in special education. And among those between 2.2 pounds and 5.5
pounds, more than a quarter had failed a grade, and 6 percent were
in special education.
</P>
<P>
   An author of that study, Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, a child development
and education professor at Columbia University, said that while the
new results were startling, there might be reasons school problems
became more pronounced as low-birthweight children grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit adolescence, there are more challenges to deal
with, and that may exacerbate the effects we saw at age 8,''
Brooks-Gunn said. ``These are kids with more illnesses, more going
against them. What this very large difference at high school
graduation may reflect is that when these kids get to middle
school, and face greater demands, they may disengage from school.''
</P>
<P>
   That study followed babies born in the 1970s, and Conley's
looked at babies born in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been significant medical advances in
caring for premature, low-birthweight babies, who make up almost 8
percent of all infants born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been big medical advances, which may mean that some
of these babies do much better,'' Conley said. ``But at the same
time, many more babies weighing less than 3 pounds are surviving,
babies who probably would have died in the period of our data. And
those are the ones with the worst problems.''

VICTOR IN MEXICO PLANS TO OVERHAUL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 6th graf to clarify time frame) 
 (See also MEXICO-POLITICS) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The president-elect of Mexico, Vicente Fox,
announced plans Tuesday to rebuild the country's federal law
enforcement system, moving it toward a U.S. model of justice as a
way to wipe out corruption that has crippled his nation for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also said that he would travel to the United States soon to
meet with President Clinton, and both major presidential candidates
to press his proposal to open the U.S.-Mexico border to a
less-restricted flow of immigrants. The president-elect also
explained some of the measures his new government would take to
deal with a range of Mexico's most persistent and complex troubles,
including the fight against poverty, efforts to stem the flow of
drugs through Mexico and the unresolved conflict in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   A two-hour news conference by Fox, whose election on Sunday
ended a 71-year rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
turned into a wide-ranging foreign policy address. But his most
detailed proposals centered on his fight against corruption, a
problem he considers a top priority. To accomplish the overhaul, he
is likely to use executive powers that allow him to create a
federal police agency and to shift law enforcement responsibilities
from one agency to another.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, he said that he would create a Ministry of
Security and Justice _ similar to the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation _ that would be responsible for all the federal
police.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's plans would also significantly reduce the powers of the
Interior Ministry, which currently manages a recently created
federal police force. And the attorney general's office would be
similarly weakened, not only by the removal of its control over
federal law enforcement, but also by Fox's plans to create a new
agency of federal prosecutors to manage investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Because his ideas have widespread support, Fox's transformation
of the system is also expected to be well-received in the Mexican
Congress, even though the Congress will no longer be dominated by
any single political party following Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   During his wide-ranging comments, Fox brought up his goal of
greater cooperation among the United States, Mexico and Canada. He
suggested the creation of a North American common market that would
allow a freer flow of merchandise and workers, with strict
adherence to standards for the protection of the environment, law
enforcement and workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me that both of us have lost sight of the
goal,'' said Fox, referring to the United States and Mexico. ``The
United States' goal has been to put up walls, police and soldiers
to fight immigration. That can't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico's goal has been to open an escape valve, allowing
350,000 young people to cross the border each year and washing its
hands of any responsibility,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are serious,'' Fox concluded, ``The least we can do is
sit down and say, `this is the problem' and the goal is to close
the development gap.''
</P>
<P>
   In his answers to reporters' questions, Fox also offered
specific proposals for improving U.S.-Mexican relations, including
extending the benefits of NAFTA more evenly to small businesses on
both sides of the border and turning the drug certification program
from a unilateral to a multilateral process involving all countries
affected by trafficking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that in the next two months, he will use five
international head-hunting firms to help him select the members of
his Cabinet so that leading up to his Dec. 1 inauguration, they can
work side-by-side with the ministers they will replace. A team of
aides to Fox have also been assigned to work with the current
leaders of the Finance Ministry on setting next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to transform the law enforcement system, Fox's plans
could be upset by a backlash from below, where bureaucrats and
officers enjoy strong civil service protections.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo reorganized and renamed the nation's
drug police at least twice, and each time traffickers quickly
infiltrated the forces and bought off leading officials. And
Zedillo created a new federal police force to fight a mounting wave
of federal crimes, including kidnapping. But so far the new police
have done little to make Mexicans, especially those in larger
cities, feel any safer.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Chabat, an analyst of Mexican law enforcement praised
Fox's plan to take the federal police out of the hands of
politicians, who used the agents for their own agendas. He said he
felt some pessimism over whether the new system would be resistant
to the corrupting forces of drug traffickers. But, he said,
``Someone has to try to fight them. The truth is whatever the
government tries, it will face a problem with the corruption of
traffickers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a signal of assurance to the Mexican military, Fox also said
he would not consider appointing a civilian as chief of the
Ministry of Defense. ``I see no reason to break a tradition that
has brought stability to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   On other domestic issues, Fox said he wanted to visit Chiapas as
soon as possible and reopen peace talks with the Zapatista rebels,
and he said that he was willing to consider one of the rebels'
principal demands to withdraw the military from rural areas of
conflict in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting poverty was another area that Fox called a priority and
he said that as president he would not approve budgets or program
proposals from members of his Cabinet unless they could demonstrate
in concrete terms how their programs would help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be our way to pay attention to the groups that have
been totally excluded from the development of our country,'' he
said. ``It is one of the strong principles that we are going to
introduce in the decision-making process of the new government.''
</P>
<P>
   In emphasizing his commitment to fighting corruption, Fox turned
the spotlight not only on the past, but also on his administration
and its future. He announced that he would create a ``Commission of
Transparency,'' made up of Mexican citizens whose job would be to
investigate high-profile scandals of past administrations as well
as to serve as a watchdog over his own government.
</P>
<P>
   But he was careful to make clear that he would not conduct
wholesale investigations of government conduct before taking
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to waste our government looking only at the
past and conducting witch hunts that could be misinterpreted,'' Fox
said in the press conference at the presidential residence, Los
Pinos. The transparency commission, he added, would be his
government's way to ``set its sights forward, to construct a
harmonious government and also to make an accounting of the past.''

DEALING STARS MADE MARINERS A BETTER TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the absence of further John Rocker developments _
quick, raise your hand if you knew in spring training that
baseball's biggest story of the half-season would be the threat of
a New York subway ride _ here is a submission for the major
leagues' most surprising tale in double-ought:
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are getting away with trading two of baseball's
premier players.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you have a more remarkable story? (begin italics) The
Mariners are getting away with Lou Piniella in nominal charge of a
mostly young pitching staff. (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Good point.
</P>
<P>
   Call the stories a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   The trades of Randy Johnson at mid-season of 1998 and Ken
Griffey Jr. after the '99 season were greeted with the enthusiasm
that Seattle normally reserves for WTO riots. But as the 2000
season's mathematical midpoint was reached Tuesday night, the deals
have clearly left the town with far fewer smoldering Dumpsters.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the Mariners are conclusively better off
without two of the game's behemoths, either on the field or at the
gate. Nor does it mean the Mariners won't step on their lips in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have the best halfway mark in club history, a
division lead as well as the American League's second-best record,
and roster depth that can survive the occasional injury.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it's a lot easier to walk around the clubhouse without
getting whacked by a flying tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   Absent a rehash of the Johnson/Griffey particulars, a reasonable
conclusion is the Mariners have obtained four contributors (center
fielder Mike Cameron and pitchers Brett Tomko, John Halama and
Freddy Garcia) to the current success, and perhaps a fifth in the
future if infielder Carlos Guillen can partly cover the potential
loss of Alex Rodriguez to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the Mariners have used mostly wisely the $25
million-plus in 2000 payroll that would have gone to Johnson and
Griffey, spreading it among multiple contributors.
</P>
<P>
   What the Mariners have lost in swagger and glamor that made them
national darlings in the '90s, they are making up in sound baseball
_ better defense, a more diverse offense, and most important,
pitching that no longer requires fans to assume false identities
and disguise voices while addressing the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching progress is even more remarkable compared to last
year. By the '99 All-Star break, the Mariners had already gone
through 23 of a club-record 28 pitchers, one shy of the
major-league mark. They compiled a team earned-run average of 6.00,
second-worst in the majors, and opponents were hitting .304.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the staff ERA is a startling 1{ runs lower and
third-best in the AL. So many major-league arms have been
stockpiled that Piniella, as with perhaps none of his peers, has
the dilemma of overload.
</P>
<P>
   But before going giddy with a notion that Piniella suddenly has
crafted a feel for pitching, two matters must be given much more
credit _ pitching coach Bryan Price and the Guilty Pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium effect was obvious from its opening. The team played
the second half of '99 in more spacious digs, helping produce an
AL-low 3.98 team ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Price benefits from the larger park and payroll, but it's also
plain that in their fifth pitching coach in Piniella's eight years,
the Mariners finally have someone who will not be outworked or
outsmarted. He has the staff's collective respect and ear _ and
Piniella's trust, so the manager can stay away from what he doesn't
know.
</P>
<P>
   In assembling the staff, however, it can't be forgotten that the
Mariners cannibalized much of their position-player roster,
resulting in 76- and 79-win seasons the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   To get these pitchers, the Mariners traded Griffey (Tomko),
Johnson (Garcia and Halama), Butch Huskey (Rob Ramsay), Darren
Bragg (Jamie Moyer) and Matt Mieske (Kevin Hodges). First baseman
David Segui, lighting up the Texas sky this season, was traded
almost a year ago for two pitchers in Class AAA, Tom Davey and
Steve Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the staff was built by scouting and checkbook. Aaron
Sele, Arthur Rhodes and Jose Mesa were major-league free agents.
Kazu Sasaki was an international free agent. Then there were three
guys almost nobody wanted _ Paul Abbott was a minor-league free
agent and Jose Paniagua and Frankie Rodriguez were claimed off
waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Only Gil Meche, a 1996 first-round draft choice, came from the
Mariners' historically pitching-poor farm system.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 14 who have seen the most innings, only four are more
than 30 _ Moyer (37), Mesa (34), Sasaki and Abbott (32). Eight are
28 or younger (Garcia, Halama, Meche, Hodges, Paniagua, Ramsay,
Rodriguez and Tomko). At 30, Sele and Rhodes are in mid-career
primes.
</P>
<P>
   In Kingdome seasons under the Piniella pitching-coach circus,
that much youth was a regular formula for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   So far this millennium, they are getting away with it. Hard to
say if the good stories will stick for 1,000 years. Another three
months, however, would be for Mariners fans a suitable beginning.

MAYOR DEFENDS HIS FATHER AFTER REPORT OF IMPRISONMENT
</HEADLINE>
  By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani defended his father as the
``finest man'' he has ever known, as reporters questioned him at a
news conference Tuesday about a report that the elder Giuliani had
spent time in prison after being convicted of armed robbery decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor did not directly answer the questions, which were
prompted by a forthcoming book that claims the mayor's father,
Harold Giuliani, served a year and a half in state prison for
robbing a milk deliveryman in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, ``Rudy! An Investigative Biography of
Rudolph W. Giuliani,'' by Wayne Barrett, Harold Giuliani pulled a
gun on the milkman in a building on East 96th Street in Manhattan
and, with an accomplice, robbed him of $128.82.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett is a reporter for The Village Voice. The book, which is
to be published next week, was excerpted on the Voice's Web site on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he would not discuss the excerpts because ``it has
no relevance to me and what I do as mayor of New York City, or my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The report comes during a difficult year for the mayor. He
announced that he was suffering from prostate cancer, decided to
withdraw from a U.S. Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton,
and announced plans to separate from his wife, Donna Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, a former federal prosecutor, has a reputation for
being tough on crime, and New York has seen every major category of
crime drop substantially under his administration. The revelations
that his father may have served time at Sing Sing Correctional
Facility a decade before his son was born cast new attention on the
mayor's personal life, something he rarely discussed before this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Giuliani, who owned a bar and grill in Brooklyn, was
sentenced to two to five years at Sing Sing and served a year and a
half, according to the book. He died of prostate cancer in 1981 at
age 73.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father died 19 years ago, and the details of his life died
with him, as far as I'm concerned,'' the mayor said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether his father had ever told him of his past, the
mayor responded, ``I'm not going to discuss my discussions with my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor would say only that his father ``taught me enormously
important lessons, including the lesson of being honest, which I've
practiced all my life.'' He added, ``His influence on me was to
drill into my skull from the time I was a little boy that I had to
be very honest, that you had to be honest to yourself first and
honest with others second.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciated the lessons he taught me,'' the mayor said. ``He
was a complete man.''

HENDERSON PLAYS LEADING ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Rickey Henderson will be 42 years old on
Christmas Day and his batting average is hovering around .240, but
there are plenty of signs that show why he's considered the best
leadoff man and base stealer who ever played.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who was picked up by Seattle on May 17 after being
waived by the New York Mets, left his footprints all over the
Mariners' 8-6 defeat of the Anaheim Angels on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   He worked Ken Hill for an eight-pitch walk to start the game,
stole second, took third on Mike Cameron's two-strike groundout to
second and scored on Edgar Martinez's single.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, he singled with one out and stole second,
eventually scoring on John Olerud's bases-loaded double. And when
the Angels closed within 7-6, Henderson stroked a two-strike,
two-out RBI double to right that gave the Mariners a two-run
cushion.
</P>
<P>
   On base is where Henderson demonstrated his true artistry,
varying the length of his leads and how he set himself up. When he
bluffed, he didn't have the same explosiveness as when he stole.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he varied his looks just as pitchers try to do with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great sense of stealing bases,'' said manager Mike
Scioscia, who played against Henderson in the minor leagues and two
All-Star games. ``He's still capable of stealing the big base
against a premium throwing catcher. He knows pitchers' tendencies
and he won't go until he gets a good jump, and when he gets a good
jump you can't get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was ejected in the third inning Tuesday for the
apparently unpardonable sin of drawing a line in the dirt with his
bat after home-plate umpire Bill Welke called him out on strikes
for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   However, since joining the Mariners, Henderson has stolen 14
bases in 16 attempts and his on-base percentage is a respectable
.349. Most important, entering Tuesday the Mariners were 22-12 in
games in which he's led off.
</P>
<P>
   __ Erstad returns: Darin Erstad was back in the lineup Tuesday
night _ at DH, not left field _ after being limited to
pinch-hitting duty Monday night because of tightness in his right
hip and buttock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a question if he could play the outfield,'' Scioscia
said of the decision to DH his hottest hitter. ``He'll be back in
left field shortly.''

Educational experts believe summer school helps address the yawning
academic gaps between poor, minority students and white

their long tug of war with business schools for the attention of
corporate America's future elite. At virtually every top business

numbers are startling. At the University of Chicago, they dropped
24 percent. At Cornell, the dip was 23 percent, and at Stanford, it
was 18 percent. As a result, it is considerably less difficult to
gain admission to some business schools than it was a few years
ago, and school officials have relaxed their requirements for work

ELSTER'S PLAYING TIME DIMINISHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Kevin Elster was the opening- day shortstop, hit
three homers in the first game at Pac Bell Park and now is stuck in
a platoon in which his playing time will do nothing but diminish as
Alex Cora gets more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   And Elster has no problem with it.
</P>
<P>
   Cora is the Los Angeles Dodgers' shortstop of the future,
providing the expected run at Alex Rodriguez falls short in the
offseason. All he needed was a little time to gain his bearings at
Triple-A Albuquerque, and Elster was the perfect stopgap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's worked out really good,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``Elster's given this club a lift and Cora's come in
and comfortably, I think, established that he could play here.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster brings experience and pop to the shortstop spot, but Cora
brings quickness, range, a stronger arm and a quicker turn on the
double play. And in an offensive game, defense through the middle
of the field wins championships.
</P>
<P>
   They are in a platoon, but the left-handed hitting Cora is
playing much more. Cora's defense was a given, but reservations
existed about his hitting. However, he's batting .277 with just one
homer and six RBI in 112 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm doing now,'' Elster said, ``this is kind of what I
thought it would be from the onset.''
</P>
<P>
   When Elster pulled a groin muscle May 3 and went on the 15-day
disabled list, the Dodgers found out Cora was ready. So when third
baseman Adrian Beltre pulled his hamstring May 27, Elster quickly
volunteered to play third so Cora, optioned to the minors when
Elster returned, could rejoin the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew exactly what I was doing,'' Elster said. ``I was giving
(Cora) a chance to come to the big leagues, but he deserved it and
this team knew that. I think it's good for the Dodgers right now
and I feel good about that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rotation change: Right-hander Kevin Brown was pushed back a
day and will start Thursday because of soreness in his lower back.
In his place, right-hander Darren Dreifort will start, but the
ramifications go beyond the one day.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hoped Brown would start today and they would bring
him back on three days rest to pitch Sunday before the three-day
all-star break.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it'll be Dreifort's final start before the break, and
an important one. If the Dodgers are to contend in the second half,
Dreifort must pitch better. He's 1-6 in his last nine starts and
his 4-7 mark as the third starter isn't what the Dodgers
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   When Dreifort shut out St. Louis on two hits May 12, he had a
2.59 ERA. Since then, his ERA is 6.84. He also has had problems
with his left knee and soreness in his pitching arm since the St.
Louis masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Dreif and I think the main thing is being
pitch-efficient, going back and pounding the ball down and don't
waste a lot of good pitches out of the zone,'' Johnson said. ``It
looked to me like he was going to be locking it in, and then there
was a little tenderness with the elbow and the slide at third (in
which Dreifort jammed his knee). His season has kind of been like
NASDAQ.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Johnson manipulated the lineup in hopes of
helping badly slumping Shawn Green find his groove. Green was moved
from cleanup to No. 3, switching spots with Gary Sheffield in the
order. Green entered the night in a 3-for-34 slump, then grounded
into a double play in his first at-bat. . . . As expected, middle
infielder Mike Metcalfe was added from Triple-A Albuquerque and
outfielder Shawn Gilbert was designated for assignment before the
game. . . . Right-hander Gregg Olson pitched the eighth inning in
his third rehab stint with Class A San Bernardino. Olson allowed a
run on two hits against Lake Elsinore. . . . Right-hander Jeff Shaw
threw on the side for the first time since he was placed on the
15-day disabled list June 28 (retroactive to June 27). He's slated
to return after the All-star break.

RANGERS CATCHER THRIVES AS POPULARITY RISES

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ When Ivan Rodriguez sees the baseball, he
hits the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   These days, his vision is virtually flawless. He's hitting
baseballs farther, harder and more often than at any time in his
nine-year career. One of his rewards came Tuesday when he became
the first American League catcher to lead overall All-Star Game
balloting since fan voting returned in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an aggressive hitter,'' Rodriguez said. ``Sometimes, I
strike out when I swing at pitches out of the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   More often, he hits pitches out of the strike zone more than 400
feet in all directions. He did it Monday night against Oakland A's
pitcher Kevin Appier. With a man on first base, Appier threw what
would be considered a safe pitch to induce a ground ball. Had the
pitch crossed home plate any lower, it would have bounced off it.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez ``has such good eye-hand coordination, it doesn't have
to be a strike all the time,'' Rangers hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo
said. ``They can say all they want about the other catchers. Johnny
Bench, he's awesome, too, no doubt about it, but this is a
different era, and Pudge is the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez took Appier's low pitch and clubbed a towering shot
over the center-field fence to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead en route
to an 8-3 victory. It was Rodriguez's 25th home run, 10 shy of the
career high he set last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I will see a ball, and, if my bat can reach it, I am
going to swing,'' Rodriguez said. ``I am going to try to hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rodriguez stacks up astounding offensive numbers to go along
with his defense and rifle right arm, the Rangers' catcher, long a
local fan favorite, has now been elected the nation's favorite ball
player.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez received 2,808,456 votes, 28,004 ahead of Mets catcher
Mike Piazza for the overall lead. He finished 192,955 votes ahead
of the AL's next-highest vote-getter, Cleveland second baseman
Roberto Alomar. He ended Ken Griffey Jr.'s four-year reign as
baseball's top vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize I had so many fans,'' Rodriguez said.
``Almost three million votes is a lot. I am going to keep working
hard for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's game in Atlanta will be his eighth consecutive
All-Star start and ninth appearance. Rodriguez built his reputation
while winning eight consecutive Gold Gloves and changing the game
by negating the opposition's running threats, but his offensive
rise has him in contention for the American League Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's progressed every year,'' Rangers first baseman Rafael
Plameiro said. ``The sky's the limit for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Tuesday night's game, Rodriguez ranked third in the
American League in batting average, second in home runs and seventh
in runs batted in. He was second in multihit games with 35. He
leads the Rangers in batting average, at-bats, runs, hits, total
bases, home runs and RBI. He is second in doubles and, perhaps the
most remarkable statistic for a catcher, he is tied for first in
triples with four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flat-out incredible, really,'' Rangers center fielder Gabe
Kapler said. ``He does things I've seen no one else do. He hits
balls out of the ballpark that aren't even in the strike zone. He's
the most aggressive hitter I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, only 28, has improved his batting average and
home-run totals each of the past three seasons and his RBI totals
the past two. His numbers thus far are on pace to demolish career
marks he set last season in all three categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most amazing thing about him,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``It's what makes him unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal numbers and All-Star appearances aside, Rodriguez said
his achievements are much less important than team success, which
has not matched Rodriguez's offensive assualt this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really look at my numbers,'' Rodriguez said. ``I can
see my numbers at the end of the season and say I had a good
season, but I like to win for the team.'' nn

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was an American experience on so many levels.
</P>
<P>
   You take 10 motorcycle riders, you give them each an Indian -- a
reborn classic bike -- you send them on a cross-country trip that
starts in Times Square in New York and ends on the Fourth of July
at Indian Motorcycles Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, they eat up apple pie Americana by the slice in a
journey with connotations of Jack Kerouac and ``Easy Rider.'' Their
progress is monitored online.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end, they turn in the bikes they otherwise couldn't
afford to ride to the dealership that lent them for the promotion.
The 10, road-grimed and achy-hindquartered, Tuesday cruised into
Indian Motorcycles on Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks at the end
of the Gear Magazine Freedom 2000 Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fourth of July is the freedom of America and that's what
we want to promote,'' said Andrew Schmidt, the dealership's general
manager, who accompanied the riders on their final leg from
Sagebrush Cantina in Calabasas to the store.
</P>
<P>
   The original Indian motorcycle company, older than
Harley-Davidson by two years, folded in 1953 but was brought back
to life in 1999 by a Canadian business group. Since then, about 200
outlets have sold riders across the country on the high-end appeal
of the bikes, which start around $19,600 for an Indian Scout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of money in this town and they know quality,''
said Indian Motorcycles Los Angeles President John Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Actor George Clooney bought six for himself and friends. Arnold
Schwarzenegger parks one next to his Humvee. When he came in to buy
one, the store aligned the Terminator with his life crest, the
American Indian animal match to his personality. Arnold was a bear.
Maria Shriver, his wife, is an eagle. It's an experience you're
buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people spend money on their transportation and toys, we
want to make it unique,'' said American Indian artist Bill Melin,
who designs artwork on some of the Indian bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Rider Teri Lynn is lead singer of the Long Beach band Suk. The
29-year-old normally rides a Suzuki. The 10 who got to ride across
country had to submit a 50-word essay on why they should go. Lynn
said there was nothing holding her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'm a chick who rides bikes,'' she said. ``My plant's
already dead and I don't care about my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider Pierson Jacquelin, 25, of West Hollywood, is a video
producer who normally rides a Yamaha. He wouldn't mind owning an
Indian. All that's holding him back is the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to be in a very different tax bracket,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   All the riders chose their own routes. Jacquelin zigzagged up
and down the East Coast before turning west, finding America most
when he got out of the big cities. He met with housewives and crack
addicts and people who remember the original Indian motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people who make up the other 250 million
Americans,'' Jacquelin said. ``The uniquely American experience was
seeing how excited people were to see an American motorcycle on the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Curd has a fledgling business importing MOR vodka from
Estonia to the United States. The New York resident said he had
been all over the world and to the West Coast. What he remembers
are the accents -- totally unlike his Brooklynese, but also
American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been through the middle (of the U.S.),'' the
26-year-old said. ``It's something everybody should do.''

By FRED J. ROBLEDO

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Normally, Los Angeles Galaxy coach Sigi
Schmid is up pacing around, rubbing his forehead or offering his
colorful thoughts to the nearest official. But this time his arms
were folded comfortably as he leaned back against the bench most of
the evening, looking as though he just finished his favorite meal.
</P>
<P>
   An explanation is easy.
</P>
<P>
   Showing the first signs of any kind of rhythm or organization
since the allocation of Luis Hernandez on May 11, the Galaxy
delighted 53,844 Rose Bowl fans Saturday with a 1-0 victory over
Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow margin doesn't do the Galaxy justice. There were just
as many fireworks during the 90 minutes of play than in the show
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez followed his first goal last Saturday with his first
assist. He also hit the post twice as the Galaxy finally started
timing his runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 minutes, Hernandez, Mauricio Cienfuegos, Danny
Califf and Marvin Quijano all missed easy chances from close range
_ but the welcomed news were the number of chances, the result of
good passing as Los Angeles held its shape most of the night,
limiting Columbus' possession.
</P>
<P>
   As if someone finally figured out the right combination, the
work-in-progress time maight finally be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was our best game since acquiring Luis,'' said
Schmid. ``We have an idea of who needs to play where right now. Now
it's a matter of the team getting to understand each other more and
getting the timing down. We need to get more games under this
formation and with this system so it's even more synchronized.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Western Division leading Kansas City (11-2-5, 38
points) has three games in hand over the Galaxy (9-5-7, 34 points),
chasing a Division title is something the Galaxy can start talking
about again without anyone erupting in laughter. The big switch
Schmid made was dropping Jones back to midfield, leaving Hernandez
and Sebastian Vorbe more space to roam up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making good decisions on the ball, that's the most
important thing,'' said defender Greg Vanney. ``If we make good
decisions and keep possession, we'll be tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez finally delivering as advertised was a welcomed sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said Vanney. ``He's dangerous, we all know he's
dangerous. The game opened up and that's when Luis and Cobi are at
their best. And tonight Hernandez showed he can set up goals as
well as score goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez set up the only goal of the game. Simon Elliott rolled
an innocent free kick forward to Hernandez, who turned and started
toward the goal. As defenders closed on him, Hernandez slipped a
pass for Mauricio Cienfuegos, who finished with a left-footed shot
from the top of the penalty area to the right netting in the fourth
minute.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only goal, but the game was filled with highlights,
many of which came from Hernandez and Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting Cobi out on the right side and giving him flexibility
to go forward helps out, but the main thing was our combination
play,'' said defender Paul Caligiuri. ``You can't say enough when
Cobi and Luis start working together. That's the key, individually
these guys are great players, but when they work as a team and as a
pair they are much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez nearly doubled the score with a flashy move in the
11th minute. With his back to the goal, he took a bouncing pass and
back-heeled it over his shoulder and behind Columbus defender Mike
Lapper, whom he spun behind to meet up with the ball. As Crew
goalkeeper Mark Dougherty came out to challenge, Hernandez tried a
chip over Lapper, but it hit the crossbar and bounced off the line.

Elster's playing 
<TEXT>
<P>
   time diminishes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Brian Dohn &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO Kevin Elster was the opening-day shortstop, hit three
homers in the first game at Pac Bell Park and now is stuck in a
platoon in which his playing time will do nothing but diminish as
Alex Cora gets more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   And Elster has no problem with it.
</P>
<P>
   Cora is the Los Angeles Dodgers' shortstop of the future,
providing the expected run at Alex Rodriguez falls short in the
offseason. All he needed was a little time to gain his bearings at
Triple-A Albuquerque, and Elster was the perfect stopgap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's worked out really good,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``Elster's given this club a lift and Cora's come in
and comfortably, I think, established that he could play here.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster brings experience and pop to the shortstop spot, but Cora
brings quickness, range, a stronger arm and a quicker turn on the
double play. And in an offensive game, defense through the middle
of the field wins championships.
</P>
<P>
   They are in a platoon, but the left-handed hitting Cora is
playing much more. Cora's defense was a given, but reservations
existed about his hitting. However, he's batting .277 with just one
homer and six RBI in 112 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm doing now,'' Elster said, ``this is kind of what I
thought it would be from the onset.''
</P>
<P>
   When Elster pulled a groin muscle May 3 and went on the 15-day
disabled list, the Dodgers found out Cora was ready. So when third
baseman Adrian Beltre pulled his hamstring May 27, Elster quickly
volunteered to play third so Cora, optioned to the minors when
Elster returned, could rejoin the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew exactly what I was doing,'' Elster said. ``I was giving
(Cora) a chance to come to the big leagues, but he deserved it and
this team knew that. I think it's good for the Dodgers right now
and I feel good about that.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Rotation change:!off! Right-hander Kevin Brown was pushed
back a day and will start Thursday because of soreness in his lower
back. In his place, right-hander Darren Dreifort will start, but
the ramifications go beyond the one day.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hoped Brown would start today and they would bring
him back on three days rest to pitch Sunday before the three-day
all-star break.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it'll be Dreifort's final start before the break, and
an important one. If the Dodgers are to contend in the second half,
Dreifort must pitch better. He's 1-6 in his last nine starts and
his 4-7 mark as the third starter isn't what the Dodgers
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   When Dreifort shut out St. Louis on two hits May 12, he had a
2.59 ERA. Since then, his ERA is 6.84. He also has had problems
with his left knee and soreness in his pitching arm since the St.
Louis masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Dreif and I think the main thing is being
pitch-efficient, going back and pounding the ball down and don't
waste a lot of good pitches out of the zone,'' Johnson said. ``It
looked to me like he was going to be locking it in, and then there
was a little tenderness with the elbow and the slide at third (in
which Dreifort jammed his knee). His season has kind of been like
NASDAQ.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Odds and ends:!off! Johnson manipulated the lineup in
hopes of helping badly slumping Shawn Green find his groove. Green
was moved from cleanup to No.3, switching spots with Gary Sheffield
in the order. Green entered the night in a 3-for-34 slump, then
grounded into a double play in his first at-bat.... As expected,
middle infielder Mike Metcalfe was added from Triple-A Albuquerque
and outfielder Shawn Gilbert was designated for assignment before
the game.... Right-hander Gregg Olson pitched the eighth inning in
his third rehab stint with Class A San Bernardino. Olson allowed a
run on two hits against Lake Elsinore.... Right-hander Jeff Shaw
threw on the side for the first time since he was placed on the
15-day disabled list June 28 (retroactive to June 27). He's slated
to return after the All-star break.!dlim!!end!

ANOTHER LOSS, BUT DODGERS NOT DESPERATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The leadoff position hasn't stabilized and, even
three months into the season, one left-hander in the bullpen isn't
ideal.
</P>
<P>
   That stated, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
understands that at the halfway point of the season, the next 81
games rests primarily on four shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start putting together some well-pitched
ballgames,'' Johnson said after the Dodgers dropped their third
straight, a 7-2 loss to San Diego at Qualcomm Stadium in the first
of a three-game series Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, in all likelihood, will be his usual, awesome self
from here to October. But how the other four _ Chan Ho Park, Darren
Dreifort, Eric Gagne and Carlos Perez _ fare will determine if the
Dodgers actually play in October.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second half to be better than the first, in which
the Dodgers trudged through injuries, fights and an unforgiving
schedule to finish 41-40, that quartet needs to be better than the
combined 18-20 they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not desperate, but I think the way we can make a
comeback is by winning the series,'' Dodgers shortstop Alex Cora
said. ``I look every night, or over the weekend, and the White Sox
are winning their series. All the teams that are in first place are
winning their series and I think that's the way we have to approach
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since winning two of three against the Texas Rangers in early
June, the Dodgers have won just one of their last seven series.
They'll need to win the final two games against the Padres to end
that trend, but more disturbing is the fact that the Dodgers are
19-19 at home. They've also lost nine of their last 12 games
overall.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hope and resolve and commitment they've talked
about, not to mention a better attitude in the clubhouse this
season, the Dodgers are six games behind Arizona and in fourth
place in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have play a lot better in the second half,''
Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros said. ``We're obviously aware of
what we need to improve and get things going.''
</P>
<P>
   Park (9-5) has been solid for much of the first three months,
but the potential for meltdown, like a year ago, continues to
exist. Park, who had a winning streak ended at five games, seemed
in control through three innings against the Padres but
inexplicably lost it in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Park allowed a single, a walk, threw a wild pitch, allowed a
two-run single and then an RBI double as the Padres took a 3-2
lead. An error and a sacrifice fly in the fifth made it 5-2 and a
leadoff double by Bret Boone and Ruben Rivera's sacrifice fly in
the sixth put the Padres ahead 6-2. This from a Padres squad that
scored 25 runs in its last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   In six innings, Park allowed five earned runs on seven hits and
two walks, but his stuff was markedly better than that. Which has
Johnson again perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like later on (in the game), he quit hitting his
spot and he quit locating, and it wasn't very pretty,'' Johnson
said. ``When you're not scoring, the pitcher has to hold us in
there and hold the other (team) down. It didn't look like he was
real sharp at times, and other times it looked like he was rushed.
Not one of his better outings. I don't know, sometimes he's a
mystery to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had but four hits off San Diego starter Matt Clement
(8-7), who beat the Dodgers for the second time in five days. He
allowed four hits and one earned run in a season-high 8 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't the same guy that pitched a week ago,'' Cora said.
``He was getting ahead and making good pitches. You went with your
game plan, but he did his job.''

KENNEDY`S DRAMATIC SECOND HOMER LIFTS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels finally got their starting
pitcher out of the second inning, added two unlikely homers by Adam
Kennedy, watched Seattle outfielders Stan Javier and Mike Cameron
play I-got-it-you-take-it with a fly ball _ and still struggled to
beat the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels overtook Seattle in the eighth inning and won 7-6,
before a capacity crowd of 43,487 at Edison Field that was lured by
a post-game Fourth of July fireworks show.
</P>
<P>
   A win Tuesday pulled the Angels within six games of first-place
Seattle in the American League West and gave them an opportunity _
with two wins over the Mariners in the series _ to jump right back
into the race.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who earlier hit a two-run homer, belted a two-run homer
off Jose Mesa with one out in the bottom of the eighth to put the
Angels ahead. It was Kennedy's sixth homer of the season and the
first two-homer game in the second baseman's brief career.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek (3-2) earned the victory by retiring both batters
he faced in the eighth. Troy Percival got the final three outs for
his 20th save in 25 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The win might have come easier if the Angels had a little help
from the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   First-base umpire Fieldin Culbreth ruled Alex Rodriguez beat the
back end of a potential inning-ending double play in the seventh _
replays showed Rodriguez was out _ and Edgar Martinez followed with
a double that scored Rodriguez to give Seattle a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was the last batter Angels starter Kent Bottenfield
faced in a bullpen-saving effort the Angels needed after starters
Ken Hill and Tim Belcher failed to last two innings the past two
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield gave up a first-inning homer to Rodriguez _ the 13th
he has allowed in his last eight starts _ but was otherwise
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the Mariners off the board until the sixth. By then, the
Angels led 4-1 thanks to Mo Vaughn's RBI single in the first,
Kennedy's two-run homer in the second and Matt Walbeck's solo shot
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels bullpen was so taxed _ Al Levine, Mike Fyhrie,
Derrick Turnbow and Shigetoshi Hasegawa were available for no more
than a batter or two _ that Bottenfield stayed in through the sixth
when the Mariners sent 10 men to the plate and scored four runs to
take a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Mariners had scored four times and had the bases
loaded with one out before anyone began throwing in the Angels
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Garrett Anderson didn't help Bottenfield when
twice during the inning he missed a cutoff man _ once earning an
error, his first in 160 games. The mistakes may not have led
directly to runs, but they forced Bottenfield to pitch around Mike
Cameron and Martinez because there was mo double-play possibility.
</P>
<P>
   After Martinez's walk loaded the bases, John Olerud, who drove
in four runs Monday, hit a two-run double over Anderson's head that
evened the score, 4-4. David Bell singled home Martinez to put
Seattle ahead, 5-4, but Bottenfield regrouped and retired pinch
hitter John Mabry and Mark McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners handed the Angels a run in the sixth, though they
seemed relunctant to take it. Troy Glaus, who reached on a two-out
walk, loafed around the bases and failed to score when Cameron and
Javier let Kennedy's towering pop fly fall.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus was spared further embarrassment when Jose Paniagua
uncorked an 0-2 slider in the dirt that catcher Robert Machado
couldn't block, allowing Glaus to even the score, 5-5.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the 10 ``Big Brother'' contestants entered
their new home on the CBS Studio City lot Tuesday night, they
spiraled into an alternate dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 89 days, TV's newest reality show, which will
premiere Wednesday night at 9, will record their every move as they
engage in a quaint, back-to-basics lifestyle _ tending chickens for
eggs, scrubbing their dirty laundry on a washboard, growing
vegetables and making bread and pasta sauces. And unlike the
chickens, the contestants can't fly the coop.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, when you're filling a tin grain feeder for the
chickens with a wireless mike clipped to your shirt, its battery
pack weighing on your belt and at least three cameras trained on
your every flinch, it's hard to feel like you've returned to a
simpler time.
</P>
<P>
   I can speak on this matter with some authority, because this
past weekend I spent 43 hours locked inside the ``Big Brother''
compound with nine other guinea pigs. So I got a taste of some of
the challenges that await the real ``houseguests.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, my time in the ``Big Brother'' house wasn't the sort of
trial that the real houseguests will suffer through. CBS has cast
disparate personalities from across the country for the real show.
My band of suburban survivors was culled largely from the
entertainment industry, and we actually got along pretty
swimmingly. The only agonizing came when we were forced to vote
someone out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The crew included: Mike, a KCBS-TV (Channel 2) reporter;
Danielle, an agent's assistant at William Morris; Beth, a CBS
publicist; Pete, who worked for the company producing ``Big
Brother''; Chad, a groundskeeper on the Radford lot; Lindy, a
post-production assistant for an upcoming Turner TV series;
Suzanne, who worked on reality series; Becky, a production head at
a furniture company; and Max, a TV director from the Netherlands,
where ``Big Brother'' originated, here to observe how CBS handled
the series.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did we fail to give ``Big Brother'' the sort of
confrontations the show will likely thrive upon, we also neglected
to provide even a smidgen of romantic intrigue. Mike and I are both
married, but even the others managed little more than the mildest
flirting.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, right from the outset, most of our conversations
focused, almost obsessively, on sex. And that's where Danielle
shown.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle was so honest and so revealing _ some might say, so
shameless _ that the rest of us were convinced that the producers
of the show were scrambling to make room for her. She declared,
almost immediately, that she was a 26-year-old bisexual virgin; she
discussed female hygiene and self-gratification and declared that
women are better kissers and flashed the Big Brother cameras a few
times.
</P>
<P>
   This was helped, no doubt, by the bottles of champagne waiting
for us on the dining room table as we entered the house. We
immediately began drinking, and thanks to some of the houseguests'
generous contributions (we were allowed to bring wine and beer),
some in our number seemingly never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   We may have become temporary lushes, but at least we were mellow
and relieved a bit from the pressures _ and the tedium _ of a
weekend in close quarters with complete strangers. For the real
``Big Brother'' houseguests, a nearly endless alcohol supply won't
be possible. They'll have to spend their meager income on real food
and items like toilet paper and paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night's bibulous introductions, we spent Saturday
morning dealing with the realities of making coffee with real beans
and tending to the chickens. Then in the afternoon, we were
summoned to the Red Room for our ``Big Brother Challenge'': We each
were issued a paddle-ball toy and told that we each had to master
bouncing the ball on it for a solid minute in tandem _ no one could
mess up. We had three hours to practice and three chances to get it
right. If we succeeded, we'd earn more dinner money. If we failed,
we'd best enjoy our heap of raw potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never do this,'' an exasperated Pete groused. ``This is
impossible,'' sighed Danielle. We banged our paddles a few times,
never controlling the bounce for more than a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where duplicity and cunning came in handy. ``Wait a
second,'' I said. ``The instructions didn't say we had to bounce
them far. So we can just do really wimpy, easy little bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   I demonstrated and Mike advanced the loophole even further _
``Just pull the rubber string back so that there's only an inch
between the ball and paddle,'' he said. So we did, it worked, and,
chuckling the self-satisfied snicker of cheaters who stole the big
game, we chucked the toys aside and returned to our afternoon
activities. We accomplished the challenge on the first take, and
enjoyed a feast of tri-tip steaks.
</P>
<P>
   But the fun stopped when Big Brother told us we had to boot one
of our ranks out of the house or, as he subtly put it, two of us
were to be ``marked for banishment,'' whereupon ``the viewers''
would vote which of those two were toast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate this,'' Lindy opined. ``I don't want to vote anyone out
_ I like everyone,'' Danielle moaned. But as Pete pointed out,
``Cutting each other's throats is why people will watch.'' So
throat-cutting time it was.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Suzanne was nominated for ouster, but so was I. (Danielle
explained that I simply wanted to be home with my wife and she
wanted to facilitate that.)
</P>
<P>
   Here's where ``Big Brother'' amps up the psychological torture:
On ``Survivor,'' the person leaves immediately after being voted
out. On ``Big Brother,'' those earmarked for death have to wait two
or three days. Suzanne and I only had to wait until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, we wheeled a giant Sony Trinitron from the storage
room into the living room and plugged it in. A face appeared,
dispassionately announcing that ``the viewers'' wanted Suzanne out.
I was spared. She had 15 minutes to pack and leave.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Suzanne was history, Big Brother ordered us to
discuss why she was ousted. Six of us had voted against her, and
each of us gave the same reason she was too nice (``nondescript,''
as one houseguest put it). In but two days, Big Brother had turned
us against ourselves _ instead of hanging on to the people with
whom it was easiest to get along, we were intentionally inviting
friction, contention and controversy. It was a chilling
realization.
</P>
<P>
   After the trauma of the initial vote, though, it was time to
drink some more, and after more of the requisite sex talk, some
turned the night into a frat party. In one bedroom, Pete, in the
lower bunk, grabbed Beth, in the top bunk, by the hair and began
pummeling her with his pillow until she toppled from the bed,
landing mainly on Max, who was (misguidedly) trying to sleep.
Beth's vengeance occurred where Pete was most vulnerable _ we'll
leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Sunday was a muted affair. We gathered around the pool _
basically a glorified wading pool _ and engaged in banter that had
to have been mind-numbingly tedious for those monitoring us.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the folks in the group enjoyed or at least tolerated the
experience, but would no doubt cite Alexander Pope's observation of
``Paradise Lost'': ``No one wished it were longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The rush of excitement for us waned in less than 48 hours. So we
have sympathy for the folks who have replaced us, for whom quietude
will come at a premium and privacy will become a dim memory.

KENNEDY TAKES M'S TO LAUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Mariners lost this one about 101 ways,
only the last of which was Jose Mesa's first pitch to Adam Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie second baseman hit his second two-run homer of the
game in the eighth inning, carrying Anaheim to a 7-6 victory in a
game the Mariners gave away.
</P>
<P>
   The homer came at the end of a long streak of success for Mesa,
who had turned his season around after losing his job as closer
late in the spring. He had only allowed three runs in all of June,
virtually cutting his earned-run average in half.
</P>
<P>
   None of that meant much to Kennedy, the second baseman picked up
in the deal that sent center fielder Jim Edmonds from Anaheim to
St. Louis this spring. He simply elected to swing at the first
pitch he saw from Mesa, starting an early Fourth of July fireworks
extravaganza at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa got the next two outs, but it was too late. The Mariners
went down in order against Angels closer Troy Percival in the top
of the ninth, bringing Seattle's three-game winning streak to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put all of this on Jose,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ``We had all kinds of little things we could have done to win
the game. We did some big things, coming back the way we did, but
we made some mistakes, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very good all year about doing the little things,
but tonight we didn't do them like we can.''
</P>
<P>
   If this night proved anything, it was that the Mariners lose as
a team as easily as they win as a team. Mesa played his part
Tuesday night, but so did second baseman Mark McLemore, reliever
Jose Paniagua, outfielders Stan Javier and Mike Cameron,
pinch-hitter John Mabry and starting pitcher Gil Meche.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore couldn't come up with Garret Anderson's hard ground
ball to open the eighth inning. That failure knocked steady
reliever Arthur Rhodes out of the game in favor of Mesa, with
Piniella playing the matchup game. Mesa was asked to get the
right-handed Troy Glaus out, which he did, but the left-handed
Kennedy burned him.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were down 4-1 early, but scored four times in the
sixth to take the lead. They should have held it all the way
through to the eighth, but Meche, Cameron, Javier and Paniagua
helped give that lead away in the bottom of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Meche walked Glaus with two out after he'd retired six in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do my job tonight, that's all,'' said Meche, who gave
up two homers and wound up being charged with five earned runs in
52/3 innings. ``If I pitch better, we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefty Rob Ramsay took over at that point to face Kennedy, and
did exactly what he wanted to do _ getting Kennedy to hit a routine
fly ball. But neither Cameron or Javier tracked it well. Each
thought the other was going to catch it, and neither did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of miscommunication,'' Cameron said, shaking
his head. ``The ball just fell.''
</P>
<P>
   That left runners at second and third, and Paniagua was asked to
get the last out. He did, but firstthrew an 0-2 wild pitch with No.
9 hitter Benji Gil at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came into the game, the one thing I'm telling myself
is, `No wild pitch. No wild pitch,''' Paniagua said. ``It was a
slider and it broke down, too far down. It was too hard, too
quick.''
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied, the Mariners got one more shot at redemption
in the seventh when Edgar Martinez doubled with two out and Alex
Rodriguez on first.
</P>
<P>
   While Angels left fielder Orlando Palmeiro tried to dig the ball
out of the corner, Rodriguez raced around the bases. Gil took the
relay and threw a one-hop rocket to the plate that dead-heated with
Rodriguez, but catcher Matt Walbeck couldn't come up with the ball.
Walbeck had blocked Rodriguez away from the plate, but with the
ball rolling loose, Rodriguez scrambled back and tagged the plate
for the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   The RBI was the 86th for Martinez, matching the total he had for
all of last season. As the major-league leader in RBIs, the
designated hitter is expected to be named to the American League
All-Star team today when the backups and members of the pitching
staff are named.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry's contribution _ or lack thereof _ came when he was asked
to pinch-hit in the sixth after the Mariners had scored four times
and had the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Kent Bottenfield, tiring badly, was only in the
game because the Angels had blown through their bullpen the past
two days. At a point when patience was there, waiting to be
rewarded, Mabry swung early in the count and popped out. A couple
of pitches later, Bottenfield limped out of the inning only one run
down when McLemore popped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole game was a see-saw,'' Piniella said. ``We had a
chance to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the Angels, who took advantage of opportunity more than
the Mariners did.

RANGERS FEASTING ON ATHLETICS' PITCHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Texas Rangers might be going nowhere fast
in the American League West, but they are making life miserable for
the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which lost six of nine to the lowly Minnesota Twins,
continues to clobber the Athletics' pitching. Tuesday night, it was
first baseman Rafael Palmeiro who had the big blow of the barrage
with a two-run home run in the seventh inning, breaking a 7-7 tie
and carrying the Rangers to a 10-7 victory at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 49,187, the second-largest regular-season crowd ever
at The Ballpark in Arlington, watched as the Rangers improved to
6-2 against the Athletics this season. With 10 runs and 13 hits,
the Rangers are hitting .348 against the Athletics this year, with
12 homers and 66 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nice win to have on the Fourth of July in front of a
sellout crowd,'' Palmeiro said. ``It's a good game to celebrate. I
think we've shown some good spurts in the first half. We just need
to stay within striking distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Good relief pitching also helped. Doug Davis, whose son
underwent stomach surgery yesterday, got the victory with two
hitless innings, and Jeff Zimmerman, protecting a two-run lead, got
two big outs in the eighth. Entering with runners at second and
first and one out, Zimmerman got Olmedo Saenz on a grounder to
third, then struck out Matt Stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do what what (Davis) did, I applaud it,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``I told him I appreciated him being here at the
ballpark. I know where I would've been, and it wouldn't have been
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The performances of Davis and Zimmerman came on a night when
owner Tom Hicks said before the game the work of the Rangers'
middle relievers has been the ``biggest disappointment'' of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they pitched this year the way they did last year, we'd
have a better record,'' Hicks said. ``I think they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Esteban Loaiza lasted only 41/3 innings, giving
up five runs on six hits and four walks. Ben Grieve produced two of
those runs in the first inning with a two-run home run, his 16th of
the year and the 10th of his career against the Rangers. He has 65
home runs total.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs also went deep against Loaiza in the fourth with a
440-home run over the Rangers' bullpen in right-center field, the
longest home run hit at The Ballpark in Arlington this year.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sheldon, filling in for injured shortstop Royce Clayton,
had a double and a home run, his second as a major-leaguer and
first since 1997, while with the Athletics. His home run Tuesday
night came leading off the third inning against Oakland starter Gil
Heredia.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers trailed 2-0 going into the inning, but Sheldon's
home run started a five-run rally. After Sheldon went deep, Frank
Catalanotto reached on second baseman Randy Velarde's error, then
came around to score on singles by Rusty Greer and Palmeiro. Right
fielder Stairs committed two errors on Palmeiro's single, allowing
Greer to score and Palmeiro to advance to third. Ivan Rodriguez's
sacrifice fly gave the Rangers a 4-2 lead, and Texas added a runs
on a single by Dave Martinez, a wild pitch and Mike Lamb's single.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs' home run and Terrence Long's run-scoring double against
Loaiza made it 5-4 in the fourth. The Rangers made it 6-4 that same
inning on Sheldon's double and Rodriguez's run-scoring single, but
Loaiza couldn't stay around through the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Grieve to start the inning and gave up a one-out
double to Stairs, putting runners at second and third, and Oates
had seen enough. Francisco Cordero came in and got Miguel Tejada on
a grounder to second that scored Grieve. After Eric Chavez walked,
Cordero got out of the inning by getting Ramon Hernandez on a
bouncer to third.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb's single and Gabe Kapler's double gave the Rangers a 7-5
lead in the fifth but the Athletics tied it in the sixth. Long led
off with a double and Velarde singled to center. Kapler, the
Rangers' center fielder, tried to get Long at home but his
ill-advised throw sailed high and wide to the backstop, allowing
Velarde to race to third.
</P>
<P>
   After Davis replaced Cordero, Velarde scored on Jason Giambi's
sacrifice fly, tying the score at 7-7. nn

WEB CONTEST CHALLENGES HACKERS TO CRACK SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey computer code crackers:hack this!
</P>
<P>
   In today's jittery e-commerce world, a dare like that would get
an Internet executive kicked to the curb faster than a mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   But one Web store is inviting the world's code breakers to crack
its systems. The catch? The site, www.openhack.com, looks like an
online art store, but it's really a contest set up by companies
united in their animosity for computer bandits.
</P>
<P>
   The winning hacker takes home $2,500 and the knowledge that he
or she helped the Internet industry shield itself against future
invasions.
</P>
<P>
   A few lessons might be good for the online marketplace, where
even the top players haven't figured out how to stave off vandals
and bandits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show people what happens when you just throw a site
up,'' Dan McCall, a founder of Guardent Inc., an Internet security
firm and one of the contest's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   When you taunt the world's code breakers, however, you'd better
be prepared. Last September, industry publication eWeek launched
the contest for the first time _ and the site took 1.5 million hits
from 50,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers have launched several ``denial-of-service'' attacks
since this year's annual contest began last week, making the
store's Web pages unavailable to the public at times.
</P>
<P>
   Such assaults have caused agony across the Web, forcing Internet
firms like Amazon.com and Yahoo.com to temporarily close their
doors. But they do not count as legimitate break-ins _ and most
code crackers sniff at such amateur work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's analagous to a kid who can't play in the football game,
so he ruins it for everyone else,'' said Mark Fabro, Guardent's
senior scientist.
</P>
<P>
   A real pro knows how to break into an e-mail or database server,
gaining access to confidential information such as credit-card
numbers, health records, and corporate secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The hacker who won last year's contest, for example, spent five
days sniffing around the site before managing to break into the
site's Linux server. Once inside, he scribbled on the home page:
``This site has been hacked. Jfs was here.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a clear difference between a hacker _ originally
defined as a person well versed in computer programming _ and a
criminal with hacking skills.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a bandit broke into online music store CD Universe,
retrieved 350,000 credit card numbers, and tried to extort $100,000
from the company. About 2,000 credit card numbers were taken from
Salesgate.com, an online marketplace for small businesses, the
company disclosed in March.
</P>
<P>
   In February, someone broke into the Web site of Aastrom
Biosciences Inc., a Michigan biotechnology firm, and planted a fake
press release claiming the company was being acquired for a large
sum. The stock price soared 50 percent before trading in its shares
was halted.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more examples, but you probably won't hear about
them. Security consultants say up to 95 percent of all computer
attacks go unreported because companies either had no knowledge of
the assaults or did not want them publicized.
</P>
<P>
   The public hacking contest is unusual in that it mimics a real
Web site. Industry observers say many hacking contests sponsored by
computer firms involve only a few pieces of the system _ only the
parts they want to test. But openhack.com includes an online
storefront, a back-end database, firewalls, and Web servers.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers can participate and remain anonymous. But to take home
the $2,500 check, the winner needs to provide a name to eWeek. The
publication will only publically disclose the winner's name with
his or her permission.
</P>
<P>
   The hacking contest has received mixed reaction from the
Internet industry. EWeek, which set up the competition, managed to
get help from Internet-related firms like Sun Microsystems and
PSINet. Other companies balked, saying they did not want to
encourage bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view, it's a misguided belief,'' said John Taschek,
eWeek's lab director in Foster City, Calif. ``Hacking occurs
anyway, whether you hold events or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a few code crackers deemed the contest unworthy of
their best hacking efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only $2,500 for information and skill that can potentially
save the industry tens of millions of dollars?'' one user wrote in
an e-mail posted on a technology Web site. ``Sorry, but I would not
waste my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other code breakers are taking the challenge. Last
week, Bruce Simpson, a 22-year-old college student in Scotland who
does Internet security consulting, began scrutinizing the site,
looking for open windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have a network to poke around in without getting
people upset,'' said Simpson.

FROM HARVARD CLASSROOMS, A COMPANY SPRINGS TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three weeks after graduating from Harvard
Business School, the ink is not even dry on their diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the four founders of Bang Networks have managed to find
workers, snare precious office space in San Francisco's ``Silicon
Gulch,'' hire a lawyer, and win venture capital financing.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they have built an instant company, complete with
money in the bank and free beer in the employee refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seems.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Bang Networks has been quietly nurtured for
months in the classrooms and libraries of Harvard Business School.
The business plan was written as an assignment for a class entitled
``Starting New Ventures.'' The market research was done to fulfill
requirements for a course on Net strategy. And professors and
fellow students acted as unpaid consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second year at Harvard Business School was almost like an
incubator,'' said Robert Dreyer, one of the company's founders.
``That was a time to plan a company in a sheltered environment. It
was the real thing. And, oh, by the way, we got a few class credits
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Business school administrators are not only aware of this
piggybacking of schoolwork with real-world capitalism, they
encourage it, within limits. It's happening not just at Harvard.
Plenty of other business schools are promoting the second year of
their MBA programs as incubators for fledgling businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In this fast-moving economy, where few people believe they can
take two years off for school, MBA programs are positioning
themselves not just as academic experiences, but as a chance for
students to try their hand at building actual companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't come here to bury your nose in books,'' said Loretto
Crane, spokeswoman for HBS. ``You have access to faculty advisers,
all the resources that the school provides, an incredibly powerful
alumni network, and you have proximity to classmates with deep
experiences and wonderful ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bang Networks, things couldn't have gone better. It all
began last year when Robert Rosin, during his second year at HBS,
met Tim Tuttle through friends at MIT. Tuttle, who has a doctorate
in computer science from MIT, had an idea.
</P>
<P>
   They teamed up with two other HBS students, Sarah Boatman and
Dreyer, to form a business plan around Tuttle's idea. Their plan
won HBS's Business Plan Competition. Upon graduating, the team flew
out to San Francisco and, within three days, found office space.
Within weeks, venture capital flowed in, and the company found
bankers, lawyers, and employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company is so new it is in ``stealth mode,'' when founders
won't talk about what their company actually does for fear that
their idea will be ripped off by a rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been living this charmed life,'' said Rosin, who has the
air of someone who can't quite believe his luck. ``We kept hearing
about all these horror stories of starting a company in the Bay
Area and, frankly, we've encountered none of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest readers get the idea that this is the typical experience of
business school graduates, a few words must be said about the
founders, whose experience likely had a significant impact on their
success thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Rosin, 29, Bang Network's president, worked for five years at
Sony, two of them as program manager for Sony's WebTV Internet
Terminal. Dreyer, 34, spent nearly 12 years at Intel Corp. At
Intel, he was one of the architects of the Pentium computer chip.
Boatman, 27, was an engineer at Honeywell Ltd in Toronto, and
Tuttle, 31, worked as a staff scientist at Lincoln Laboratory in
Lexington after getting his doctorate at MIT. The four founders
hold 18 patents between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gold-plated team,'' said Marco Iansiti, a professor at
HBS who advised the group as they developed their business plan.
``You're talking about exceptional people with an exceptional
business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, limits to how much a business school will
sanction the building of a venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a good idea to be running a business while
you're in school,'' Iansiti said. ``There's a difference between
planning a business and actually running it. That's where we draw
the line. Students shouldn't be running businesses while they're in
school. Bang is a good example of how it should be done. They did
the preparation while they were in school, and as a result they got
a jump-start on the real world when they graduated. They got it
just right.''

LUMAPATH LIGHTS THE WAY FOR WEB SURFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea for a new kind of Internet company took added shape
when Andrew Gelfond was reading an online movie review a few years
ago. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if the browser in his
personal computer could instantly retrieve other reviews of the
same movie so he could compare notes and get real-time second
opinions?
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wanted to know right away was, `Did Siskel and Ebert
give this movie a thumbs up or a thumbs down?' '' Gelfond said.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, Gelfond's idea is about automatically linking a
Web page displayed on a person's computer screen to other
independent Web sites with related content.
</P>
<P>
   Such technology could be extremely valuable to e-commerce
retailers, and it became the basis for Lumapath Inc., a Maynard,
Mass. start-up that Gelfond, a Lotus Notes alumnus, cofounded with
Robert Zurek, whose resume includes stops at Powersoft Corp. and
Sybase Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Secretly established a year ago, its strategy hashed out over
eggs at a local Friendly's, Lumapath just emerged this week from
``the stealth mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might call Lumapath an online branding company. Others
might say it's an Internet infrastructure company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anything like it,'' says Rebecca Reynolds
Moore, founder of MuseumShop.com, a Web retailer that sells items
online from the gift shops of some of the world's most famous
museums.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Zagat.com, Gomez.com, and CouponSurfer.com, Moore's
company is one of Lumapath's first clients.
</P>
<P>
   As an e-commerce shakeout has begun to claim early casualties, a
big challenge many Web retailers face is encouraging repeat
business.
</P>
<P>
   Zurek and Gelfond claim Lumapath offers a solution Web retailers
can use to keep their customers loyal _ a so-called browser
companion they've dubbed ``Take Us With You!''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose a consumer is a fan of MuseumShop.com. If the consumer
has a compatible browser _ and not everyone does at this point _
she can opt to mouse-click on the Take Us With You! logo at the
bottom of MuseumShop.com's home page.
</P>
<P>
   Then MuseumShop.com accompanies the consumer on her Internet
travels. At the bottom of her PC screen, a navigation bar appears
with an unlit icon for MuseumShop.com.
</P>
<P>
   The icon remains unlit if the Web sites the consumer visits have
no relevance to MuseumShop.com. But suppose a few days later, the
consumer goes to Amazon
</P>
<P>
   .com's Web site to check out books about Renoir.
</P>
<P>
   Take Us With You! instantly recognizes the relevance between the
consumer's search on Amazon.com and the inventory of gift items
stocked by MuseumShop.com.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, the MuseumShop.com icon at the bottom of the
consumer's PC screen lights up. If the consumer runs her mouse over
the illuminated icon, a pop-up screen shows some of the
Renoir-related items sold by MuseumShop.com.
</P>
<P>
   If the consumer chooses, she can instantly link to MuseumShop
</P>
<P>
   .com's store and make a purchase _ a sale that MuseumShop.com
might not have made otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   How does Lumapath hope to make money? By charging clients such
as MuseumShop.com a fee based on how much traffic Take Us With You!
drives to their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Lumapath has raised about $6.9 million in financing,
mostly from Hummer Winblad Venture Partners of San Francisco and
Atlas Venture of Boston. Lumapath employs 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We generally do West Coast deals because we take a board seat
and play an active role in our companies,'' Hummer Winblad partner
John Hummer said in a statement. ``But Lumapath had something
special that made us jump on the next plane to Boston. This (Take
Us With You!) infrastructure gives businesses a way to travel with
their consumers across the Web, to make their brands an interactive
part of the Internet experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who opt to use Take Us With You! aren't limited to
traveling the Web with just MuseumShop.com. In theory, a consumer
can load Take Us With You! navigation bars with as many as 18 Web
site icons at a time (as long as those sites are all Lumapath
clients).
</P>
<P>
   For example, a consumer could have MuseumShop.com,
CouponSurfer.com, and Gomez.com, the Web-site rating service, on
their navigation bar at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose the consumer now went looking for a Renoir book at
Amazon.com. All three icons could light up. The consumer could link
to MuseumShop.com to see related products, look up MuseumShop
</P>
<P>
   .com's rating from Gomez, and qualify for a coupon discount on
Renoir products from CouponSurfer.com.
</P>
<P>
   As Gelfond sees it, the beauty of Take Us With You! is that it
lets e-commerce clients provide a free, added convenience to their
best customers by allowing them to cut through Web clutter.
</P>
<P>
   For clients, Take Us With You! is about ``branding and bonding''
with an e-commerce Web site's best customers and making such Web
sites ``portable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Lumapath sounds like a grand idea. But as the Internet
has often proved, good ideas don't guarantee profits.
</P>
<P>
   One big challenge for Lumapath and its clients may be explaining
to consumers how Take Us With You! works and why consumers should
opt to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she chose to become a Lumapath client, MuseumShop.com
founder Moore said, ``There are so many ideas out where it's just a
leap of faith.''

SISTERS REACH SEMIS AT WIMLBEDON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ What a win for Williams. What a win for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   No, you're not seeing double. But Wimbledon will be Thursday
when America's smashmouth sisters, Venus and Serena Williams,
engage in the ultimate sandbox scuffle _ a Centre Court match at
the All England Lawn Tennis &AMP; Croquet Club.
</P>
<P>
   The drama will be diminished only by degree. A killjoy draw
decreed that the sisters, either of whom looks like a worthy
champion, must meet in a semifinal. They kept that appointment in
distinctly different fashion Tuesday. In the centerpiece
quarterfinal, Venus toppled top seed and world No. 1 Martina
Hingis, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. By then, Serena was comfortably settled in
the friends' box at Centre, having performed another whiplash act
with a 6-2, 6-0 demolition of Lisa Raymond that took all of 40
minutes on Court 1.
</P>
<P>
   That set up what Hingis called ``a family matter,'' and it will
be what really matters Thursday even if it's not the climax. At
least it will get top billing. In what shapes up as an afterthought
in comparison, defending champ Lindsay Davenport will try to
eliminate unseeded Jelena Dokic from her path to another title
bout. Davenport, the No. 2 seed, overcame a scare from No. 6 Monica
Seles, 6-7, 6-4, 6-0, in Act II on Centre. And after Serena barely
left any footprints on the grass of Court 1, Dokic _ a
quarterfinalist at 16 last year _ went one better in her second
Wimbledon, beating another wannabe, unseeded Magui Serna, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   But on this day, center stage was divided in two as the Williams
sisters took their respective courts simultaneously. That created a
logistical nightmare for their father, Richard, who coaches both.
He started out watching Venus, raced across the brick pathway to
catch a glimpse of Serena _ which was about all there was to see in
her match _ then returned with plenty of time left in Venus-Hingis,
a 2-hour-1-minute serial.
</P>
<P>
   Even though matters will be consolidated Thursday, Richard told
reporters he can't bear to watch. If not, he'll be the only one in
the vicinity averting eyes from this sibling rivalry between
sisters who maintain they're not sibling rivals.
</P>
<P>
   They're not the Lobsy Twins _ at 20, Venus is two years older _
and they insist they're just happy there will be a Williams in the
final. They showed up here as something of mystery guests, having
taken extended breaks for various injuries and other pursuits while
suspicious minds wondered whether their father was choreographing
their careers to avoid moments just such as this.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's here, Venus expects Daddy will be somewhere
alternately imploring, ``Go, Venus. Go, Serena.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus may need Richard's help more. Though she owns a 3-1 edge
over her kid sister in professional encounters _ winning in the
1998 Australian Open and Italian Open and the 1999 Lipton final _
Serena had the upper hand most recently, in the Grand Slam Cup
final last October. And Serena owns the only Grand Slam singles
crown in the house, having beaten Hingis in last year's US Open
final after Venus lost to the would-be homewrecker in the semis.
</P>
<P>
   No such vengeance is necessary now, but the sisters will try to
beat up on one another. It's a bittersweet prospect for a pair of
young ladies who claim they've been lifelong buddies, although
Serena conceded, ``I did have a problem with cheating when I was
younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus laughed at the recollection. ``I just rolled with it,''
she said. ``It's tough to argue against Serena because she was so
good at arguing, so good at cheating, it was no use.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been of no need here as Serena, the No. 8 seed, has ``been
playing the best tennis in the world this week,'' according to no
less a reviewer than Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   If it's not the best, it's certainly the fastest. Serena already
had 33- and 51-minute lightning strikes to her credit, so Raymond
shouldn't feel slighted.
</P>
<P>
   Serena broke her in the first game and again to 4-1 before
serving out the first set. She gave Raymond nothing in the second.
</P>
<P>
   That left her with ample opportunity to give support to No. 5
seed Venus, who needed every bit of it in holding off Hingis. Like
her sister, Venus is a powerhouse, serving consistently at 115-120
miles per hour; Hingis needs a tailwind to even threaten three
figures. But the 1997 Wimbledon winner is perhaps the craftiest
woman in the game, and that ability, along with Venus's tendency to
get overeager about finishing points, prolonged this showdown.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both antagonists had trouble with their serves. There
were 13 breaks in all, including a stretch of six in a row from the
final game of the second set to 3-2 in the third. The tradeoff
worked to Venus's advantage, and she served out the match, bombing
an ace for the coup de grace, then skipping and waving her arms as
if she'd just decked Lennox Lewis. After that, she marched
triumphantly to the stands, where she touched the American flag of
a brave soul who might not have realized that the British don't
find much reason to celebrate the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has the burden of facing her sister. And while there
won't be any grudges, there won't be any lack of incentive, either,
despite innuendos that Richard rigs the matches to split the
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to win Wimbledon,'' said Venus. ``Doesn't
matter if I'm playing Serena or I'm playing Pete Sampras, I'm going
to want to win Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   She's won't be alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't win,'' said Serena, ``I'm sure I'm going to be sad,
go home, work on a couple different things, see what I can do
better. It's just like a regular match.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure. And Wimbledon is just like your front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's match was a regular high-wire walk after Seles took
the first-set tie-breaker, 7-4. The defender hasn't been
overwhelming here, partially because of a bad back that shelved her
for two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of lost my rhythm on big points,'' Davenport said.
``But I can feel a big difference with the way I'm striking the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles, who lacks only this title to complete her Grand Slam
collection, could see the difference in the second set, when the
two traded breaks before Davenport trumped her in the 10th game.
And the challenger had nothing left after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely my energy level wasn't the same in the third set,''
said Seles.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor had it that Dokic didn't need to expend much energy to
handle Serna. Wimbledon obviously suits her nicely; following up on
last year's improbable run, she hasn't lost a set here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played well,'' Dokic said, ``and I didn't let the
opponents get into matches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses have gotten into the same match, and while it may
be awkward, both belong there.

TRACKING SOFTWARE RAISES STICKY LEGAL, ETHICAL ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cheatin' cyberhearts beware.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking in your computer may be a program that captures every
keystroke, every message, every word you type, every Web site you
visit.
</P>
<P>
   A separate program may be sending that information as an e-mail
to the person who installed the snooping software.
</P>
<P>
   The two programs, called Spector and eBlaster, were originally
intended for parents who wanted to keep track of their kids' online
activities and employers keeping tabs on their workers.
</P>
<P>
   Then suspicious spouses discovered the programs, which
surreptitiously record computer activity. The software evades
detection by not popping up in program files or on computer task
lists. It shows up only when a series of ``hotkeys'' are typed.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at SpectorSoft in Vero Beach, Fla., which makes the
products, estimate that half of the company's sales are used to
track potential infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   But the programs work so stealthily they spook even the most
cyber-savvy and have raised numerous legal and ethical questions.
</P>
<P>
   Is it legal?
</P>
<P>
   Does it invade privacy?
</P>
<P>
   Do parents, employers, and spouses have the right to spy?
</P>
<P>
   Can the programs' results be used as evidence in court?
</P>
<P>
   Does using them erode trust?
</P>
<P>
   Small, privately held SpectorSoft contends its software does
nothing illegal or unsavory. Its Web site advises customers to
disclose their monitoring efforts and cautions against installing
the software on computers they don't own. But skeptics say those
caveats may not shield the company _ or its customers _ from
potential legal consequences.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, it brings up sticky ethical issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal issues raised here are significant,'' said Marc
Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington, D.C., and a law professor at Georgetown University Law
Center. ``It is the main feature of the software _ its ability to
monitor covertly _ that creates the legal risk. In effect, it can
become unlawful intrusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``there are issues of trust,'' Rotenberg said. ``When
you're basically spying on someone, you really jeopardize trust
with those people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spector program, sold for $49.95 and downloadable from the
Internet, can be set by its users to capture screen shots at
intervals, from every second to every few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The second program _ called eBlaster, it sells for $59.95 _ will
send that information as an e-mail attachment to users,
elimininating the need for users to have direct access to the
computer being monitored.
</P>
<P>
   One disadvantage is that it requires users to flip through
individual screen shots, which can be time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   SpectorSoft's president, Doug Fowler, who studied math and
computer science at the University of New Hampshire, said the
company initially targeted only parents and employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months into selling the product, we got an e-mail from a
customer who used it to find out her husband had been cheating on
her,'' Fowler said. ``At first, I thought it was strange and sad.
It wasn't the kind of thing we set out to promote. But then we kept
getting more of these testimonials.''
</P>
<P>
   Now SpectorSoft, which sells about 1,000 copies of its programs
each month, actively promotes this segment, publishing on its Web
site and distributing to reporters customer testimonials that read
like a modern-day ``Madame Bovary.'' One e-mail came from a man who
installed it on his girlfriend's computer and found out she was
seeking ``sexual thrills'' online. ``I was amazed and saddened to
see the depths to which this woman had plunged, how full of deceit
and lies,'' the anonymous customer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Six out of 10 customers who buy the software for spousal spying
are women, Fowler estimated. ``Women have the right to know if
their husbands are fooling around and bringing diseases back to
them,'' he said. ``In many ways, we've empowered women to know
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the ethical aspects of using SpectorSoft products,
Fowler said his company could easily modify the program so that it
could be sent as a sort of computer virus that can, without the
recipient's knowledge, attach itself to the computer and silently
e-mail reports back to the sender. ``That, however, is a line we
will not cross, even though a product like that would sell very
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that wouldn't stop a clever hacker from rigging the program
to do just that, said Mark Young, a partner at Peabody &AMP; Young in
Boston and a specialist in cyberlaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wrong hands, this kind of software could give rise to
all sorts of violations of federal and state laws,'' Young said.
Among them are the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act,
which prohibits intercepting or revealing private electronic
communications, much as antiwiretapping laws do for telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which
bans unauthorized access to government computers, and the Economic
Espionage Act, which prohibits copying or control of corporate
trade secrets, Young said. In addition, most states have privacy
laws that mirror federal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler insists SpectorSoft's programs violate no laws. He
concedes, however, that they raise difficult social and ethical
questions, a fact that has kept conventional venture capitalists
from investing in SpectorSoft, which has so far been funded on less
than $100,000 in private seed capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether (venture capitalists) would be
comfortable with a product used by wives who are trying to discover
whether their husbands are cheating on them,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But personally, I don't have too much sympathy for a husband
who is fooling around on his wife. I just don't. It may be a
conservative point of view, but I think people have a right to
know. Does it promote a certain amout of paranoia and distrust? I
suppose it may. But in the past, people spent thousands of dollars
to get the same kind of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would feel if someone used the software to track
his computer activities, Fowler, who is not married, said, ``I
suppose I wouldn't be too happy about it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer users know they can get a big boost in performance by
adding some more memory chips. But IBM Corp. scientists say they
can get that same burst of speed by cramming twice as much data
into the same amount of memory.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is called Memory eXpansion Technology, or MXT. IBM
debuted the technology at last week's PC Expo trade show in New
York. The company intends to roll it out in its Netfinity server
computers, and has signed a five-year deal with ServerWorks Corp.,
a California maker of motherboard chips, to include the MXT system
in its future chipsets.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be only the beginning. Bill Ott, director of
Netfinity server development, says MXT will become a standard
feature in all kinds of computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this technology is going to be pervasive,'`
Ott says.
</P>
<P>
   MXT works by compressing the data loaded into the computer's
main memory bank, so that twice as much can be fitted into the same
number of dynamic random-access memory chips. There's nothing new
about the idea; for years, companies have offered software products
for this purpose. Few users of the Windows operating system
presently use this kind of software, but a memory compressor called
RAM Doubler is quite popular on Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh
machines.
</P>
<P>
   But this approach to memory compression carries a cost. Because
a computer uses the data in its main memory chips millions of times
every second, the computer must constantly pause to decompress the
data before processing. As a result, memory compression makes the
system run slower.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's approach takes the load off the computer's main processor,
placing it instead on a special controller chip that resides on the
computer's motherboard. This chip automatically handles the
compression-decompression process, running a program based on the
standard ``zip'' algorithm used to compress data files.
</P>
<P>
   Ott says MXT could have been implemented years ago, except that
the controller chips of the time were too slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get silicon that was fast enough to allow us to
implement these algorithms,'' he says. Today's chipmaking
techniques have solved that problem.
</P>
<P>
   The memory controller chip also shunts the most frequently used
data into a special ``memory cache,'' which is also on the
motherboard. By doing the entire process in hardware rather than
software, Ott says the IBM memory compression method slows the
computer only a little.
</P>
<P>
   But MXT makes up for this by reducing the need to look up data
on a computer's hard drive. That's what a computer does when the
information it needs isn't stored in the main memory chips. Hard
drives are mechanical devices and run thousands of times slower
than chips. So every time a computer looks up data on the hard
drive, it suffers a major decrease in performance.
</P>
<P>
   By squeezing twice as much data into the memory chips, the MXT
system sharply reduces the number of times the computer must run
hard drive lookups. Ott said that the result is a 30 to 60 percent
speed boost.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, rather than buy computers with the new technology,
users could just buy more memory chips. But that's not as
attractive an option as it was just a couple of years ago,
according to Steve Cullen, a memory industry analyst for Cahners
In-Stat Group. Cullen notes that the price of memory chips fell
dramatically during the late 1990s, but prices have more recently
leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   ``DRAM is going to be a good business to be in for the next
couple of years,'' says Cullen, because booming demand for
electronic devices will let memory chip makers keep their prices
stable.
</P>
<P>
   That means there's a market for a system to double the capacity
of every precious memory chip. Ott says that while MXT will make
its debut in high-end servers, it could be a big hit with makers of
palmtop computers and other cheap portable devices, whose designers
want to get maximum value from every bit of memory. Says Ott:
``We're driving this to make it an industry standard.''

RECRUITING: LURE DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Want to win a Palm Pilot?
</P>
<P>
   Just go to one of Trilogy Software's information sessions at any
college campus and you can enter a raffle to win anything from a
handheld device to a car. Trilogy, an Austin, Texas
business-to-business company, has been using marketing gimmicks
like these to lure students who are potential employees.
</P>
<P>
   As competition for young talent becomes increasingly fierce,
companies are forced to become more creative in attracting college
graduates to work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Students are time conscious and choosy about which companies'
information sessions they will attend, said Patricia Rose, director
of career services at the University of Pennsylvania. Many will go
to a company's Web site to learn about its business, she said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM Corp. has set up information sessions in spring break hot
spots like Panama City Beach, Fla., to catch students during their
time off. Recruiters will set up tents and pass out information
about job opportunities at IBM, said Maribeth Voss, program manager
at IBM's national recruiting program.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are also getting a jump on the traditional fall
recruiting season and trying to nab potential students by hiring
them as summer interns. Offering summer interns full-time jobs is
now commonplace, said Patricia Rose, director of career services at
Penn. She advises companies to try to hire prospective employees
for summer jobs the summer before their senior year and stay in
touch with the student until he or she makes a decision in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com hired 15 summer interns this year, including high
school and college students. The Maynard, Mass. online career
portal plans to offer full-time jobs to half of the interns who do
well, said Jeff Yehle, its human resources director.
</P>
<P>
   IBM hired 3,500 summer interns this year and will offer 40
percent of them permanent positions, said Glen Brandow, an IBM
spokesman.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   With dot-com companies under increasing pressure, would-be chief
executives are looking for higher cash and stock compensations to
make up for the increased risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, a CEO would make an average base salary of $150,000.
Today, they make an average of $200,000 to $225,000,`` said Juli
Ann Reynolds, managing director at Russell Reynolds Associates, an
executive search firm, in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When technology stocks were soaring, CEOs would be willing to
leave an old economy company and take a pay cut in exchange for
more stock options at a dot-com, Reynolds said. CEOs now expect the
same cash compensation as they had at their previous company and a
large chunk of stock as well, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are going to great lengths to make executives
happy in the current market. One of Reynolds' clients wouldn't
accept an offer unless the company provided him with a personal
jet, and the company agreed to his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the executive recruit and his or her family with their
transition to a new city is just as important as monetary
compensation. Companies are willing to do what it takes and will
even help CEOs place their children in an advanced school, Reynolds
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the tech sector, where engineers and technicians are in short
supply and great demand, undergraduate engineering majors are
receiving sign-on bonuses with their offers this year.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering graduates at Northeastern University were offered
bonuses from $2,000 to $5,000 on top of moving expenses, said Maria
Stein, associate director of senior and alumni services.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Pennsylvania, one engineering graduate this
year was offered a $15,000 sign-on bonus, said Rosette Pyne,
assistant director of career services.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also help graduates settle into their new living
situation, giving them temporary places to live until they find
apartments, said Stein.

THORNY ISSUES ARISE OVER PROTECTION FOR ONLINE INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stewart is geeked out and plugged in. The gangly, pink-haired
pitchman for the online broker Ameritrade is perfectly comfortable
buying and selling shares of stock in the do-it-yourself Internet
world.
</P>
<P>
   The fuddy-duddies Stewart persuades to try online trading, on
the other hand, come straight out of mainstream America. They know
how to use a computer, and they can learn how to place a trade
online easily enough, but they don't have Stewart's Net savvy or
his tolerance for risk.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is an important one for regulators.
</P>
<P>
   As online trading evolves beyond the techies and day traders
that Stewart stereotypes, it is raising all-new questions of rights
and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Who, for example, is on the hook if a 70-year-old widower loses
his life's savings investing in dot-com stocks?
</P>
<P>
   Offline, a broker could be responsible for steering the widower
into unsuitable investments. Online, the same investor might not
have any recourse, even if he relied on information provided by an
Internet brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the question boils down to whether Net brokers
give investment advice or just automate the buy/sell transaction.
With billions of dollars hanging in the balance, the answer turns
on a seemingly simple point: the definition of ``recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, regulators take a wobbly second step in their effort
to deal with such issues. That's when the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers
finish a six-week, coast-to-coast fact-finding tour of the major
online brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory road show stopped at Boston's Fidelity Brokerage
in early June. It came on the heels of a 115-page SEC report,
released in November, that highlighted potential problems at
Web-based brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been sitting down with the firms to find out what kind
of tools they're developing and what kind of guidance they need and
want from us,'' said Laura Unger, the SEC commissioner in charge of
the tour. ``We want to protect investors, but we don't want to
stifle innovation (at the online brokers).''
</P>
<P>
   Unger said she plans to follow the road show by surveying the
investing habits of 2,000 cyber-broker customers. Still, she said
it's likely to be months before the SEC or NASD comes up with
comprehensive plans to make sure online investors have the same
protections as their offline counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early fall seems to be a realistic target for us to reach some
kind of conclusion,'' agreed Elisse Walter, chief operating officer
of NASD's regulatory arm. ``We're just not sure yet what the
conclusion will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the gaggle of regulators is that so much falls
into gray areas. Especially when it comes to the most contentious
debate _ about the so-called suitability requirement _ very little
is in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, online brokers argue, the Web is a primordial soup of
tools and information in which investors should expect less
hand-holding and less interference from the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not subject to the same requirements as traditional
brokers,'' said Robyn Slater, spokeswoman for Ameritrade, which
nonetheless found itself on the losing end of a high-profile
arbitration case over the issue five months ago. ``We don't give
recommendations; we just execute trades.''
</P>
<P>
   That position is shared by most online brokerages, since it
insulates them from claims that they bear any responsibility for
customers' bad investment choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's pretty cut-and-dried,'' said Glen Mathison,
spokesman for Charles Schwab, operator of the largest online
brokerage. ``We don't offer direct, personalized advice online, and
we don't think there are any suitability rules online.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, others see anything but a cut-and-dried issue.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Indiana University medical student Lael Desmond
lends some weight to arguments on the other side. In January, a
panel of NASD arbitrators ruled that Ameritrade was responsible for
a series of ill-fated investments Desmond made in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two schools of thought emerged right away on that decision,''
said Marc Beauchamp, executive director of the North American
Securities Administrators Association. ``Depending on who you ask,
it was either a misunderstanding about margin accounts or a
suitability issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Beauchamp said, there's a ``good chance there will
be a slew of cases like it'' in the aftermath of this spring's dip
in the Nasdaq Stock Market. That sell-off bloodied tens of
thousands of online traders who had invested on margin _ borrowed
money from their brokers, that is _ in the hope of amplifying gains
(at the risk of magnifying losses).
</P>
<P>
   The question in the Desmond case centers on the role of online
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds so straightforward,'' said Dan Burke, an analyst
with Gomez Advisors. ``But it turns out there are a lot of ways to
look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   At traditional firms, brokers have an obligation to make sure an
investment is appropriate before recommending it to a client. They
would be personally liable, for example, if they pushed go-go
technology stocks to inexperienced investors or ones with
relatively small accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Both the New York Stock Exchange and the NASD have versions of
the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Desmond decision, it was widely assumed that the
requirement didn't apply to online brokers, since they didn't give
individual advice. That case and the creation of new technology
that can ``personalize'' the online investing experience have
combined to stir up the current debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some brokers, for example, now have the ability to figure out
how their clients invest or want to invest. They might track a
customer's ``click pattern,'' or create a profile from information
the customer provides when she opens an account.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it would then be relatively easy to customize what
type of screens the investor sees, or to tailor research or
advertising to her interests.
</P>
<P>
   Another possility: Customers could establish a preferred asset
allocation, and get electronic warnings when their accounts stray
from the parameters, or if a trade isn't in keeping with the
established goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``At what point are they providing information, and at what
point are they making a recommendation?'' Unger asked. ``The more
the technology moves us toward `segment of one' marketing, the
harder it gets to draw a bright line between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   In Desmond's case, personalization technology wasn't involved,
and the facts aren't in dispute. Indianapolis lawyer Mark Maddox
simply argued that Ameritrade had a duty to keep inexperienced
investors such as Desmond from high-risk investments.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage, obviously, thought differently. Slater, the
Ameritrade spokeswoman, declined to comment on the case. In the
past, though, the company has said the arbitration panel made its
decision based on factors other than suitability.
</P>
<P>
   (Since arbitration panels rarely release written decisions, the
reasoning behind their decisions is often debated later.)
</P>
<P>
   Desmond originally invested $30,000 with Ameritrade, buying
shares of half a dozen tech stocks. Before long, he combined the
stocks' appreciation with money he borrowed from the Web broker to
buy shares worth another $67,000. At its peak, Desmond's account
had grown to about $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   When stocks plummeted in August 1998, Desmond not only lost the
entire account, but he owed Ameritrade another $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   After Desmond filed a grievance, an arbitration panel forced the
broker to repay $40,000 to cover Desmond's losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these online firms will give a margin account to
anybody with $2,000 and a pulse,'' said Maddox, who is also
president of the Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association.
``That's a speculative and risky way to invest, and it's
inappropriate for them to let people like Lael do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter, of the NASD, said regulators are still debating whether
that's true. And even if they decide that online firms have an
obligation to check for suitability, she said, they're not sure how
to implement such a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The industry argues that current regulations are sufficient.
Consumer advocates and some state regulators, meanwhile, would like
to see pop-up windows that warn investors about trades that
wouldn't pass muster under traditional suitability guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to avoid putting unnecessary restrictions on the way
companies do business,'' Walter said. ``We'll try to establish what
a firm's obligation is, and it's their job to come up with ways to
meet that obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what ultimately happens, some state authorities
are grumbling that the take-it-slow approach by the SEC and NASD
will leave investors unprotected for too long.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Division of Securities, for example, took the
initiative and requested information from the 20 largest Internet
brokerages last month. It sent questionnaires to each, asking what
steps are being taken to make sure customers are sophisticated
enough to invest online.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the New York attorney general's office conducted its
own study of the industry. The report focused on a number of
problems, but left open the question of new regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Nestor, head of the Massachusetts Securities Division and a
member of the regulatory crew that visited Fidelity, said it's only
a matter of time before states unilaterally write legislation
dealing with online brokers. They have a legitimate concern, he
said, that the stock market will slip into a bear market before
safeguards are in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, it wouldn't be a good situation to have 50 states
with 50 different sets of rules, but there are good reasons to have
a policy now,'' Nestor said. ``If the feds take a long time, you
will see states finalizing their own policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just too important of an issue, and too big of a new
industry, to leave these questions unanswered for long.''

AVERAGE YEARLY RETURN OF 6.58% MEANS PORTFOLIO NEEDS MORE ZIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. My four 401(k) funds seem to be flat. I've been making
contributions to my 401(k) since the early '90s and have only
$93,000. Suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   R.S., Brookline, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Almost everybody's portfolio has been flat _ or worse _
lately. Nonetheless, I'm having trouble figuring out just what
happened here. If you have indeed been contributing $6,600 a year
for a decade, you have realized average annual returns of only 6.58
percent _ and each of your four funds have better records than
that, although Fidelity Pacific Basin, with a 10-year record of
6.71 percent average annual growth, comes close. Either previous
contributions were lower, you began contributing late in the
decade, or you made a number of unfortunate portfolio switches. In
any event, I suggest a new plan. Aside from your Pacific Basin
holding, all of your funds have good records, with the Spartan 500
Index achieving 17.13 percent average annual returns over 10 years,
and Fidelity Disciplined Equity producing 17.65 percent. Fidelity
Asset Manager Growth was created at the end of 1991; it returned an
average 17.35 percent over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   You don't specify how your $93,000 is apportioned, but it seems
Pacific Basin is probably the root of a lot of disappointment. Its
dismal 10-year record largely can be tied to four consecutive years
of losses, beginning in 1994. Last year, it produced a spectacular
119.6 percent gain, but through the first half of this year it is
down 13.88 percent. It's simply too risky for a typical retirement
portfolio. I'd eliminate it. If you want to hold on to it, limit
the position to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you anticipate retiring within 10 years, eliminate the
Fidelity Asset Manager Growth position. It's a nice fund if you
have an investment time frame of five to 10 years, but not if you
anticipate retiring at 62 or 65. While the fund has a stronger
growth orientation than the other two Fidelity Asset Manager funds,
it still has only 67.5 percent of its assets in stocks. Spartan 500
Index is almost entirely invested in stocks. If the fund is
available in your 401(k), I'd prefer that you move the money in
Asset Manager Growth into Fidelity Growth and Income; if not,
consolidate that position in the Spartan Index 500 holding.
Finally, with the exception of Pacific Basin, your holdings
concentrate on the same market segment: large-cap domestic stocks.
Disciplined Equity and Index 500 vary only that Disciplined Equity
uses a computer program in an effort to tweak the results of the
Standard and Poor's 500 Index. Some years it succeeds; other years
it doesn't. I'd put 65 percent of the total portfolio in one or
both of those funds, and if these offerings are available within
your 401(k), I would then put 10 percent in Fidelity Select Health
Care, which I like a lot for long-term portfolios, another 15
percent in Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock fund, and 10 percent in Fidelity
Low-Priced Stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to retire in eight years. I have a home worth about
$225,000, with $40,000 on the mortgage, to be paid off in three to
four years. I am a conservative investor. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A.M., Newburyport, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not sure how the majority of your savings _ that $80,000
in the 403(b) account _ is invested, so it's hard to project a
growth rate. With average returns of 8 percent, you would
accumulate $208,105 over eight years, at current savings levels. At
7 percent or 6 percent, the figures would be $193,734 or $180,406,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Focus on inflation. If it averages 3.5 percent for the next
eight years, by the time you begin collecting that $40,000 annual
pension, it will have the buying power of $30,375 in today's money.
If you are contemplating a retirement based on a $40,000 income
stream, you would already be more than $9,000 behind. Your
accumulated savings would be enough to supply such an income
stream, whichever level of returns you consider. But the point is
that they would probably be inadequate to keep pace as year after
year of inflation piles up. If there is a cost-of-living adjustment
to your pension, that would make a huge difference. It would also
make a big difference if you were willing to invest more
aggressively. With a typical stock-dominated portfolio, you could
expect 10 percent returns; if you plug that assumption into your
savings schedule, the accumulation at age 61 would be $240,318.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like to push conservative savers into a more aggressive
stance. But there's another way to improve your retirement
position: Adding the amount of your mortgage payment to your
savings might roughly triple your savings level for the last four
or five years preceding retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am single and work for a company that was sold last year.
What should I do when the IRS releases the 401(k) money? I want to
retire in eight years with an income equivalent to $30,000 in
today's money. I add $2,000 a year to the Roth IRA and $6,500 to my
new 401(k) account. Where should I put the money from the 401(k)?
Should I move the money in the Roth IRA?
</P>
<P>
   P.E., Arlington, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The key thing when a 401(k) is terminated is to make sure it
goes directly from the managers of the old 401(k) to another
financial institution in the form of a rollover IRA. It is
possible, as well, that it could be rolled over into your current
401(k) with your new employer. If not, you could simply go to the
companies where you have your current traditional IRAs and ask one
or more of them to establish a rollover IRA for you. After that,
they will handle the paperwork, and the money will not go through
your hands. If it goes through your hands, it suddenly turns into
taxable income, with ugly results.
</P>
<P>
   I would definitely stick with Vanguard Health Care. The fund
went into a funk for a period last year, but the record at midyear
shows 35.4 percent 52-week total return, which is not my idea of
flat.
</P>
<P>
   If you achieve an average portfolio return of 10 percent, you
will have $504,999 in eight years. If inflation averages 3.5
percent, you will need about $40,000 to equal today's $30,000. Even
with Social Security, inflation would soon catch up with you. So
unless you increase your savings, you'd be better off retiring in
10 years, not eight.

MIKE WALLACE LEARNED HOW TO WIN FROM HIS FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM KALEC  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Mike Wallace often would turn his head and stare,
with a perplexed look on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The people who watched his father, Russ, race on weekends in St.
Louis admired the way he handled his car on local racetracks. Russ
always gave the fans a show. Still, they despised him.
</P>
<P>
   Russ drove aggressively, was willing to take a chance, and when
the dust settled, he was the one who usually crossed the finish
line first.
</P>
<P>
   Mike, along with his brothers Rusty and Kenny, marveled at how
this mechanic and St. Louis Post-Dispatch delivery man suddenly was
transformed into a driver who could navigate his car past the rest
of the field and somehow always finish near the top.
</P>
<P>
   He also wondered why the same fans who admired Russ's skill
behind the wheel wanted so badly for him to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to any local Friday, Saturday, Sunday night
racetracks, the one thing you found out is that the guy who wins a
lot gets booed,'' said Mike Wallace, who now races in the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series, which comes to New Hampshire International
Speedway this weekend. ``My dad was the guy that was booed.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was the driver that every other driver and spectator
wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   And once Mike figured out what the jeers meant, he couldn't wait
to hear the chorus of boos after his father had won another race.
It was the music that only a winner could enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   So when Mike was presented the opportunity to have the same
sounds fill his ears as a driver, there was little hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   He always had wanted to be the one behind the wheel. The one to
do whatever it took to win. The one who always seemed in control
and never could be rattled on the track.
</P>
<P>
   The one everybody loved to hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I can be like that, I can do that,'' Wallace said.
``I went through the working, all the regular jobs and all that
stuff, and I realized that is not what I want to do. I have friends
of mine that say I am crazier than heck to be in the business I am
in. You know, `It is too much work, it's too hard.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But no 9-to-5 job could give Wallace the thrill of being in the
hunt for the Craftsman Truck Series points championship. Heading
into this weekend's New Hampshire 200, Wallace is in fourth place
with 2,095 points and trails leader Greg Biffle by 152 _ a margin
Wallace believes he can make up if Biffle has one off race.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, Wallace considers an off race to be a
20th-place finish or lower. But in general, an off race for Wallace
is any time he doesn't get the checkered flag _ and the boos that
come with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad won all the time, so I grew up with that desire,''
Wallace said. ``It is a lot more fun to win than run in the back of
the pack. Everyone remembers the winner; no one remembers the
loser. You should want to be the guy, and I always want to be the
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I saw a T-shirt the other day that said, `Winning is
everything, coming in second is telling the world you suck.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wallace bought that shirt, and he thinks about its message
often.
</P>
<P>
   After battling Biffle down to the final lap of the Pronto Auto
Parts 400 June 9 in Fort Worth _ only to come up a couple of tenths
of a second short _ Wallace hung around the track and replayed what
had happened over and over in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The second-place finish certainly kept him in good position in
the standings.
</P>
<P>
   But to Wallace, second place meant he lost. There are no moral
victories, and that philosophy permeates his racing team, as
illustrated by Wallace's conversation with crew chief Tim Kohuth as
they left Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know we're screwed up,'' said Kohuth. ``We are a really
messed-up race team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean?'' Wallace replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed that we ran second,'' Kohuth said. ``Most
would be thrilled to death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but that is the difference between our team and everyone
else,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the reason Wallace might not be driving on the
Craftsman Truck circuit much longer.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994-97, Wallace raced occasionally on the Winston Cup
circuit with two teams. He thought he had reached the pinnacle of
motor sports. The stands were packed, the infields were full, the
races were on television, and he was bumping with the biggest names
in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had never been so miserable.
</P>
<P>
   He entered each race knowing that the resources of his team gave
him no chance to win. For a man who holds victory in such high
regard, being buried at the bottom of the Winston Cup standings was
unacceptable. His option was to switch to trucks and wait for a
better Winston Cup opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people made opinions about Mike Wallace that
are not really me,'' Wallace said. ``You know, people said, `You
are hard to get along with' or whatever. The problem was that I
wasn't running good. And it was bothering me. I just wasn't happy
because I wanted to run good but I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like having a bad day at work and everybody wanting you
to go around smiling all the time _ you just can't do it. So I want
to run the Winston Cup series again. I want to go back there. I
want to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace is now 41, but the memory of how fans would react
toward his father after he won race after race is still very fresh.
And it was those moments on sticky Missouri nights at the racetrack
that fuel his racing dreams.
</P>
<P>
   He is not content to be just another member of the Winston Cup
circuit; he has done that and found little enjoyment in it. He
wants to be the professional stock car driver everyone hates.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace wants to be booed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning drives me,'' Wallace said. ``I like to have that peer
respect. I would not just go back, because I have been there. I
like being one of the guys people know can win the race.''

 &HT;    Fat patriots finally get what they deserve
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray LeMay is giving something back to the wide load community.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think this country was born because the Pilgrims
wanted to escape religious persecution, but that's not it entirely.
They came here to eat. Eat, as in eat too much. Bring me your
tired, your poor, your double-meat cheeseburgers with a side order
of onion rings. We are a nation of fat people. Our national motto
ought to be: ``Are you going to finish that?''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, owner of Ray's Steakhouse in Austin, Texas, knows this. So
during August, Ray is going to put a set of scales near the bar in
his restaurant and give price breaks to big 'uns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to tighten all the chairs up and make sure they're
in good condition,'' said Ray, who is proud that he outweighs both
his parents put together. Ray weighs about 340, and his parents put
together weigh about 300.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it'll work. If you're a guy and you weigh 250 pounds
or more, you can get a double-size chicken fried steak or prime rib
for the price of the single size, or two kabobs for the price of
one, or a free baked potato. Women get the same break, but they
only have to weigh in at 200 pounds and up.
</P>
<P>
   So you're actually going to put women on a scale in your
restaurant, Ray? What are you, a suicidal lunatic?
</P>
<P>
   ``If a woman comes in and she tells me she weighs 200 and she
obviously is not, and I ask her to get on the scale, I'm going to
have to be careful because she may get mad and bang me in the head
with her purse,'' Ray admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it'll be even worse if Ray gives a woman a price break
by just eyeballing her. I can hear it now. ``Send the double prime
rib to the mastodon at table five.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray isn't quite so worried about asking big guys to get on the
scales for a price break. Although he does have one concern _ the
equipment. ``If a guy weighs 400 pounds, we're not going to ask him
to get on the scale,'' Ray said. ``We do have to worry about the
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray thinks one-airplane-seat-challenged people deserve a round
of applause. On Friday night, a customer mentioned a sister who
weighs 195 pounds. ``195?'' Ray said, with a ``So what?'' tone in
his voice. ``I weighed 195 when I was 6 years old.'' Ray agrees
that the three basic food groups are meat, gravy and cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Ray says that one time on Maui, he ate eight plates
of ahi tuna and a gallon of soy sauce. How long did that take?
``Twenty minutes,'' Ray said. ``The sashimi meister had to go to
the hospital after that, he was working so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray decided to come up with this special promotion for ``people
of size'' to thank the many slam-dunk-challenged people who come
into his restaurant. Austin is a skinny town, but Ray's is a fat
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Ray put it, ``I just notice a lot of fat guys come in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray recalls the moment when the scales idea hit him upside the
brain. ``I saw three guys come in one night; they all must have
been over 400,'' Ray said. ``I said, `You guys aren't going to
order the 6-ounce filets, are you?' They started laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   So remember our national heritage and go grill some dogs.

perennials _ reminding you that contrast can be as interesting as
complement. Such unexpected pleasure is always what I feel when I

   WALLPAPER _ Putting up wallpaper is not the easiest home
improvement project you can take on, but it's not the hardest

   AWNINGS _ Our decks and patios give us spaces for relaxing and

awning protects occupants from sun and rain while leaving them
exposed to the natural sights, sounds and breezes around them.
Window awnings also have practical uses. They block harsh direct
sunlight, making rooms cooler and more comfortable and they protect
furniture and fabrics from fading. But one of the most important
functions of patio and window awnings is to look good; they dress
up a house, giving it style and personality. (Dayton Daily News).

 &HT;    Info-age students missing it
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome back to work. If we can believe our daily newspapers _
and of course we can, every blessed word _ we spent this
extravagant gift of a four-day weekend in style: traveling,
barbecuing,
</P>
<P>
   ooh-ing and aah-ing over dozens of area fireworks displays.
</P>
<P>
   But not, apparently, teaching our young anything about the
significance of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's New York Times raised the question: What in Bunker Hill
do our college seniors know about history?
</P>
<P>
   TheTimes reported that a Washington-based nonprofit, the
American Council of Trustees and Alumni, conducted a survey of 556
seniors at 55 ``leading colleges,'' including Harvard and Brown.
They asked 32 high school-level
</P>
<P>
   history questions, throwing in a couple of pop-culture gimmes.
</P>
<P>
   One student scored 100 percent. The average score was 53
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-nine percent could identify Beavis and Butthead as
cartoon characters.
</P>
<P>
   But, given four multiple-choice answers _ with the answer
staring them in the face as expectantly as Regis Philbin _ a mere
22 percent could place the phrase ``Government of the people, by
the people, for the people'' in the Gettysburg Address.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight percent knew that Snoop Doggy Dog is a rap artist;
28 percent knew the Battle of the Bulge took place in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight percent guessed that the ``lowest point in the
Revolutionary War'' was Valley Forge.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes! These are the scions of the Information Age. An
unprecedented amount of knowledge is literally at their fingertips,
only a mouse click
</P>
<P>
   away. Miles and miles and miles of memory. Yet their cultural
memory banks appear to be running alarmingly low.
</P>
<P>
   Is that their fault or ours?
</P>
<P>
   How long has it been since American history was truly part of
the national conversation?
</P>
<P>
   Over the four-day weekend, we did Fourth of July with all the
trimmings: Fireworks, hot dogs and mustard, cookouts. Only once,
during that time, did any of our friends mention the significance
of the holiday? That was Zafar
</P>
<P>
   Rizvi of Butler Twp. He was born in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   He brought us an essay making the Internet rounds, ``Remembering
Independence Day.'' ``Have you ever wondered what happened to the
56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence?'' the essay
begins, and proceeds to
</P>
<P>
   elaborate, in gruesome detail.
</P>
<P>
   At Zafar's insistence, we reluctantly turned our attention away
from the grill. ``I didn't know any of these things!'' he
exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Harvard should appoint him honorary professor. We seem to
be in danger of raising future generations with gigabytes of
information instantly
</P>
<P>
   at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
   And none of it engraved in their hearts.

   AMAZON-REVIEWER _ Harriet Klausner not only reads at least two
books a day, the suburban Atlanta homemaker has churned out more
than 500 book reviews for Amazon.com in the last five years. Her
unpaid criticism has won her a loyal following and earned her the
title as the web site's No. 1 reviewer. ``I can tell in the first
50 pages if a book is any good,'' says Klausner, whose mission is
to draw attention to unknown writers. ``If it's not, I don't waste
my time.'' (Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.

   COXNET FOOD 0704 _ Making sangria is simple, and that's a good
thing because sangria aficionados strongly recommend that sangria
is at its best made fresh, not days in advance or out of a bottle.
But finding much consistency among sangria recipes is anything but
simple. All call for wine and citrus fruits, and most include some
sort of brandy, but beyond that, no two recipes are alike. (Fisher,
Dayton Daily News) Art includes a 3-column color photo of a glass

coconut pound cake. For country music's biggest stars, however,
``Mama'' Lois's cooking is the equivilent of any listing you'll

interest. The wineries listed in the wire-service stories as having
lost some of their already-bottled wines weren't on any of my
must-have lists, so the losses didn't resonate all that strongly.

SAVANNAH _ Every garden needs a touch of mystery, a little

you turn a bend after viewing a stately row of soft, fuzzy
perennials _ reminding you that contrast can be as interesting as
complement. Such unexpected pleasure is always what I feel when I
visit this old seaport town and see the ancient-looking Spanish
moss growing amid Savannah's New South hustle. (May, Atlanta

   WALLPAPER _ Putting up wallpaper is not the easiest home
improvement project you can take on, but it's not the hardest

   AWNINGS _ Our decks and patios give us spaces for relaxing and

awning protects occupants from sun and rain while leaving them
exposed to the natural sights, sounds and breezes around them.
Window awnings also have practical uses. They block harsh direct
sunlight, making rooms cooler and more comfortable and they protect
furniture and fabrics from fading. But one of the most important
functions of patio and window awnings is to look good; they dress
up a house, giving it style and personality. (Dayton Daily News).

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 &HT;    IBM LAUNCHES WORLD'S FASTEST SUPERCOMPUTER
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ IBM announced Thursday(cq) it has built the first
supercomputer that scientists hope is powerful enough to simulate
the explosion of a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The $110 million machine is a major step toward an era when
computers will provide such benefits as vastly improved weather
forecasts and individually designed medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The new IBM computer, called ASCI White, weighs 106 tons and
occupies an area the size of two NBA basketball courts. It would
take the next four biggest computers in the world combined to equal
its enormous processing power.
</P>
<P>
   The new supercomputer can do 12.3 trillion calculations a
second, making it about 30,000 times more powerful than today's
desktop personal computers. It is 1,000 times more powerful than
IBM's Deep Blue, the supercomputer that beat chess champion Garry
Kasparov in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every man, woman and child on the face of the Earth would have
to add up 2,000 random numbers a second to keep up with this
machine,'' said David Cooper, chief information officer at the
Energy Department's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said he was ``cautiously optimistic'' that ASCI White
will for the first time let government scientists perform the
complex modeling and simulation needed to ensure the reliability of
the explosive yields in U.S. nuclear weapons, eliminating the need
for actual underground tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of the old-timers will say, 'I'm not willing to give
up on testing until I see a lot more of these simulations,' ``
Cooper noted in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, using a model that makes 1 trillion calculations a
second, the Livermore lab was able to test nuclear weapon
``triggers.'' Combining those tests with ASCI White testing of
explosive yields would require 20 or 30 days of work on a computer
that makes 100 trillion calculations a second, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has entered into ``discussions'' with the Energy
Department's office of defense programs to deliver just such a
machine by 2004, said Jim Jardine, IBM's Austin, Texas-based
project manager for ASCI White. The letters stand for the Energy
Department's ``accelerated strategic computing initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Livermore, nuclear simulation tests are also being
conducted at Los Alamos and the Sandia National Laboratories, both
in New Mexico. They are necessitated by the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, which the United States has not signed, but by which it
abides.
</P>
<P>
   IBM believes the supercomputing breakthrough can be applied to
other fields besides nuclear weapons. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Global weather modeling under which current 18-hour computing
cycles can be reduced to a few seconds, radically transforming
early warning systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Production of pharmaceuticals that are custom-tailored to a
person's individual's genetic profile.
</P>
<P>
   _ Integrated monitoring of air routes, jet stream weather
patterns and pollution migration.
</P>
<P>
   The basic building block of the new IBM supercomputer is known
as the RS/6000. Since 1992, IBM has sold more than a million of
these machines to about 150,000 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jardine noted that the ASCI White system rests on a structure
that combines many of these units, unlike ``the one-of-a-kind
(supercomputers) that not a lot of people can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in sheer scale, the new machine dwarfs all that has gone
before. For example, if it were to be deployed as a Web server, it
could process 6 billion online transactions in one minute flat.
</P>
<P>
   To get the job done:
</P>
<P>
   _ Its 8,192 microprocessors contain some 2,000 miles of copper
wiring.
</P>
<P>
   _ It holds than 160 trillion bytes of disk storage capacity,
enough to house twice the contents of the Library of Congress and
16,000 times more than high-end PC's equipped with 10 gigabytes of
storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
   _ It has a memory bank of 6.2 trillion bytes, nearly 100,000
times more than today's average desktop PC, which comes with 64
megabytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
   _ It requires 1.2 megawatts of electricity, enough to power a
small-sized city.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shipments of the machine from the IBM performance testing
facility in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to Livermore, which have already
begun, is requiring 28 tractor trailer trucks.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web: www.top500.org ranks the world's 500 most powerful
supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL COMPUTERS
</P>
<P>
   The new IBM supercomputer will be more powerful than the world's
next four fastest computers combined. The new computer and the four
fastest current machines are listed below with the performance

<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many reasons that explain Vicente Fox's decisive
victory in Sunday's elections in Mexico. His charismatic candidacy,
his obstinacy and vitality, his constant efforts to reach out both
to the left and to the PRI to build a broad coalition, all
contributed to the resounding triumph for his opposition party,
PAN.
</P>
<P>
   But the main explanation must be found in the Mexican
electorate's overwhelming desire for change, after many decades of
virtual one-party rule and 20 years of economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   Fox transformed the election from a beauty contest into a
referendum on change, challenging Mexicans to vote yes or no, for
or against perpetuating the PRI in power. The people, massively,
said no. Despite the machinery's last-ditch and distasteful _ to
put it mildly _ attempt to recast the vote as a plebiscite on Fox's
character, the voters were not gullible. They stuck to the basics,
and voted the world's oldest standing one-party system out of
office.
</P>
<P>
   This referendum, if successful, would not only lead to victory,
but also to a broad mandate for that change. According to an exit
poll conducted by the Los Angeles Times-Reforma, a Mexico City
daily newspaper, more than two-thirds of those who voted for Fox
did so because they identified him as an agent of change. A similar
percentage of those who cast their ballot for the PRD's Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas did so for similar reasons. And even a significant chunk
of Francisco Labastida's electorate sought change in the elections,
leading the PRI candidate to make ``change'' and a ``New PRI'' the
slogan of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexicans are not totally unhappy with the present state of
affairs _ President Ernesto Zedillo's popularity is quite high,
actually _ they clearly want change with a vengeance. Vicente Fox
will be able to count on a broad consensus within Mexican society
regarding the need to move beyond the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Herein, of course, lies also the main challenge facing Fox, not
only over the next five months, but above all after his Dec. 1
inauguration. He has tried, mostly, but not always with success, to
give change meaning and precision, particularly in regard to
economic and social policy, re-establishing law and order and
security for people and property, institutional reform and
combating inequality and poverty, eradicating corruption and
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   He will now have to strike the perfect _ almost impossible _
balance between the specific, policy-based definition of change
that people desire and expect and the self-evident limits on change
that Mexico's domestic and external situations obviously impose.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization, economic constraints, a strong opposition, the
logical divisions existing within his coalition, the strains of an
excessively long transition period, are all factors that will
contribute to strong limitations on the scope of change, on the
actual possibilities of improving people's lives and reforming
institutions, and on settling scores with Mexico's past.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has already shown his uncommon negotiating skills in
building the left-right coalition that took him to power, but that
is almost child's play compared to the task ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its history, Mexico has at last fought
for, conquered and ultimately transferred power at the ballot box.
This is no minor feat for a country where coups, revolutions,
foreign interventions and interminable individual or party
dictatorships have been the norm since the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The mandate Vicente Fox has is enormous, but so are the
challenges facing him. He will undoubtedly be up to the task, and
so will Mexico.

   This simple meal of piquant chicken and potatoes with zucchini
is just what's needed on a summer evening when you don't want to
work too hard. And even though you have really cooked a meal you
have a lot of help from ingredients that aren't much of a bother:
roasted red peppers, olives and already cooked artichoke hearts.
The olives for this dish should be piquant rather than oil-cured.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a food processor even the potato dish does not
require much of an effort and the clean bright flavors of the
potatoes and zucchini with nothing more than salt and pepper is a
delightful change from what is usually done to gussy up zucchini.
When they are fresh, they are so sweet, and sauteing them adds a
lovely toasted flavor. And putting a brown crust on potatoes makes
them irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to tell you that potatoes roasted in the oven are
as addictive as french fries but no matter how many I make, there
are never any left. I have the unfortunate habit of snacking on
them after they come out of the oven.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to cook the chicken dish even more quickly you can
cut the chicken into one inch chunks before they are sauteed.
</P>

WINDOWS ME TAILOR-MADE FOR HOME USE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is nearly midnight, and I am painfully aware why I answer as
I do when asked the question: ``Do you want the beta version of
this program, or would you rather wait for the final product?''
Final product.
</P>
<P>
   The exception to that rule is currently on my computer monitor:
Windows Millennium Edition, shortened to ``Windows Me'' on the
splash screen that comes up each time the program starts. I have
the beta release of Windows Me.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Woe Is Me.
</P>
<P>
   Things will improve rapidly between this nearly finished version
and Sept. 14 when the product goes on the shelves. Truthfully,
there are not many hangups, and those are being rapidly tracked
down by beta testers and squished by programmers across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   This is beta version 3.94. Even though I should know better, I
have volunteered to take a look because it is the latest major
upgrade to the popular Windows operating system for home users from
Microsoft. When Windows 2000 was released in the past year, many
home users were wondering whether that system, designed mainly for
business, was for them. The answer was: ``It wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll be asking the same thing about Windows Me as the final
release date draws closer. This time the answer is: ``Microsoft has
designed WinMe with home users in mind. There are plenty of
improvements _ including faster boot-up and more stability. There
is a much-needed `System Restore' feature to revert the system to
where it was before it stopped working. Networking one home
computer with another has been made easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Installing WinMe took about half an hour of mainly sitting and
waiting for the CD to run its course _ or at least the second
install did. The first one failed to catch fire, but that was
probably because the ``C'' drive on the computer didn't have enough
real estate left undeveloped on which to build. WinMe recognized
that and suggested Drive E as its new home.
</P>
<P>
   But WinMe apparently didn't like Drive E, for it certainly
balked enough times before it was obvious that it wasn't going to
live there. Fortunately, I'd taken the program's suggestion to
create an uninstall disk before proceeding. When the install
failed, that disk came to the rescue and, after about five minutes
of thrashing around, WinMe was gone and Windows 98 had returned.
</P>
<P>
   Note to readers: Forewarned is forearmed.
</P>
<P>
   Before upgrading, clean up Drive C to free as much space as
possible. Run the defragment and scan disk programs. Back up the
drive, create the uninstall disk as directed, and then install
WinMe.
</P>
<P>
   Having done that, WinMe sniffed around Drive C and immediately
took a liking to the neighborhood. In the process, it managed to
find a CD-ROM drive, CD-rewriteable drive, Zip drive, modem card,
sound card, video card, printer, and assorted other items attached
to the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for the new splash screen _ a pure white
background replacing the blue-sky one of Windows 98 _ you might not
even notice WinMe was running on the surface. The desktop is still
the same and the icons for programs are there.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother, then? For one thing, the program cranks up a lot
faster than Windows 98. That in itself is no big deal, but it's
still the first thing most people may notice _ particularly if you
have a lot of things attached to the computer and it presently
takes its sweet time getting ready for work.
</P>
<P>
   Another big change is at the other end of things: the shut-down
options. WinMe has added a stand-by option for desktops that
basically put things in a sleep mode, thus allowing a quick
resumption of work instead of completely shutting down and starting
over. For longer durations, the computer can put itself into what's
termed ``hybernation'' where work in progress is saved to disk and
the system is reduced to its lowest power state.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus: Getting two computers connected _ even if only one
is running WinMe _ is much easier than it used to be. I had taken
out the network card before the second installation. Once WinMe was
in place and running, the network card went back in its slot. WinMe
found it on reboot, and a ``network wizard'' walked me through
setting it up for connection to the second computer. If the second
computer is running Windows 95 or 98, WinMe will instruct the user
to insert a blank floppy disk to transport a needed program over to
the other computer so the two can connect.
</P>
<P>
   WinMe's beta version occasionally locks up on start up, an odd
behavior that is usually corrected by rebooting and, I've found, is
completely avoided by disconnecting the computer from the network.
The beta testers with similar network set ups have no doubt found
and corrected it in newer beta revisions.
</P>
<P>
   WinMe's improved behavior over the past few weeks has allowed
exploration. The basics are still there (Windows Explorer, the
program for examining the contests of disk drives and folders, is
now found under the ``accessories'' group in the menu) and things
work pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   A Windows Movie Maker makes importing and editing video much
easier. It's a sophisticated program that simplifies creating video
to e-mail to friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   What Movie Maker does for videos Windows Me's Media Player does
for audio files. There's a feature that puts dancing circles and
bars on the screen that pulse in time to the music for those who
like eye candy. More useful, however, is the player's ability to
create and index high-quality audio files.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that all of these features can be found in
freeware, shareware or commercial offerings from other third-party
developers. Indeed, System Restore is a plain-vanilla offering of
GoBack, a program from Wild File that was reviewed here several
months back. (A spokeswoman for Wild File said System Restore lacks
many of the features that has drawn users to GoBack; the company
has come out with a version that can be used with Windows Me.) The
new Windows Me combines all the other useful programs under one
operating roof, makes improvements to them in some cases, and then
provides a standardization of user controls among the programs.
</P>
<P>
   The price hasn't been firmed up yet, but I've seen estimates
ranging from $60 to $90 for the new operating system. Based on
previous Windows upgrades, those are reasonable expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Is Windows Me in your future? If you're among the 15 million
households with two computers and want to connect them, or you've
installed a new scanner or piece of software only to find the
operating system will no longer work, there's a brighter future
coming in September.

 By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Anita Brown is having one of her moments. The
founder of a nonprofit group called Black Geeks Online is at
Harvard to participate in a panel discussion about the digital
divide, and there are a few things she would like to discuss. What
is wrong, she wants to know, with all those caffeinated kids who
work 24 hours a day without stopping to call their mamas or take a
look at the world? What good, she asks, is a computer if you're
poor and hungry and can't get a job?
</P>
<P>
   And another thing. What is all this gee-whiz technology doing to
the thing called humanity? ``They call this online connectivity or
community, but it's not,'' she says. ``Community is when you have a
crisis at home: Who do you call to take care of your babies while
you run down to the hospital at 3 o'clock in the morning? That's
community.''
</P>
<P>
   She interrupts her stream-of-consciousness monologue to seek a
light for a cigarette, and within minutes, she's deep in a
discussion with a woman who represents a health-oriented Web site.
The next thing you know, Brown has the woman's business card. The
contact may come in handy some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an Aquarius,'' she says. ``Humanity is my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is one of those individuals that author Malcolm Gladwell
describes as a ``connector,'' a walking, talking Rolodex of sorts
who makes it her business to bring other people together. And for
the past five years, she's been doing her matchmaking on the
Internet. Using the online monikers of Sistah Geek and Miss D.C.,
Brown runs Black Geeks Online from her home in Washington. Founded
on a whim in 1996, the loose-knit organization has grown from 18
members to 25,000  &UR; today &LR; , and Brown has established herself as an
unofficial Internet griot who sends out missives to members all
over the world, from the South Bronx to South Africa. The
organization is a sort of digital grapevine for people of color
online, and Brown has made it her mission to encourage black
information technology professionals to volunteer in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a genius for knowing all the right people,'' says Adam
Fisher, senior associate editor of Wired magazine. ``She makes
things happen.'' Brown has adopted Fisher as her ``new best
friend;'' she feeds him tips about black high-tech entrepreneurs
who should be featured in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old grandmother, however, is the first to admit that
she is an unlikely role model for budding geeks. A sixth-generation
Washingtonian, she dropped out of college after six months _ ``I
didn't like it. They told you to read the book and spit it out'' _
and spent several decades working as a secretary in the civil
service. Back in her day, the transistor radio was considered
high-tech. But her brother, a retired computer engineer, introduced
her to the Internet in 1994. She resisted at first _ ``I said, `Oh
no you don't. Big Brother will not get me!' '' _ but when she
discovered that she could exchange recipes with a chef in New
Orleans, she was hooked. ``I'm a communicator, an information
broker, and I saw the potential,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Since she founded Black Geeks in her living room four years ago,
she has organized an information technology workshop called
``Taking IT to the Streets,'' which introduced 200 newbies to
computers and the Internet. Earlier this year, she was tapped as
one of the Top 25 Women on the Web by SFWoW, a San Francisco-based
association of professional women involved in the Internet. Brown,
who is known for wearing red high tops and a Tweety Bird watch,
shared the honors with top CEOs and computer scientists. ``She
isn't your typical CEO, but she has made a difference by helping
other women get over their fear of the Internet,'' says Mary Choy,
who ran the committee that selected this year's winners. ``When she
accepted her award, she said, `They told me not to wear sneakers
and not to curse onstage, but here I am, wearing sneakers and
cursing onstage.' She fit in beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown chooses not to wear those red high tops for her appearance
at Harvard, though. ``A girl has to look her best,'' she says with
a coy smile. But she is going to speak her mind. She is frequently
asked to speak about the digital divide, the gap between the
technology haves and have-nots. The digital divide is usually
described as a gap between blacks and whites, but Brown isn't
convinced that the problem can easily be solved by throwing money
and computers at poor communities. ``My main concern, from (Vice
President Al) Gore to (Microsoft chairman Bill) Gates, is that all
this equipment and money is being handed out in a vacuum,'' she
says. ``They're putting computers in the schools without talking to
the parents or the community. None of this money is going to train
people. They're just creating new consumers, and the last thing
poor people need to do is to find a new electronic mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, like many other former Internet enthusiasts, no longer
thinks that computers in and of themselves can provide the answer
to society's ills. ``I'm a techno realist,'' she says. ``It's time
to stop and say, `Wait a minute.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And she is willing to stir up debate wherever she goes. At the
Harvard conference, which was called Internet and Society 2000, she
objects when a moderator wants to discuss the digital divide in the
Third World. ``I don't see how we can fix someone else's barn when
ours is falling to the ground,'' she says. When she goes through
her spiel about the Internet dehumanizing society, including the
bit about the coffee, the crowd applauds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anita is a '60s revolutionary who uses the Internet as a new
tool to kind of continue the philosophy and ideology of changing
things and not accepting the status quo,'' says Kenny Granderson, a
fellow panelist and the founder of Inner City Software in
Dorchester. Granderson is a kindred spirit. He founded Boston
Blacks Online, a group of 650 members who communicate on the
Internet. ``We both deal with people on a grassroots level, dealing
with the regular Joes and Janes,'' Granderson says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after a few days in Cambridge, Brown connects with many
Joes and Janes and counts a number of ``new best friends.'' After
her appearance on the panel, she launches an animated conversation
with Jose Orlando Lopez, vice-president for academic affairs and
innovations at the American University of Puerto Rico. She takes
his card, one more for her Rolodex. You never know when Sistah Geek
might need a best friend in Puerto Rico.

NEW PLAYER ADDS TO CHIP SLOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's no such thing as a computer that's too fast.
Everybody knows that.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite everybody. Indeed, the world's top chip makers
are busily inventing clever new ways to make their processors run
slower. Strolling the corridors of this year's PC Expo trade show,
I encountered several examples of their recent handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   These slower chips are made for portable computers, the kind
powered by hefty slabs of lithium that generally provide only two
to three hours of useful life. That's because it takes so much
energy to drive the colorful flat-panel display screens and the
multigigabyte hard drives, and the DVD drives for watching The
Matrix on that coast-to-coast flight. They all eat electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the worst gluttons is the processor itself. Today's
high frequency processors want lots of juice.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it is wasted as raw heat. Desktop computers use fans and
metal heatsinks to disperse the heat; use a laptop and your thighs
become the heatsink. Even the lower-powered laptop processors made
by Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. don't completely
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But they're trying harder, with new chip designs that dial back
on the processor's power consumption whenever possible. When you're
playing a game or a video, the chip goes to full power; punch up a
boring text document, and it drops back into cruising speed.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a new idea, but it's taken on new urgency for AMD and
Intel, thanks to the most heavily-touted chip start-up in years,
Transmeta. That's the Silicon Valley company that got international
headlines by hiring the world's most famous programmer, Linux
creator Linus Torvalds.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta wasn't working on Linux software, though. It was
designing a new chip called Crusoe that's designed to run
Intel-compatible software while using just a fraction of the power
consumed by Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
   The first Crusoe-based computers are on display here, and at
first glance, Intel and AMD have reason to be concerned. The
prototype machines, from IBM Corp. and NEC Corp., are ultralight
laptops that seemed to offer solid performance during my brief
tinkering session.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta folk proudly pointed to an on-screen gauge that shows
the processor leaping to its full speed of 533 megahertz when I
started up a video player, then dropping down to 333 megahertz once
the video is running. The result, they say, is a minilaptop that'll
run for eight to 10 hours before it needs a recharge.
</P>
<P>
   AMD has responded to the challenge with a system that does
pretty much the same thing. Its mobile PowerNow chips constantly
speed up and slow down depending on the user's actions. AMD says
PowerNow will make the battery in a full-sized laptop last about an
hour longer.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Intel is offering a system called SpeedStep that
automatically slows down its mobile Pentium III chips when a laptop
is running on battery power. There's also QuickStart, a feature
that makes the chip run flat-out when the user is doing something _
typing, for instance. But the chip drops instantly into a
power-thrifty ``idle'' mode when you pause for a second or two.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta chief executive David Ditzel says he doesn't much mind
that rival companies are copying his company's slowdown strategy.
``Even at peak performance, we still dissipate a lot less power,''
Ditzel declares.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of another Transmeta design trick. Instead of
building Intel-compatibility commands into the chip, Crusoe stores
them in software, and runs them only when needed. That means Crusoe
chips need fewer transistors, and thus less power. They're also
smaller than a Pentium or AMD K6, and they run a lot cooler. The
base of the Crusoe laptop I tested was barely above room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   We'll find out later this year whether consumers will embrace
Crusoe-based machines. But the company has already inspired a
rethinking of the megahertz megalomania that's driven the industry
for so many years. Of course, it would have happened anyway; as
millions of us buy palm computers and Internet cell phones, battery
endurance starts to matter more than raw horsepower. That's why so
many chips now feature power brakes as standard equipment.

CONDUCTING SOME PANDA DIPLOMACY ON THE WEB; A BREAK IN MOORE'S
LAW,  BUT, HEY, WHO'S COUNTING?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  Those who contend anything can be
found on the Web may be right. A Maryland couple just found a giant
panda for themselves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce and Iresha Fletcher of Chevy Chase were the winning
bidders in an online auction to ``adopt'' Mei Shiang, a 2-year-old
giant panda that lives in the Wolong Nature Reserve in China. For
their $6,100, the couple will receive a year's worth of e-mail and
videos on their ward's progress. The money goes to the Wolong Panda
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Why adopt a panda? ``The U.S. and China are the two powers in
the world, and hopefully a program like this can help relations,''
Fletcher explained last week.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's hope is certainly shared by Twinbays International,
which sponsored the auction. Twinbays was formed in April 1999 to
sell Chinese goods to Americans but now hooks up U.S. manufacturers
with Chinese suppliers. Last Thursday, Twinbays held a reception in
Washington for Chinese officials and Virginia venture capitalists
to honor the Fletchers and to introduce itself in its new guise.
</P>
<P>
   Although Twinbays has headquarters in Reston, Va., the company
employs only 20 people there; it has 40 people in China. ``It's
necessary that we show our respect for the Chinese environment,''
Martin David, president of Twinbays, said of the panda promotion.
``The auction cost us a small fortune, but it's cheaper than buying
full-page ads.''
</P>

<P>
   A BREAK IN MOORE'S LAW, BUT, HEY, WHO'S COUNTING?
</P>
<P>
   Ever-faster computers are just in the nature of things. Behind
the blase optimism is Moore's Law _ named after Gordon Moore, the
co-founder of Intel, who observed that the number of transistors
chip makers could fit on a given piece of silicon doubled every 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet recently, computer scientists have begun to fret that the
end of Moore's Law _ and, with it, the march of computing progress
_ is in sight as the physical limits of minute circuitry loom.
</P>
<P>
   So the IBM announcement last week that it had built the fastest
supercomputer becomes of interest to more than the computing
equivalent of drag-racing fans. The $110 million machine, built to
simulate the testing of nuclear weapons, is three times as powerful
than the previous record holder. And the earlier front-runner, also
from IBM, was finished 21 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there is a break with Moore's Law, at least in this
rarefied realm.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation for the jump lies largely in the rapid progress
IBM has been able to achieve in materials science and systems
design. For example, using copper instead of traditional aluminum
wires in chips allows for higher circuit speeds with lower power
consumption. Another lift comes from the programming wizardry that
enables the supercomputer, which sprawls over an area the size of
two basketball courts, to orchestrate the data-chugging power of
more than 8,100 microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent conference called Beyond Silicon, sponsored by MIT's
Technology Review magazine, Nicholas Donofrio, senior vice
president for technology at IBM, said he believed that recent
advances made the limits of Moore's Law less worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   With the new supercomputer, he said last week, ``We're not
relying solely on lithography on silicon _ the stuff of Moore's Law
_ to scale up computing power.''
</P>
<P>
   And to be honest, the achievements of the IBM supercomputer,
known as ASCI White, are impressive even to nonpropeller heads. It
would take a person with a calculator 10 million years to do the
number of calculations that the new supercomputer can do in one
second. A silly comparison in some ways, but one powerful dragster.

MICROSOFT TO REWARD ITS BEST AND BRIGHTEST ENGINEERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   In an effort to
reward its brightest technologists, Microsoft plans to announce
Monday that it has created a Distinguished Engineer program,
initially honoring 16 of the company's best designers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Similar programs are already in place at Cisco Systems, IBM, Sun
Microsystems and Xerox as a way to reward engineers and scientists
who might otherwise leave research and development jobs for
management positions with greater financial rewards.
</P>
<P>
   In an electronic mail message sent to Microsoft employees on
Friday, the Microsoft chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, wrote,
``These appointments underscore Microsoft's commitment to our
technical people as key partners in the leadership of the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   The position entitles the Microsoft researchers to a financial
reward package that is similar to that received by the company's
vice presidents, said Deborah Willingham, the company's vice
president for human resources. ``We were trying to be sure that
great technical people know that they have the opportunity to
achieve the recognition that vice presidents receive inside the
company,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company will add approximately four or five employees to the
list each year, she added.
</P>
<P>
   For Charles Thacker, a former Xerox and Digital Equipment
engineer who joined Microsoft three years ago and is now involved
in the company's effort to develop a tablet-like computer, the
program will have little effect on his day-to-day work activities.
</P>
<P>
   He said the program will principally be of value because it will
chart a path for technical employees at the company, which now has
a work force of more than 38,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It demonstrates to the technical people that you can stay on
the technical ladder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Thacker, who is the co-inventor of the Ethernet
office networking technology, those to be named Distinguished
Engineers include Butler Lampson, Charles Simonyi, Jim Gray and
David Cutler. All are well-known scientists and engineers who have
helped the company pursue advanced computer technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler, for example, came from Digital Equipment to lead a team
at Microsoft that developed the Windows NT operating system,
beginning in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The others who received appointments as Distinguished Engineers
are Mark Lucovsky, Wael Bahaa-El-Din, Anders Hejlsberg, Antoine
Leblond, Suryanarayanan Raman, Darryl Rubin, Brad Lovering, Lou
Perazzoli, Michael Toutonghi, Peter Spiro and Mohsen Al-Ghosein.

E-COMMERCE: PRINCIPLES OF CONSUMER PRIVACY ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   When the online
privacy debate reached its peak earlier this year, the watchwords
were ``notice'' and ``choice.'' Consumer groups demanded that
online advertising companies like DoubleClick give consumers more
notice when tracking their behavior, and give them the choice to
avoid such tracking.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But there are two other core privacy principles: giving
consumers ``access'' to data collected on them and providing them
with the ``security'' that the data is kept private.
</P>
<P>
   The first two terms continue to be volleyed back-and-forth by
legislators scoring points in this year's campaign, but the latter
two have received scant air time.
</P>
<P>
   That may change, as companies have begun heeding the call of
privacy advocates to increase access to profiling data.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is, the techniques of the companies that offer
solutions on data access may actually run afoul of some privacy
groups. The resulting conflict could shift the debate to a new
front and make strange bedfellows of privacy advocates and the
advertising networks and other companies that have until now been
their prime targets.
</P>
<P>
   Access has been a sleeper issue primarily because it is so
complex. It seems obvious that consumers should be able to check
the files that others keep on them and to change anything that is
wrong. But articulating the boundaries of such a policy is no easy
task.
</P>
<P>
   Should businesses give consumers access to transactions made
years ago, data that the company has on a computer tape sitting in
the back of a storage closet? Should they be forced to spend
millions of dollars updating their computer systems so consumers
can see and change that information? And what right do consumers
have to data that is collected not about them, per se, but on the
computers they share with others at work or at home?
</P>
<P>
   These questions have led advertising networks like DoubleClick
and Engage, among others, which gather information on users
anonymously, to hold off on giving users access to data.
</P>
<P>
   Still, recent steps within the industry suggest that some
companies are heeding the call for access.
</P>
<P>
   One such company is BeFree, which, among other things,
distributes software that helps online businesses tailor their
content to the user's interest. This so-called personalization
software has become increasingly common among e-commerce companies
this year, as they vie to improve their profit margins by showing
customers merchandise they are more likely to buy.
</P>
<P>
   This software also raises privacy issues, as it relies on
tracking a user's behavior on a site, or a group of sites, to
determine a consumer's buying preferences. As with other companies
that track user activities, BeFree inserts a ``cookie,'' or a
number within a small text file, on the user's hard drive, to track
activity.
</P>
<P>
   BeFree says it requires the sites that use the software to
inform customers how it works, and give them a way to opt out of
the tracking. The company also goes one step further, by giving
users access to the information gathered on them.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on SuperGo.com, a bicycle store, users can click
on a link within the site's privacy statement and go to another
site set up by BeFree, which then discloses information compiled
about the user's behavior on SuperGo. Later this year, when BeFree
tracks user activity across multiple sites, it will disclose the
user's information from all the sites on one page.
</P>
<P>
   To authenticate the identity of the user who asks for his online
dossier, BeFree checks the user's cookie number, then retrieves
only the browsing and purchasing information associated with that
cookie.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, BeFree does not have full control over how that
information is displayed. At the moment, for example, SuperGo
customers can view only the stock numbers of the products they
looked at or purchased. Steven Laff, who designed the SuperGo site,
said the company would translate those numbers to text soon.
</P>
<P>
   Laff said that giving consumers access to data gathered on them
was a common sense approach. ``It's a nice, respectful thing to
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of other companies facing the same access questions
said the BeFree approach was flawed. Daniel J. Jaye, co-founder of
Engage, an online advertising company that tracks consumers
anonymously, said BeFree ``may be well-intentioned, but it could
lead to a security breach.'' Jaye said the technique jeopardized
users' privacy, because it could disclose their information to
someone else who uses the same computer.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a person visited the SuperGo site while at work,
an employer or a co-worker could sit at the same computer and see
that a person used it to shop for bikes, or easily view that
person's BeFree profile.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Shen, policy analyst for the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, and a critic of companies like Engage that
track online users, said: ``I actually agree with Dan on this one.
You don't want that information to end up in the wrong hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Gerace, BeFree's co-founder, said he considered that
argument when developing the software, but added that when two or
more people used the same computer, Web browser software allowed
users to control their information by erasing cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The user just has to be conscious about how they're using the
machine,'' Gerace said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the access issue is less problematic when companies
gather information, usually offline, that includes a person's
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike companies that only track users online anonymously _ and
therefore have no way to ensure that they are disclosing profile
information to the right person _ companies that track personally
identifiable information have alternatives. Because these
businesses usually have an address to go along with a name, they
can simply send a letter with the information requested, or send a
log-in and password so the consumer can view the information
online.
</P>
<P>
   Axciom Corp., which sells information on tens of millions of
U.S. households, allows users to get access to their information by
sending a letter and $5 to the company. More important, Axciom
released technology last year that allows companies with vast
amounts of consumer data to sift through it quickly and present it
for review or editing by consumers or a sales staff.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, dubbed AbiliTec, solves one aspect of the access
issue for companies that collect data on consumers from several
sources _ for instance, through mail order operations, retail
stores or the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Such companies often contend that it would be too burdensome to
offer consumers access to personal data, because it would be
technologically impossible to compile that data in one place
quickly and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   AbiliTec and competing products may make it easier for companies
to do that, but such technology is not inexpensive. One Axciom
executive said it could cost a large retailer that sells through a
traditional store, a catalog and the Web more than a million
dollars to implement.
</P>
<P>
   Other solutions to the access problem are coming to market, as
well. ECustomers.com, for instance, has developed technology that
will soon allow e-tailers to use data about a person's offline
shopping habits to tailor their display of merchandise for
consumers who sign up for the ECustomers service. Like BeFree,
ECustomers plans to allow consumers to have access to the data it
compiles on them, by mailing a log-in number and password. If the
consumer's address matches the one ECustomers has on file, the
consumer's identity is all but assured.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for companies that continue to collect data
anonymously to preserve users' privacy _ but that do not want to
follow BeFree's example _ there are few, if any, technological
solutions to the access problem. ``We very much support the notion
of access,'' said Jaye of Engage, which places ads on Web sites
based on a user's online activity. ``But we can't do it securely.
It's kind of a devil-if-you-do, devil-if-you-don't situation.''

RESIGNATION OF ORACLE'S PRESIDENT UNRELATED TO SPYING, ELLISON 
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   SAN FRANCISCO _
Who's minding the store at Oracle Corp.?
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, there was last week's clamorous disclosure that the
software giant had paid a private investigation service to gather
information about Microsoft Corp. allies. Then on Friday came the
abrupt resignation of the company's president, Raymond Lane _ a
move the company said was unrelated to the investigation
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the day-to-day operation of Oracle is now in the
hands of a troika of executives who report directly to Larry
Ellison, the company's flamboyant and mercurial founder and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview over the weekend, Ellison cited three executives
as key members of his executive team: Gary Bloom, 38, Oracle's top
marketer and executive vice president; Jeffrey Henley, 54, the
chief financial officer; and Safra Catz, 38, Oracle's
highest-ranking woman and a former investment banker who is now an
executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Henley and Bloom have both been with the company for a decade,
and Bloom in recent months had been assuming more and more of the
departing president's duties. Catz was at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette before joining Oracle last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said that Lane would not be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Although acknowledging that the timing of the announcement was
not ideal, Ellison said that the resignation of Lane, 53, a former
Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton executive who was widely credited for having
helped rebuild Oracle during the last eight years, had nothing to
do with the Microsoft controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a good time for this transition,'' Ellison said
in a telephone interview. ``We have been planning Ray's departure
for several weeks, it was related the end of our fiscal year.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the appearances of upheaval, Oracle, of Redwood City,
Calif., the largest database software company, is on a roll, having
capitalized on the Internet commerce boom the last two years. On
June 20, the company announced strong earnings gains in its fourth
fiscal quarter. Excluding investment gains, Oracle reported
earnings of $926 million, up 76 percent from similarly adjusted
income of $527 million in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose
17 percent, to $3.37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good time for Oracle to have this happen,'' Roger
McNamee, a director of Integral Capital Partners in Menlo Park,
Calif., said of Lane's resignation. ``Larry Ellison has surrounded
himself with a great team and a deep team.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Lane's resignation nonetheless raised eyebrows.
The company chose to issue a news release announcing Lane's
departure at 6 p.m. Pacific time on Friday at the start of the long
Fourth of July weekend. The news release offered no reason for his
resignation, and Lane could not be reached for comment over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But David Roux, Oracle's former executive vice president for
corporate development, who is now a general partner at Silver Lake
Partners, an investment firm in Menlo Park, said it was unlikely
that Lane's departure indicated any split or dispute with Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oracle is very much Larry's company,'' he said. ``One of the
reasons that Ray was so effective and well-liked was that he was
never confused about the core fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said that Lane had been on vacation last week when the
company made the surprise disclosure that it had paid for a a
covert investigation of several Microsoft lobbying groups. He said
he and Lane had not talked about his decision to publicly defend
the spying effort on Wednesday, at a news conference where Ellison
told reporters he thought that his company was not arrogant, rather
had performed a ``public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said that he did not know Lane's future plans, but added
that Lane had a new family, with one young child and a second on
the way. He said Lane, who will remain on Oracle's board, had made
more than $2 billion in the increased value of Oracle stock since
joining the company in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison also noted that most of Lane's responsibilities at
Oracle had already been shifted to Bloom, the executive vice
president who also has responsibility for product development.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bloom said in a telephone interview on Saturday:
``My own role has evolved over time and I'm quite comfortable with
it. There are a number of organizations that have been shifted from
Ray's to my responsibility, including the partners program, the
education business which is a $500 million business, as well as
worldwide support and worldwide marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Bloom who took responsibility for introducing a new
version of the company's Internet Application Server 8i, which came
out on Wednesday. The software, crucial to the e-commerce
operations of many businesses, has become one of Oracle's most
important products.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside Bloom and Henley, Ellison said that Catz, who had been
a managing director at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, was playing an
important role at Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Catz had helped build Softbank Corp., the Japanese
company founded by Masayoshi Son, but had joined Oracle because she
was tired of the extensive travel required by her work as a banker.

ONLINE GROCERY SHOPPING STILL FACES LOGISTICAL HURDLES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  Last week, two
big names in the online grocery business announced they were
merging, with Webvan agreeing to pay $1.2 billion for
HomeGrocer.com. Online grocers seem to be coming quickly to the
realization that there is strength through scale, but significant
kinks in the business continue to present big challenges to its
long-term viability.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Online grocery shopping beckons like an electronic Statue of
Liberty to the tired, the time-pressed and the hunkered masses who
consider going to the grocery an odious task. Why drive all the way
to the supermarket to tangle with a shopping cart, and risk getting
the one with the sticky wheel, when you can sit quietly at your
computer and click through your choices at your convenience?
</P>
<P>
   The converted sing the praises of online grocery shopping,
calling it convenient, reliable and, yes, no more expensive than
conventional supermarket shopping. ``It probably ends up being more
cost-effective, because you don't pick up the things you don't
need,'' said Robin Bonenfant of Norwalk, Conn., who recently began
using Peapod, the Chicago online grocery pioneer that will have its
10th birthday on Wednesday. ``They take coupons as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Armando Quintero, a father of two who stays home with his
children in San Rafael, Calif., said ordering from Webvan had
simplified his life in some ways. ``They can deliver very early in
the morning, so if we need lunch items for our kids, we could get
them delivered before school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he said, he and his wife, who is at work at an office
all day, ``interact online'' _ going over their electronic shopping
list and adding or deleting items from their separate computers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fans, only about 2.8 percent of Americans buy their
groceries online, according to estimates by Evie Black Dykema, a
senior analyst with Forrester Research. Among the drawbacks people
typically cite are having to plan and having to think about the
delivery schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be organized and thinking ahead,'' said Tracy
Petrak, a legal secretary from San Rafael who orders occasionally
from Webvan. At one point, she was surprised to receive a large
postcard from the company, observing that she had not ordered in a
while and asking, ``What did we do wrong?'' Webvan also sent her a
$25 coupon to use on her next order, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people just do not want to give up the social opportunities
or the nostalgia they associate with grocery shopping. It ties in
with memories of their parents, sometimes, or contributes to a
sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel guilt about shopping online,'' Dykema said.
``Anecdotally, there is this feeling that it's a little artificial
to have their groceries sent to them. It's similar to when Procter
&AMP; Gamble introduced cake mixes, and they found that women wanted to
add their own egg. That way, it was their own cake.''
</P>
<P>
   To get people to buy groceries online, companies are using a
variety of models. Peapod, which appeared on the edge of extinction
just three months ago when its chief executive quit suddenly and a
financing deal fell apart, has now aligned itself with a
traditional supermarket giant, Royal Ahold. In Fairfield County,
Conn., where Bonenfant points and clicks, Peapod used Ahold's Stop
&AMP; Shop stores to fill produce orders, while turning to a Peapod
warehouse for other items.
</P>
<P>
   So thorough is the alignment that Royal Ahold owns 51 percent of
Peapod, and a former Ahold executive, Marc van Gelder, is running
Peapod. Van Gelder seems convinced that Peapod's new model will
work. ``This is a leverage of the Stop &AMP; Shop chain, which stands
for good value and good quality,'' he said. ``And we are also
leveraging, from a procurement perspective, all the advantages you
get from being linked to a $26 billion company. It is a great
competitive weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop &AMP; Shop stores are also being used to promote Peapod, and
the two companies are running joint advertisements. ``We do
advertising in local newspapers as well as public relations and
door hangings,'' van Gelder said. ``What we want to get to is to
really personalize e-mail for customers. We will be able to
communicate with our customers on a personalized basis.''
</P>
<P>
   By hooking electronic shopping so thoroughly to an old-style
chain, Peapod is following the example of many European online
grocers, which in many cases were started by the traditional
retailers. J. Sainsbury and Tesco in Britain and Carrefour and
Promodes in France, some of the biggest chains in Europe, all have
online services they promote through their stores, said Jacob
Jensen, a consultant with Roland Berger Associates, a
consumer-products consulting firm in New York, who has studied
e-grocers in Europe and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But does the model really work? Online grocery companies are
typically plagued by two issues: making sure their orders are
packed and delivered properly and keeping their costs down _
something that is particularly difficult when a fleet of trucks or
vans is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen said creating a large warehouse, along the lines of
Amazon.com, was the only way to meet the first goal effectively.
The cost issue is best addressed, he said, by keeping geographic
markets closely circumscribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a cost perspective and from a fulfillment basis, the
dedicated warehouse is the best model,'' he said. ``What really
upsets the consumers is if you don't deliver the products they
ordered, or if you don't hit the window you promised for delivery.
And in terms of managing delivery costs, it means the route density
has to be mapped out ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   One French online grocer, Tele-Market, has tried to solve the
distribution issue by subcontracting its delivery service. ``They
have independent couriers driving around with their products, and
they take other companies' products along as well,'' Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the more deliveries in a given area, the lower the
costs overall. But except for a few cities, Americans who can
afford computers and Internet access are more likely to live in
suburbs, if not exurbs, which means more driving for any company
that offers delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to building critical mass for online shopping,
timing may turn out to be everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next wave is when these 18- to 20-year-olds start
replenishing their own households,'' Dykema said, noting how that
age group already goes online to do much of its shopping, from cars
to electronics to groceries. ``They can't imagine why consumers
wouldn't look online first for products. They don't suffer from any
of these hang-ups.''

DIGITAL ECONOMY'S DEMAND FOR STEADY POWER STRAINS UTILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphics clients.

or 888-346-9867.) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Read-Rite, an
electronic components maker in Milpitas, Calif., has been in no
position to complain whenever fluctuations in electrical service
shut down a vital computer-controlled milling machine. After all,
the local utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, has lived up to its
contractual obligation to keep the power flowing and to prevent
voltage surges or dips of 10 percent or more.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the milling machine, which helps Read-Rite make
the tiny devices that read and write information on computer disk
drives, crashes if voltages vary as little as 5 percent. And such
flutters have occasionally occurred the last two years as Pacific
Gas, a unit of PG&AMP;E Corp., has performed its daily juggling act of
matching power demand and supply in the region. So far, Read-Rite's
solution has been to monitor the incoming power closely and adjust
settings on the milling equipment manually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to watch it closely because we can lose materials
worth thousands of dollars,'' said Shahzad Mahmud, director of
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Read-Rite's milling machine is indicative of a long-running, but
accelerating, problem: The nation's electrical power supply system
is not up to the task of meeting the digital economy's needs. While
the utility industry has historically prided itself on delivering
fairly stable power 99.9 percent of the time, today's computerized
economy is demanding even fewer interruptions and a much steadier
current.
</P>
<P>
   That is because electricity is more than just energy for
computers _ it is the medium they use to do their job. Rapid,
minute changes in voltage represent the ones and zeros that make up
digital information.
</P>
<P>
   Those patterns are ultimately translated into a human voice
during a phone call, a calculation during a banking transaction, a
dose of radiation during cancer therapy or a photo of a new baby
e-mailed to scattered relatives. Any disruption in the power supply
that compromises the processor's ability to manage those voltages
can lead to lost data or system crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Power disturbances around the world cause more than 17,000
computer disruptions every second, from annoying frozen cursors to
serious destruction of equipment, according to the latest
calculations of American Power Conversion of West Kingston, R.I.,
which began building backup power systems for computer users in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have worked well for an economy that ran on motors and
lights,'' said Peter Gross, a leading designer of giant
telecommunications hubs, data centers and other buildings that
operate around the clock. ``There's a major disconnect with what's
happening in the digital world.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also an explosion of interest in technologies and
services that address the new economy's power needs. And the
remedies go well beyond the surge suppressors that most home PC
users employ to protect their computers during lightning or voltage
spikes. The solutions aimed at businesses include backup generators
manufactured by companies like Caterpillar and smaller power
supplies from American Power Conversion and the Liebert unit of
Emerson Electric. There are innovative fuel cells from start-ups
like FuelCell Energy; new flywheels from Active Power and Beacon
Power and a variety of battery improvements. Companies like
International Rectifier and Ixys are finding strong demand for new
microchips that manage power equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The computer-driven economy's push to transform the electricity
business adds up to a $500 billion opportunity for the companies
selling into it, according to Mark P. Mills, a Washington-based
consultant who, along with Peter Huber, a senior fellow at the
Manhattan Institute, coined the term ``powercosm'' to describe the
evolving market. The two men jointly publish The Digital Power
Report for the Gilder Group.
</P>
<P>
   The message certainly is resonating on Wall Street.
International Rectifier has soared from less than $12 last summer
to more than $55. Ixys, a smaller competitor that was hovering
around $3 in November, reached $69 last Tuesday. Start-ups like H
Power, a fuel-cell maker, and Active Power are on the runway for
public offerings this summer, hoping to find the same kind of
welcome as Capstone Turbine, which went public on Thursday at $16 a
share and ended the week at $45.0625. Meanwhile, giants like
General Electric and the deregulated arms of numerous utilities
have been pouring venture capital into the field.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the digital economy is causing electrical
headaches in two ways. The most straightforward is that it drives
up demand for electricity in regions like the Northeast where
capacity is already strained in the peak summer months. Last week,
on Manhattan's Upper East Side, for example, Consolidated Edison
shut off service to eight apartment buildings and lowered its
voltage in the neighborhood for several hours on a hot, muggy day.
</P>
<P>
   The rising demand involves much more than air-conditioning, of
course. Consider the transformation of a 16-story building in
downtown Newark, N.J., which formerly housed a Macy's department
store and consumed roughly 10 watts of power a square foot before
the store was shut down in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the upper floors have been reopened as a
``telecommunications hotel'' where companies like WorldCom, IDT,
Qwest and Level 3 Communications park rows of data servers, routers
and other electronic equipment, as well as cooling systems, backup
power and other devices. According to Public Service Electric and
Gas, the local utility, such users require 40 to 50 watts a square
foot.
</P>
<P>
   One developer looking at another site in North Jersey for the
home of a potential million-square-foot data and communications
center asked Public Service for 100 megawatts of power, according
to Patrick Downs, the utility's vice president for operations
support. ``That's one-third of what we give the whole city of
Newark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the most extravagant estimates of the new economy's
impact on sheer demand put the level at less than 10 percent of the
total capacity of traditional utilities. To energy managers,
engineers like Gross and, more recently, Wall Street, the volume of
demand for power is less noteworthy than the higher quality of
electricity that digital users are insisting upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three nines is great for the grid,'' Mills said, referring to
99.9 percent reliability, or roughly eight hours of power losses a
year. Indeed, it is hard to imagine this figure becoming much
better, given the vulnerability of power supply grids to bad
weather, animals shorting out transformers and other equipment, and
drunken drivers hitting utility poles.
</P>
<P>
   But even ``three nines,'' Mills said, is ``trash for a
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills' prescription for microprocessor-friendly power quality is
10 nines, or 99.99999999 percent reliability _ a mere 32 seconds of
power loss a year _ plus equipment to protect against those gaps
and the sags, spikes and surges in between.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So great is the cost of computer disruptions to the economy that
the sale of services or equipment to prevent such problems is
starting to be seen as a can't-miss proposition for those with the
right technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Model T was introduced, people didn't worry about the
grade of gasoline,'' said Larry R. Wilson, director of strategic
planning for the electric power unit of Caterpillar. The invention
of high-performance cars changed that, Wilson said, and now the
same thing is happening on a much broader scale with electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where people have a power quality need, price is not an
issue,'' Wilson said. He predicts strong growth for Caterpillar's
generator sales to a ``premium'' market of users for whom price is
no object when it comes to reliable backup energy. Such users are
willing to pay the equivalent of $20 a kilowatt for backup
supplies, compared with about 7 cents a kilowatt, on average, for
electricity drawn directly from the utility grid.
</P>
<P>
   Although it varies by state around the nation, utility
regulators generally define a momentary power loss as one lasting
one to five minutes. Such interruptions can cause havoc in
stock-trading systems, automated paper mills and other
computer-driven processes unless there are backup power generators
and equipment to switch to them seamlessly.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, trouble does not wait for an outright power
loss. A voltage dip of just 10 percent, with no interruption, can
cause problems for some systems in a sixth of a second, according
to Marek Samotyj, who manages power quality programs for the
Electric Power Research Institute, a Palo Alto, Calif., research
group owned by utility companies. And some sensors in medical
equipment fail if current is cut off completely for as little as
four milliseconds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the crowd of suppliers that offer remedies swells, the
question of who will pay for better power is very much unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, American Electric Power, a large utility based in
Columbus, Ohio, and the equipment maker Siemens Power Transmission
and Distribution began studying what combination of monitoring
equipment and system improvements would be required to supply
premium-quality power to an industrial park in Delaware, Ohio.
American Electric's goals included learning whether premium power
could command premium prices, according to Harry Vollkommer, one of
the project managers for the utility.
</P>
<P>
   But James Osteen, senior industrial engineer at Nippert Co., a
wire manufacturer that is one of the major utility customers in the
park, does not see a more stable power supply as a premium product.
He said all companies were expected to improve quality continually
these days, and the utility should be no exception. ``Our
expectation is that we won't pay more for premium power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar attitude prevails in Detroit. In order to keep
business from the Big Three auto companies, Detroit Edison is
currently supplying power under a contract that penalizes it if it
fails to steadily reduce the number of power losses and
fluctuations. The number of power losses at General Motors has been
reduced by two-thirds since the contract began in 1995, and Detroit
Edison has improved enough to avoid any penalties so far for power
sags, according to John C. Anderson, director of energy services
for GM.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the new economy's power needs, however, is not simply
a matter of improving the utility grid. Studies show that 70
percent of disruptions originate from electrical problems at
customer sites, according to Richard P. Bingham, a manager at
Dranetz-BMI, a power-quality products and consulting company, in
Edison, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laser printers often take out computers when the heater comes
on,'' said Bingham, citing but one example. Electronic ballasts in
overhead lighting and compressors in soda machines also cause
unexpected loads. And electronic devices, like drives that adjust
speeds on motors to save energy, generate electrical interference
on the lines that power them. The interference, known as harmonic
signals, can trip up other equipment unless it is canceled by
filtering devices. And many schools, he said, are creating problems
for themselves by overloading their electrical systems with new
electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of problems and the public's dwindling patience with
disruptions means that trouble-shooters like Dranetz-BMI can no
longer restrict themselves to the utility-dominated world, where
the person on the other end of the phone is generally an engineer.
``There are a lot more people with less and less knowledge of
electricity calling me with questions,'' Bingham said.

NEW ENCRYPTION SYSTEM WOULD PROTECT MUSIC ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SABRA CHARTRAND c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   As the Internet
continues to influence the evolution of intellectual property law
and policy, one issue currently generating tremendous controversy
is the free and anonymous swapping of digital music files.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Various companies have proposed forms of encryption as solutions
to the problem. Now add another candidate: Three mathematicians at
Brown University have capped six years of research with a patent
for an encryption code they say will make it impractical _ if not
impossible _ to infringe copyrighted data like digital music.
</P>
<P>
   The mathematicians, Jeffrey Hoffstein and Jill Pipher, both of
Pawtucket, R.I., and Joseph Silverman of Needham, Mass., patented a
system they say can quickly encode every second of a data stream
with a different encryption key. That means that a typical
three-minute song would be scrambled into 180 different codes;
anyone taking the time to break a single code would be rewarded
with only one second of music.
</P>
<P>
   They say the encoding works so quickly that encryption keys
could be instantly disposable. Data like songs could be encoded to
play on only one specific music player or computer, after which
that particular version of the code would be thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone orders music, then it can be encrypted specifically
for that user,'' explained Scott Crenshaw, chief executive of the
Rhode Island company that owns the patent, NTRU Cryptosystems Inc.
``It will only download on that user's device. He can't share it
with his friends without authorization because it simply won't play
on his friend's device.''
</P>
<P>
   The encryption can be used for data transmissions between
computers, cellular phones, digital music players ``or virtually
any consumer device connected to the Internet,'' Crenshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw contends that the encoding and decoding is much faster
than with any similar system, and he says it does not use much
computer memory. ``It's tiny and can fit into 1,500 bytes, while
competitors take 10 or 20 or 30 times as much space,'' he said.
``That's important because consumer devices have very little
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other encryption systems, the new invention grew out of
advanced mathematical formulas. NTRU's technology differs from
other encryption processes, Crenshaw said, because it relies on a
mathematical system called a ``convolution product'' to make it
faster and more efficient. With that kind of math, he said,
encoding requires only one step, while decoding requires only two.
Some other encryption systems need more than 1,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The invention uses what is called ``public key'' encryption,
which does not require the sender and receiver to privately
exchange code keys to complete a transaction. Crenshaw said that
when a person ordered music online, his computer or music player
would provide the encoding key to the server computer of a Web site
dispensing the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The server uses that key to encode the data, and then throws
it away,'' Crenshaw said. The encoded music comes back to the
user's computer, which already knows the key and uses it to decrypt
the data. ``No other player has that key,'' he said. ``The music is
useless if sent to another player.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardware or software employing the encryption technology
would have to be included in consumer electronic devices. Crenshaw
said NTRU had signed a licensing agreement with an Israeli company
called Aladdin, which makes the so-called tokens that activate
music players and that could contain the encryption technology.
</P>
<P>
   A chip in the token would tell the music distributor what
encryption key to use. The customer could move the token between
his MP3 player, home stereo, computer or other device so he could
listen to his music library in more than one place, Crenshaw
explained, but because the token would be customized for his
devices only, he wouldn't be able to give it to a friend to share
digital music illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffstein, Pipher and Silverman received patent 6,081,597.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

didn't like technology at all. A lot of times I end up complaining
about how it has messed with my life in bad ways.

   But since I write about technology, there are some things you
need to understand. I do love technology, have loved it since I was
a kid messing with ham radios, sending frog astronauts into near
space _ and usually an early grave _ with homemade rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is great. It's just that it's somehow become a
religion instead of a tool.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some great tools out there, and today I'll tell
you about some of the ones that do impress me and are useful in my
life.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with digital cameras. I started thinking about the
trend toward these filmless cameras last night while _ in a fit of
nostalgia _ looking through some old photographs taken when I was a
kid. Looking at those photographs you'd have thought that I come
from a long line of pastel-colored people.
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear a lot of good reasons to get a digital camera,
including how easy it makes it to send a photograph by e-mail to
relatives and friends. And those are good reasons. But _ if you are
the kind of person who wants future generations of your family to
see how you really look _ digital cameras have another advantage.
Unlike photographic prints, where the the chemistry that creates
the images are doomed to eventually blotch and fade into
nothingness, a digital photograph should look the same 100 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings me to the second gadget that seems to have a
real future: the recordable CD. If you have a lot of photographs,
you can transfer them to the CD and store it away. Unlike magnetic
recording devices, if stored properly, it should last for a century
or two. (And if your great-great-grandchildren wish, they can copy
it a hundred years from now. Unlike duplicating a videotape, the
copy will be identical to the original with no loss of quality.)
</P>
<P>
   The mass storage available on a CD and its semipermanence make
it a great place to store other family memories including texts
about the family tree, precious letters and other information that
you'd like to keep around. Just one quick tip: Make two copies.
Keep one at home and store another one in a safe deposit box or
with a friend. That way if your home is ever struck by fire or some
other disaster, you won't lose the memories.
</P>
<P>
   The third technological marvel that I recommend to you is a UPS,
an uninterrupted power supply. Years ago, when I started writing
about computers, the UPS was something reserved for businesses and
government. It was too expensive for home users. But nowadays, you
can buy one for $100 or so, and it's worth every penny.
</P>
<P>
   A UPS is basically a large battery connected to circuitry that
converts the battery power into current that your PC can use. When
the power goes out at your house _ and, at my house at least, that
happens at least six or seven times a year _ the UPS automatically
kicks in to supply an uninterrupted source of power. That means
you'll have time to shut down your computer normally and save your
work. And since a UPS also provides excellent protection against
power surges and dips, your PC should work better with fewer screen
freezes and also last longer. The power dips and surges gradually
do damage to your machine.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of useless and expensive software and hardware
out there. But I don't know a soul _ truly _ who regrets owning any
of the devices I've mentioned today.

 &HT;    Ontrack's SystemSuite 2000 comparable to rival
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ontrack's SystemSuite 2000 goes head-to-head with
Norton's SystemWorks and comes out pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   It runs from a control center with 10 basic modules, some of
which, as you might expect, have redundant sections.
</P>
<P>
   The Fix Wizard, for example, has nine functions, all but one of
which can be found under other headings.
</P>
<P>
   Disk and Files contains core programs such as DiskFixer, a disk
defragmenter, FileUndeleter and several system-file backup
programs. The file recovery program is similar to Norton's _ unless
you give it a deleted file to look for, it will search a specified
drive for all the deleted files it can find, and present a list of
them, their folder of origin and an estimate of the likelihood of
complete recovery.
</P>
<P>
   For folks who haven't been through this sort of thing before,
and find the concept of searching for a deleted file to be somewhat
oxymoronic, file deletion still works like this:
</P>
<P>
   When you order a file deleted, it isn't immediately wiped out.
Instead, the system tags it as deleted, making its space on the
hard drive available for new information. Sooner or later _ sooner,
of course, if you decide you want it back _ it will be overwritten,
entirely or partially.
</P>
<P>
   Registry tools are the best thing about these latest programs.
It seems to me that SystemSuite's RegistryFixer is somewhat more
aggressive and detailed than Norton's comparable program. After
launching it, it will present the user with a list of registry
problems with three levels of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   If it's certain it can deal with a problem, it will already be
marked for action. The other two levels are left up to the user. In
some cases, it will offer a choice of actions, in addition to the
choice of doing nothing at all about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, on the other hand, can either fix the problem or not,
and that's it. If you want something done about a problem it can't
handle, then you have to go into the Registry editor and deal with
it yourself, a process I would not recommend to the novice.
</P>
<P>
   SystemSuite keeps automatic track of all the registry changes so
if you made a bad guess, it can be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   It has the usual complement of system diagnostics and monitors,
and protective services that include a Crashproof function. I have
no confidence in these things; they generally cause more problems
than they forestall.
</P>
<P>
   The Crisis Center is an interesting idea. Of its four
components, only one is concerned with helping you deal with data
recovery yourself. One conveys you to various online advice sites,
and the other two hook you up with industrial-strength, extra-cost
services provided by OnTrack.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a complete suite of ZIP file-archiving and
un-archiving programs and a full virus protection.
</P>
<P>
   SystemSuite runs $60. More information is available at
www.ontrack.com.

 &HT;    `Digital Diva' Stacy Elliott's Tips
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Elliott, Microsoft's ``Digital Diva,'' offers this advice
for newcomers to computers and the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   1. Figure out what you want to do. Focus on what you want to do
rather than on the technology itself. From there you can decide
what products you need. If you just want to send e-mail and surf
the Web, your needs will be simple. But if you want to send digital
pictures, you need a camera and a scanner.
</P>
<P>
   2. Grab a friend and go to the computer store. It's good to take
a friend along with you. Store personnel are great, but they don't
know you and your skill level. The best way to learn about
technology is to have somebody you know help.
</P>
<P>
   3. If you belong to a club, have a ``Tech Night.'' ``Many people
are involved in clubs or organizations, like gardening clubs or
book clubs,'' Elliott says. Pick a night to talk about technology.
Ask everyone to bring a gadget and demonstrate how it works, or
have the meeting at a home where everyone can try the computer.
``All of a sudden, you'll have new ideas about what technology can
do,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   4. Do a little bit every day. Don't try to do everything all in
one day. Play with it, practice with it and explore. Learn one
thing, then you can go onto something else.
</P>
<P>
   5. Read up. Don't skip over the technology articles in magazines
like Family PC _ if you are connected to the Internet you can go
out onto the Web and look for more tips and tricks. Elliott
suggests flipping through books at the local bookstore to find the
right one for you. Make sure you don't buy any book that uses
language you don't understand. One book she recommends is ``The
Grown-Up's Guide to Computing'' by Mary S. Furlong and Stefan B.
Lipson from the Microsoft Press, but there are many good ones to
chose from.

 &HT;    Protect your PC privacy
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I am connected to the Internet via cable modem (MediaOne). I've
read numerous articles that indicate I'm at risk from hackers
breaking into my PC files with this connection. Is this true even
if I only have my PC on and am working in Microsoft Word, for
example, but have not clicked on the icon that connects me to
MediaOne's home site?
</P>
<P>
   _ Yvonne Naylor, Bay Village, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There are pitfalls. As a cable modem user, once you turn
on your PC or Mac, you're immediately perched out there on a
network. And you're not alone. You are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You become even more susceptible to intruders when you
launch your browser to surf the Web. The Internet isn't secure at
all. That's a given. Threats exist to privacy and data.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There are things you can do, though. If you don't want to
surf but wish to use a word processor or another application and
not feel like someone's peering over your shoulder, disconnect the
fat network cable (RJ-45) that runs from your computer to the cable
modem.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: That way, you stay close to home. On your own hard drive.
You don't connect to the cable TV network or make the giant leap to
the Web, the mother of all networks. When you want to rejoin the
masses, plug the cable back in and you're good to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: When you're ``live'' and online, one safety precaution is
to turn off File and Print Sharing in the Network Control Panel on
the PC. That can cut off an interloper's way ``in.'' On the Mac,
turn off the File Sharing Control Panel. Disable printer sharing
within the printer software or Control Panels, depending on the OS.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Or ``build'' a personal firewall. Firewalls come in all
shapes and sizes, but here we're talking about software that
controls traffic between your computer and the Internet and alerts
you to possible intrusions. For the PC, there's Norton Internet
Security 2000 (symantec.com) at $69.95. In addition to defending
against invasion, this package puts icing on the cake by keeping
cookies in check and blocking banner ads. Norton currently doesn't
have a Mac version available. For another PC version, surf to
networkice.com and look at BlackICE Defender ($39.95). For the Mac,
check out DoorStop at opendoor.com for $59.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Also, it doesn't hurt to see what your cable company says
about protecting your system (www.mediaone.com). When downloading
off the Net, virus protection is a must. Keep an eye out for
insidious e-mail attachments, too. As we know all too well from the
Love Bug, double-clicking an attachment can launch an executable
that wreaks havoc. Having a text/image viewer around doesn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: A couple of good-sense practices to adopt, if you haven't
already. If you have passwords to anything, don't share. Also, back
up data regularly. That's smart to do whether you're connected to
the Internet or not.
</P>
<P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    A dud named 'Sue'
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ What a disappointment. The most complete
Tyrannosaurus rex ever discovered gets the most shallow treatment
ever burned onto a CD-ROM in Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive's I See
Sue . . . the T.rex. ($20; www.simonandschuster.com; for Windows
and Mac). The sad truth is that you'll get relatively few glimpses
of the magnificent creature's bones alongside a mind-numbingly
simple, simulated board game in which you collect and discard
tiles, go-fish style, to complete a dinosaur and move across a
badly-drawn playing field. The game takes about as long to master
as tic-tac-toe, and the frustratingly random jump-aheads and
fall-backs on the game board remove even that classic paper and
pencil game's strategy factor. Annoying Nickelodeon child star
Danny Tamberelli (''Pete and Pete,'' ``Figure it Out,'' ``All
That'') provides repetitive, bothersome rhyming commentary with
only the most cursory level of information. Skip the CD-ROM and go
straight to the wonderful Web site, www.iseesue.com, for a far more
in-depth look at Sue's discovery and reconstruction with puzzles to
print and complete. Yeah, T.rex is supposed to be bad, just not
like this. (Ages 4-7).
</P>
<P>
   NOW THIS GAME'S GOT BITE
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Dinosaur Activity Center ($30;
www.disneyinteractive.com; for Windows and Mac) is everything ``I
See Sue'' isn't . . . that's the good news and the bad news.
Whereas ``Sue'' is a clunker built around a real creature,
``Dinosaur'' is a fantastic, personality-filled CD-ROM based on
those fictional, Disnified creatures-with-human-faces from the hit
movie of the same name. Of the three great arcade and logic
strategy games here (not including the silly Lemur Love Match),
Colossal Fossil Face Off is the best. It's a simplified chess-type
game of dino vs. dino, where each player's beasts have their own
special moves. The object is to discover which of your opponent's
creatures is hiding the dinosaur egg. There's a fun dinosaur puzzle
maker, which lets kids mix and match dino parts and record their
own voice-over roars, and, with an Internet connection, the
dinosaur creations can be e-mailed to friends. Children won't learn
much about real dinosaurs here, but they won't be bored to tears
after five minutes, and they'll pick up some logic and strategy
skills along the way. (Ages 5 and up).

 &HT;    Delete PC fear
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you scared of Web surfing? Terrified of
technology? You are not alone. And there is help. Getting plugged
in to the information revolution is easier than you think.
</P>
<P>
   You may even find that it's fun.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of nervousness about the Web comes from what seems like an
endless stream of advertisements on television, radio, magazines
and newspapers that toss around phrases like ``e-business,''
``Internet service provider,'' ``DSL,'' along with names of
companies that have three w's in front of them and a dot-com after
them.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of decent, smart, intelligent people don't deal with the
Internet on a daily basis, don't have an e-business and don't want
to have one. They stare at the TV dazed and confused as one
Internet ad is followed by the next, with no idea what these
companies are selling or even how to find the Web site where all
this stuff is being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Don't despair. No matter what your computer geek friends may
tell you, everybody _ even your 6-year-old who may be in the living
room working on his Web site as you read this _ was a computer
novice once. Really.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watched the Super Bowl, nearly every ad was a dot-com
advertisement,'' says Stacy Elliott, the so-called Digital Diva,
who travels the country for Microsoft delivering the message that
computer use can be simple. ``You would have thought the whole
world had Internet access except for you, and that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of people who cringe when someone tells them
to look something up on the Web or who rank the idea of installing
software with jumping out of an airplane without a parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let all the lingo and hype keep you away from computers
and the Internet. If computers were really that hard to use,
Circuit City would only sell video equipment and software
billionaire Bill Gates would be the night manager at a McDonald's
instead of the richest man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice anyone can give the computer-shy is to ask not
what you can do for technology but rather what technology can do
for you. ``If someone tells me to get a digital camera,'' Elliott
says, ``my first instinct is still to ask why, and most of the time
people will say, `Well, because it's cool.' That means nothing to
me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if somebody told me that a digital camera would let me
take pictures of my new home in Seattle, put them up on the
Internet so my friends in the Midwest can see them, then I can see
there is some utility, some reason for getting a digital camera.''
</P>
<P>
   So lesson one is an easy one. Ask yourself what you want to get
from your technology adventures. Do you want to track your stocks
online? Do you want to keep up with breaking news from around the
world? Do you want to listen to music online? Or do you just want
to e-mail your kids at college?
</P>
<P>
   Once you know what you want to do, you're halfway home. The next
step is to learn how to do it. Elliott suggests a hands-on
approach. Find a friend who has a computer or uses the type of
technology you're interested in and ask for a demonstration. She
says actually being able to play around with technology in your own
home or at a friend's house without any pressure to understand
everything right away is the best way to wade into the technology
waters.
</P>
<P>
   One way to get started is to just sit down at the computer with
a good friend or a good book to guide you in your initial efforts.
Just wandering the aisles of the local bookstore to find a book
that answers your questions without raising new ones is your best
bet. But don't grab the first book you see. If you don't understand
anything in the book, don't buy it. If seeing pictures of what the
computer screen should look like will help, buy a book with plenty
of easy-to-understand illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   There's also nothing wrong with grabbing your computer-savvy
friends and having them show you what to do. The Web site,
SeniorNet, says not to be afraid to ask for help. Although the site
is geared toward seniors, the advice holds true for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you have to tell yourself some things: Nobody is born
knowing this stuff,'' writes Lois Granick, a SeniorNet instructor
in Washington. ``Teaching older adults does sometimes mean
convincing them that they can learn. Students need to be convinced
that learning new things _ including computers _ is sometimes
difficult and often slow. It's is not possible to learn it
instantly. The computer is particularly intimidating to those first
approaching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Granick says that once seniors get over their fears of the
computer the fun part of computing is almost always instantly
apparent. ``Students at the end of the first lesson are reluctant
to leave the Solitaire game that is scheduled for the last 15
minutes of the session to practice mouse usage.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you're online and looking for a jump start to the Web,
there are plenty of guides to help you find interesting Web sites
geared to your interests. ``The Internet Cool Guide'' and ``The
Internet Cool Guide to Online Shopping'' are two small,
easy-to-read guides to some of the best-known Web sites. Even if
you're not online yet, browsinww.digitaldiva.com) must have felt
when she went to work in Microsoft's marketing department three and
a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the difference between hardware and software,''
she says. ``That's a pretty big problem when you work at Microsoft.
I'd sit in these meetings and hear all this technology talk and I
was just overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   She spent most of her time in meetings scribbling down strange
acronyms and techno-speak that sounded like something Captain
Picard would utter in an average episode of ``Star Trek,'' then
hurry back to her office and try to look everything up.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, like a lot of women new to technology, was afraid to
ask questions of her Microsoft colleagues because she didn't want
to appear ignorant. However, she soon discovered that many of her
friends who didn't work for high-technology companies like
Microsoft were just as confused and intimidated as she was.
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Diva's traveling road show takes her all over the
country with the Microsoft team, demonstrating products and
spreading the word that technology is accessible. She has a ``try
it, you'll like it'' attitude about technology that resonates with
women who are interested but slightly nervous around computers,
software, hand-held devices and other high-tech gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent show-and-tell engagement at the Atlanta Civic
Center, women stopped to look over and ``test drive'' everything
from money management software programs to electronic organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to open our eyes and see what's happening,'' said
Jody Gold, a visitor from Maryland who stopped by the technology
display to test out a hand-held electronic organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we really want to get involved in and not shy
away from,'' added her friend Beth Kwiateck. They both said that
being able to play around with various software and computer
devices in a low-stress atmosphere (none of the products
demonstrated was available for purchase on-site) made them more
willing to ask questions and try the products out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only use the computer at home,'' said Beth Kearney, ``but my
daughter just got a high-tech job and she wants to tell me about
all this stuff and I want to find out what it's all about.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Want to see the future of the Internet? Keep an eye on
Bob Pittman, America Online's president and chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of the AOL/Time Warner merger vote, Pittman, 46,
has become one of the most influential figures in both old and new
media. The decisions he'll make at America Online will have an
impact on nearly everyone who picks up a magazine, watches TV, goes
to a movie or logs on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Media insiders will remember Pittman as the man who helped
develop MTV and VH1, the wildly popular cable music channels.
</P>
<P>
   He joined AOL in 1996 with a plan to use his knowledge of TV
programming to create channels and ``programming'' for the online
service.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman also came to AOL to transform the online service's
business model. Ripping another page from his television
background, he moved AOL from a subscription-based business model
to one that included advertising, marketing and electronic
commerce. The combination was and still is so successful that
almost all other Internet service providers _ including the No. 2
ISP, Atlanta-based EarthLink _ now consider it a key component of
their business strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman has expanded his vision to include delivering AOL on any
device from the traditional PC to pagers and television. He also
sees a world where AOL users can watch movies and download music
right on the service.
</P>
<P>
   Charging for digital music downloads could be the one place
where Pittman will make his biggest impression on the Internet
economy. Last week, AOL took its first step toward selling music
online, making a deal with InterTrust Technologies that will let
AOL members download digital music for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of trying to figure out how to
commercialize digital downloading,'' said AOL spokeswoman Wendy
Goldberg. The technology will be included in AOL version 6.0 due
out this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the billion-dollar question that artists, record
companies and Internet companies dearly want to answer is whether
AOL customers will be willing to purchase music online _ no matter
how easy it is to do.
</P>
<P>
   Talal Shamoon, senior vice president for media at InterTrust,
said America Online's 22 million-plus subscriber base would be the
ideal setting to launch a secure version of Napster, the widely
used system for swapping music files.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, through its various partners and the seemingly limitless
resources of the Time Warner family of media products, could offer
a stunning range of incentives that could include everything from
concert tickets to a free month of HBO.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are limitless, and if anyone can figure out a
way to persuade listeners to pay for music on the Net, the odds are
pretty good it's Pittman. After all, who would have thought back in
1981 that people would be willing to sit and watch a channel that
then consisted of nothing but music videos 24 hours a day?
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be at the threshold of something very big,'' Shamoon
told The Wall Street Journal. ``A robust electronic community of
people exchanging content in a safe way, where rights holders get
paid and consumers feel good about the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether that ``something very big'' actually materializes is
entirely up to Pittman, and it's hard to find a pundit who doesn't
believe Pittman is this century's P.T. Barnum _ the kind of
businessman who instead of selling things you don't want, persuades
you to buy things you had absolutely no idea you wanted.
</P>
<P>
   His business skills Hollywood media connections and marketing
genius create a rare set of talents, combining ``old economy''
horse trading with ``new economy'' innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Mark Stavish, head of personnel for AOL, put it best when
he told the Sunday Times of London, ``People say AOL exists because
of Steve (Case, AOL's founder and chief executive), but it works
because of Bob.''

BERTELSMANN COMMITMENT TO LYCOS DEAL INTACT, CEO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER   c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief executive of German publisher Bertelsmann AG says he
remains committed to a planned alliance with Waltham, Mass. Lycos
Inc., although Bertelsmann's exact obligations were revised
downward last week.
</P>
<P>
   When Lycos and its would-be buyer, Spain's Terra Networks,
announced their merger on May 16, they said Bertelsmann planned to
pay their combined company $1 billion over five years for
advertising and e-commerce services. In a filing June 28, Terra
disclosed that Bertelsmann is only ``obliged'' to pay $325 million
and that Terra's parent, Telefonica SA, would replace up to $675
million worth of orders Bertelsmann might cancel.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Bertelsmann chief executive Thomas
Middelhoff called it ``very, very unlikely'' his company would
spend less than the full $1 billion. He also said Bertelsmann
expects to go ahead with a plan to acquire a stake in Terra Lycos
in three years or so.
</P>
<P>
   But Middelhoff said Lycos chief executive Bob Davis was right to
insist Telefonica guarantee Bertelsmann's payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for (Lycos) shareholders, because nobody knows what
will happen in the next three to four years in the Internet
world,'' Middelhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann's exact role in Terra Lycos has been unclear to
some.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture is counting on access to Bertelsmann's big array
of record and movie studios, books, and magazine titles, all needed
to attract online viewers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bertelsmann is barred from investing in Terra Lycos
directly, under its agreements with America Online, once a close
ally until it moved to buy Time Warner Inc. this year.
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff said Bertelsmann is still committed to paying Lycos
competitor AOL $250 million for advertising over four years, in a
deal announced in March. ``We're best friends,'' he said of America
Online Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Bertelsmann's relationship with Terra Lycos will go further,
he said. ``It's a special kind of alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Terra's filing mentioned various risks for Terra
Lycos it hadn't previously highlighted. One section of the document
was titled ``Risks Related to Being Part of the Telefonica Group.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Terra noted that other Telefonica companies
``could compete with us, and they may pursue their own
Internet-related business.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Telefonica's Argentine telecommunications unit also
runs an Internet portal targeting the same home users Terra Lycos
aims to attract, the filing said.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk is that Internet use in Latin America may grow more
slowly than expected. Terra said it received 73 percent of its
revenue from Latin American operations. And Terra warned its
free-Internet access offerings in Spain, Brazil, Mexico, and other
countries could prove costly.
</P>
<P>
   A Terra representative in New York declined to elaborate on the
details.
</P>
<P>
   Terra also outlined new five-year employment agreements for
senior Lycos executives including Davis, who would be chief
executive of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   Davis would get a base salary and bonus of $500,000, plus a $5
million payment in case of severance. He would also receive options
to acquire 2 million Terra Lycos shares.

MICROSOFT HIRES WASHINGTON APPELLATE SPECIALIST FOR NEXT STAGE OF 
DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   The Microsoft
Corp. added more firepower to the defense team in its antitrust
case Monday by hiring Carter Phillips, one of the nation's leading
appellate lawyers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phillips, 47, a partner in the Washington office of Sidley &AMP;
Austin, is one of the group of lawyers who regularly argue cases
before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent term, Phillips was on the winning side in three
cases before the court. In one, he argued on behalf of a health
maintenance organization in a case in which the court ruled that
the financial incentives placed on doctors to hold down costs do
not make HMOs liable for violating a duty to put patients first. He
was a member of the winning legal teams in two other cases: the
court's reaffirmation of the Miranda rule and its decision to
strike down a New Jersey hate crime law as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' first assignment for Microsoft will be to work on a
Supreme Court brief, due July 26, in which the company will argue
that the court should allow a federal appeals court to review the
antitrust case first. The Justice Department and 19 states suing
Microsoft are seeking to have the Supreme Court take the case
directly to speed up the appeals stage of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is appealing the ruling of U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson that the company is a monopolist that repeatedly
violated the nation's antitrust laws. Jackson ordered that
Microsoft be split in two and that it make a series of changes in
its business practices. But soon after, he postponed all of the
sanctions until the completion of the appeals process, which could
take a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, which presented Microsoft's defense in its
setback before the district court, will remain the software maker's
lead counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're moving to the next phase of this case, and Sullivan
&AMP; Cromwell will benefit from the experience of Carter Phillips and
Sidley &AMP; Austin,'' said James Cullinan, a spokesman for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a courtroom defeat in a major case, it is not
unusual for a defendant to bring in additional expertise for the
appeals, according to legal experts. Phillips will work on
Microsoft's appeal whether the Supreme Court takes the case
directly or not, Cullinan said.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Sidley &AMP; Austin, Phillips was a law clerk to
Chief Justice Warren Burger and he served as assistant solicitor
general in the Reagan Administration from 1981 to 1984.

BEWARE OF WELL-HEELED SNAKES HIDING IN THE GRASS-ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
  By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   At various times in my life, I've
fantasized about becoming an astronaut, a major-league center
fielder, a rock singer, and a waiter for Republican and Democratic
fund-raising dinners. (With meals going for $250,000 a plate, I
figured I could get along quite nicely on 15 percent tips.)
<TEXT>
<P>
   But, alas, I don't like flying coach, not to mention floating
weightlessly, I can't hit a 90 mph fastball, I sing like a cat
trapped in a shower, and I simply cannot bear the thought of making
a living cutting up Strom Thurmond's food or watching Bill Clinton
inhale his.
</P>
<P>
   So, reluctantly, I've been forced to defer my dreams and let
them dry up like raisins in the sun. (Speaking of shriveled fruit,
did you hear that prune growers just won FDA approval to begin
calling their product ``dried plums''? Really. ``It's a marketing
question,'' said a spokeswoman for the California Prune Board.
``We're going for younger consumers, and our surveys show they have
a more positive feeling for the name `dried plum.' It's more of a
`fruit goodness' feeling.'')
</P>
<P>
   Dreams are hard to abandon, but my raisins and I have been
getting along OK. Then, a few days ago, I read an article that
caused my almost-middle-age heart to skip a beat in joy (at least I
hope that was joy). The story revealed a couple of dream jobs I'd
never considered.
</P>
<P>
   The first: Taking out the trash for the technological
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle Corp., admitted last week that
he hired private investigators to delve into the activities of
several groups the Independent Institute, the National Taxpayers
Union and the Association for Competitive Technology that
aggressively supported Microsoft during its antitrust troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison says he had a hunch the organizations weren't
independent advocacy groups, as they portrayed themselves, but were
actually well-paid mouthpieces for Microsoft. He said his snoops
found evidence confirming his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   The spying involved, among other things, sifting through trash.
Oracle's investigators allegedly offered to pay janitors to let
them take a peek at garbage belonging to one of the groups. In the
high-tech world, this is known as ``competitive intelligence.''
And, it seems, it's lucrative. The janitors were offered $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison says it was his ``civic duty'' to spy. Microsoft, not
surprisingly, also contends it's done nothing wrong. It claims
Oracle paid groups to say nasty things about Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure who's guilty of what, but give me a pair of rubber
gloves and a few grand, and I'd be happy to be, uh, competitively
intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   While I'm at it, I'm thinking it might be fun and profitable to
seed a few new ``grass-roots'' groups, too. I've done a little
research and discovered it's a booming business. In the mid-1990s,
folks in corporate America grew weary of battling groups that
popped up to oppose their every move. So CEOs started creating
their own groups.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, utility companies launched Northwesterners
for More Fish, to fight people bellyaching about hydroelectric
projects killing fish. Friends of Eagle Mountain emerged in
California to defend efforts to turn an old iron mine into the
world's largest landfill. The National Wetlands Coalition popped up
to water down federal wetlands regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you saw the recent commercials by Citizens for Better
Medicare opposing the Clinton administration's proposal for new
benefits. The ``citizens'' in question are pharmaceutical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The group spent more than $30 million on commercials. It also
operated two Web sites offering free $10 calling cards and rather
touchingly, I think urging visitors to dial up their grandparents
to chat about Medicare. The deal was so popular the group later
posted a message asking visitors to call Gramps and Granny ``on
your own dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of you might quibble with the ethics of going through
other people's trash or dropping a snake into the grass-roots.
</P>
<P>
   But I think it's all a matter of perspective and allowing
yourself to dream big. Some of us look at a difficult situation and
see a prune. Others eye the same set-up and think, ``Ah! Dried
plum!''
</P>

&HT;     MEXICO ENTERS A NEW ERA 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELIAS CASTILLO

<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ For Mexico, in the end, it all came down
to the wise words attributed to Abraham Lincoln:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that you may fool all of the people some of the
time; you can even fool some of the people all the time; but you
can't fool all of the people all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a swirl of a ``derrota,'' Spanish for a major defeat,
Mexicans on Sunday finally took the presidency and legislative
majorities away from the PRI, the corrupt and brutal Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, voters decided they would be fooled no more
by the PRI which, for 71 years, kept Mexico poor, stifled
enterprise, governed by bribery and corruption, kept most Mexican
women barefoot and pregnant, and kept their husbands ignorant and
in wretched poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's stunning presidential elections, the cleanest ever
in Mexico, Vicente Fox, of PAN, the National Action Party, crushed
the PRI candidate, Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen sink and all, the PRI was not only hurled out of Los
Pinos, the presidential residence, it was also thrown from the
country's Congress. Opposition parties will now control both the
Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, equivalent to the U.S. House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the PRI's defeat was an educated middle class. As far
back as the government's 1968 massacre of nearly 500 protesting
students, these voters began to realize that PRI leaders and their
cronies were using bloodstained tactics while lying and cheating to
stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   The prime example was Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of
the ex-president in exile, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Raul, now in
jail, had illicitly amassed a fortune in excess of $400 million
while working as a government official during his brother's
six-year presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Mexico's middle class, stuck on the bottom
rung of the ladder to success because of economic blunders by the
PRI, decided it would no longer be fooled by the party in power,
which tended to privately and quietly make the United States its
whipping boy, blaming Uncle Sam for policies aimed at keeping
Mexico underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   I once asked a Mexican presidential adviser in Mexico City why
the country suffered such terrible poverty. He grabbed his throat
and said, ``The United States has us like this. They want to keep
us poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Flabbergasted, I asked him how exactly the United States did
that. He shrugged his shoulders and said, ``I don't know, but they
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   His gesture and statement was a prime example of the astounding
arrogance of PRI officials thinking they could get anyone to
swallow such a baldfaced proposition. Mexican intellectuals had
already discovered that the PRI's closed market economy, ramshackle
education system, corruption and cronyism were to blame for a
crumbling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Those intellectuals and the middle class combined to form the
juggernaut that convinced even Mexico's poor that the PRI was
rotten to the core.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for 71 years the PRI had fed on the fears and hopes of the
poor, its most loyal constituents. The PRI warned that if they were
voted from office, the party's barefoot and hungry followers would
suffer even more. And, simultaneously, the PRI promised a better
life and handed out sandwiches and tacos on election day as a
gesture of good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, not even sandwiches and tacos were able to buy votes.
</P>
<P>
   In a major demonstration of courage and enlightenment, Mexicans
voted out the PRI in the best tradition of democracy.

&HT;     POTATO SALAD DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Potato salad. That's first on my list of
favorite things about America, at least right now as I go back for
a third helping at the Fourth of July picnic, my second favorite
thing about America.
</P>
<P>
   That is, not counting freedom and democracy, which George Bush
and Al Gore claim to love so much they're willing to hang out with
rich people and raise millions.
</P>
<P>
   Just as there's no such thing as a good presidential candidate,
there is no such thing as bad potato salad. The best potato salad
is your own or your mother's, thus there are 200 million best
potato salads.
</P>
<P>
   Potato salad is where democracy and meritocracy meet. Of course,
mine, made with lots of egg, is the very best.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing wrong with the stuff is when yours isn't the only
kind at the picnic. The first time through the line, out of
politeness, you have to waste space on the paper plate with other
people's recipes.
</P>
<P>
   That's why picnics are so great. You're allowed to go back for
potato salad as many times as you want, and no one's watching you
hog your own. And only your wife is counting how many hot dogs you
eat.
</P>
<P>
   Hot dogs. That's another of my favorite things about America.
Other countries have their bratwurst and bangers, and they're fine
in Wisconsin or at Renaissance Faires, but there's nothing like hot
dogs in the great outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   They go with mustard or ketchup, fireworks or bleachers, and
they can be fried or grilled, served on buns or in beans. They can
be dropped in the fire or on the grass and they're still great.
Maybe better.
</P>
<P>
   You just swirl them around in your mug of beer.
</P>
<P>
   Ketchup. It's a vegetable (Ronald Reagan said so) made with
sugar, and you put it on meat and deep-fried stuff. You can't get
more American than that.
</P>
<P>
   And what a bottle. First none comes, then a lot, eventually
leaving a third at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   H.J. Heinz has experimented with bottles that squeeze and have
wide-mouths, but Americans refuse to buy ketchup except when it's
in the classic container. We have our traditions, like pounding
with the palm and hoping not to be a fountain of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Food and drink is the essence of patriotism. Bostonians didn't
burn a British flag, but deep-sixed their tea. That hurt.
</P>
<P>
   This is the weekend when food prohibitions are forgotten in
favor of patriotism, and everyone has a hot dog or a hamburger _
except a few vegans, who are hogging the eggless potato salad.
That's OK. It's not the best. Mine is.
</P>
<P>
   They can have those tofu dogs, too. Tofu dogs are patriotic.
Only Americans would invent something that gross.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson, what a patriot. I always thought the French helped
us beat Cornwallis and win the Revolutionary War. It turns out it
was a handsome midget of an Australian, and now he's got 20 million
George Washingtons in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   We know nothing about history, science or philosophy and yet we
rule. We are totally uninformed, yet we lead the world in the
information revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The information itself is irrelevant to the revolution,
something Tom Paine would find shocking. Who's Tom Paine? No
relation to Webber. Ask Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   Everything we know we learn from movies or MTV. Regis Philbin
hosts our greatest educational program. What we know for sure is
that we have a great work ethic, and we celebrate it on our Fourth
of July five-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On the Fourth of July, everyone wears the red, white and blue.
It's wonderful. No earth tones, just the tones of the greatest
nation on Earth, and Levis count as blue.
</P>
<P>
   We do as early Americans did, and attend fairs, fireworks and
parades.
</P>
<P>
   I like the small parades, such as the one in Larkspur, which has
contingents of dogs and one man's collection of World War II trucks
and tanks. I love watching old Nazi military vehicles clank by
parked BMWs, Porsches and Audis, with most Marinites blissfully
unaware they all came from the same factories.
</P>
<P>
   We're ignorant of history, yet we rule. We do know enough,
though, to cheer the Vietnam veterans in their patchwork mix of
uniforms. They always get the biggest cheers in the small town
parades, and that's a great thing.
</P>
<P>
   We remember the Vietnam War, and Mel Gibson didn't win it.

   What is patriotism? The New York Times tried to answer that
question last week, and in its typical way, with a debate between a
conservative intellectual and a liberal intellectual. The word
``intellectual'' means no one is paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   The question the Times posed to the deep thinkers of left and
right was whether patriotism is loving America for what it is, or
what it could be.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone missed the point, discussing irrelevancies like
flag-burning and what it represents, even though it's rarely seen
outside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   What America is, of course, is a country that always tries to be
what it could be. What America could be includes some of the things
we used to be, and some things that are only in our dreams.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we love America, along with the potato salad, hot
dogs and ketchup, which are exactly as they should be.
</P>
<P>
   My country right or wrong, now dig right in.

ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN LEADERS TO MEET IN U.S. NEXT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton announced Wednesday that Israeli and
Palestinian leaders will meet next week at Camp David to try to
thrash out the framework of a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have concluded that this is the best way _ indeed, it is the
only way _ to move forward,'' Clinton said, though he acknowledged
that success was not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The open-ended summit meeting between Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, will be held
at the presidential retreat in Maryland beginning on July 11. That
is just two months before the Sept. 13 deadline that both leaders
had set to conclude peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have threatened to unilaterally declare an
independent state if the agreement is not reached by the September
date.
</P>
<P>
   Camp David has particular significance because the outline of
the 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt was achieved in a
similar summit meeting presided over by President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described Camp David as ``a place where a milestone for
Middle East peace was reached.'' He added, ``I hope we'll all be
inspired by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited the
Middle East in an effort to bring the two leaders closer together
in preparation for a summit meeting. She implied last Friday after
her return that the time was not right for such a meeting, and said
that there was ``plenty of time to do what needs to be done''
before the Clinton administration ends next January.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said Wednesday that ``to delay this gathering, to
remain stalled is simply no longer an option. The
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as all of us have seen, knows no
status quo. It can move forward toward real peace or it can slide
back into real turmoil. It will not stand still.''
</P>
<P>
   The president continued, ``If the parties do not seize this
moment, if they cannot make progress now, there will be more
hostility and more bitterness, and perhaps even more violence, and
to what end?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed that there was ``no guarantee of success,'' but
said the lower-level negotiators had reached an impasse. ``Movement
now depends on historic decisions that only the leaders can make,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he planned to participate in the talks. ``I
will give it whatever time is required, as long as we're still
moving forward,'' he said. ``I will spend as much time up there as
I need to spend.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficult core issues to be resolved include the future of
Jerusalem, the borders of a Palestinian entity and the fate of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barak, who marks his first year as prime minister on Friday, has
tried to simultaneously conduct separate peace negotiations with
Syria and the Palestinians, but so far without success. Barak, who
was in London Wednesday to meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair,
needs the diplomatic success to help bolster his fragile
parliamentary coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said it wants the summit meeting, but the
Palestinians had said until now that the gap between the two sides
has not been narrowed sufficiently to ensure a successful meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has already gotten the go-ahead from the Palestinian
authority's legislature to declare independence if the September
deadline passes without a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, referring to Barak and Arafat, said Wednesday, ``I
think that neither of them want us to go by September without a
resolution to this.''

&HT;     COURT RULES AGAINST CITY LAW ON ATM FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON and CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge has struck down a voter-enacted
city law that restricted the ability of banks to impose surcharges
on non-customers who use their automated teller machines to
retrieve cash.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker sided with the banks'
assertion that San Francisco did not have jurisdiction to impose
such an ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Walker ruled the 7-month-old law, as well as a similar law
adopted by the Santa Monica City Council, was pre-empted by the
National Banking Act and other federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney Louise Renne said her office would appeal the
judge's decision, which was expected.
</P>
<P>
   The city, on behalf of the more than two-thirds of San Francisco
voters who supported it, maintained it had the right to enforce
such regulations under consumer protection authority granted by a
separate federal law, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through enforcement of these ordinances, plaintiffs will
suffer irreparable economic loss,'' Walker ruled in an opinion
filed Friday but received by the parties in the case Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has never taken effect. Walker was widely expected
to strike down the law, since he granted an injunction blocking its
enforcement immediately after its passage. The 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld the injunction in March. Municipalities and
states around the nation are trying to enact similar legislation;
one such measure in Iowa has been struck down.
</P>
<P>
   ATM owners, network operators and banks where customers have
accounts impose a ``foreign fee'' of $1 to $2 to recoup the cost of
allowing consumers to use ATMs at banks other than their own.
</P>
<P>
   But since April 1996, ATM operators have been allowed to charge
a second ``convenience fee,'' usually $1.50, to people who use
their ATMs to withdraw money from an account at another bank. As a
result, withdrawal fees can sometimes reach $3.50 when customers
use ATMs at banks other than their own.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the legal wrangling centered on the definition of
consumer protection envisioned by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act,
and how much authority municipalities can claim under that
provision.
</P>
<P>
   City lawyers said regulating ATM fees would legitimately fall
under their purview as a consumer protection issue, but bank
attorneys argued that cities have far more limited powers, such as
lighting and the location of ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Fees, the banks said, fall squarely in the arena of how they
conduct their business, which is exclusively regulated by federal
authorities under the National Banking Act.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, The City derided the surcharge as a ``double
fee'' and ``pure profit to the ATM terminal owners.''
</P>
<P>
   The city said the fee disproportionately affected poor people,
who withdraw smaller amounts of money on each trip to the ATM.
</P>
<P>
   Banks say the extra fee is warranted, bringing in extra money to
expand their ATM networks.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeking to overturn San Francisco's law was filed by
the Bank of America, Wells Fargo and the California Bankers
Association, a trade group based in San Francisco.

   Acknowledging that success is not assured, President Clinton
announced Wednesday that he will bring Israeli and Palestinian
leaders together next week at Camp David to attempt to thrash out
the framework of a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have concluded that this is the best way _ indeed, it is the
only way _ to move forward,'' said Clinton, who plans to
participate in the complex talks by shuttling back and forth from
Washington, about 80 miles southeast of Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will give it whatever time is required, as long as we're
still moving forward,'' Clinton said. ``I will spend as much time
up there as I need to spend.''
</P>

   Barak has tried to simultaneously conduct separate peace
negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians, but so far without
success, and needs the diplomatic success to help bolster his
fragile parliamentary coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli prime minister said Wednesday in Paris after meeting
French President Jacques Chirac that he still hopes to keep the
Sept. 13 deadline that he set with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel wanted Clinton to step in and hold the summit
meeting, the Palestinians had expressed reservations, saying that
the gap between the two sides had not been narrowed sufficiently to
promise success.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has already gotten the go-ahead from the Palestinian
authority's legislature to declare independence if the September
deadline passes without a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Wednesday that neither Barak nor Arafat wanted the
September deadline to pass without resolving the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   But the president added: ``Etched in each side's mind are
intense fears and emotions and deep-seated commitment to defend
their peoples' interests. There are no easy answers and certainly
no painless ones, and therefore there is clearly no guarantee of
success.''

 &HT;    WRESTLING GRAPEVINE: News, notes from the industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Viacom/CBS to give Extreme Championship
Wrestling the boot from The Nashville Network once the World
Wrestling Federation's suit with USA Networks concluded. On
Thursday, came this press release:
</P>
<P>
   ``TNN notified ECW today that, per the terms of their agreement,
the network would be terminating the telecasts of ECW on TNN, with
its last telecast on September 22. ECW was not doing as well as
expected. We appreciate the efforts ECW and Paul Heyman have made
to bring wrestling fans to TNN.''
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by ECW lead counsel Stephen Stern's response
on ecwwrestling.com:
</P>
<P>
   ``As counsel for ECW, we have been trying to meet with TNN for
months. Our efforts to meet with TNN have fallen on deaf ears and
been ignored. Based upon what has now become publicized fact
regarding the WWF's negotiations with CBS/VIACOM/TNN, we now begin
to understand, in our opinion, why meetings were not held. ECW
feels that TNN may not have been completely forthright in its
dealings with ECW given their relationship and ECW is disappointed
by the most recent actions of TNN to cancel its agreement with ECW.
``
</P>
<P>
   The harsh words end a relationship that seemed doomed from the
start. The combining of the most violent professional wrestling
group in the United States and a station that lives on ``The Dukes
of Hazzard'' and ``Dallas'' reruns was never going to be a perfect
match. Add to that, months of complaining from ECW that it was
getting no promotional help from TNN (despite being the top rated
show on TNN, one cannot find barely a mention of ECW on the TNN
Website _ country.com. And that mention refers to wrestlers who
have not been in the ECW for months). ECW also claimed TNN wanted
to water down ECW's racy and violent storylines and the writing was
on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite these problems, ECW is putting together a pretty
interesting pay-per-view for July. ``Heatwave'' (July 16th) will be
headlined by Justin Credible defending the ECW Title against Tommy
Dreamer in a Stairway to Hell match. Also ECW Television Champion,
Rhino takes on the Sandman and Steve Corino meets Jerry Lynn. ECW
is also hopeful of getting former WCW cruiserweight champion,
Psychosis, signed for the show. His contract with WCW expires this
week and he would jump into a program with Super Crazy if he joins
ECW.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Monday will mark an historic occasion in professional
wrestling history _ maybe. It will be WWF's ``Raw is War''
record-setting 84th consecutive television ratings victory over
WCW's ``Nitro.'' Now we say maybe because the 10th will be the day
after ``Bash at the Beach'' pay-per-view and the introduction of
the new Sting gimmick, the return of Vince Russo and possibly the
reforming of the NWO could all come down. That might give WCW the
push to at least close the gap, but a ratings victory would be
nothing short of a miracle.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In his new job-hunting book, ``Games Companies
Play,'' Dr. Pierre Mornell has a great anecdote about the person
Sherlock Holmes was based on: Joseph Bell, an internist who taught
Arthur Conan Doyle at Edinburgh Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``A master of observation and deduction,'' Mornell writes, ``Dr.
Bell would dip a finger into a foul-smelling liquid and then put
his finger into his mouth in class, and he would instruct his
students to do the same.

   ``As the students grimaced, Dr. Bell would point out that while
he had placed his index finger into the awful brew, it was his
middle finger that found its way to his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Mornell, a psychiatrist, writes that the power of observation
can be crucial for job hunters as they decide whether a company
would be a good fit for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the organization's parking lot, if it has one,'' he
writes. ``Are there reserved executive parking spaces? Is the lot
filled with Fords or BMWs? Are they clean or dirty? With bumper
stickers or without?
</P>
<P>
   ``And if the cars have bumper stickers, do they say `Question
Authority' or `Support Your Troops Abroad'? These details can tell
you a lot about the organization you're dealing with, or what kind
of people visit the place.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just job hunters who need to be observant, of course.
People often say they got laid off ``out of the blue.'' Well, no.
They usually got laid off out of the red, as in red ink. Their
company was bleeding it.
</P>
<P>
   About the only time a layoff could really come out of the blue
is if you work for a small business and the owner suddenly dies.
Otherwise, the signs are there. If you got laid off and really
think it came from nowhere, think back. You probably either missed
something or were in denial.
</P>
<P>
   In the immortal words of workplace role model Homer Simpson,
``D'oh!''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you're a talented worker who got laid off. Which
companies would you most like to work for? What can you learn about
those companies that you don't already know?
</P>
<P>
   Like Holmes, you can gather clues long before the formal
interview. Do you know anyone at your target company? Can an ally
introduce you to someone? Find out as much as you can about what
it's like to work there, both its good points and bad points.
</P>
<P>
   Research the company thoroughly. What does its Web site tell
you? For large companies, you might get useful information at
www.hoovers.com, www.freeedgar.com, vault.com and wetfeet.com.
Investment sites can let you find out what stock analysts say about
its future.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a start-up, check into the backgrounds of its founders.
Did it get funding from a prestigious venture capital firm, or did
Uncle Vinny take out a second mortgage on his home in Turlock?
</P>
<P>
   (This is assuming you've saved up some money and don't have to
leap at the first job offered. If you're down to your last dollar,
you'd settle for a company that sacrifices virgins and worships
Kathie Lee Gifford.)
</P>
<P>
   One big mistake is to send out resumes to every company
imaginable, not bothering to personalize them or research the
company. You'll get a better response from 10 focused cover letters
than from 100 that begin, ``To whom it may concern.''
</P>
<P>
   All the research not only helps you avoid companies that don't
suit you, it makes you stronger when you do eventually interview.
You'll know about the company's strengths and weaknesses, and how
your skills will help. That will allow you to ask intelligent
questions and avoid the meaningless chitchat that's involved in
many interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When you visit the company, observe everything you can, from the
parking lot that Mornell mentions to the way people interact to the
style of the office. Does your prospective boss seem organized or
overwhelmed? Are workers in a cubicle farm or a more open setting?
Do the telephones have dials on them?
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Hound of the Baskervilles,'' the crucial clue for
Holmes was that a dog did not bark. At your prospective company,
are there any dogs that aren't barking? What ought to be in the
picture, but isn't?
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing remarkable about all the work spaces looking the
same, for example, except it could mean that the company
discourages people from putting up family photos. Or it expects you
to sacrifice your individuality.
</P>
<P>
   Before you accept any offer, do whatever you can to talk with
someone who will be blunt. Snow jobs are not limited to ski
resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get a job, don't suddenly let those powers of
observation go to waste. Check to see what stock analysts are
saying about your company or industry. If competitors are laying
people off, is it because your company is getting stronger or your
industry is getting weaker? Do people in your network see things in
the industry that you don't?
</P>
<P>
   What kind of people are getting promoted at your company? Are
they all white and over 50? Are the new hires all under 30? Does
frankness get rewarded or punished? Is everyone's workweek five
hours longer this year than last year? Have vacations been put on
hold? When's the last time you got a raise?
</P>
<P>
   Again, don't forget about the dog that isn't barking. When
people leave, are the positions left vacant? Are bonuses a thing of
the past? Has your elaborate Friday lunch turned into coffee and
doughnuts?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can ignore everything and go along your merry
way. The industry can decline and others can be laid off, but you
can still pretend nothing is wrong. At least until the pink slip
has your name on it _ or the company crumbles.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us back to ``d'oh!''

SENIORS NOT SOLD ON SOCIAL SECURITY CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. _ Rose knows Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   So do Harvey, Lou, Lenny and Jack. At the Century Village
condominiums, where the average age is 75, most residents are
experts on the federal retirement benefits they have received for
years.
</P>
<P>
   That makes them a tough sell for Texas Governor George W. Bush
and Vice President Al Gore, as the two continue to tangle over how
best to structure Social Security. These are the voters who may
well determine the outcome of the presidential campaign in Florida,
a key state in the quest for electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   And they are very listening closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue around here is Social Security. . . . It's been
a boon for us,'' said Amadeo Trinchitella, 82, a city commissioner
who is legendary for getting the condo residents to the polls, no
matter their age or disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't think,'' he added of Gore and Bush, ``either one
of them is on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of tough-minded political focus, rooted in the
well-guarded self-interest of a huge constituent group, usually
leads presidential candidates to shun talk of changes in the
nation's most revered entitlement program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security is either a magic bullet or a coffin nail for
candidates over time,'' said Marilyn Roberts, a specialist on
political communication at the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1992 Democratic primary here, Bill Clinton blew Paul
Tsongas's candidacy apart by accusing the former senator from
Massachusetts of planning to cut Social Security benefits. And in
1982, congressional Democrats used Ronald Reagan's 1981 budget
plan, with its proposed Social Security cuts, as a wedge to help
win back 26 seats in the House. Most politicians since have
confined themselves to declaring their undying devotion to the
program.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, both Bush and Gore have taken the plunge as
Social Security trustees predict that there is only enough money to
keep the system going until 2037. At that point, incoming payroll
tax revenue will cover just 72 percent of the benefits promised
under law, a recipe for collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he wants to preserve Social Security by allowing
younger workers to keep a percentage of their payroll taxes and
invest them in the stock market. He says they can get a greater
rate of return, though he does not promise to guarantee benefits if
the market drops. Bush has not specified what percentage of payroll
taxes he would divert to private investment accounts, nor how he
would finance the transition to the new system.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, would leave Social Security benefits as
is, shoring up the system with money from the budget surplus. In
addition, he would create a new program in which the government
matches savings set aside by workers in accounts that could be
invested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate has gone near the third-rail in the Social
Security debate: Raising the retirement age for full benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At this sprawling retirement community, with the standard issue
18-hole golf course and a dozen swimming pools, there are 16,000
residents, eight voting precincts and plenty of time for talk.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the air conditioned Century Village offices, there are
heated denunciations of Bush's plan to allow people to invest a
percentage of their payroll taxes in the stock market. And a
discussion of Gore's plan turns into a confused shouting match that
could have come straight out of an episode of ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Arkush, a former hospital administrator from Cincinnati,
disapproves of Bush letting people invest money that currently goes
to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average person does not know anything about the market,''
she says firmly. Not that Rose and her husband, Lou Arkush,
consider themselves average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're almost millionaires, but we're not there yet,'' she said
of their financial portfolio. ``We did well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou Arkush, Rose's husband and a former sales representative for
Max Factor, said that unlike most people, he and his wife read
company reports from cover to cover before making an investment.
</P>
<P>
   He says he agrees with Bush that the rate of return on payroll
taxes for Social Security is terrible compared to the history of
the stock market over the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he warns, ``We may be going into another 1929.''
</P>
<P>
   Having lived through the Great Depression and the stock market
crash of '29, most seniors here are horrified at the thought of
risking money that was meant as a safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is a crapshoot,'' says Lenny Mitchenkoff, a
retired construction supervisor from New York. ``Social Security
shouldn't be invested in anything that can go down. I think that's
the worst thing that can happen in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kessler, an electrician from New Jersey, agrees: ``I don't
believe in gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Bernstein says he got out of the stock market at the
beginning of the year, avoiding losses of about $500,000, he
estimates. His cousin, he said, lost $2 million as the high-tech
boom tanked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe investing in the stock market is inherently
dangerous,'' said Bernstein, owner of a community newspaper in
Rockaway, N.Y. ``We don't need our Social Security money to do it,
we'll take our own money.''
</P>
<P>
   Such caution about investment risks sounds like an echo of Gore,
who has ripped the Bush plan as risky and irresponsible. But
seniors here are wary of Gore, too. When the conversation turns to
the vice president's Social Security proposal, a shouting match
erupts between Mitchenkoff and Jack Miller, a foreign language
teacher from Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Miller tried to explain that Gore would keep the same Social
Security system, while allowing people to invest in the stock
market from a separate account.
</P>
<P>
   At the words `stock market,' Mitchenkoff exclaims sharply:
``Gore wouldn't do that! He wouldn't have anything to do with the
stock market!''
</P>
<P>
   Miller accuses Mitchenkoff of not reading the newspaper lately,
which Mitchenkoff angrily denies. Like the former schoolteacher
that he is, Miller pleads with him to settle down. ``Will you
listen, please?''
</P>
<P>
   These are the people whom Gore is counting on to win Florida the
way President Clinton did in 1996, running against Bob Dole. This
time, however, the popular Florida governor is the brother of the
Republican nominee, and recent polls show the vice president
trailing Bush by two to seven points.
</P>
<P>
   In the political calculus of the Sunshine State, Gore needs the
big numbers of South Florida Democrats to offset the more
conservative Democrats and Republicans of the north who are likely
to side with Bush. Gore also needs to win over the seniors who vote
in large numbers, compared to the younger people who generally do
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do well with the seniors, you're going to do very, very
well in the state of Florida,'' said Bob Butterworth, the attorney
general who is chairing Gore's campaign here. The condo complexes,
largely populated by emigres from the Northeast, he said, are
``organized by building and organized by floor. If you haven't
voted by two in the afternoon, you get a knock on your door.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush, said most Americans,
including Floridians, don't believe that Social Security will be
there for them when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Governor Bush understands and why his proposal is
becoming attractive, is by giving them the chance to build wealth
over a long period of time with market investments, we will have a
solution to the long-term solvency of Social Security,'' Bartlett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Arkush acknowledges that there are problems with Social
Security, as Bush says. But she is willing to consider an even more
radical remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't need Social Security and shouldn't get it,''
she says. ``And others need more.''

SOME PEOPLE USE MAPS, SOME PREFER VERBAL DIRECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Blanchette describes himself as a ``map guy,'' someone who
prefers visual images to written directions when getting to a new
place. The 38-year-old carpet installer said, since he started
driving, ``maps always work for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But a recent study shows that a person's preference for visual
images, as opposed to verbal instructions, isn't entirely a matter
of free will.
</P>
<P>
   Each person's brain, they say, knows its neurological strengths
and weaknesses, and directs each person toward the method that
gives the most neurological bang for the buck. In Blanchette's
case, the part of his brain that processes visual information
probably works quickly like a high-speed computer, while the verbal
area may lag behind with slow transmission rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a matter of taste, it's a matter of mental
efficiency,'' said Marcel Just, codirector of the Center for
Cognitive Brain Imaging at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, and an author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Just's study, which appeared this month in Cognitive Psychology,
gives further insight into the ongoing effort to determine just how
people use their brains to solve problems from simple tasks to
complex reasoning. It has implications for brain-injured patients
as well as ordinary people looking for different or better pathways
for learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study shows that, even in solving a simple problem,
there's more than one way,'' said Jordan Grafman, chief of the
cognitive neuroscience section at the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the study's results involving brain scans of 12
college students also happen to reinforce the conventional wisdom
that men tend to think more spatially, while women tend to think
more verbally, though Just emphasized that the number of subjects
is too small to consider this a significant finding.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the major findings of the study is that regions
of the brain in charge of visual and verbal processing get better
at their respective jobs the more they are used. Even in the
neurological world, it seems, success breeds success, and the brain
sends work to those cells that do the job most easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like your brain gets a favorite chair and heads for it
each time,'' said the psychology professor.
</P>
<P>
   The ``chair'' in these cases are parts of the brain that happen
to be on the left side. Brain scans showed the Broca's area,
located roughly behind the left temple, of participants lit up with
activity when they were engaged in verbal thinking. The superior
parietal cortex, located in the left rear of the head where a
woman's headband would rest, was lit up with blood activity when a
spatial and visual imagery was used.
</P>
<P>
   So a person assembling a toy scooter or a bookshelf would have
an activated Broca's area if relying on the manual's written
instruction, or an activated superior parietal cortex if depending
on the manual's schematic drawings.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, participants were asked to answer about 50
true-false questions, such as whether a star sign was above the
plus sign. In the ``verbal'' method, they were asked to read and
think about the sentence only, then see a picture and answer the
true-false question. In the ``visual'' method, they were asked to
read the sentence, visualize the image depicted by it, look at a
picture, then answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also assessed each student on whether he or she was
inherently better at verbal or visual strategies. They found that
students who were verbally adept, for instance, could employ their
Broca's area with minimal blood flow and still get the right
answer, whereas the low-verbal students required much more intense
blood flow to that region to get the answer.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear just how brain areas look differently when they are
utilized more, perhaps getting bigger in some cases, or just more
internally rich with new cells and neural connections.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, scientists recently found that 16 London taxicab
drivers developed a larger hippocampus _ the area responsible for
storing mental maps of places and is roughly located between our
ears _ after being on the job for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Studies last year on the preserved brain of legendary physicist
Albert Einstein found that his parietal lobe was larger than
normal, though the overall size and weight of his brain was not out
of the ordinary. Still, the parietal lobe is the area responsible
for, among other things, spatial and visual imagery and some
scientists have speculated that Einstein's large endowment
contributed to his genius.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say it remains unclear whether people have in-born
predisposition to visual thinking, for instance, rather than
verbal. Federal scientist Grafman said there's a theory that the
male tendency to think more spatially _ they have been shown to be
better at keeping track of east-west-north-south directions even
with map rotations _ may have to do with their history as the
society's explorers and hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no question among scientists that upbringing and
culture plays a major role in developing different regions. Just
said the American education system has a history of rewarding
verbal thinking at the expense of visual processing.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to getting around, officials at electronic mapping
Web sites, as well as motor clubs, say most people prefer maps to
written directions, perhaps wanting the opportunity to plot their
own path to get some place, rather than accept a computer-generated
route.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, spokesman for the Automobile Association of America,
said another popular method of getting directions is a combination
of verbal and visual, that is, directions delivered with visual
landmarks. Many drivers, including a woman who has been driving for
the US Postal Service for 13 years, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like both maps and written directions, but I want landmarks
more than anything else,'' Veronica Bertrand, 42, said while on her
route in Boston last week. ``Just tell me to go up Commonwealth
Avenue and turn right at the Star Market. Then I'll get there.''

TREE FALLING IN A FOREST DOES MAKE A SOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When a tree falls and there's no one there to hear it, does
it make a sound? J.C., Charlestown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. In a word, yes.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of authors of popular science books that would
have you believe that a person has to look at something before it
becomes real and that somehow this comes from ideas of modern
physics such as quantum mechanics. This is actually, in most cases,
complete rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of an objective reality, quite independent and uncaring
of whether people look at it or not, is extremely well-supported by
experiments, and even the notion of ``the world being changed by
being observed'' in quantum mechanics doesn't really need humans to
do the observing.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, there is still discussion about what exactly
constitutes an observation, but let's be pragmatic. Suppose one
took a tape recorder into a forest and placed a small but powerful
explosive charge at the base of a tree with a timer to set it off
in five minutes. Ten minutes later, when the tree has fallen, the
tape would contain a ``bang!'' followed by a crashing sound _ the
sound of a tree falling in a forest when nobody's there to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I suppose one could argue that sound is actually the
translation of vibrations by the ear, or a microphone, and, unless
there is a translation device, there is no sound. But the
vibrations would still exist and they would be felt by the other
trees, even if they wouldn't exactly ``hear'' it in the
conventional sense.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophers have written about this at length, but experiment
must always be the final arbiter.

ARMS DEBATE HEATS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine -- They waited for high tide Sunday to loose the
newest destroyer down the greased ways at Bath Iron Works, the USS
McCampbell, named after a World War II Navy pilot who shot down 34
Japanese fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
   Only three other American pilots ever shot down more of the
enemy, but Captain David McCampbell, the Navy's ``Ace of Aces,''
was the only one to survive the war. His memory and pluck were
cited repeatedly in the speechmaking at the Bath Iron Works
shipyard launching.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians and bureaucrats gathered round as Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright cracked the champagne bottle across the
bow, and thousands cheered as the state-of-the-art warship, the
20th Arleigh Burke-class Aegis destroyer fabricated in Bath,
slipped neatly into the Kennebec River.
</P>
<P>
   You get a lot for your $900 million, if you are an American
taxpayer. You get a space-age vessel chock full of missiles and
computers, capable to fighting off enemy aircraft, enemy missiles,
enemy ships, enemy submarines, and, with a wrinkle John Paul Jones
could never have imagined, an enemy chemical warfare attack.
</P>
<P>
   And the computer gear enables the McCampbell to provide what
madame secretary called ``capabilities never before seen, providing
area missile defense for our forces and friends.'' When Lieutenant
McCampbell landed his prop-driven Hellcat fighter on the USS Essex
after the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944, he had shot down nine enemy
planes, the all-time US air combat record.
</P>
<P>
   That is a remarkable achievement, likely never to be duplicated
by another US flier except in a computer-enhanced Hollywood
shoot-'em-up. But the amount of firepower in the hands of the
skipper of this newest Aegis destroyer and the 19 others like it is
vastly more sophisticated than anything available in McCampbell's
day.
</P>
<P>
   When the shipbuilders of Maine were first tasked with furnishing
floating firepower for the fledgling US Navy, they worked with wood
and canvas and tar, and Americans felt we didn't need much of a
fighting force because a wide and hostile ocean stood between them
and Europe's warring legions.
</P>
<P>
   The day World War II broke out, the American army consisted of
160,000 officers and men, all told. Ours was the world's 17th
largest army, trailing that of Romania's. But in the six decades
since then, the United States has gone the other way, building up
the most expensive and powerful, if not the largest in terms of
numbers, military establishment on earth.
</P>
<P>
   This comes at a vast cost. And every four years during
presidential election campaigns we have a debate about how much
more or less we should be spending. Such a debate is lurching along
right now. Albright issued the ritual
we-cannot-let-our-guard-down-just-because-we're-on-top speech.
``Nothing could be more foolish or dangerous,'' she said, ``for the
world is smaller now than it has ever been, and crises develop more
rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   So we constantly replenish our armory with ever-more-pricey
weaponry. The mother of all budget battles looms with the GOP's
traditional war cry, demanding more missile defense than we have
now, or that the Democrats think prudent or even workable. Surveys
show that most Americans do not know or care that there is no
effective defense against an enemy long-range missile attack with
nuclear-tipped warheads.
</P>
<P>
   For the last half of the 20th century, stability was imposed by
the doctrine of mutually assured destruction, but beginning in the
Reagan era, the notion of a ``star wars'' missile umbrella ignited
a spending boom on missile research. The June 30 New York Times
carried a detailed exposition by reporter William J. Broad of the
Clinton administration's scheme to parry the GOP rhetoric. It
detailed the facts of life ``star wars'' proponents ignore: even
the most sophisticated computer-laser-satellite-interceptor array
can be easily overcome by use of dummy warheads, Mylar balloons,
and other off-the-shelf technology.
</P>
<P>
   With all the tools in the terrorist toolbox, a huge outlay of
taxpayer cash on fanciful missile technology seems foolish on its
face. The vulnerability of our cities and subways to chemical and
biological terrorism is apparent and chilling and ominous. There is
still no star wars wrinkle that can prevent a fishing boat or a
pickup truck or a posse of 20 hikers with knapsacks from lugging in
an atomic weapon and erecting it somewhere around the Empire State
Building or the US Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Broad's survey of the missile defenders' art ended with a glum
recitation of the fate of Safeguard, the only defense the United
States actually erected against long-range missiles. It cost $25
billion and the guts of it sat in North Dakota in missile silos.
Once it was switched on, in 1975 under President Ford, it stayed
switched on for only 133 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon decided that the Russians could easily overcome
Safeguard with multiple-warhead missiles, and scrapped it.
Safeguard is still buried out in North Dakota, rusting away. It
cost us taxpayers, if I get my zeroes right, $188 million a day for
each of those 133 days, before it was junked. At some point, we
have to say enough is enough.

A STAR-SPANGLED CITY PROVES AN EXCELLENT VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It had been too long since my wife and I had been
back to this city that is a beguiling blend of so many things:
hallowed sites and funky shops, open parkland and bustling streets,
society nabobs and street people, sports and culture, fine dining
and fattening fast food.
</P>
<P>
   Weekender
</P>
<P>
   What better time to reacquaint ourselves after an absence of a
dozen years than a sunny weekend when a major event _ the NCAA
Women's Final Four basketball championship _ was enlivening an
already lively city? And what better way to spend our first
afternoon than getting a quick overview of the city, beginning at
one of America's most cherished symbols, the Liberty Bell?
</P>
<P>
   There it stood in the glass pavilion where it has been housed
since the bicentennial year of 1976, too fragile to ever be rung.
Hordes of schoolchildren and other sightseers surrounded it, their
chatter competing with the talk a National Park guide was giving. I
came away with two facts I hadn't known or noticed before: The name
Liberty Bell wasn't generally used until the 1830s, and
``Pennsylvania'' is misspelled on the bell as ``Pensylvania.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was trolley time. The Philadelphia Trolley Works
conducts a 90-minute, hop-on-and-hop-off, tour of the city plus a
40-minute excursion through 8,900-acre Fairmount Park.
Sophisticated it may not be, but it was a grand way to refresh our
memories. The tours are fully narrated, but I have learned not to
take as absolute fact every statistic that trolley guides in any
city reel off _ sometimes they even contradict one another.
</P>
<P>
   What I relish, though, are the occasional anecdotes, such as the
one about how many years ago the city fathers needed to construct a
statue of George Washington in a hurry. So they lopped off the head
of a statue of Frederick the Great on horseback and grafted on
George's head. I also chuckled upon learning that the statue of
Joan of Arc on horseback is known locally as Joanie on a Pony.
</P>
<P>
   The sights were the important thing, and there were so many:
elegant, red-brick Society Hill and tiny Elfreth's Alley, the
oldest residential street in the nation; Logan Circle, with its
fountains and greenery; Fairmount Park, home of the Philadelphia
Zoo and of historic homes open for tours (and of far less litter
than I remembered from our previous visit); and Penn's Landing, the
waterfront park where festivals are held all summer.
</P>
<P>
   And there's sculpture everywhere, some of it thanks to
Philadelphia's widely copied ordinance requiring that 1 percent of
the cost of a building must be dedicated to art. In Philadelphia,
you run across sculpture ranging from Claes Oldenburg's
``Clothespin'' at Center Square to the famous LOVE sculpture (with
an out-of-sync ``O'' because artist Robert Indiana knew love was
never perfect) at 15th Street and Kennedy Boulevard on John F.
Kennedy Plaza, to a statue of ``The Thinker'' in front of the Rodin
Museum to a likeness of the late, controversial mayor Frank Rizzo
on the North Side of City Hall. We were also struck by the number
of murals, ranging from floral scenes to a giant drawing of Patti
Labelle, one of many famous singers with Philadelphia roots.
</P>
<P>
   What's nice about such a tour is that you can pick out the
places you want to return to on your own. The only problem is that
in Philadelphia there are too many places to hit in a weekend or
even many weekends. But we vowed to do as much as we could,
beginning with a post-tour stroll through the bustling downtown, en
route to our hotel, a Courtyard by Marriott at the site of the old
City Hall Annex. Progress was slow not only because of the crowds
but because my wife, Linda, unwittingly wore a coat of orange _ the
color of the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers, who were
playing in the Final Four that night (and who would win their
semifinal game, only to be defeated by the University of
Connecticut for the championship). Fans kept asking her if she was
from Tennessee; a TV reporter even tried to interview her. Back at
the hotel, she shed the orange coat for the rest of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   (The Final Four, and all the buzz and bucks it brought, was a
feather in the cap of this Yankee Doodle city. The First Union
Center, where the games were played, sold all of its 20,000 seats _
and probably could have sold 40,000, which says something about the
rise of women's sports. Another plus for the city will be the
Republican National Convention July 31-Aug. 3.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia means history, so we started the next morning by
joining in a condensed version of a walk conducted by a young
history scholar from the University of Pennsylvania whose facts we
could trust absolutely. Christopher Klemek of Poor Richard's
Walking Tours, noting that Philadelphia is an ``outdoor history
book,'' led us to or by the sites, including, of course, Carpenters
Hall, Independence Hall, and the Franklin Court complex, outlining
the story of the events that took place here, stressing William
Penn's invaluable contribution to America, and noting that if
statesman-inventor-social planner Benjamin Franklin had done
nothing more than written his treatise on electricity, his place
among American greats would have been assured. We did take mild
umbrage, though, at his putting down Boston's role in Revolutionary
history (``What did they really have? A riot and a tea party'').
Even so, it's a tour through the centuries that we recommend
highly.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia means food, too. After the walk we headed for one
of my favorite places, Reading Terminal Market. This century-old
indoor farmers' market is crammed with no-pretense shops and stalls
offering everything from quick eats to exotic groceries (shark,
sometimes) to flowers to elaborate pastries to used paperbacks. The
lines appeared to be longest at those places offering
Philadelphia's famous fast-food favorites, cheese steaks and
hoagies (submarine sandwiches). We ended up with Chinese food.
</P>
<P>
   There were two other memorable dining experiences during our
weekend, both different from the market and from each other. The
City Tavern, in the heart of the historic area, is a direct
descendant of the one built in 1773 and accordingly serves colonial
dishes such as West Indies peppered soup and turkey pot pie,
delivered by a costumed waitstaff.
</P>
<P>
   I learned a couple of things about taverns. As proprietor and
cookbook author Walter Staib will tell you, because of the West
Indies trade, Philadelphia's meals were a lot tastier than
Boston's. What's more, I came to think of taverns as the Internet
of colonial times, complete with ``You've got mail.'' The taverns _
and the term encompassed inns and other public gathering spots _
were places to hear news, pick up mail, and even do banking.
</P>
<P>
   From the old to the new: We also dined at one of the city's
trendy spots: The Fork. Located in a historic building and filled
with artwork and unusual furniture, Fork has a dining room that
seats just 48. So make reservations. The seasonal menu included
roasted Chilean sea bass (my choice), Greek marinated lamb chops
(my wife's choice), romaine with roasted garlic honey dressing, and
warm chevre wrapped in prosciuto. This is one ``in'' restaurant
that didn't disappoint us.
</P>
<P>
   (Among the dozens of other eating spots that Philadelphians
recommend are the Fishmarket, Old Original Bookbinder's, Le Bec
Fin, the Commissary, the Knave of Hearts, Guru, Ristorante
Panorama, Kansas City Prime, Roller's, Chart House, Katmandu, China
Village, Joseph Poon Asian Fusion, Ralph's, Christian's, Pat's King
of Steak's, Geno's Steaks, A Brave New World, Plough &AMP; the Stars,
and Pasion!. And, perhaps inevitably, there is now a Hard Rock
Cafe.)
</P>
<P>
   Food for the soul is easily obtainable in the city, too, perhaps
nowhere more so than at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which often
has special exhibits such as the recently concluded ``The Splendor
of 18th-Century Rome.'' The current exhibit, which runs through
Oct. 29, is ``The Arts of Hon'ami Koetsu, Japanese Renaissance
Master.''
</P>
<P>
   But you need no special exhibit to enjoy this museum, with its
thousands of works of art from nearly all schools and periods.
There are tapestries by Rubens, paintings by Manet, Cezanne,
Renoir, and Picasso _ and pop art, too. One thing you shouldn't
look for there, though, is the statue of Rocky, shown in one of the
Sylvester Stallone movies. That's been moved to the city's sports
complex.
</P>
<P>
   One other museum we dared not miss was the Franklin Institute
Science Museum, a landmark with four floors of interactive
exhibits. It's famous for its walk-through beating heart, which now
has a big brain as a companion. There are exhibits on aviation,
electricity (how could there not be?), computers, and
communications, where I proudly posed for a picture beside a 1930s'
console radio. There was a closed-circuit television, too, but I
quickly moved away from it because a ceiling camera was showing a
picture of my bald spot.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was for strolling. We had done a lot in a short time and
now it was time to decompress with a long walk. We peeked in the
doorway of the US Mint, which was closed (just as well; they
probably don't give free samples anyway). We walked through the
Bourse, a shopping center with a smattering of fast-food places and
souvenir shops. (For dedicated shoppers, Philadelphians recommend,
among others, Lord &AMP; Taylor in the historic Wanamaker building, the
Gallery at Market East, the Shops at Liberty Place, and the Shops
on Walnut Street.)
</P>
<P>
   We continued to South Street, the place where all the hippies
meet, according to an old song by the Orlons. Nowadays, the hip and
the square seem to enjoy this funky thoroughfare with its thrift
shops, restaurants, music stores, and craft and specialty shops.
Commercial giants know a good thing when they see it because in
addition to all the independent little places, companies like the
Gap and McDonald's have made their appearance _ something that
diminished the atmosphere a bit.
</P>
<P>
   We headed back via Spruce Street, with its charming red-brick
rowhouses, and window-shopped on Pine Street, which is filled with
antiques stores. At one spot, I ogled a stack of Sinatra 78-rpm
records and decided it was too bad that the Chairman of the Board
recorded songs about Chicago and New York but never Philadelphia.
There certainly is a lot worth singing about.

 &HT;    WRESTLING GRAPEVINE: News, notes from the industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Viacom/CBS to give Extreme Championship
Wrestling the boot from The Nashville Network once the World
Wrestling Federation's suit with USA Networks concluded. On
Thursday, came this press release:
</P>
<P>
   ``TNN notified ECW today that, per the terms of their agreement,
the network would be terminating the telecasts of ECW on TNN, with
its last telecast on September 22. ECW was not doing as well as
expected. We appreciate the efforts ECW and Paul Heyman have made
to bring wrestling fans to TNN.''
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by ECW lead counsel Stephen Stern's response
on ecwwrestling.com:
</P>
<P>
   ``As counsel for ECW, we have been trying to meet with TNN for
months. Our efforts to meet with TNN have fallen on deaf ears and
been ignored. Based upon what has now become publicized fact
regarding the WWF's negotiations with CBS/VIACOM/TNN, we now begin
to understand, in our opinion, why meetings were not held. ECW
feels that TNN may not have been completely forthright in its
dealings with ECW given their relationship and ECW is disappointed
by the most recent actions of TNN to cancel its agreement with ECW.
``
</P>
<P>
   The harsh words end a relationship that seemed doomed from the
start. The combining of the most violent professional wrestling
group in the United States and a station that lives on ``The Dukes
of Hazzard'' and ``Dallas'' reruns was never going to be a perfect
match. Add to that, months of complaining from ECW that it was
getting no promotional help from TNN (despite being the top rated
show on TNN, one cannot find barely a mention of ECW on the TNN
Website _ country.com. And that mention refers to wrestlers who
have not been in the ECW for months). ECW also claimed TNN wanted
to water down ECW's racy and violent storylines and the writing was
on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite these problems, ECW is putting together a pretty
interesting pay-per-view for July. ``Heatwave'' (July 16th) will be
headlined by Justin Credible defending the ECW Title against Tommy
Dreamer in a Stairway to Hell match. Also ECW Television Champion,
Rhino takes on the Sandman and Steve Corino meets Jerry Lynn. ECW
is also hopeful of getting former WCW cruiserweight champion,
Psychosis, signed for the show. His contract with WCW expires this
week and he would jump into a program with Super Crazy if he joins
ECW.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Monday will mark an historic occasion in professional
wrestling history _ maybe. It will be WWF's ``Raw is War''
record-setting 84th consecutive television ratings victory over
WCW's ``Nitro.'' Now we say maybe because the 10th will be the day
after ``Bash at the Beach'' pay-per-view and the introduction of
the new Sting gimmick, the return of Vince Russo and possibly the
reforming of the NWO could all come down. That might give WCW the
push to at least close the gap, but a ratings victory would be
nothing short of a miracle.

ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN LEADERS TO MEET IN U.S. NEXT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton announced Wednesday that Israeli and
Palestinian leaders will meet next week at Camp David to try to
thrash out the framework of a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have concluded that this is the best way _ indeed, it is the
only way _ to move forward,'' Clinton said, though he acknowledged
that success was not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The open-ended summit meeting between Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, will be held
at the presidential retreat in Maryland beginning on July 11. That
is just two months before the Sept. 13 deadline that both leaders
had set to conclude peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have threatened to unilaterally declare an
independent state if the agreement is not reached by the September
date.
</P>
<P>
   Camp David has particular significance because the outline of
the 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt was achieved in a
similar summit meeting presided over by President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described Camp David as ``a place where a milestone for
Middle East peace was reached.'' He added, ``I hope we'll all be
inspired by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited the
Middle East in an effort to bring the two leaders closer together
in preparation for a summit meeting. She implied last Friday after
her return that the time was not right for such a meeting, and said
that there was ``plenty of time to do what needs to be done''
before the Clinton administration ends next January.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said Wednesday that ``to delay this gathering, to
remain stalled is simply no longer an option. The
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as all of us have seen, knows no
status quo. It can move forward toward real peace or it can slide
back into real turmoil. It will not stand still.''
</P>
<P>
   The president continued, ``If the parties do not seize this
moment, if they cannot make progress now, there will be more
hostility and more bitterness, and perhaps even more violence, and
to what end?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed that there was ``no guarantee of success,'' but
said the lower-level negotiators had reached an impasse. ``Movement
now depends on historic decisions that only the leaders can make,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he planned to participate in the talks. ``I
will give it whatever time is required, as long as we're still
moving forward,'' he said. ``I will spend as much time up there as
I need to spend.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficult core issues to be resolved include the future of
Jerusalem, the borders of a Palestinian entity and the fate of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barak, who marks his first year as prime minister on Friday, has
tried to simultaneously conduct separate peace negotiations with
Syria and the Palestinians, but so far without success. Barak, who
was in London Wednesday to meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair,
needs the diplomatic success to help bolster his fragile
parliamentary coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said it wants the summit meeting, but the
Palestinians had said until now that the gap between the two sides
has not been narrowed sufficiently to ensure a successful meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has already gotten the go-ahead from the Palestinian
authority's legislature to declare independence if the September
deadline passes without a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, referring to Barak and Arafat, said Wednesday, ``I
think that neither of them want us to go by September without a
resolution to this.''

BIRDS, BEASTS, AND PHIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEWA DOWNS, Kenya _ Ain't love grand. Or maybe grandstanding in
the case of a nose-heavy bird called the redbilled hornbill, a
take-out messenger on a mission of nutrition to his lady love.
</P>
<P>
   ``There he goes with lunch in his crop,'' says Phil West.
``He'll fly to the nest and regurgitate it into his mate's mouth.
Is that personalized room service or what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hornbill-and-coo, huh? Dancing beak-to-beak. Romantic, I
guess,'' says my friend, Aurelio, looking my way. ``But please
don't try it on me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't fly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Avian chivalry,'' says Phil. A young African hand
extraordinary in his knowledge of the bush, its flora and fauna, he
ranges in expertise from such as ants to elephants, termites to
giraffes, purple-flowering hypoestes plants to Sodom apples,
ostriches to graceful bateleur eagles. ``They got their name from
the French, `bateleur' _ tightrope walker _ for their gentle
wing-flapping way of maintaining balance.''
</P>
<P>
   At 24, a trained naturalist, he's the lead guide at Lewa Downs,
an extremely attractive and comfortable lodge in the Kenyan
Highlands. Once a cattle ranch, the Downs, a 45,000-acre spread of
varying, sometimes rugged terrain, is operated by the congenial
wife-husband team, Emma and Will Craig, and turned over to the
conservation of the fascinating wildlife. It is devoted not only to
animals but the exceptional care and feeding of about 20 human
guests in well-appointed stone-and-thatched cottages with
four-poster beds at the edge of the lush Isiolo Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The animals can care for and feed themselves as long as they're
not hunted down. Hunting has been outlawed in Kenya for almost a
quarter-century. Conservation is the cry, supported by President
Daniel Arap Moi, who appears to realize the priceless and
perishable nature of these wondrous creatures, as well as their
celebrity as drawing cards for tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hunting ban, Phil carries a gun, a powerful .458
Winchester rifle, for protective support when walking the wilds
beyond lodge confines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't shot anything during my tenure. That would be awful
to have to do. But a rhino that came very close had me sweating.
They're quick, erratic, and have lousy eyesight, so you have to be
ready for anything they might unwittingly do.'' Rhinos, ugly
creatures needing glasses and face lifts, are nonetheless
intriguing. Decimated by poachers, who sought their prized horns
(ground into an expensive powder considered an aphrodisiac in the
Orient), they've made a strong comeback here because Lewa employs a
large security force to discourage the criminal marauders. Hanging
out and frequently seen are both the black and the uncommon white
variety. They all look black to me.
</P>
<P>
   But Phil explains that the white classification stems from the
Afrikaans word, ``weit'' _ wide. The whites do have wider heads and
are usually poking around the ground. ``They're grazers, eating
grass and low stuff. Blacks are browsers, preferring bushes and
leaves _ their haute cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, here's a dangerous crowd that won't be intimidated by a
gun,'' he smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there at your feet. Safari ants. Give them a little
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Streaming along like a crimson freeway, the tiny ants are off on
their own safari.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're vicious biters. If they get inside your clothes,
you'll perform the most vigorous striptease imaginable to find them
and get rid of them. No matter where you are. I've seen it happen
to somebody in a group. All inhibitions are canceled by safari
ants, and you tear off everything.''
</P>
<P>
   We give them room.
</P>
<P>
   A martial eagle with 8-foot wingspan _ ``the largest African
eagle'' _ glides overhead, casting a shadow. Nearer, a superb
starling, named for its brilliant blue feathering, flits among
termite mounds that impersonate rusty fire hydrants.
</P>
<P>
   Phil has been ``spishing,'' making a sort of hissing sound _
``psssshhh!'' _ that can attract curious birds. The superb starling
has shown up along with a red and yellow barbet, and a
slate-colored bou bou whose call sounds like tongue-clicking:
``Klook-klook!'' Also arriving are white-browed sparrow weavers, a
pearl-spotted owl, and a red-rumped swallow. ``That swallow can do
everything airborne _ eating, making love. Even sleeping in flight,
taking short snoozes.'' A small brown monkey, too, is lured by the
spish: a vervet, kind of a flasher showing off his blue privates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a raincoat,'' Aurelio advises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 417 different species of birds on the property. Oh,
look, that's a hammerkop,'' Phil indicates a large black bird with,
yes, a hammer-shaped head, presiding over a large nest. A
roominghouse, actually, since unrelated birds live there as well,
bringing bones, skulls, and other neat trash as rent payments.
``The hammerkop is called the witch doctor bird by some of the
locals, who believe it has magical powers. Put one of its feathers
over the door if you're expecting a baby, and that guarantees a
son.''
</P>
<P>
   A rare and very elusive black leopard has been reported in the
neighborhood for weeks, and Phil is eager to track it, encounter
and shoot it with a camera. He becomes more eager as Lucy Darch
appears on horseback, saying she's seen what she believes to be a
fresh track on a nearby dirt road. Lucy, a guide, leads bush rides
on the Downs' horses and camels.
</P>
<P>
   Tracks, of course, come in all shapes and sizes that
bush-literate Phil reads avidly. ``They're my daily newspaper. They
tell me what's going on around here. Elephant footprints are easy.
Big and deep. Seeing some he may pull out his tape measure,
pronouncing, ``Forty-three centimeters (17 inches) long. I'd say
it's a 21-year-old male.''
</P>
<P>
   The leopard's prints are subtle. ``It's light-footed, doesn't
leave much of an indentation. You look for what we call `shine.'
Just an indication.'' He's on his knees, poking around the road
where Lucy thinks she saw evidence. ``Good catch, Lucy.'' He's
found just a trace of a pad, the shine he can identify. Then more
of it as we cross grassland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cat's headed for that wood'' _ so we are, too, presently
confronting an electrified wire fence, a boundary of the Lewa
property, separating it from a thick forest. ``He slipped under the
lower strand. Are you up for it?''
</P>
<P>
   More like down for it, bellying beneath _ groan, groan _ and
then rock-to-rock jumping across a stream, and through a kite
spider's web as Phil picks up the track again. Above, somewhere in
the leafy canopy that dims the daylight, the residents of the
towering, thickly buttressed fig trees begin chattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vervet monkeys. They're warning the leopard.'' Thanks a lot,
guys. ``But he's probably watching us. This area abounds in hiding
places, and leopards are very shy and skittish. But very aware of
who's around.''
</P>
<P>
   The trail cools, vanishes, but the chase has been exhilarating.
``Once I become more familiar with his habits,'' says Phil, ``I'll
set up a trip wire and camera. I'll get his mug shot yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Send us a copy.''
</P>
<P>
   Retracing our steps, we reach the dusty road where I detect new
markings, feeling like Elmer Fudd pondering ``wabbit twacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, yes, well done,'' Phil compliments me. ``That's the famous
Goodyear impala.''

THE MAN WHO FIXES BRAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Again and again, Dr. Evan Snyder checks a big
nitrogen-cooled freezer in his lab at Children's Hospital, as
anxious about its smooth operation as he might be about an ailing
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've even driven halfway home, turned around and come back,''
he admits, just to make certain the unit is humming along as it
should, chilling its contents to exactly 220 degrees below zero,
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Call him obsessive. Snyder, laughing at himself, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   But keep in mind that the freezer contains the stuff of a
medical revolution in treating everything from Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's disease to strokes and spinal cord injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder lifted the freezer's lid recently to reveal hundreds of
small vials containing clumps of brain cells, frozen in suspended
animation. These are neural stem cells _ immature, generic brain
cells that can develop into any of the highly specialized cells
that make the brain work.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder was the first to isolate and grow these stem cells in the
lab about a decade ago, and, since then, he has rocketed to
prominence on the hope of using them to heal a wide range of
presently incurable brain disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time ever, the traditional view of the brain
as an organ where, after maturity, damaged or dead cells cannot be
replaced may be tottering. And the neural stem cells are acting as
the battering ram.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stem-cell biology is enormously exciting right now and holds
promise for really novel therapies _ not just symptomatic
therapies, but maybe cures,'' says Dr. Gerald Fischbach, director
of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is even bolder, predicting the first human trials of
stem-cell therapy may be only a year or two away, based on the
rapid progress in lab animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the decade is out,'' he said, ``there will be some
therapeutic benefits'' from treating disease with neural stem
cells. Parkinson's disease, caused by the death of brain cells in a
certain region, might be one of the first targets for stem-cell
treatment, he said; another is Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, because it kills so quickly and there's no
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   For the victims of incurable brain diseases and their loved
ones, Snyder is a beacon of hope, an optimist in the face of some
of the cruelest afflictions known to humanity. His optimism and
openness to new ways of conducting research has made him a magnet
for support and advocacy groups for diseases from
ataxia-telangietasia, or A-T, to the rare Canavan syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists like Evan Snyder are like first-round draft picks:
Every disease group wants to get their hands on someone like
this,'' said Brad Margus, founder of the Florida-based A-T
Children's Project.
</P>
<P>
   Margus has two sons increasingly disabled by A-T, whose victims
lose control over their body beginning at a young age and are
highly susceptible to cancer. That Snyder is both a pediatrician
and a lab researcher ``means a lot to me,'' Margus said, because he
has both compassion for his patients and the skills to do
cutting-edge research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often have a dilemma with a medical doctor who has noble
reasons for being in medicine but doesn't understand the research
process, or a PhD who gets turned on by working at the lab bench,
but can't seem to remember that these are people they're dealing
with,'' Margus said.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement about Snyder's work is fueled in part by neural
stem cells' astonishing ability to migrate through the brain,
homing in on nerves that have been damaged and transforming
themselves into specialized nerve cells of the appropriate type.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, the damage is sending out cries for help _ `We need
neurons now!' _ and the stem cell can become a neuron'' and send
out new ``wiring'' that makes the right connections to repair
damage, Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of admiration for Evan,'' said Dr. Paul Sanberg,
chairman of neuroscience at the University of South Florida who
also does neural transplantation. ``He has started to focus on ALS
and Parkinson's diseases, but his real love is these rare disorders
in kids and preemies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most dramatic animal experiment, Snyder implanted neural
stem cells into the brain of the mutant ``shiverer mouse,'' a lab
creation afflicted with continuous, severe tremors. Snyder found
that the implanted cells repaired the damage and eased the mouse's
shivering. More recently, he's moved some of the stem-cell work
into monkeys, since they more closely resemble humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that you can place (neural stem) cells in the
nervous system and have them take on the characteristics dictated
by the local environment is really revolutionary,'' said Fischbach
of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The
next big push, already underway, is to identify the signals that
call the cells to damaged areas, and try to duplicate them with
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder and other scientists also are exploring a strategy for
treating inoperable brain tumors by inserting toxic genes into
neural stem cells that would deliver the genes to the tumor and its
spreading tentacles, like a suicide bomber. What's hoped for is
that the gene-carrying stem cells can follow the same pathways the
tumor cells take as they weave their way inextricably into the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   That goal is a very personal one. A close friend of Snyder died
from a brain tumor in his 40s, and Snyder vowed to find a way of
attacking tumors with his stem cells. He's reminded of this pledge
whenever he attends formal functions _ his tuxedo used to be that
of his friend.
</P>
<P>
   As the excitement about this new attack on brain diseases
ripples through the medical field and into public awareness,
Snyder, a pediatrician and neurologist at Children's Hospital and
Harvard Medical School, is increasingly in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he's in nearly perpetual motion. Flying here and
there, he caroms from one scientific meeting to another, writes
papers, supervises his laboratory and keeps in touch with myriad
scientists with whom he's collaborating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is amazing in that regard. He's definitely like having a
hyperactive kid _ the good part,'' said Xandra Breakefield, a gene
therapy researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital with whom
Snyder is attempting to use stem cells against brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a coveted speaker at scientific meetings _ he's
given more than 35 such talks so far this year _ Snyder is much in
demand by the media. Engaging and possessing a boyish, telegenic
presence, he's recently been on the ``Today'' show, National Public
Radio, local television, and innumerable print stories on the new
frontier in brain science.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's method for isolating and growing neural stem cells is
licensed to Layton Bioscience Inc. of Atherton, Calif., which plans
to develop stem-cell treatments. But, despite the potential for
profit, Snyder is not a wealth-seeking entrepreneur, said Gary
Snable, the chief executive officer at Layton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tremendously dedicated to solving some of the childhood
disorders, but he has no interest whatsoever'' in the business part
of it, Snable said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder allows himself a modest bit of flash with his car, a
sporty 1990 Honda Civic, which he said is something of a statement
about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fast, it's compact, it's fire-engine red _ but old,'' he
said. Age, in fact, is a sensitive topic. Snyder won't reveal his,
saying, ``Nobody knows how old I am,'' though he graduated from
college in 1973, making him mid-to-late 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's scientific portfolio, aside from his many publications,
is his collection of slides he uses for talks. In addition to
numerical data, many of the slides are photographs of brain slices
showing the work of neural stem cells. Like the freezer, Snyder
obsesses over his slides. He adds or removes slides for different
audiences, and, after every talk, jots down which slides he used
and how well the presentation went.
</P>
<P>
   The A-T Children's project and several other disease groups have
been funding Snyder directly _ bypassing the federal system of
research grants _ to expand his team to focus on the rare diseases.
As a result, he said, ``We're progressing at a pace that is every
scientist's dream, but it's very important not to sacrifice our
scientific integrity'' in the rush toward a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the research move into humans before the safety of stem
cells is known. ``Can these things be controlled once they're
implanted?'' Fischbach asked. In addition, the Food and Drug
Administration will want assurance that the versatile cells won't
produce cancers, and that the cells can be produced with consistent
quality control.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Snyder, his neural stem cell research doesn't
carry the ethical baggage of embryonic stem cell research because
the nerve cells don't have to be harvested from human embryos.
Snyder's cells were taken originally from a fetus that was aborted
for other reasons several years ago. Now that the cells can be
maintained and their numbers increased in the lab, he said he
doesn't need to use any more fetal material.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's driven, like many top researchers, and is prone to
letting work dominate his life, Snyder has a wide range of
interests besides neural stem cells, such as linguistics and
theater.
</P>
<P>
   While attending the University of Pennsylvania, where he majored
in psychology, Snyder worked in summer camps for emotionally
disturbed children. He continued on to medical school at Penn, and
at a time when most medical students are overwhelmed with studies,
Snyder found time to start the Philadelphia Children's Theater
Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that, in front of kids, I could really open up,''
Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur theater group, which performed in children's
hospitals around Philadelphia, offered more than a creative outlet
for Snyder: He met his future wife after one of the shows when she
asked to meet the writer of the production's songs.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Vieira, Snyder's wife, is now a lawyer in the counsel's
office at New England Medical Center, and she's also a
semiprofessional singer with groups such as the Tanglewood Festival
Chorus. They live in Jamaica Plain.
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder has difficulty squeezing in a personal life these
days, in part because be is so committed to the people he works
with as well as their scientific goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really takes care of everyone in his lab; he's loyal and
he's just so supportive,'' said Kurtis Auguste, now a medical
student in California who carried out a research project with
Snyder while a Harvard undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   Even Snyder is feeling a need to rest a bit from the frantic
pace. In the past, he said, he hasn't really taken vacations;
instead, bringing his wife along to scenic or luxurious places he's
been invited to speak.
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder said she's wearied of waiting while he spends most of
the time talking shop with other researchers, and he's turning over
a new leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take a real vacation this summer,'' he said,
``and I define a vacation as someplace where you don't take along
your slides.''

ABORTION POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ The legal losers on abortion rights understood
the implications perfectly. It's the politicians on the Right who
have been slower to get the message, but from George W. Bush on
down they're coming around.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, the issue is not the politically created concept of
``partial birth'' abortion. It's abortion itself, which both raises
the stakes and changes the politics.
</P>
<P>
   As Justice Antonin Scalia noted in verbally violent dissent, the
Supreme Court's bare majority that has upheld the foundation of
abortion rights, Roe v. Wade, has precluded meaningful legislation
to attack the rights piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia was explicit: ``The possibility of limiting abortion by
legislative means . . . has been rendered impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The other passionate right-to-lifer on the Supreme Court,
Clarence Thomas, was similarly noteworthy for his non-mincing of
words: ``We are told that (31) states are prohibited from banning
one rarely used form of abortion . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative politicians have tried to ignore these unassailable
(by logic and legal analysis) observations, but their movement is
already divided about pressing on with pointless legislative
gestures after having wasted five years on the sideshow of Thomas'
``rarely used'' but politically useful procedure, while roughly a
million abortions were being performed for every one of those
years.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if one believes that ``human'' life begins at the
instant of conception and that ending it medically is homicide, the
``unborn child'' is just as ``dead'' in the deity's eyes, no matter
its fetal age or the procedure used to ``kill'' it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is trying mightily to ignore this reality. That is why he
talks of banning ``partial birth abortion,'' never of junking Roe
and going after abortion rights themselves. His tacit deal with the
right-to-life movement that forms much of his party's modern base
has been to ignore the basic issue in his campaign (and thus avoid
mobilizing the pro-choice majority) while offering a clue to his
real intentions by making anti-Roe Scalia and Thomas his models for
Supreme Court appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, the GOP's congressional right-to-life guru,
Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois, hews to a belief that it is
possible to construct a ban on one abortion procedure that is
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Two big problems, flowing from the candor of Justices Scalia and
Thomas. The first is substantive, to wit the prevailing view among
right-to-life scholars and most state attorneys general that such a
narrow ban would be meaningless to the very limited extent as was
enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   The second is that such a ``ban'' would be signed into
irrelevant law by President Clinton, with the support of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   People forget that the so-called model statute that
right-to-lifers came up with for their partial birth crusade was
designed not to fit within Roe's mandates but to flout them. That
is why all the state laws and the congressional measure President
Clinton has twice vetoed explicitly rejected attempts to tailor
them to Roe. That is why they intentionally blur the distinction
between the second and third trimester, avoid singling out dilation
and extraction, and reject most health exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   That is also why the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, in
some magnificent lawyering, targeted the 21 states with the most
explicitly anti-Roe laws for court challenges, while representing
the gutsy doctor who took on the Nebraska statute.
</P>
<P>
   This has set the stage for the altered state of abortion
politics, featuring a wounded and angry right-to-life movement, but
also a clearly threatened right-to-choose, now hanging by a Supreme
Court thread.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, Bush is now under real pressure to ditch
any pro-choice running mate, above all Gov. Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania. He is also under pressure to slap down all attempts
to alter the GOP platform and to speak up more for the cause. At
stake is the intensity of his base.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Al Gore's choices for vice president are are
less affected, with the sole exception of Senator Evan Bayh of
Indiana, who backs the partial birth ban. In addition, the Nebraska
decision destroys Ralph Nader's argument that there is no
consequential difference between the two major party nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights have had their profile raised. There is now one
nominee who favors them and one who opposes them, and it's clear
each is in position to do something about it as president. It's
equally clear that this will only matter in the election to the
extent Gore makes it matter.

RAIN DOESN'T FALL ON THIS PLAIN

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; TRENTON, Neb. _ The first time one of the craggy farmers in
the pickup truck raised his arm as they passed by on the county
road, I began blathering that I'm just a harmless city boy and I'll
give them my laptop computer if they promise to leave me alone.
</P>
<P>
   The second time I checked myself in the rearview mirror to see
if my Dairy Queen frappe had smeared across my face. The third time
it dawned on me that they were only waving hello.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. I should have known something was strange a few hours
outside of Chicago when I pulled into the ``World's Largest
Truckstop'' on Interstate 80 in Walcott, Iowa, a place where you
could have a cavity filled, watch a movie, get a haircut, wash some
clothes, and take a shower (free with every fill-up). In the
sprawling store, I eyed a pair of mud flaps that said, ``Nasty,''
but decided they might not fit the image of the convertible I
rented for this cross-country trek.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the parking lot, as an endless stream of 18-wheelers came
and went, Jerry Albrecht, a 57-year-old trucker hauling used cars
from Pennsylvania to Montana, came over to talk about life.
</P>
<P>
   He dreams of opening his own restaurant in his Michigan hometown
_ ``Not a fancy night place, but breakfast, doughnuts, closes at 4
or 5 in the afternoon,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He talks of how he met his current wife on a run in Florida.
``She helped me unload my truck. I just liked the way she handled
herself.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time I cross the Nebraska line and drive south through a
sea of corn to the tiny town of Auburn, I half expect to see Auntie
Em hanging laundry on the back line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howdy,'' Lee Casey calls out from a window table as I walk
through the ancient door of Kelly's Cafe. He's the town's retired
undertaker, more animated than you might expect. He's flanked by
the town's retired banker, a retired newsman, a retired farmer, and
Ken McCormick, an insurance agent whom the rest of the group calls
``not retired, just tired,'' all part of the prairie rendition of
the McLaughlin Group. They gather every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sit down, we're solving the world's problems,'' Lee says. When
the owner, Lance Conn, asks if we'd like some pop, I think, ``Ah,
hah, they're into something funny here.'' My navigator leans in and
whispers, ``Soda.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, as the sun beats relentlessly from the
never-changing blue skies, the talk is of drought. They've had just
one-third of their normal moisture over the last year, and when
they finally got some weather the week before, much of it came in
the form of hailstones that ripped through crops and left farmlands
looking like battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   North of town, kindly farmer Daryl Obermeyer shows me the dry,
cracked earth where a field of oats should have been. The crop
should be chest high, though what's growing barely scrapes the
knee. As a result, farmers all over are selling cattle that they
can't afford to feed _ selling, as Cathy Anderson of the local Farm
Service Agency says, ``a part of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of these farmers who likes to complain,''
Obermeyer says. ``We'll pull through.'' He shows us a video his son
made for his college film class, asks if he can take our picture,
then sends us on our way.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, I point the convertible west and head out Highway
136 along the Kansas border toward the part of the state hardest
hit by drought, buzzing through a patchwork quilt of corn and wheat
fields that stretches flat toward infinity and glistens in the
day's fading sun. Storm clouds gather in the distance, bolts of
lightning smashing the ground, and then, an evening deluge.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, I assume the farmers will be dancing in
the puddles, but as they sit at the Texaco station in this town of
900 residents, retired postman Dick Cowles glumly explains, ``We
didn't get a drop.''
</P>
<P>
   All season, the winds have been right and the weathermen
constantly call for rain. But every time, the clouds veer to the
north or south, leaving this narrow band parched and its farmers
fending for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're eternal optimists,'' farmer Tom Baker says. ``You have
to be in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   He returns to his fields, me to the road, both of us hoping that
every cloud we see brings rain.

   TEACHERS-PAY (Chicago) _ The National Education Association,

</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (``p'' code)
</P>
<P>
   GORE (Dateline to kum) _ One day he bashes the oil industry; the
next he goes after the pharmaceutical conglomerates. Al Gore is
clearly trying to rally the traditional Democratic base, but he is
also reacting to Ralph Nader's appeal. By Alison Mitchell.

<P>
   BUSH (Dateline to kum, Calif.) _ In a speech in California, he

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-SOFTWARFE (Shanghai) _ Janet Reno isn't the only one
worried about Bill Gates' software monopoly, China's leaders are,
too. Concerned that the country is growing overly dependent on the
Microsoft Windows operating system that controls computers running
everything from China's banks to President Jiang Zemin's e-mail
box, the Chinese government, itself a master at monopoly, has
joined one of the most progressive antitrust clubs in the world. It
is backing the Linux operating system, which is distributed free to
anyone who wants it. By Craig S. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-WORKERS (Tulsa, Okla.) _ American business is rushing
into China, and Marilyn C. Grant, a 56-year-old widow who drives a
forklift for a fishing reel company, is being left behind. Ms.
Grant's employer, Zebco, plans to move much of its fishing reel
production to China, just a month after the House passed a measure
that would end cold war restrictions on China trade. At least 240
local Zebco workers will lose their jobs. As China modernizes and
loosens controls, its lure as a manufacturing base, which has been
growing since the early 1980s, is proving irresistible to many
multinationals. For every jumbo jet Boeing sells China, it seems, a
Zebco sends a production line there. By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ The daily marketplace column. By Floyd
Norris.
</P>
<P>
   SOFTWARE-EARNINGS () _ Two software companies _ BMC Software and
Computer Associates _ warn that quarterly earnings will be lower
than expected because of weakness in sales of software for
mainframe computers. BMC shares tumble 34 percent in early trading;
Computer Associates fall 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-ACCESS (Seoul, South Korea) _ Euphoria over the thaw
between North and South Korea has waned considerably in the few
weeks since their leaders held a summit and a symbolic truckload of
Coca-Cola crossed the DMZ, heralding potential economic and
investment opportunities. Experts say it will take more than
tempting products or business plans to get Pyongyang to grant
access to foreign businesses. By Samuel Len.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-EURO (London) _ Under pressure from business over its
indecision over joining the euro, Britain has rejected claims that
foreign companies are withdrawing or reducing their investments in
the country. It points to new data that show a 25 percent increase
in such investment since last year. By Alan Cowell.

THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN, AND WE LIKE `LIKE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many a usage stormlet rages for years among insiders without
disturbing the peace of ordinary people. One of those minor
disturbances, over the past half-century or so, has been the
question of like vs. such as, but now it looks as if this weather
event has blown itself out. And the less formal like is the usage
left standing.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't realize the end was near till a query came in last week
from John Fitch of Cambridge, asking about a recent story in the
Sunday Globe. Why did the writer refer to ``rural families such as
the Hanscoms''? ``What's wrong with saying `families like the
Hanscoms'? '' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise here was not that Fitch noticed, but that he chose
the side he did. A decade or two ago, any reader who cared enough
to write would probably have scorned like the Hanscoms and insisted
that only such as was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Many editors still feel that way. Their seasoned superiors have
initiated them in the traditional journalistic bugaboos _ don't use
over for more than, don't use some for approximately _ the way
fraternities pass along their secret handshakes, and such as is one
of the jewels in their hoard of arcana. Those who insist on
families such as the Hanscoms can split hairs even more finely; in
one camp are those who believe such as can never be divided, in
another those who find such families as the Hanscoms perfectly
proper.
</P>
<P>
   But the rabble _ those of us who like like, and use it far more
than such as _ got some high-level support last year: The revised
New York Times style manual endorsed like as the preferred usage.
Such as is for fuddy-duddies, says the paper once known as the Good
Gray Lady: ``In introducing an example (multinational companies
such as Coca-Cola), the phrase is stilted and should usually be
replaced by like. The phrase is slightly less stiff when a noun
falls between the words (such companies as Pepsico), but like
remains more fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was all the fuss about? Like, the ``purists''
maintained, was to be reserved for pointing out resemblances, not
used to introduce examples. She drives like a maniac? No problem.
She drives fast cars, like Jaguars and Porsches? Should be such as,
say the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, though, the such as question has not roused the
passions of most usage authorities; many simply ignore it. The
generally sensible Theodore Bernstein calls the distinction
``slight'' and its backers ``nit-pickers.'' Even a stickler like,
or such as, Wilson Follett _ whose 1966 Modern American Usage
devotes an entire appendix to elucidating the subleties of shall
and will _ doesn't mind the phrase composers like Beethoven. Going
further than Bernstein, he calls the distinction between like and
such as ``extremely slight.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, unlike many cherished usage crotchets, such as can muster
some logic in its defense. And James Kilpatrick, the feistiest of
the such as stalwarts, marshals it all in his 1993 book, ``Fine
Print,'' devoting two rousing pages to castigating the soft-headed
ninnies who consider the distinction trivial. And he makes the
point as well as it can be made: For instance, he objects to Time
magazine's report that a pornography operation was moving into
``sun-and-fun states like California and Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time intended to say that the German pornographer was
considering outlets in California and Florida, but that was not
what Time said,'' thunders Kilpatrick. ``Time said the sleazebag
was considering outlets in states like California and Florida.''
True enough _ strictly speaking, if they were states like
California and Florida, they couldn't be California and Florida.
But would such as improve the statement's accuracy, or does it have
the same flaw? Absolute correctness would seem to demand ``starting
with California and Florida,'' or simply ``in California and
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, like seems to have conquered the field. Which does
not mean, of course, that we want to throw out such as. Sometimes
we want to sound like fuddy-duddies, after all. And with all the
other likes in the language, we'll need such as simply to provide
an alternative. Faced with a sentence like ``He likes all the
flavors she likes, like raspberry and mango and pineapple,'' even
the most casual speaker might appreciate the availability of such
as.

   Theresa Valliere came through with the salmon pie recipe we've
been looking for. This is a good basic pie recipe that could easily
be played with to clean out the refrigerator. Leftover peas,
carrots, even bell peppers would be welcome additions to this pie
that might even tempt the youngest appetites _ well, without the
onions.
</P>
<P>
   The tomato preserves and tomato jams are in response to a
request from Christene Route of Fort Worth. They're both from
``Jams, Jellies &AMP; Preserves'' by Linda Ferrari (Prima, $12).

<TEXT>
<P>
   In an experimental effort to help cultivate the next generation
of Christian leaders, Andover Newton Theological School has
challenged 24 youth activists from around the country to see their
churches, neighborhoods, and each other in new ways.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong program, part of a national effort funded by the
Lilly Endowment, gave teenagers a rare opportunity to talk about
faith in a serious way outside the safety of their communities,
which ranged from Seattle to Maine and from the evangelical to the
mainline.
</P>
<P>
   The students spent time exploring issues of homelessness and
gentrification, and time in small groups confronting questions they
raised themselves, such as ``Am I strong enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed toward the end of their week, several students said
time away from home and with other committed youngsters forced them
to rethink their notions of divinity (what one student called `the
whole Jesus thing') and faith, and, in many cases, to come away
stronger. Several students said they thought they experienced a
call to the ministry over the week, while others said they would
bring a new energy to social justice work.
</P>
<P>
   Religious communities around the country have been experimenting
with new ways to harness the energy of the young as the number of
people entering the ministry in many denominations declines.
Pollster George Barna warned earlier this year that ``one shift
that should trouble leaders in the Christian church is the
superficial relationship that most teens have with Christianity and
their plans to reduce their already minimal commitment to the
Christian faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The group that gathered in Newton, Mass., however, was selected
for its commitment. The students were recommended by pastors, and
had thought enough about religion that they were able to write
essays on their personal faith journeys and were willing to spend a
week of their summer vacations in a kind of encounter session on
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been questioning everything, and when I got here, it
seemed like I got to question even more,'' said Jordan Tupper, 17,
of Yarmouth, Maine, a member of the United Church of Christ who
said he has wanted to be a minister since he was 8. ``What does it
mean to be a Christian? Am I willing to devote myself to Jesus?''
</P>
<P>
   The students, most of whom attend public schools, said they
often feel uncomfortable discussing religion in school or with
friends. Several were from churches with anemic youth programs, and
welcomed the opportunity to talk with other youngsters who were
interested in exploring theological challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had one thing in common: the same God,'' said Willie
Ramos, 19, an evangelical Christian from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Seals, 17, of Lumberton, N.C., said a session with a
once-homeless person encouraged him to look more charitably at the
homeless people he encounters back home, while Ian Callahan, 17, of
Holden, said he will now look for a way to reconcile his
aspirations to be a film director with his Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary goal was to help them create a transformative
experience to deepen their faith, so that they could hear a radical
call to be more courageous in the world,'' said Arrington
Chambliss, an aspiring Episcopal priest who was one of several
current and former seminary students working with the teenagers.
``To see 16 and 17-year-olds talking about a sense of call is
pretty intense.''

   BANK-RESTORE (New York) _ Some relationships sag during a move
and, when a drawn-out renovation is added, some collapse altogether
from the strain. But Laura Bohn and Richard Fiore never seem
happier than when they are abandoning one renovated apartment to
overhaul the next. They have teamed up on seven renovations,
starting with the apartment Ms. Bohn was living in when Mr. Fiore
met her 21 years ago. Three years ago, they took on their riskiest
project. They bought a bank. The gamble was a true test of personal
and professional ties. Only the stout of heart would spend $2
million on a 1907 Beaux-Arts bank, with landmark status and an
address at Eighth Avenue and 14th Street, and then invest nearly
$10 million more to convert it to condos, with a penthouse for
themselves on top that would pay for itself. By Julie Iovine.

   NEW-ORLEANS-DECOR (New Orleans) _ In a city of ancestor worship,
where family history comes entombed in leather-bound albums, Angele
Parlange may be the nerviest gal in town. Ms. Parlange has
creatively and flamboyantly reinterpreted her family traditions in
fabric, china and interior designs of the hyperfeminine variety at
Parlange, one of Louisiana's most celebrated plantations. By
Patricia Leigh Brown.

   MOORE-HOUSE (Royal Oak, Md.) _ As the architect behind the $81
million renovation of the Library of Congress, Arthur Cotton Moore
would seem to be an expert on coordinating complex projects. But
his own home here, some 50 miles east of Washington, was almost his
undoing. On the lawn behind the house lie several 30-foot-long
curved steel girders. Has Moore acquired a Richard Serra sculpture?
``Actually,'' he explained, ``those are some of the pieces that
didn't work.'' Pieces, that is, of Moore's house, in which 77
girders _ many of which are curved and all of which were usable
only if correctly formed to within one-sixteenth of an inch _
collide. Assembling the house, in a style Moore has dubbed
``industrial baroque,'' took more than nails. As Moore's wife,
Patricia, observed, ``Other people have a family doctor; we have a
family welder.'' By Fred Bernstein.

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ No matter who is president, the
church vs. state controversy will continue, especially after the
Supreme Court's ruling last month outlawing student-led prayers at
public high school football games. The next chapter could come when
the court decides, probably next year, on statutes, such as one
recently passed Virginia, that permit a moment of silence in public
classrooms. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

A CULTURAL ICON TURNED ON ITS SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a dainty drop of smelly socks, a carefree twirl of a
knob, and housewives in the early 1950s had a reason to smile about
dirty clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The automatic top-loading washing machine quickly became an
American icon, a fixture in tens of millions of households during
the last half-century. Having clean clothes is an obsession in the
United States _ they are washed more often here than virtually
anywhere else _ and top-loaders gush hundreds of gallons of hot
water to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   But now, top-loaders may be edged out in the States by a version
of their more efficient European cousin: The front-loader.
</P>
<P>
   US Department of Energy standards announced in May require new
washers to be 35 percent more efficient within seven years. Most
top-loaders, which have to fill all the way up with water to work,
won't pass that test. Front-loaders, which wash clothes using a
tumble method like a dryer, use about two-thirds less water. And
less water means less energy used to heat it. Not since the advent
of low-flow toilets has a new energy standard promised to affect so
many consumers' daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This definitely places a new spin on things,'' said Jacqueline
Davies, a mother of two, shopping near Boston recently. ``I'm used
to picking up the top and throwing in something I forgot. It's just
a strange way of doing the laundry, from the front.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, convinced a top-loading tradition can be broken by a
small squat or a bend of the knee, manufacturers like Maytag have
introduced souped-up front-loading machines to the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But competition is close behind. Just last week, Whirlpool
unveiled a high-efficiency top-loading machine that showers laundry
instead of immersing it in a bath and will, the company says, meet
the EPA's efficiency guidelines. Noting that they found that eight
out of 10 Americans preferred a top-loader, company officials are
counting on consumers who want to drop dirty clothes into the soapy
cycle. Both machines retail for several hundred dollars more than
the cost of a standard washer, but claim their products can save
$100 a year on utility bills. Pricing for a standard washer starts
at about $400.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of these new machines saves more water in a year than
someone drinks in a lifetime,'' said Bruce J. Wall, residential
programs manager for Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships, a
nonprofit group. ``And you save money with the second price tag _
the operating cost. But it's hard to get people to change. New
England is the land of the steady habits, people do what they've
always done.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans, in general, have rarely chosen conservation over
convenience _ in any form. They use public transportation less than
those in other countries. For the most part they choose to drive
gas guzzlers even as the price of gasoline soars. Part of the
reason may be energy is cheaper here than in Europe, some academics
note. Others say it's simply the culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We embrace waste,'' said Joe Boskin, professor of history at
Boston University. ``The North American continent has been a
cornucopia for those who have settled here. For example, there were
so many lobsters here, they were used to fertilize the soil. We
thought nothing of conservation.''
</P>
<P>
   The energy crisis of the early 1970s gave Americans a taste of
economy _ and they didn't like it. Gas could be bought only on
certain days. President Jimmy Carter made a speech calling for
people to turn down their thermostats and put sweaters on. Being
energy efficient, many Americans thought, meant going without.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil embargo in the early 1970s and again in 1979 to some
extent gave conservation a bad name,'' said Andrew deLaski,
executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, a
coalition of consumer and environmental organizations. ``But
really, efficiency is doing things better but using less energy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, government officials realized huge energy
savings were possible with simple household appliances. And
standards began being put into place. Now, refrigerators are much
more efficient than in the early 1970s. New standards are being
developed now for central air conditioning, and stricter ones for
room conditioners go into effect this fall. Light bulbs also are
more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the savings are not immediately apparent to the
consumer, because the energy-efficient models work as well as their
predecessors. Usually, the only way to show the difference is
comparing electric bills.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to tell whether US consumers will embrace the
front-loading washer, which accounts for 90 percent of washing
machine sales in Europe, industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sort of scared of front-loaders, the water comes up
to the level of the door and you see that window, and you think
this may not be safe. . . . It is a little bit inconvenient,'' said
Surendra Gupta, director of the Laboratory for Responsible
Manufacturing at Northeastern University. ``Americans are so into
convenience and luxury, any little change they really don't like.''

   CLINICAL-TRIALS: Nation's Medical Research Engine Sputtering,
Experts Say. (WASHINGTON) With the human genetic code deciphered
and other discoveries unfolding daily, medical science is poised to
gallop forward like never before. But experts say the entire engine
that drives research is sputtering. Too few doctors are being
trained in clinical research. And public trust is low. Fewer than 4
percent of cancer patients, for example, participate in clinical
trials. And while clinical trials were once the domain of
university researchers, about 80 percent of new drug studies are
conducted in private labs, and pharmaceutical companies now spend
more money on research than the National Institutes of Health does.

   PENN-KEYSTATE: Keystone State May Hold the Key
(Analysis)(NORRISTOWN, Pa.) They call it the Keystone State, and in
this unpredictable election year, Pennsylvania is living up to its
name. In the race for the White House it is a swing state with 23
electoral votes, and too close to call. In the struggle for control
of the Senate, Pennsylvania has one of the nation's most vulnerable
incumbents, freshman Republican Rick Santorum. In the House
campaign, at least three seats are up for grabs. All this in a
wide-open year, when the potential for simultaneous change in
partisan control of the presidency, the Senate and the House is
considered greater than in any year since 1952. And if rumors of
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge as a running mate for George W. Bush
turn out to be true, it would send a clear signal that Bush wants
to make a stand in the Rust Belt states that run west through
Illinois -- a group of states that, with the exception of Indiana,
went Democratic in the 1990s. By John Hassell. About 1,200 (``p''

HEADS BEGIN TO ROLL IN THE WEB'S OWN THERMIDOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was more than 200 years ago on a hot July day that the
factions governing the French Revolution _ the elected deputies,
the Terrorists, and the mob _ realized they had gone too far. Too
much had happened too soon; society had been transformed too
quickly. The two greatest revolutionaries of them all, Danton and
Robespierre, were dispatched to the guillotine, and a period of
comparative conservatism and consolidation ensued.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction became known by the renamed month in which it
occurred: Thermidor. And this is where we are in the Internet
revolution: Web Thermidor. Mob rule is coming to an end. The
trimming Talleyrand of American jurisprudence, David Boies, is now
going to work for Napster. The lawyer who made the world safe for
IBM in the monumental antitrust trial of the late 1970s, then
switched sides to lead the government's case against Microsoft, is
advancing the argument that the Napsterite Jacobins are proper
bourgeois entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence that reaction is at hand? The Web revolution
is devouring its young. Witness the Web execution of Harry Knowles,
who just three years ago was the People's Friend, the sobriquet
assigned to the deified revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat. From his
Austin, Texas-based site, aint-it-cool-news.com, Knowles posted all
the information the movie moguls didn't want the public to know:
last-minute rewrites of expensive pictures, disastrous test
screenings in Tucson. Cognoscenti credit him with more or less
single-handedly torpedoing ``Godzilla,'' the $200 million turkey
from Sony Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   But Harry is hamburger now. Web harpies have been busily
exposing the once-independent Knowles as nothing more than a studio
ponce. Now Knowles accepts free junkets to film locations and is
seen feeding at the same trough as the other bought-and-paid for
critics. He's a whore like the rest of us! He's appearing on Roger
Ebert's show, for Crissakes! Two fatty film flacks flogging frothy
flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet pioneers have either joined the reaction _
there's Amazon's Jeff Bezos patenting a technology that's not even
his _ or are plunging headfirst into the wastebasket of history.
Say what you will about former San Francisco Examiner staffer David
Talbot; he launched Salon, the first legitimate Internet magazine,
almost a full year before Michael Kinsley and Microsoft trumped him
with Slate. Talbot's now busy firing his friends, but his own job
will fall into the basket soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are driving Web Thermidor: Web commerce succeeded
when it seemed cheap and convenient to use. The press, which has
been cheerleading each more improbably ``awesome'' turn of the
revolutionary worm, has finally cottoned on to the reaction. The
Globe recently reported that consumers are finding Web travel sites
hard to use. You bet they're hard to use! Would I rather make two
or more stops on a trip to California _ the Priceline.com option _
or pick up the phone and call Southwest Airlines? That wasn't a
very hard decision.
</P>
<P>
   Would you like a primer on hard to use? Check out Priceline's
discount grocery site. By the time you've decoded the complicated
interaction of their half-price tokens with in-store promotions and
manufacturers' coupons, I've been to Stop &AMP; Shop and back _ three
times! Sure, I appreciated the free roll of film Ememories.com gave
me with my Sunday paper, but it took two weeks for my fershlugginer
pictures to arrive. Hideous CVS would have had them back to me 10
days ago, and processed them more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the Web proving to be less convenient than
originally hyped, suddenly, it's no bargain. Free shipping is going
the way of the dodo bird, as are the endless offers of free
samples. And despite what you read in the Internet buff books about
``first mover'' advantage, the few good ideas that work are being
stolen by Old Economy dinosaurs. Who are you betting on _ Barnes
and Noble, or Bezos' increasingly fragile Amazon.com? Priceline, or
the five airlines that have colluded to steal their business model?
</P>
<P>
   The revolution ain't over, by a long shot. And no, I don't know
who, if anyone, will emerge as the Internet Napoleon. (Although I
like Esther Dyson as Madame Defarge.) But we're already several
months into Thermidor, with no letup in sight. You want to watch
the Industry Standard's Flop Tracker and Dot.Com Layoff Tracker for
an up-to-the-minute accounting of the boys and girls parachuting
back into the Old Economy. The Terror may be over, but the heads
are still rolling.

   DELTA _ Delta says it will take a $228 million second-quarter
gain on the conversion of some of its remaining priceline.com

million charge related to early retirements. Some 2,500 workers
took advantage of a special offer of paid medical benefits for
early retirees. Delta also is switching to a calendar fiscal year.

anything but simple. All call for wine and citrus fruits, and most
include some sort of brandy, but beyond that, no two recipes are

perennials _ reminding you that contrast can be as interesting as
complement. Such unexpected pleasure is always what I feel when I

   WALLPAPER _ Putting up wallpaper is not the easiest home

Window awnings also have practical uses. They block harsh direct
sunlight, making rooms cooler and more comfortable and they protect
furniture and fabrics from fading. But one of the most important
functions of patio and window awnings is to look good; they dress
up a house, giving it style and personality. (Dayton Daily News).

BE SURE TO HEED THIS ADVICE ... AND SMILE

   From time to time, we offer ``advice to go'' _ helpful hints for
the traveler. Well, the whimsical Web site MailBits.
</P>
<P>
   com has done the same, providing tips you'd be wise to heed.
Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --Be suspicious if the advertised price of a Caribbean cruise
includes the phrase ``Free Ammo.''
</P>
<P>
   --There is no legitimate reason for a travel agent to need to
know if you have experience in jungle warfare.
</P>
<P>
   --Likewise, legitimate travel agents do not dress in foreign
military uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   --Say no to anyone who asks you to deliver a suitcase of
powdered sugar to their grandmother in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   --Carefully consider visiting a country where the license plate
motto is ``Die American Pig.''
</P>
<P>
   (We thank faithful contributor and Web whiz Mike Schuster of
Foxborough for locating this ``advice.'') &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travel Trivia: You know where the White House is. But where is
the Blue House? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: Just as New York City is displaying cow sculptures
everywhere, Toronto will have more than 300 moose sculptures
grazing downtown streets. The host hotel for this ``Moose in the
City'' event, the Holiday Inn on King, has four such sculptures,
including one near its restaurant. His name: Chocolate Moose.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: Massachusetts prohibits snoring unless bedroom
windows are securely locked. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``When traveling alone, your mind fills up strangely with
the people you are fond of, the people you have left behind'' _
Richard Holmes, an English journalist. &QL; 
 &QL; 
New travel products: Here's the latest evidence that our world is
getting more amazing every day: Travelers using Trip.com Wireless
can now rebook a flight using a wireless device such as a cell
phone or Palm Pilot. In seconds, you can check seat availability
and schedule a later flight _ something that should especially
appeal to business travelers. The program, operated in tandem with
Trip.com's parent company, Galileo International, also allows the
viewing of multiple itineraries, updated flight information, and a
variety of other travel-related items. For more information, visit
www.trip.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? In Seoul. The Blue House is the residence of
South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung. &QL;

BOSTON SPARKLES IN JULY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   July is a great month for Boston. Think of it _ tall ships,
harbor festivals, the Boston Pops, Van Gogh, and a 40-foot-long
dinosaur named Sue will all be on hand to make this a month of
memories. Add to this two huge parades by the Shriners _ one on
Tuesday at noon and the other on Wednesday at 5:30 p.m.; the 30th
annual Boston Globe Jazz and Blues Festival July 7 to 16; North End
Italian festivals; classic car lawn events at the Museum of
Transportation, and not one but two grand celebrations of Bastille
Day. In Boston the celebration of French food, music, and dancing
is on Marlborough Street between Clarendon and Berkley streets, and
just across the Charles River in Cambridge, the party is on Holyoke
Street between Mass. Avenue and Mount Auburn Street.
</P>
<P>
   Now through July 4 is Boston Harborfest, with more than 200
events, including fireworks and visits by US and foreign naval
ships. Half the events are free, others $1 to $10. Today, thousands
will head to City Hall Plaza for the annual Chowderfest. Not to be
missed is the 27th annual Fourth of July on the Esplanade Tuesday
with the Boston Pops and fireworks (the rehearsal for the Pops is
Monday at the Hatch Shell).
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Gogh: Face to Face'' is at the Museum of Fine Arts through
Sept. 24. One easy way to get tickets to this stunningly beautiful
show is to book a hotel package through one of the 15 Boston and
Cambridge hotels offering them.
</P>
<P>
   From July 10-16 some 70 tall ships from 30 countries will be in
Boston. Check out the grand parade of sail (July 11), the salute by
the Boston Pops, fireworks, and, on July 16, the USS Constitution
on parade.

SCHOONER VACATIONERS GO WHERE THE WIND TAKES THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKLAND, Maine _ The day is sunny and the wind steady as the
two-masted schooner American Eagle _ one of the fleet of
passenger-carrying windjammers that ply the Maine coast each summer
_ sails into the broad expanse of Penobscot Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Having helped raise the schooner's sails, passengers line the
rails to wave goodbye to land, other boats in Rockland Harbor,
fishermen on the breakwater, and maybe to a few of their cares and
worries as well. Windjammers have no fixed itinerary (that's part
of their charm) and let prevailing winds set the course and dictate
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a place to anchor is rarely a problem. Penobscot Bay is
dotted with islands offering sheltered coves and protected harbors,
one of the reasons it's such a popular yachting area.
</P>
<P>
   John Foss, American Eagle's skipper and owner, brings the
schooner around and heads up the coast, following the line of the
Camden Hills that begin just north of Rockland. The ruggedly
beautiful Maine coastal scenery is another reason people love to
sail up here.
</P>
<P>
   As the hills slip away to the stern, Foss spins the wheel, puts
American Eagle on a northeasterly course and announces with casual
authority, ``I think we'll anchor off Islesboro tonight.'' The next
night it could be Deer Isle, Stonington, North Haven, or wherever.
</P>
<P>
   A windjammer cruise is an old-fashioned, low-tech stress beater,
with a different small port to visit each day and constantly
changing seascapes to enjoy. What it isn't is a trip on a luxury
liner.
</P>
<P>
   Cabins are comfortable but usually cramped. Meals, which are
cooked on woodstoves, are generous and savory (homemade bread and
muffins are the rule) but not gourmet. Entertainment is homegrown.
Foss reads poems and short stories to his passengers after dinner,
for instance, while other captains play the guitar or organize sea
chantey singalongs.
</P>
<P>
   All of the dozen or so windjammers in the fleet have a lobster
bake during each cruise, usually on an uninhabited island. You'll
never know just how good a Maine lobster can taste until you've
eaten one cooked in a bucket of seawater on the beach of a
lupine-speckled island in Penobscot Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Windjammers themselves are as indigenous to the Maine coast as
lobsters and a century ago seemed nearly as common. Today, the
fleet is unique. Nowhere else in the world will you find such a
concentration of passenger-carrying sailing ships as along
mid-coast Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the windjammers are veterans of the age of sail and
began as coastal cargo carriers. The oldest, the Lewis R. French,
was launched in Christmas Cove, Maine, in 1871 and has been
carrying timber and passengers along the Maine coast ever since.
The Stephen Taber was built as a coastal schooner on Long Island in
the same year. Both are listed on the National Historic Register.
</P>
<P>
   The 132-foot-long Victory Chimes, built in 1900 to carry lumber
around Chesapeake Bay, accommodates 40 passengers and is the
largest passenger sailing vessel under the American flag. It is
also the last three-masted schooner on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It's often difficult, at least for a landlubber, to tell a
modern windjammer _ one built to carry passengers, not freight _
from a historic one. For instance, the 30-passenger Heritage,
launched in 1983 at North End shipyard in Rockland, has
contemporary comforts but the sturdy lines of a traditional
19th-century Maine coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Although banded together in the Maine Windjammer Association,
schooners are individually owned by their captains (frequently a
husband and wife team) and have distinctive characters. Each almost
always boasts an eventful history.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about American Eagle's background and Foss smiles.
``She's 70 years old,'' he says, ``and is one of the last
Gloucester fishing schooners.'' Launched in Gloucester, Mass., in
1930, the American Eagle was a commercial fishing vessel on Georges
Banks off the New England coast for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Foss bought the 24-passenger schooner in 1983 and completely

   The windjammers are based in Rockland, Camden, and Rockport, but
all of them, along with visiting tall ships, will pass in review
during Rockland's Schooner Days and North Atlantic Blues Festival,
July 7-9. Any windjammer under sail is a beautiful sight, but
watching a parade of them with all flags flying is an experience.

to seek out another sportswriter. That, apparently, is what Walter
Matthau did. Oddly enough, Matthau, the Tony-award and Academy

FAR FROM GLOOMY, OSLO'S UP FOR A CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO _ In 1950, Oslo celebrated its 900th anniversary. This
year, it's proudly and unabashedly celebrating its 1,000th.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Norwegians can't do the math. This skinny,
underpopulated country on the west coast of Scandinavia has an
excellent educational system. The reason for the rewrite of history
is that researchers found some thousand-year-old records of the
city's existence in time for Oslo's millennium to coincide
conveniently with the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Norway's educational system includes nine years of English,
starting in the third grade, so don't be surprised if the staff in
your hotel speaks better English than you do, which helps make a
visit there uncomplicated.
</P>
<P>
   About the hotels. Oslo boasts grand, pricey places to stay.
Instead, I chose two that were small, moderately priced,
beautifully decorated, and run by some of the most helpful hotel
employees I've encountered anywhere. The first was the Frogner
House Hotel, northwest of the historic center of town, an
exquisitely converted Art Deco building. The second was the more
modern Noble House, right in the heart of the old city.
</P>
<P>
   The bountiful breakfast buffet at the Frogner House included
shrimp, cheeses, cold cuts, yogurt, fruits and vegetables _ enough
to keep you going 'til dinner, skipping lunch. (Guide books
actually advise this strategy, warning that Oslo is hideously
expensive. I actually thought it quite reasonable by the standards
of European capitals.) The Noble House buffet was equally lavish:
no shrimp, though, which thwarted my goal of eating my favorite
shellfish three meals a day.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian food used to have a reputation for being boring. But,
as London has in recent years, Oslo has developed into something of
a culinary center. Not surprisingly, fish and seafood are the
stars, along with local specialties like reindeer and cloudberries,
which turn up on the menus of both modern Scandinavian restaurants
like the elegant _ and expensive _ Feinschmecker, and at
traditional haunts like the famous Theater Cafe. Located on the
ground floor of the Hotel Continental, the Theater Cafe has
sumptuous Art Nouveau decor, a piano and violin duo playing on a
balcony, a lunch menu heavy on open-faced sandwiches that are works
of art in themselves, and a view of the National Theater across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1899, the elegant neoclassical playhouse is famed for
its stagings of works by Norway's greatest playwright, Henrik
Ibsen. They're performed in Norwegian, naturally, which limits
their appeal to tourists. Dance, on the other hand, is a universal
language. I caught a Norwegian National Ballet performance of
Robert Sund's ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' at Oslo's Opera House,
a modernist facility buried ignominiously inside a shopping center,
with no on-street presence. The performance, on the other hand, was
of international caliber, the dancers fresh and well-trained, and
ticket prices far lower than those at major opera houses in either
Europe or America.
</P>
<P>
   Oslo is a casual city, and even though this was opening night
for the ballet production, few people were in anything approaching
formal attire; hardly any men even wore jackets. What also struck
me was that the cloakroom was an unguarded, unlocked row of hangers
along a wall; the protective precautions that are routine in other
countries don't exist here.
</P>
<P>
   About the only hazard I encountered in what seems the safest of
cities was the traditional high thresholds between rooms, which had
me constantly stumbling, especially in middle-of-the-night trips to
the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   I walked everywhere _ except for a 10-minute ferry trip that
left from the pier in front of Oslo's Radhuset, the City Hall, a
blocky pair of 1930s brick towers in socialist modernist style. The
Radhuset was originally supposed to have murals by Norway's most
famous painter, Edvard Munch, who ultimately lost the commission to
a nonentity: Munch's politics weren't sufficiently socialist.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of my brief boat excursion across the Oslo Fjord was
the Bygdoy peninsula, which deserves an entire day. Here are
several museums devoted to Norway's seafaring traditions and to its
architecture, all within easy walking distance of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Best of the lot is the simplest: The Viking Ship Museum, which
displays three ships nearly 1,200 years old, excavated from burial
mounds along the fjord. Like the ancient Egyptians before them,
Vikings buried their rulers in boats, with all the equipment they'd
need for the afterlife, everything from jewelry to textiles to
weapons to exquisite gilt bronze mounts for horses. Much of this is
handsomely displayed in cases in the museum. But the main
attraction is the trio of wooden boats. Best preserved is the
Oseberg ship, the burial place of a high-ranking woman and her
attendant. A narrow, attenuated shape more than 60 feet long, it
culminates at either end in graceful spirals with an animal's head
on one, its tail on the other. The boat is further adorned with the
carved interlace the peripatetic Vikings borrowed from the Celtic
world. It was, in effect, a floating sculpture, probably used only
for short pleasure journeys. The Tune ship, also in the museum,
ventured farther, hence its severely damaged state. Ragged and
jagged, it looks like a great bird with clipped wings.
</P>
<P>
   The museum itself is shaped like a cathedral, with the boats in
what would be the nave and transept, their darkened woods
silhouetted against austere white walls. It's a breathtaking
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bygdoy attractions commemorate more recent expeditions by
adventurous Norwegians. The Fram Museum was literally erected
around the Fram polar ship, built in 1892, a vessel that made many
daring journeys, the most famous of which was Roald Amundsen's
voyage to Antarctica; in 1911 Amundsen became the first man to
reach the South Pole. The museum's multilingual wall texts help you
understand what he went through, as does boarding the boat itself,
which you're allowed to do. Fur underwear hanging in the tiny
cabins indicates some of the discomfort of life on board; so does
the infirmary, with its surgical tools that perhaps amputated
frost-bitten limbs. The numerous whiskey bottles must have
comforted home-sick sailors, as did domestic touches like a pillow
embroidered by a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, the Kon-Tiki Museum looks like a Polynesian
restaurant in a strip mall. Inside, it tells the fascinating saga
of Norway's most illustrious 20th-century explorer, Thor Heyerdahl,
who in 1947 journeyed from Peru to Polynesia on a ``ship'' that
amounted to a balsa raft to prove that the first Polynesians had
come from South America. There's a surprise ``underwater'' room
here, that, courtesy of some glass walls, places you underneath the
raft, staring at ``sharks'' that look big enough to tip it over _
and giving you a sense of Heyerdahl's gutsiness.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Bygdoy's attractions is the Norwegian Folk Museum,
the equivalent of Old Sturbridge Village, Colonial Williamsburg, or
Stockholm's Skansen. This collection of more than 150 buildings
gathered from all over Norway was something of a disappointment:
There are an awful lot of weathered farmhouses of similar vintage
and style, many growing picturesque grass roofs and supported on
narrow pedestals. Unlike most of Oslo's attractions, the Folk
Museum is sadly lacking in interpretive materials in any language,
and there weren't many staff around to help us. The resident potter
wasn't potting; the weaver wasn't weaving. The high point of the
vast place for me was the circa 1200 Stave Church, a tall, narrow
type of building unique to Norway. Stave churches look like the
keels of Viking ships; their tiered roofs sprout carvings that
project boldly outward, like the Vikings themselves. These
buildings may have been the country's first major examples of
Christian architecture, but they are adorned with decidedly pagan
imagery, including gargoyle-like dragon heads. There are 32
surviving Stave churches, named for the narrow strips of wood that
hold them up; being inside the one in the Folk Museum was like
entering a treehouse; the darkness of the ruggedly carved wood was
alleviated only by paintings of saints and a ``Last Supper'' in the
apse.

   TAKE-BOS  
 OSLO, Sweden: ... the apse.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oslo boasts more than 50 museums, several devoted to a single
artist. Most famous of these is the Munch Museum, repository of the
more than 1,100 paintings and thousands of works on paper that the
artist bequeathed to the city on his death in 1944. It took until
1963 for the city to open a museum to house them. In the United
States, Munch's most famous painting, ``The Scream,'' along with
Garrison Keillor's monologues on Norwegian bachelor farmers, have
contributed to the impression that Norwegians are a gloomy lot.
They're not; nor are Munch's expressionist canvases all
angst-ridden, as the museum's vast selection demonstrates.
</P>
<P>
   Munch is famous worldwide. Gustav Vigeland is not. The quality
of Vigeland's art is questionable, but his ambition sure isn't.
Like Munch, Vigeland donated all his work to Oslo _ but he got a
far better deal, one of the most subsidized situations an artist
has ever enjoyed. In the 1920s, two decades before his death, the
city built him a huge studio and residence that eventually became
his museum and mausoleum: His ashes rest in the brick building's
tower.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the Vigeland Museum is Vigeland Park _
which contains 212 larger-than-life figurative sculptures in
bronze, granite, and wrought iron, all designed by the artist, as
was the layout of the park itself. This mind-boggling array,
executed in a staunch socialist style, forms a catalog of human
postures and gestures, including some you can't believe people
could actually perform: One man balances no fewer than four
toddlers on his arms and one lifted leg. Then there's the
``Sinnataggen,'' a little nude boy having a temper tantrum,
Vigeland's best-loved work and Oslo's equivalent of Brussels'
``Mannequin Pis.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the city's other museums, I particularly enjoyed the National
Gallery, which puts Munch in the context of his lesser
contemporaries and makes you appreciate him all the more; and the
National Museum of Contemporary Art and the Astrup Fearnley Museum
of Modern Art. The last two work Norwegian artists into an
international mix _ with mixed success.
</P>
<P>
   I stayed in Oslo for more than a week _ an amount of time some
friends thought bizarrely long, especially since I didn't go on the
almost-obligatory fjord cruise or do much of anything at all
outdoorsy, except walk miles each day and revel in the cleanest,
crispest air of any city I've visited in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegians are nature-lovers par excellence, who spend as much
time outdoors as possible, and who revere the remoter parts of
their country. I met one Norwegian who proudly told me he had to be
helicoptered to his rural cabin because there was no other access
to it. I congratulated him and moved on to the next museum, in the
company of my traveling companion, a woman whose anxiety level
rises as the ratio of people to trees drops.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegians see red, the dominant color of the country's flag, on
May 17 _ and so does anyone else who happens to be in the country
for this holiday that's the equivalent of our Fourth of July. It
marks Norway's 1814 declaration of independence from Denmark,
although independence wasn't exactly complete: Norway was then
united with Sweden, an arrangement that lasted until 1905. Even
then, Norway invited a new king with both Swedish and Danish
ancestry to rule the country.
</P>
<P>
   Except a few restaurants, everything's closed for May 17, and
everyone takes to the streets for the traditional parade _ which is
utterly charming. Many people wear the national dress that's
recently enjoyed a renaissance in popularity: long, full skirts
with lots of embroidery, spangly brooches, aprons and shawls for
the women; knee-length pants for the men, with short jackets
frequently adorned with brocade lapels. Only the ubiquitous cell
phones and cigarettes _ Norway, like most of Europe, is still a
smoking country _ dilute the quaintness.
</P>
<P>
   No display of military might here; no soldiers, tanks or
fly-overs. Instead, the parade is all children, with a sprinkling
of adult chaperones. It seems like all of Oslo's half million
citizens are in attendance, slowly making their way up Karl
Johansgate, the city's central spine, which ends in the park around
the Royal Palace, or ``Slottet,'' a somber neoclassical pile where
Norway's popular royals stand on the balcony and spend the day
waving. Hour after hour they go on; you could forgive them for
donning prosthetic arms for the occasion or hiring stand-in wavers
to spell them. The crowd is dense, but everyone's so polite there's
no pushing and shoving, no sense of claustrophobia. And at the end
of the long march, the thousands of children who participated are
awarded blue paper diplomas that they wear around their necks,
evidence they've all passed Parade 101.

BATTLING BANDS ARE BACK IN STYLE

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can't we all just get along?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for fireworks this Fourth of July need look no
further than many of today's rock and rap acts who seem to spend as
much time dumping on each other as they spend making music.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Mike Tyson vs. Lennox Lewis _ not to mention the
nonexistent Lewis children Tyson has threatened to devour. These
days, the most entertaining fight cards feature Limp Bizkit vs.
Creed, Lil' Kim vz. Foxy Brown, Noel Gallagher vs. Liam Gallagher,
and of course, Eminem vs. Everybody Who Isn't a White Rapper Named
Eminem.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the feuds are more entertaining than anything
these people are putting out there musically.
</P>
<P>
   Such feuds have always been as much a part of the music business
as groupies and drug problems. There were imagined rivalries
between the Beatles and Rolling Stones, but there were real battles
between such artists as Neil Young and Lynyrd Skynyrd. After Young
skewered a legacy of racism and slavery below the Mason-Dixie line
in ``Southern Man,'' Skynyrd's Ronnie Van Zant sang ``Well, I hope
Neil Young will remember/ A Southern man don't need him around
anyhow,'' on ``Sweet Home Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Lighting up your enemies on record Van Zandt-style is still a
favored mode of retribution, especially among rappers. LL Cool J
and Kool Moe Dee worked each other's nerves back in the 1980s, 3rd
Base tore up Vanilla Ice on ``Pop Goes the Weasel,'' and Former
N.W.A. founders Dr. Dre and Eazy-E torched each other repeatedly,
and Dre even dogged Eazy (as well as record exec Jerry Heller) in
the hilarious ``Dre Day'' video.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was rather light-hearted, like a spirited round of
the dozens, until it seemed some folks were about to resort to
settling scores like Michael Corleone in ``The Godfather.'' Tupac,
convinced Biggie tried to wax him outside a New York recording
studio, went after Notorious B.I.G., his wife Faith Evans, Puffy,
and anybody else down with Bad Boy Records on ``Hit 'Em Up,'' one
of the most devastating and angry rap records ever. By the time
both Tupac and Biggie wound up murdered within six months of each
other, all this bad blood had turned toxic, and everyone was
calling for a truce.
</P>
<P>
   But removed from the gunshots and the bloodshed, good ol'
fussin' and fightin' is back in style. You can hardly pick up a
music magazine, or see an MTV newsbreak or video without catching
the latest about who's dissin' whom. Here's a scorecard:
</P>
<P>
   At last week's ``Dysfunctional Family Picnic'' in New York, Limp
Bizkit's Fred Durst ripped into Creed singer Scott Stapp. As Bizkit
guitarist Wes Borland tore into the opening riff of ``Break
Stuff,'' Durst went off on Stapp. ``That guy is an egomaniac,'' he
said. ``He's a (expletivin') punk, and he's back backstage right
now acting like he's (expletivin') Michael Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst, who in some quarters might be himself considered both a
punk and egomaniac, then encouraged the audience to get blankets
and pillows for Creed's set. Stapp said, ``It takes a lot more guts
to say something to somebody than from behind their back,'' then
accused Durst of ``manipulating the media and the truth by using
Creed as a scapegoat for his own immature and egotistical
actions.'' Durst has since responded with ``What I said about Creed
I meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Trent Reznor and Marilyn Manson (who recently kissed
and made up) trash Michael Stipe, Billy Corgan, and especially
Courtney Love in Reznor's ``Starsuckers, Inc.'' video; Britney
``I'm Prettier and Sexier'' Spears and Christina ``Perhaps, But I
Can Actually Sing'' Aguilera make veiled snipes about each other in
interviews. Stephan Jenkins of Third Eye Blind calls Rob Thomas of
Matchbox Twenty ``fat,'' eventually apologizes, then, according to
Thomas, makes more nasty comments.
</P>
<P>
   And in the battling brothers tradition of Ray and Dave Davies of
the Kinks, and Chris and Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes, there
are the brothers Gallagher. Clean and sober Noel left his band
Oasis mid-tour rather than put up with the antics of his
hard-drinking baby brother, Liam, or as Noel has taken to calling
him these days, ``Monkey Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone in the name-calling department, Lil' Kim found
some time to pop off about her archrival in nastiness, Foxy Brown,
at the release party for her long-awaited (and quite
underwhelming)new CD, ``The Notorious K.I.M.'' When asked recently
if there were any ill feelings between her and Foxy, Kim said, ``We
don't have a problem. I don't think about her. I don't care about
her, because I don't deal with the Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm, now I know what the ``B'' in Kim's nickname _ Queen Bee _
really stands for. It's your serve, Foxy.

   One of Alice's adventures in Wonderland takes the form of a
race. When it is over, she asks who has won. ``Everybody has won,''
the judge, a dodo, replies, ``and all must have prizes.'' The race
to sequence the human genome _ or, rather, to claim the credit for
sequencing it _ is now over. So the White House's dodo-in-chief,
Bill Clinton, has duly awarded prizes to everybody. But let's not
forget that this particular race was not to the finish-line, but to
the starting-line. Knowing the sequence is really just the

   His strategy for winning last weekend's parliamentary election
in Zimbabwe was worse than a crime. It was a mistake. Ready to
wreck the country in order to hold on to power, Zimbabwe's
president, Robert Mugabe, ruthlessly tried to refight the
liberation war, encouraged brutal intimidation of the opposition,
played the race card against whites, and promised to seize their
land and give it to landless blacks. Mugabe believes his right to
rule is absolute; Zimbabwe's voters beg to differ. For their sake,
his party, ZANU, could do itself and Zimbabwe a favor by dumping
Mugabe now. &QL;

   It used to be said that every foreign article about Japanese

of policies. After the poll on June 25, the same can be said again.
But there is a difference: once, this saying was a compliment

   DENVER, COLO. _ Thank God for Greens. Amid the general po-faced
seriousness of American politics, here is a party that doesn't dare
to be dull. One pony-tailed wannabe presidential candidate from
Tennessee says that he hasn't smoked pot with Al Gore for a long
time. Another, named Jello Biafra, wants a maximum wage _ around
$200,000, he thought, should suffice _ and the abolition of both
the CIA and sports-utility vehicles (SUVs). And delegates in formal
evening wear carried placards saying ``Billionaires for Bush and
Gore. We bought the election so you don't have to.'' &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ The nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court are
famously shy of the limelight, preferring to announce their most
politically contentious decisions on the very last day of their
nine-month term and then go off on vacation, leaving a swirl of
controversy behind them. They did it again on June 28, in four
split rulings, capping a term littered with attention-grabbing
cases. It coincided with a presidential election year. Inevitably,
this has raised the question: how much impact can the next
president have on the direction of the Supreme Court? A lot. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Politics has few rules, especially in an election

century, party bosses paid the ultimate compliment to the brand-new
system of industrial mass-production by inventing ``machine
politics.'' Now that commercial America is in love with the
Internet, when will that, too, turn politics upside down? Is a
handshake still more potent than a Web page? &QL;

the six-year-old boy shipwrecked off Florida last November, who
finally returned to Cuba with his father on June 28. But his hopes
that his victory would prompt bigger changes in American policy
towards Cuba _ particularly the trade embargo imposed in 1960 _

   MEXICO CITY _ The last four presidential terms have ended in
economic turbulence, but this time it is going to be different. So
Mexican officials have sworn and, until recently, investors had
believed them. But a bout of nerves that began last month seems to
be worsening. This week the peso fell, briefly, to its lowest point
since February 1999. It is not just political uncertainty over this
weekend's election that is to blame. Investors are also worried
about the effect on Mexico of a hard landing in the United States,
which takes 90 percent of its exports. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ It looks increasingly likely that the eventual
replacement for the internal-combustion engine in motor vehicles
will be the fuel cell. This is a device that reacts hydrogen and
oxygen together to release electrical energy. Environmentalists
like it, because its exhaust is water. And, after some initial
hesitation, the world's car makers are now investing heavily in
turning it into a practical reality. The latest prototype comes
from General Motors, which hopes to get its first fuel-cell-powered
car into the showrooms by 2004. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Live by the sword, die by the sword. In less than two
decades, Bernie Ebbers made his way from small-time motels to
big-time telecoms, eventually controlling a third of America's
long-distance calling and nearly as much of its Internet traffic
through his empire, Worldcom. Last year he crowned his run with a
deal that was then the biggest in history: a $115 billion bid for
Sprint, America's third-largest long-distance carrier and perhaps
its best wireless firm. But on June 27, the streak ended: Sprint
was one acquisition too many. Both America's Department of Justice
and the European Union's regulatory authorities moved to block the
deal. &QL;

   RACE-HIP-HOP (Undated) _ Billy Wimsatt, 27, was born as rap
music was being invented by blacks and Latinos in the South Bronx.
What began as party music became their cry of ghetto pain and their
great hope for a way out. And as hip-hop _ not just rap music but
fashion, break-dancing, graffiti and the magazines that chronicle
it all _ blossomed into the radiant center of youth culture, Billy
Wimsatt and lots of other white kids found in it a way to flee
their own orderly world by discovering a sexier, more provocative
one. Like many young hip-hop heads, he regarded hip-hop, with its
appeal to whites and blacks, as a bold modern hope to ease some of
the abrasiveness between the races. Elliott Wilson, a young black
man, had never met Billy Wimsatt, but their lives had traced
similar trajectories across the hip-hop landscape. As a writer and
editor, he too had spent much of his adult life thinking about
hip-hop. And not just hip-hop, but race and hip-hop. Race was
unavoidable in hip-hop. Hip-hop had inspired him to believe that,
precisely because he was black, he could achieve what whites simply
assumed was theirs by birthright _ a gainful life over which he
asserted control. By N.R. Kleinfield. (6775 words, plus an abridged

   BANK-RESTORE (New York) _ Some relationships sag during a move
and, when a drawn-out renovation is added, some collapse altogether
from the strain. But Laura Bohn and Richard Fiore never seem
happier than when they are abandoning one renovated apartment to
overhaul the next. They have teamed up on seven renovations,
starting with the apartment Ms. Bohn was living in when Mr. Fiore
met her 21 years ago. Three years ago, they took on their riskiest
project. They bought a bank. The gamble was a true test of personal
and professional ties. Only the stout of heart would spend $2
million on a 1907 Beaux-Arts bank, with landmark status and an
address at Eighth Avenue and 14th Street, and then invest nearly
$10 million more to convert it to condos, with a penthouse for
themselves on top that would pay for itself. By Julie Iovine.

   MOORE-HOUSE (Royal Oak, Md.) _ As the architect behind the $81
million renovation of the Library of Congress, Arthur Cotton Moore
would seem to be an expert on coordinating complex projects. But
his own home here, some 50 miles east of Washington, was almost his
undoing. On the lawn behind the house lie several 30-foot-long
curved steel girders. Has Moore acquired a Richard Serra sculpture?
``Actually,'' he explained, ``those are some of the pieces that
didn't work.'' Pieces, that is, of Moore's house, in which 77
girders _ many of which are curved and all of which were usable
only if correctly formed to within one-sixteenth of an inch _
collide. Assembling the house, in a style Moore has dubbed
``industrial baroque,'' took more than nails. As Moore's wife,
Patricia, observed, ``Other people have a family doctor; we have a
family welder.'' By Fred Bernstein.

&HT;     DESIGNER'S CLOTHING BRINGS OUT LUXURY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Zang Toi's custom-made Manolo Blahnik croc
slides are cutting holes in his feet and his Band-Aids are coming
loose. ``The day I got these, I walked 27 blocks. Not smart,'' he
says giggling.
</P>
<P>
   Zang giggles a lot. He's probably one of the more joyful of the
New York fashion pack, and his exuberant designs are a reflection
of his penchant for surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The new collection for fall 2000, which he previewed recently at
Nordstrom's, could be subtitled: The Ivana. On the runway, his
models were Ivana Trump clones with their hair fouffed up in
beehives with full bangs. (Even Ivanka, Ivana and The Donald's
teen-age daughter, who has modeled for Zang for the past couple of
years, was made up to look like her mom _ no big jump there). These
are definitely big blond girl duds _ Easter-egg colors like
lavender, buttercup and dusty rose done up in expensive cashmere
tweeds, paired with custom-dyed mink collars and cuffs, and
off-the-scale in chic and cost.
</P>
<P>
   Suits are cut very classically with well-tailored shoulders and
nipped-in waists. More often than not, there is a simple bathrobe
tie closure of two beltlike strips that attach to the back of the
jacket with two buttons at the waist. Trims are small bands of
custom-dyed mink. Pants are hip-riders that ease down into
boot-cut, cuffless bottoms. (Zang showed mink-trimmed, sky-high
mules with them _ lavender fluffs with his knee-length, lavender
mink-collared coat with matching cashmere turtleneck _
scrumptious.)
</P>
<P>
   There is an entire grouping of what I call ``Palomino'' clothes
_ cashmere trouser suits in a grayed-down oatmeal beige worn with
the sheerest woven cashmere blouse and matching shawl that means
business _ or at least, would look sensational alighting from a G-3
or the first-class section of Air France. My goodness, does this
man adore unbridled luxury!
</P>
<P>
   ``These are gorgeous clothes for gorgeous girls,'' explains
Zang, who has decided that since he's in California, he's going to
dress that way. The long-haired, Malaysia-born Chinese designer is
in cream linen shorts, his slightly uncomfortable croc slides, a
white T-shirt and a deliciously thick, cream cashmere cardigan
covered with floral embroideries. Zang's main inspiration for this
collection _ which is divided between colorful suits, coats and
dresses for daytime and a black-and-white, luxuriously beaded
take-off on St. Laurent's slightly butch ``Le Smoking'' tuxedo look
for night _ is Monte Carlo, circa 1955: ``The days when Princess
Grace and Liz Taylor were there,'' he says, ``just like the opening
of a James Bond movie _ all those ice princesses fighting for the
attention of Sean Connery.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the night collection that is the most elegant. While
Easter-egg colors for fall may not be to every brunette's taste,
you can't go wrong with simple black-and-white, black velvet or
black cashmere sweaters trimmed with silvery embroideries and
flashing crystals. It's divine sweater and skirt dressing _
particularly the plain black sweater with elaborately jeweled cuffs
and a form-fitting, floor-length ball skirt. Tight to the knees, it
flares out in a plethora of pleats that fall into a stunning train.
``Entrance'' is written all over this ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Zang is not above a bit of bawdy humor. The evening collection
does feature a voluminous black velvet skirt worn over jeweled
hot-pants _ but the opening, for showing off those hot-pants, is in
the back. ``When you see a woman walking toward you, she's elegant
and classic,'' Zang says. ``But when she walks away _ well,'' he
giggles, ``it's quite naughty.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years ago, Zang came to the United States from Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, to study at Parson's School of Design in New
York. Of his classmates, only he and Marc Jacobs went independent
with their own signature lines. ``I really have learned to design
for my ladies,'' says Zang. ``I know who they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the end of the day, this is still a business. And, yes,
this collection is very expensive, sort of on the snobbish side. I
want the women who can afford it to feel special.''
</P>
<P>
   As Zang is talking, he is seated at a desk writing up an order.
A petite, 40-ish woman has just finished spending close to $40,000
for five or six outfits including an elaborately beaded black
velvet skirt worn with a black cashmere U-backed sweater trimmed
with black fox. She has also ordered what Zang calls his ``Sharon
Stone'' coat _ a simple, slim black velvet, one-button,
floor-length opera coat (to be worn over skinny pants or a straight
skirt) with a huge black fox collar. Zang says, ``I love Sharon.
She's a very classy lady.'' He is still in a tizzy over the massive
bowl of red tulips she sent to his atelier after a particularly
hurried order.
</P>
<P>
   There are two words that keep cropping up in Zang's vocabulary:
classicism and drama, the two elements he has gleaned from his
adoration of Yves St. Laurent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is my hero,'' Zang says emphatically. ``He was the only
designer who was able to do classic clothes in the daytime and then
drama at night. How many designers can you find who can tailor the
perfect suit for daytime and come up with such inspired fantasy at
night? Ten years from now, I'd like to be the American designer who
does this kind of quality.''

 &HT;    DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Happiest childhood memory is an icy
pool in a Georgia pasture
 &HT;    (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Carolyn W. Burson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWNAN, Ga. -- ``Heaven's Gate.'' That's what we called the gate
to the fenced-in pasture surrounding the swimming pool on McKoy
Place.
</P>
<P>
   The pool was owned by the Jackson family, who lived across from
the pasture on the unpaved street that dead-ended at their barn.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was the only pool in town in the early 1930s, and while
the general public paid admission, the people who lived on the
short street could go in free.
</P>
<P>
   I was 7 years old when my family moved to McKoy Place. I
couldn't believe we had lucked up on such a fantastic thing as a
pool, particularly our very own.
</P>
<P>
   Before, daddy had taken my older brother and sisters and me
swimming at Warm Springs, Ga., where President Franklin D.
Roosevelt visited and where he eventually built the Little White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Those were fun times, but not like the fun I had at the
Jackson's pool.
</P>
<P>
   With the Great Depression in full swing, my parents might not
have always known where our next meal was coming from, but I was
unaware of the hard times.
</P>
<P>
   As long as I had a plate of mama's wonderful biscuits smothered
with milk gravy and a piece of streak-o-lean on the side, I was
happy because I knew I could go to the swimming pool as soon as I
finished eating.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, I would come home only to eat, and then
would head back to that celestial place.
</P>
<P>
   And I didn't need a store-bought bathing suit. Mama made mine
out of old wool sweaters, hand-me-downs that were no longer
wearable.
</P>
<P>
   The pool had a cement bottom and wooden sides and was filled by
the coldest spring water you ever stuck your big toe in.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it would be muddy, but we couldn't care less, as long
as we could jump off the small diving board or dog paddle in the
icy water.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of snakes in the deepest part didn't bother me, either. I
believed my sisters when they said snakes couldn't bite you under
water.
</P>
<P>
   Those two hot summers I spent cooling off in that pool will live
in my memory as the most wonderful times of my childhood.
</P>
<P>
   But when my baby brother was born, we needed a bigger house and
that was when we moved from McKoy Place.
</P>
<P>
   I never went back swimming in the Jackson's pool, but instead
had to be content to play in a dammed-up creek in the pasture next
to our new home. A couple of years later a city pool would open.
</P>
<P>
   The dead-end street known as McKoy Place was eventually opened
up to make way for a fashionable subdivision, and is now Alpine
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   All that is left of that heavenly realm is a small stream and a
big gap in the side of a hill where the pool was.
</P>

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: The U.S. Postal Service has been advertising a new series of
baseball stamps. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Legends of Baseball series will be dedicated officially
and issued July 6 in Atlanta in conjunction with Major League
Baseball's All-Star Week. They'll be available at post offices
nationwide starting July 7. The stamp designs were unveiled May 4
at Busch Stadium in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps will honor Roberto Clemente, Ty Cobb, Mickey
Cochrane, Eddie Collins, Dizzy Dean, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Josh
Gibson, Lefty Grove, Rogers Hornsby, Walter Johnson, Christy
Mathewson, Satchel Paige, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth, George
Sisler, Tris Speaker, Pie Traynor, Honus Wagner and Cy Young. These
players were honored last season as part of Major League Baseball's
``All-Century Team'' program.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service will print 200 million of the self-adhesive
33-cent stamps. For information: 1-800-782-6724 or online at
www.stampsonline.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the earlier part of the 20th century, an employee of the
U. S. Patent Office made this comment: ``Everything that can be
invented has been invented.'' Can you provide the name of that
person, and the context for this remark?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's some disagreement about whether it actually happened,
but the Chambers Dictionary of Quotations says
</P>
<P>
   Charles H. Duell, commissioner of the Office of Patents, wrote a
letter in 1899 to President William McKinley making that comment to
bolster his contention that an Office of Patents was no longer
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If a person pays Social Security taxes, but dies before
becoming eligible to receive benefits, what happens to that money?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the person has survivors who meet eligibility
requirements, benefits may be paid to them. Otherwise, the money
paid in taxes goes into the Social Security's pool of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Agency spokeswoman Patti Patterson explained that Social
Security is a national system of social insurance under which
employers, employees and self-employed people pay Social Security
taxes. These taxes paid on a worker's earnings are not placed in a
specific account for the individual worker, but are pooled in
special funds.
</P>
<P>
   These funds, as Patterson pointed out, are used to pay benefits
to workers and their families because of the loss of earnings due
to retirement, disability or death.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article in the June 25 Parade magazine said the number of
Americans killed in action in the Korean War had recently been
revised from more than 50,000 to fewer than 40,000. This appears to
be a drastic revision. What's the explanation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Pentagon is saying the error's primary culprit was an
anonymous government clerk.
</P>
<P>
   The higher figure cropped up shortly after both sides declared
the truce in 1953, and had been repeated erroneously ever since. It
even was endorsed by Encyclopedia Britannica and engraved on the
Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the bureacrat mistakenly added all
nonbattlefield U.S. military deaths that occurred worldwide during
the three-year war to the more than 33,000 number of U.S.
battlefield dead in Korea. But only 3,275 of those nonbattlefield
deaths _ largely due to accidents or disease _ occurred in Korea.
That yields the newly revised death count.
</P>
<P>
   All service historian offices have been advised about the
revision and have agreed with it, the Pentagon stated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the term ``jaywalking'' originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's derived from the ``belligerent and defiant'' jaybird,
accordingiant'' category because they cross the street without
heeding traffic laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins'' offers
a somewhat different version, tracing it to the era when
automobiles first came into use, and saying the term incorporates
``walking'' with the slang term ``jay,'' meaning a stupid,
inexperienced hick. The encyclopedia, which says ``jaywalker'' was
first recorded in 1917, also links the term to jaybirds, ``commonly
identified with rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will our next elected president be scheduled to choose a new
U.S. Supreme Court justice during his term?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no ``schedule,'' as such. Justices have lifetime
terms of office, and vacancies occur only when a justice dies,
resigns, retires, or removed through impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On average, a vacancy has occurred every two years, at least
since 1937 and the passage of an enhanced retirement option for the
justices. In that sense, the court is overdue, since the last
vacancy occurred in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It's widely expected that the next president may make as many as
three appointments to the Supreme Court. A log of possible nominees
in either a Gore or Bush administration can be found online at this
Web site: http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/supremecourt.htmJustices.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the process of vacancies and filling them can be
found online at
http://rodan.asu.edu/(tilde)george/vacancy/vacancy.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Taxpayers for Common Sense and National Wildlife
Federation recently ranked the 10 worst Army Corps of Engineers
projects. What are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: (1) East Arkansas Irrigation Projects (Arkansas); (2)
Delaware River Deepening (Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania);
(3) Upper Mississippi River Lock Expansions (Illinois, Iowa,
Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin); (4) Big Sunflower River
Dredging and Yazoo Pump (Mississippi); (5) Oregon Inlet Jetties
(North Carolina); (6) Apalachicola River Navigation (Alabama,
Florida and Georgia); (7) Lower Snake River Navigation (Idaho and
Washington); (8) Savannah Harbor expansion (Georgia and South
Carolina); (9) New Jersey Beach Replenishment (New Jersey); (10)
Long Island Beach Replenishment (New York).

</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened in a class-action lawsuit against
Publishers Clearing House? I didn't see anything about a resolution
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   A: The case is still tied up in the courts. It was reported in
February that U.S. District Judge G. Patrick Murphy in East St.
Louis, Ill., approved a $30 million settlement in a class action
lawsuit that accused Publishers Clearing House of misleading
sweepstakes entrants. The suit claimed the company duped people
into buying magazines by falsely leading them to believe it would
increase their chances of winning millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   After the settlement was announced, two California lawyers who
had been barred from the case appealed the settlement, meaning any
payment to the people eligible to get money back in the lawsuit
would have to wait up to 12 months. Murphy, meanwhile, said he
would impose sanctions against the lawyers, who he said tried to
enter the lawsuit just to delay the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Then in March Virginia's attorney general sued Publishers
Clearing House over its sales tactics, and Maryland's attorney
general was reported to be investigating the company in preparation
for filing an administrative complaint, rather than a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Any settlement is certain to be reported widely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is former ice skater Debi Thomas doing these days? I
haven't seen her on the pro skating circuit.
</P>
<P>
   A: She's Dr. Debi Thomas now. After she won the bronze medal in
the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta _ coming in third
after East Germany's Katarina Witt, who won the gold, and Canada's
Elizabeth Manley, silver _ Thomas left Stanford University, saying
she had no place to skate there. She moved to Colorado, got
married, but later divorced. She finished medical school at
Northwestern University, specializing in orthopedic surgery, and at
last report was living in Arkansas with her second husband and
their son.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who had emphatically said ``No way'' when asked if she
would compete in an Olympics again after 1988, didn't immediately
abandon the sport, however. In 1990, she joined Jim Simpson and
Peter Carruthers in the TBS broadcasting booth for the Goodwill
Games, winning praise for her poise and professionalism. And in
1996 she was in the cast of the Holiday on Ice production of
``Nutcracker,'' which toured in five cities, not including Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the most rainfall ever recorded in, say, 24 hours,
anywhere in the world? And where did that occur?
</P>
<P>
   A: A record 73.62 inches of rain fell in 24 hours in Cilaos,
Reunion, an island in the western Indian Ocean southwest of
Mauritius, on March 15-16, 1952. For a calendar month, the record
is 366 inches, at Cherrapunji, Meghalaya, India, in July 1861. The
12-month record, 1,041.8 inches, also was set at Cherrapunji, from
August 1860 to August 1861.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the 24-hour record is 43 inches, which
fell on July 25-26, 1979, at Alvin, Texas. Over a 12-month period,
739 inches fell in Kukui, Maui, Hawaii, from December 1981 to
December 1982.

   Q: I'm 73. Is that too old to donate organs?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. There's no upper age limit to be a donor, said Jeff
Al-Mashat of the Georgia Coalition on Donation and Lifelink of
Georgia. The only factors ruling out organ donation are HIV and
active viral hepatitis, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I see ads on TV for Father Joe's Villages. What is that, and
is the man on TV a real priest?
</P>
<P>
   A: The man in the ads isn't an actor. He's Father Joe Carroll,
said Mark Tsuchiya, spokesman for Father Joe's Villages in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The villages' stated mission is to help people in need turn
their lives around and regain independence through ``one-stop
shopping'' _ comprehensive care under one roof, including
education, job training, child care, substance abuse counseling,
and medical and dental care.
</P>
<P>
   It has grown from a small outreach to single homeless men in San
Diego 50 years ago into seven large ``villages'' in California and
Nevada. The prototype, St. Vincent de Paul, now serves more than
2,300 people a day. Another facility, M.A.S.H. (Mobile Assistance
and Shelter for the Homeless), houses 300 single women and families
and a crisis intervention center. The original 35-bed Toussaint
Teen Center is expanding into a 627-acre rural campus as an
alternative to foster care. Other facilities, such as Josue Homes
for people with AIDS, have grown similarly.

   Q: A recent article stated that honorably discharged World War
II veterans could obtain a high school diploma. Who do I contact to
get the form to verify eligibility? I served between Sept. 16,
1940, and Dec. 31, 1946.
</P>
<P>
   A: You must have read about Operation Recognition, a program of
the Massachusetts Department of Veterans' Services, local boards of
education, and school superintendents throughout Massachusetts,
said Tom Thomas of the Department of Veterans Affairs. To date,
about 3,600 diplomas have been awarded in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Similar programs are under way in Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota and
North Carolina, and are being developed in Idaho, Florida,
Wisconsin, California, Texas, Connecticut, South Carolina,
Virginia, West Virginia, Colorado and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've seen and flown aboard various versions of Boeing jet
aircraft, including 707, 727, 737, 747, 757 and 767. Was there ever
a 717?
</P>
<P>
   A: There wasn't a commercial aircraft identified as a 717
between the 707 and 727, if that's what you mean, but there is one
now. (A prior Boeing aircraft initially was designated as the 717,
but was developed into the KC-135 Stratotanker for the Air Force
and wasn't a passenger plane for airline service.)
</P>
<P>
   Boeing calls the 717 _ officially, 717-200 _ the newest member
of its commercial jet airplane family. It was introduced in October
1995 as the McDonnell Douglas MD-95. The twin-jet aircraft has 100
to 106 seats and has been designed specifically for short-hop
service, short-field operations, fast turnaround at airport gates,
and the ability to sustain eight to 12 one-hour flights daily,
Boeing says. Those capabilities make the 717-200 ideal for markets
averaging 300 miles or less, although the plane's basic version has
a nonstop range of 1,580 miles.
</P>
<P>
   With a wingspan of 93.3 feet and overall length of 124 feet, the
717-200 is similar in size and configuration to the previous DC-9
series 30. Boeing has sold more than 140 of the 717s; about 20 have
been delivered to AirTran Airways and other carriers.

<P>
   Q: Jimmy Carter and I served in the Navy ROTC at Georgia Tech at
the same time. He went on to the Naval Academy. How long did he
serve, what did he do, and what rank did he leave with?
</P>
<P>
   A: Carter graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946. He spent his
first two years in the Navy chiefly as an electronics instructor,
first on the USS Wyoming and later on the USS Mississippi,
battleships that were being used to test new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of his period on the Mississippi, Carter
volunteered for submarine duty. He graduated from
submarine-training school in 1948 and was assigned first to the
submarine Pomfret and then, in 1950, to the K-1, a submarine
designed for anti-submarine warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Carter joined a select group of officers who were
developing the world's first nuclear-powered submarines. He became
engineering officer of the nuclear sub Sea Wolf. He served under
Capt. (later Adm.) Hyman Rickover, who pioneered the nuclear
project.
</P>
<P>
   When Carter's father died in 1953 he felt he was needed in
Plains to manage the family business, so he resigned from the Navy
with the rank of lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did the expression ``love'' in tennis come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The Language of Sport'' by Tim Considine says a popular
theory for ``love'' _ which is a score of zero for a player or side
_ holds that it's a corruption of the French l'oeuf, meaning
``egg,'' and ``goose egg'' is a slang term for zero.
</P>
<P>
   However, the book continues, it's more probable that the present
use equates ``love'' with ``nothing,'' as in the expression ``a
labor of love,'' meaning a task performed by a person for nothing
(but love).
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article mentioned that consumers who wish to have their
names and personal information removed from marketing lists can do
so by writing to the Direct Marketing Association. What is the
address, and what information are we supposed to provide?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can register with the name removal file by mailing your
name(s) and home address and signature in a letter or on a postcard
to: Mail Preference Service, Direct Marketing Association, P. O.
Box 9008, Farmingdale, NY 11735-9008.
</P>
<P>
   Only postal mail requests for inclusion are accepted because
signed requests are considered proof that the person submitting the
request is the person whose name is being removed from marketing
lists. E-mail requests are not honored because there's no way to
verify the identity, the association says.
</P>
<P>
   When you register, your name is placed on a ``delete'' file
which is made available to companies four times a year (January,
April, July and October). Not all marketing material will be
eliminated, the marketing association states.
</P>
<P>
   Your name remains on the file for five years. After that, you
must repeat the process if you want to continue to be listed.

   Q: I saw that the official figure for the number of Americans
killed in action in the Korean War had recently been revised from
more than 50,000 to fewer than 40,000. This appears to be a drastic
revision. What's the explanation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Pentagon is saying the error's primary culprit was an
anonymous government clerk. The higher figure of 54,246 (now
revised to 36,940) cropped up shortly after both sides declared the
truce in 1953, and had been repeated erroneously ever since. It
even was endorsed by Encyclopedia Britannica and engraved on the
Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the bureacrat mistakenly added all
nonbattlefield U.S. military deaths that occurred worldwide during
the three-year war to the more than 33,000 U.S. battlefield dead in
Korea. But only 3,275 of those nonbattlefield deaths _ largely due
to accidents or disease _ occurred in Korea. That yields the newly
revised death count.
</P>
<P>
   All service historian offices are in agreement with the
revision, the Pentagon stated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently listed the nation's 10 largest cities by
population within the city limits. However, such artificial limits
don't accurately portray the size of a metropolitan area. Based on
current estimates, what are the 10 largest cities by their
metropolitan statistical areas?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some metropolitan statistical areas and consolidated
metropolitan statistical areas reach across state borders, so the
numbers are markedly different. The top 10, according to Census
Bureau estimates as of July 1, 1998:
</P>
<P>
   (1) New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (which also
includes areas in Connecticut and Pennsylvania), 20.13 million; (2)
Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County, 15.78 million; (3)
Chicago-Gary, Ind.-Kenosha, Wis., 8.8 million; (4)
Washington-Baltimore (which also includes areas in Virginia and
West Virginia), 7.28 million; (5) San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose,
6.8 million; (6) Philadelphia-Wilmington, Del.-Atlantic City, N.J.
(which also includes areas in Maryland), 5.98 million; (7)
Boston-Worcester-Lawrence-Lowell-Brockton, Mass. (which also
includes areas of New Hampshire), 5.63 million; (8) Detroit-Ann
Arbor-Flint, Mich. 5.45 million; (9) Dallas-Fort Worth, 4.8
million; and (10) Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, Texas, 4.4 million.

<P>
   Q: Is it a state or federal law or regulation that hamburger or
ground beef must be cooked medium well or well done when served in
a restaurant?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's not technically the way it works, although the end
result may be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rosenbloom, professor in Georgia State University's
Department of Nutrition and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic
Association, explained that restaurants should cook ground beef to
an internal temperature of 155 degrees F. This is the temperature
that the Food and Drug Administration has established for
prevention of food-borne illness from ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, recommends that
for home cooking of ground beef, an internal temperature of 160
degrees F is the standard. So Rosenbloom suggests that for food
safety reasons, anyone planning a hamburger cookout this summer
needs to use a meat thermometer.

   Q: I'm 73. Is that too old to donate organs?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. There's no upper age limit to be a donor, said Jeff
Al-Mashat of the Georgia Coalition on Donation and Lifelink of
Georgia. The only factors ruling out organ donation are HIV and
active viral hepatitis, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I see ads on TV for Father Joe's Villages. What is that, and
is the man on TV a real priest?
</P>
<P>
   A: The man in the ads isn't an actor. He's Father Joe Carroll,
said Mark Tsuchiya, spokesman for Father Joe's Villages in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The villages' stated mission is to help people in need turn
their lives around and regain independence through ``one-stop
shopping'' _ comprehensive care under one roof, including
education, job training, child care, substance abuse counseling,
and medical and dental care.
</P>
<P>
   It has grown from a small outreach to single homeless men in San
Diego 50 years ago into seven large ``villages'' in California and
Nevada. The prototype, St. Vincent de Paul, now serves more than
2,300 people a day. Another facility, M.A.S.H. (Mobile Assistance
and Shelter for the Homeless), houses 300 single women and families
and a crisis intervention center. The original 35-bed Toussaint
Teen Center is expanding into a 627-acre rural campus as an
alternative to foster care. Other facilities, such as Josue Homes
for people with AIDS, have grown similarly.

   However, the book continues, it's more probable that the present
use equates ``love'' with ``nothing,'' as in the expression ``a
labor of love,'' meaning a task performed by a person for nothing
(but love).

   Q: An article mentioned that consumers who wish to have their
names and personal information removed from marketing lists can do
so by writing to the Direct Marketing Association. What is the
address, and what information are we supposed to provide?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can register with the name removal file by mailing your
name(s) and home address and signature in a letter or on a postcard
to: Mail Preference Service, Direct Marketing Association, P. O.
Box 9008, Farmingdale, NY 11735-9008.
</P>
<P>
   Only postal mail requests for inclusion are accepted because
signed requests are considered proof that the person submitting the
request is the person whose name is being removed from marketing
lists. E-mail requests are not honored because there's no way to
verify the identity, the association says.
</P>
<P>
   When you register, your name is placed on a ``delete'' file
which is made available to companies four times a year (January,
April, July and October). Not all marketing material will be
eliminated, the marketing association states.
</P>
<P>
   Your name remains on the file for five years. After that, you
must repeat the process if you want to continue to be listed.

   Q: I saw that the official figure for the number of Americans
killed in action in the Korean War had recently been revised from
more than 50,000 to fewer than 40,000. This appears to be a drastic
revision. What's the explanation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Pentagon is saying the error's primary culprit was an
anonymous government clerk. The higher figure of 54,246 (now
revised to 36,940) cropped up shortly after both sides declared the
truce in 1953, and had been repeated erroneously ever since. It
even was endorsed by Encyclopedia Britannica and engraved on the
Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the bureacrat mistakenly added all
nonbattlefield U.S. military deaths that occurred worldwide during
the three-year war to the more than 33,000 U.S. battlefield dead in
Korea. But only 3,275 of those nonbattlefield deaths _ largely due
to accidents or disease _ occurred in Korea. That yields the newly
revised death count.
</P>
<P>
   All service historian offices are in agreement with the
revision, the Pentagon stated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently listed the nation's 10 largest cities by
population within the city limits. However, such artificial limits
don't accurately portray the size of a metropolitan area. Based on
current estimates, what are the 10 largest cities by their
metropolitan statistical areas?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some metropolitan statistical areas and consolidated
metropolitan statistical areas reach across state borders, so the
numbers are markedly different. The top 10, according to Census
Bureau estimates as of July 1, 1998:
</P>
<P>
   (1) New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (which also
includes areas in Connecticut and Pennsylvania), 20.13 million; (2)
Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County, 15.78 million; (3)
Chicago-Gary, Ind.-Kenosha, Wis., 8.8 million; (4)
Washington-Baltimore (which also includes areas in Virginia and
West Virginia), 7.28 million; (5) San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose,
6.8 million; (6) Philadelphia-Wilmington, Del.-Atlantic City, N.J.
(which also includes areas in Maryland), 5.98 million; (7)
Boston-Worcester-Lawrence-Lowell-Brockton, Mass. (which also
includes areas of New Hampshire), 5.63 million; (8) Detroit-Ann
Arbor-Flint, Mich. 5.45 million; (9) Dallas-Fort Worth, 4.8
million; and (10) Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, Texas, 4.4 million.

</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it a state or federal law or regulation that hamburger or
ground beef must be cooked medium well or well done when served in
a restaurant?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's not technically the way it works, although the end
result may be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rosenbloom, professor in Georgia State University's
Department of Nutrition and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic
Association, explained that restaurants should cook ground beef to
an internal temperature of 155 degrees F. This is the temperature
that the Food and Drug Administration has established for
prevention of food-borne illness from ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, recommends that
for home cooking of ground beef, an internal temperature of 160
degrees F is the standard. So Rosenbloom suggests that for food
safety reasons, anyone planning a hamburger cookout this summer
needs to use a meat thermometer.

<P>
   Q: The U.S. Postal Service has been advertising a new series of
baseball stamps. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Legends of Baseball series will be dedicated officially
and issued July 6 in Atlanta in conjunction with Major League
Baseball's All-Star Week. They'll be available at post offices
nationwide starting July 7. The stamp designs were unveiled May 4
at Busch Stadium in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps will honor Roberto Clemente, Ty Cobb, Mickey
Cochrane, Eddie Collins, Dizzy Dean, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Josh
Gibson, Lefty Grove, Rogers Hornsby, Walter Johnson, Christy
Mathewson, Satchel Paige, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth, George
Sisler, Tris Speaker, Pie Traynor, Honus Wagner and Cy Young. These
players were honored last season as part of Major League Baseball's
``All-Century Team'' program.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service will print 200 million of the self-adhesive
33-cent stamps. For information: 1-800-782-6724 or online at
www.stampsonline.com.

<P>
   Q: In the earlier part of the 20th century, an employee of the
U. S. Patent Office made this comment: ``Everything that can be
invented has been invented.'' Can you provide the name of that
person, and the context for this remark?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's some disagreement about whether it actually happened,
but the Chambers Dictionary of Quotations says
</P>
<P>
   Charles H. Duell, commissioner of the Office of Patents, wrote a
letter in 1899 to President William McKinley making that comment to
bolster his contention that an Office of Patents was no longer
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If a person pays Social Security taxes, but dies before
becoming eligible to receive benefits, what happens to that money?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the person has survivors who meet eligibility
requirements, benefits may be paid to them. Otherwise, the money
paid in taxes goes into the Social Security's pool of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Agency spokeswoman Patti Patterson explained that Social
Security is a national system of social insurance under which
employers, employees and self-employed people pay Social Security
taxes. These taxes paid on a worker's earnings are not placed in a
specific account for the individual worker, but are pooled in
special funds.
</P>
<P>
   These funds, as Patterson pointed out, are used to pay benefits
to workers and their families because of the loss of earnings due
to retirement, disability or death.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article in the June 25 Parade magazine said the number of
Americans killed in action in the Korean War had recently been
revised from more than 50,000 to fewer than 40,000. This appears to

</P>
<P>

That yields the newly revised death count.
</P>
<P>
   All service historian offices have been advised about the
revision and have agreed with it, the Pentagon stated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the term ``jaywalking'' originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's derived from the ``belligerent and defiant'' jaybird,
according to ``Picturesque Expressions: A Thematic Dictionary.''
Presumably, jaywalkers fall into the ``defiant'' category because
they cross the street without heeding traffic laws.
</P>
<P>

a somewhat different version, tracing it to the era when
automobiles first came into use, and saying the t the next

&HT;     ACTRESS FINDS HER SOAPBOX IN `I'M THE ONE' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There is a passage in the film of Margaret Cho's
raucous stand-up confessional ``I'm the One That I Want'' in which
she details the dregs of her days in Studio City. It all happened
after the cancellation of ``All American Girl,'' her ABC sitcom,
for which she was told she was too fat and not Korean enough for
American audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Cho flew into a tailspin that resulted in a masochistic bender
of drugs, drink and anonymous sex. She was also nearly half her
regular size and was rarely cognizant of what she drank with which
drug while she was sleeping with which random gentleman. She'd hit
bottom with a resounding thud.
</P>
<P>
   So where, she wonders in a Warfield Theater thick with gay men,
is her parade? Cho, who grew up in San Francisco in the 1970s, is
that lower level of celebrity icon gay men love so much. Too young,
too unproven, too still-here to be with The Girls _ Judy, Billie,
Sylvester _ and without an overpriced boxed-set and eternal disco
anthem, she'll never be a true Survivor the likes of Diana, Donna,
Barbra or Cher.
</P>
<P>
   The film is special anyway: It's the first stand-up flick since
Martin Lawrence's ``You So Crazy'' and the first by a woman; Cho's
act is more chick-riffing-with-mic than one-woman show, a la Sandra
Bernhard or Julia Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Cho, in particular, has a face that happens to be the
semiconscious spine of her comedy. It never seems to quite
cooperate with her vision of what it should be doing, and I think
she finds this funny herself. When she fills her cheeks with air,
she looks simultaneously like a blowfish and the vessel that will
finally get Richard Branson safely around the world.
</P>
<P>
   There's a priceless bit where she impersonates German couture
designer Karl Lagerfeld at one of his shows and Cho protracts the
moment, allowing you to see how grandly absurd her face is
inhabiting Lagerfeld's severe, aloof-bitch persona: In her hands,
he's nothing less than a slapstick geisha.
</P>
<P>
   Like Whoopi Goldberg at the apogee of her genius, but more
diffident and less assertive, Cho hints at the power that lies
beneath her innocent-looking face. She's not a changeling, she's
inflectionist _ every caricature surfaces by way of her
Bay-Area-Valley-Girl Asian-ness. Whiteness, blackness, maleness
become a fascinating function of her own ethnicity, each emerging
as some piece of racial cubism, the likes of which we've never seem
before. Witness Gwen, the woman who shows up while Cho's in rehab,
``to wash your vagina.'' It's a show-stopping moment. You can
almost no longer see Cho inside this burly woman, of whom she's
made a grotesque, tearfully funny harridan.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the least successful moments in the film come in her
impersonations of her mother, a schtick that seemed funny early in
Cho's career, when neither her material nor her stage presence were
as strong as they are now.
</P>
<P>
   The bits now flirt with weird sanctimony. So do the act's
Hollywood portion, which leaves the subject of ex-boyfriend Quentin
Tarantino sadly under-plumbed and embraces a righteousness that
mires her in a long, uncomfortably laughless stretch. They feel
less like theatrical drama and more as if Cho has wandered into
Asians Anonymous on open mic night. Her feelings here are so raw
she can't seem to harness them, and everyone feels awkward.
Otherwise, the film is about Cho's psychological self-destruction,
in which she has boldly dismantled herself, then performs a
reconstruction. And in case you missed that she is a survivor, Cho
has hinted at such with her hot pink outfit and the flaming crimson
streaks in her hair. Like, she's a phoenix.

THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF WATERMELONS AND PEACHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent poll showed that more than 80 percent of Texans were
worried about a drought that's covering the state. Half were
cutting back on their water usage to help conserve.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, obviously, was so there would be plenty of
irrigation water to produce watermelons for Fourth of July
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Also, so that the Parker County Peach Festival would have ample
fruit this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A quick survey around the Fort Worth-Dallas area shows the
conservation efforts paid off. Don McGon, at the farmers market in
Weatherford, said that merchants there had plenty of melons. They
didn't have any Black Diamonds, he quickly added, but there were at
least two or three other red-meat varieties available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seedless watermelons, too,'' McGon added, ``We even
have some yellow-meat seedless.'' Grocery stores in the area are
loaded with seedless varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the watermelons aren't from the local growers. McGon
said local farmers won't be bringing their melons to town until
later in the month. The Jubilees and Sugar Babies sitting on the
shelves today are from a little farther south, near Hico.
</P>
<P>
   In a state gripped by drought the past four out of five years,
the melons have prospered.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Agricultural Extension Service reports a successful
crop this year. Texas growers planted 35,000 acres of watermelons
this year, ranking first in national production.
</P>
<P>
   The watermelon harvest began in early May in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley. West of San Antonio, the harvest began three weeks
ago and was expected to peak this week.
</P>
<P>
   The melons have dodged the drought, agriculture experts said,
because most of them are grown in irrigated fields. The Texas
watermelon harvest will continue in East Texas through the month,
and will wind down by October in the High Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo, Brooks, Knox, Gaines and Wood are the state's top
producing counties, though watermelons are grown in nearly half of
all Texas counties, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Parker County produces a lot of watermelons, but the signature
crop there is clearly peaches. McGon warned that the farmers market
will be jammed next weekend with the Parker County Peach Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peach crop has been great this year,'' he said. ``The
peaches are going strong and the festival people estimate we'll
have 50,000 visitors next weekend for the peach festival.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival takes place from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Folks at the Weatherford Chamber of Commerce said farmers have
promised a good crop this year because of the recent rains. Last
year, more than 30,000 visitors enjoyed sweet, large _ but limited
_ peaches. This year, growers said there will be plenty to go
around.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's event will be the last festival centered around the
picturesque Parker County Courthouse. In future years, the Texas
Department of Transportation has informed the city that because of
safety concerns, it will no longer close the major thoroughfares
around the courthouse for the festival.

   GUN BARREL CITY, Texas _ The mayor of Gun Barrel City collects
Waterford crystal and professes his fondness for the band Air
Supply without a hint of sarcasm. He calls his mother and most
other females ``darlin' '' _ as in ``Where have you been hidin',
darlin'?'' And when he drives his 1996 Lexus through the Gun Barrel
business district, he leans far back in the leather seat and clasps
the steering wheel with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor chews bubble gum.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his professional career, the amiable mayor of
Gun Barrel City has launched two profitable newspapers and one
magazine. Before this year's campaign, he had relatively little
political experience: As a freshman in college, he was narrowly
elected president of the student government.
</P>
<P>
   But that was three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor was still a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   The newly minted mayor of Gun Barrel City is 21-year-old Tye
Thomas, who shoots the bull like a Texas good ol' boy three times
his age. His days are filled with handshakes and phone calls and
the kind of networking that Tye has excelled at since he was a
towheaded 10-year-old peddling homemade gift items to his
neighbors. On May 6, he became, quite possibly, the youngest mayor
in ``the great state of Texas,'' as Tye calls his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to be governor someday.
</P>
<P>
   Gun Barrel City lies 60 miles southeast of Dallas on picturesque
Cedar Creek Lake, where mobile homes share the shoreline with
sprawling summer cottages. Retirees and middle-aged refugees from
the Big D have doubled the population over the past 10 years to
almost 7,000. With its Wal-Mart Supercenter and Beall's, the city
boasts of its standing as ``the shopping center of western
Henderson county.''
</P>
<P>
   The citizens of Gun Barrel call their mayor ``mature for his
age.'' They're impressed by his proficiency with Roberts Rules of
Order and his business acumen (the mayor is also publisher of the
weekly Lakeside News). But mainly, Tye won on his promise to bring
professional and cordial governance to Gun Barrel City Hall,
according to locals.
</P>
<P>
   This was a refreshing concept, considering that the last mayor
landed on the front page of The Wall Street Journal after kicking
down a city administrator's door.
</P>
<P>
   Tye, say his supporters, has people skills.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the baby-faced mayor broke for lunch at the Victorian
Lady Tea Room in neighboring Mabank, his hometown. True to his
title, the mayor of Gun Barrel carries a 9mm Ruger on his hip. More
incongruous are his idol _ Larry King _ and the colors he painted
his home office _ two shades of pink. He orders spiced tea and
quiche, and his eyes dart about the dining room as he recounts his
path to the mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Tye can remember, he's been ``money motivated.'' As a
kid, he sold the pecans that fell from his backyard trees. He
bought lottery tickets and sold them to classmates for $2 a pop. He
secretly hawked candy in the school corridors, bought and sold used
computers, and kept a stand at a local flea market.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, he started his first newspaper, Cedar Creek Briefs. Tye
traveled by bicycle, selling ad space to local businesses, and
hired employees to fill the remaining columns with human-interest
articles. His high-school counselor persuaded him to enter a
young-entrepreneurs contest sponsored by Johnson &AMP; Wales University
in Rhode Island. Tye placed second, and the school offered him a
generous scholarship. College had never interested him much, but he
sold the newspaper (which was grossing upward of $80,000 annually,
he says), bought a Lexus and hit the road for Providence.
</P>
<P>
   He hated most everything about the East Coast. ``They thought I
talked too slow. They thought I drove too slow,'' he says. ``It's
like a whole other country up there.'' After 3 1/2 years, with a
bachelor's degree in marketing, he made a beeline for home.
</P>
<P>
   That was in November 1999. Four months earlier, Tye had resolved
that when he returned to Gun Barrel he would do two things: start
another newspaper and run for mayor. The weekly Lakeside News
premiered in January 2000. In May, with the backing of the local
business community, the publisher added ``mayor'' to his resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think I have an instinct for it,'' Tye says about
politics, ``just like a baby kitten knows how to use a litter
box.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Tuesday evening, the mayor calls the City Council
meeting to order. He sits at the center of a long dais flanked by
five council members, any one of whom might be old enough to be his
grandparent. A man upset about the city changing his street number
speaks to the council. The mayor leans back and swivels his chair,
touching the tips of his fingers together. He listens pensively. He
whispers to the city secretary. He thanks the aggrieved citizen for
his time and calls for a motion to take no action. Motion seconded.
Motion passed.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor introduces a reporter in the audience from a newspaper
that must be ``hard up'' for news to send staff all the way out
here to do a story ``on the kid mayor of Gun Barrel City,'' as he
refers to himself. The gray-haired audience laughs. The mayor is a
pretty funny guy.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Tye and two council members retire to
Warner's restaurant on the water. He unwinds with cheese fries and
a Coors Light (he's legal now) and recounts the time, a month ago,
when he overdid it on margaritas and had to call for a police
escort from the bar. The mayor still commits the occasional
youthful indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   Tye's parents remain unfazed by his success. Rynell and Larry
Thomas divorced about eight years ago, when their three older kids
were already grown and out of the house. Consequently, Tye, the
youngest, spent a lot of time with his mom. ``He always was a
doer,'' Rynell says.
</P>
<P>
   Tye's dad has made some changes in his life and comes around
more often these days. ``I told him he wouldn't want it after he
got it,'' Larry says of the mayor's job. ``Give him another six
months till he's fed up.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor isn't quite fed up, but he's stressed. ``Six weeks
down, 98 to go,'' he says half-jokingly of his two-year term. He
won't go back to the bar where his dad has taken him for years, he
says, because the last time he visited, ``I had two dozen people
come up to me talking about potholes and culverts and people in
jail,'' he says. ``They think I can wave my magic wand and fix
their problems now.''
</P>
<P>
   But good things have come to the mayor. So far, he's united the
once-contentious council and lobbied successfully for a 10 percent
pay hike for the police. He was recently chosen to cast one of the
Texas Republican electoral votes this fall. His Lakeside News seems
to be gaining on its two local competitors each week, and he plans
to open a second newsroom in nearby Athens.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the mayor turns 22. He says he won't seek a second
term if he thinks he's done all he can for Gun Barrel City. That
would leave seven years before he could legally run for George W.'s
current job in Campaign 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Tye Thomas for governor.
</P>
<P>
   You heard it here first.

&HT;     LIGHT MAY HELP KEEP ARTERIES UNCLOGGED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scientists say light could help prevent a small
percentage of heart attacks if doctors shine it into the interior
of human arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime within the next year, researchers at the Mayo Clinic
and elsewhere may begin beaming light into human arteries. The goal
is to see if light prevents arteries from re-clogging after a
special type of heart surgery, said Francis P. Gasparro, who helped
organize this week's 13th International Congress on Photobiology.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a popular kind of heart surgery has involved
the insertion of a long catheter, which carries a small balloon,
into an artery feeding into the heart. The catheter is routed
toward the artery through a wide vein in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Once the catheter reaches the desired artery, surgeons inflate
the balloon. The balloon flattens out accumulated plaque that is
blocking blood flow. Ideally this method (known as trasluminal
balloon angioplasty) allows the resumption of normal, unblocked
blood flood into the heart.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a small percentage of cases, the artery clogs again
within months.
</P>
<P>
   What might be done to prevent such re-clogging of the artery? A
solution, now being tested on lab animals, involves sliding a
fiber-optic tube through the catheter into the heart. The
fiber-optic line can transmit an intense beam of light to the site
of the clogging.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists suspect that by illuminating the arterial interior
for several minutes, they might be able to hasten the healing of
scar tissue that would otherwise seed future clogging.
</P>
<P>
   Past research indicates that light accelerates wound healing in
surface skin, perhaps by stimulating the skin's immune system. It
is therefore worth seeing if the same thing will happen inside
arteries, Gasparro said.
</P>
<P>
   Lab tests of the procedure on rabbits and pigs have been ``very
encouraging,'' said Gasparro, a professor of physical chemistry at
Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia who is not directly
connected with the research.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``it's too early to say whether this approach is
efficacious. No one has yet done a clinical study in humans,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Human tests could begin within a year at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The science of photobiology began to attract public attention in
the 1970s, when scientists began fearing a future epidemic of skin
cancer caused by increasing solar ultraviolet (UV) light.
</P>
<P>
   UV levels would rise, they forecast, because pollutants called
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were slowly destroying the atmospheric
ozone layer. The ozone layer normally provides a shield from
cancer-causing solar radiation.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the meeting also said they still have not found
convincing scientific evidence that suntan lotions protect against
a wide variety of skin cancers.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``limited evidence'' that suntan lotion protects
against one type of cancer and another, pre-cancerous condition,
Gaparro said. However, he warned, there is no clear evidence that
the lotion protects against many types of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Gasparro based his comments on a report at Tuesday's sessions by
A.R. Young of St. John's Institute of Dermatology in London.
</P>
<P>
   Young reported ``limited evidence'' that suntan lotion may
protect against a type of skin cancer called squamous cell
carcinoma and a pre-cancerous condition known as actinic keratosis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet science still has not established the ability of suntan
lotion to protect against skin cancer in general, Young cautioned
in an abstract of his talk.

CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES TURN A HOUSE INTO A FISHBOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By ERIC TAUB    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Orwell expected Soviet-style communism to perfect the
notion of a society monitored by an all-seeing ``big brother,'' but
he did not realize that it would take capitalism to come up with
the most efficient way for millions of people to be nosy.
</P>
<P>
   What capitalism has come up with is the aptly named ``Big
Brother,'' CBS's spinoff of a television show that was first
created in the Netherlands and is already wildly popular across
Europe. The first show in the United States was shown Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 10 strangers moved into the house where they will
live for three months with virtually no contact with the outside
world. The house was built for the show on the network's lot in the
San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles. Privacy is nonexistent;
the participants are under total video surveillance, even when
sleeping, showering or using the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Whether one thinks that this concept is a brilliant way to
observe the workings of the human psyche or a tremendous waste of
time for the broadcasters, the participants and the audience, there
is no denying that the creation of nightly shows detailing the
previous 24 hours in 10 people's lives is an extraordinary
technical and logistical challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The participants who entered the house cannot leave unless they
quit voluntarily or are voted out by viewers. The house has two
windowless bedrooms (how they're shared is up to the group), one
shower, one toilet, a kitchen, a dining room and a living area, all
chockablock with Ikea furniture. All areas are continuously lit by
fluorescent lights, except the bedrooms, where the lights can be
turned off but the people will still be visible. There is a small
courtyard and garden, but they are completely surrounded by walls,
affording residents a prisonlike view of nothing but a patch of
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Every two weeks throughout the show's planned three-month run,
one contestant will be thrown out. Each time, the residents
themselves will nominate two people to remove, and members of the
home audience, each spending 99 cents to vote by calling a 900
number, will make the final decision on which one will go.
</P>
<P>
   The house is a plain, prefabricated structure. It and the
courtyard are encapsulated within an outer shell. Five cameras sit
on dolly tracks in the space between the inner and outer walls. An
operator can quickly and invisibly move a camera to catch some
action through one-way mirrors found on every wall. In addition, 23
cameras and 60 microphones are visible, hung in every room and the
yard. All are automatically controlled, and most can pan and zoom.
</P>
<P>
   While even the toilet and shower are under surveillance, the
small cameras there are not for broadcasting. They are meant to
ensure that participants do not retreat there to seek privacy, said
the show's executive producer, Paul Roemer. The bedroom cameras
have night-vision capability, and footage from the bedrooms will be
shown.
</P>
<P>
   While the cameras will monitor any nudity and sexual activity in
the house, CBS says that such scenes will not be used for the
television broadcast or the site's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the producers is to make audience members feel like
furtive watchers. ``We're purposely shooting and editing the show
to look like a rough cut,'' said Roemer, who is from the
Netherlands and was one of the creators of the show there. ``The
camera may zoom in too far or the focus may briefly be off, but
that's OK. We want the effect to be as if the viewer is actually
watching the action through a window.''
</P>
<P>
   Literally every inch of the contestants' living quarters will be
monitored. When the producers realized that a far corner of the
courtyard was out of ideal camera range, they planted a cactus
garden there to discourage anyone from loitering around it.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle Roemer had to face was figuring out how to
distill the previous day's videotape, documenting 10 individuals'
lives, down to a 30-minute show for broadcast each night, and how
to do that editing in just a few hours. Roemer solved the problems
during the show's 30-month gestation period in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Typical American sitcoms use three cameras, and the director,
stationed in the control room, orders the action to switch between
them. But in ``Big Brother,'' there are more than nine times as
many video feeds.
</P>
<P>
   In the control room, designed in cooperation with Sony, the
images captured by each of the 28 cameras are displayed on separate
monitors, positioned in two rows of 14. Rather than continuously
recording each camera feed and then later viewing all the video for
possible inclusion in the half-hour show, the nine story editors
make editing decisions on the fly. Only four of the 28 feeds are
actually taped at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   Story editors, familiar with the goings-on at the house and
presumably well aware of the various individual dramas forming and
reshaping themselves, direct the most salient action to one of four
larger monitors that sit atop the 28. Two of those monitors are
used for the wide shot of each scene that might be worthy of
inclusion, and the other two focus on close-ups of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first approached a Dutch technical company to help us
do this, they thought we were nuts,'' Roemer recalled. Referring to
two other so-called reality television shows, he added: ``This is a
much more difficult job than filming `Survivor' or MTV's `Real
World.' On those shows, they tape everything and edit later. We're
editing as the action unfolds and deciding instantaneously what to
actually record.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the house is monitored around the clock, the crew members
work in shifts. The story editors, all experienced in documentary
production, watch the action unfold while listening to two separate
audio streams through their headphones.
</P>
<P>
   When story editors spot action that they find interesting and
germane on one of the four monitors, one of the control panel
operators pushes a button to mark that spot electronically.
Software designed by Sony records the time of day, the date and
that sequence's time code, an electronic marker that allows the
editor to find the shot quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Another assistant enters various keywords describing the scene
into an Apple iBook. If the editors later want a particular shot
but do not know where it is on the tape, they can search for it by
typing a few descriptive words into the iBook, which will generate
a list of shots that have been described by those keywords.
</P>
<P>
   To edit the show, all the marked sequences are digitized and
transferred to computer hard drives, then edited on Sony's digital
editing system. The final cut is then transferred back to videotape
for broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Those viewers who wish to set aside their own lives to watch
others live theirs can do that 24 hours a day on
www.bigbrother2000.com, which will continuously broadcast the same
four channels that the control room is recording. AOL members
(keyword: bigbrother) will also be able to see shots of the control
room, the vegetable garden and the chicken coop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning is the hardest part,'' Roemer said. ``We've got
10 people in a house who don't know each other, an inexperienced
production staff and the need to be great right away. If we don't
pull it off, the audience will quickly reject us.''

Wednesday that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, will come to a Camp David summit
next week intended to resolve the hard-core issues that have
divided their peoples for more than 50 years. Speaking in terms
that portrayed the weight of the undertaking, Clinton said the two
leaders would face the ``most profound questions'' and that there

   RACE-HIP-HOP (Undated) _ Billy Wimsatt, 27, was born as rap
music was being invented by blacks and Latinos in the South Bronx.
What began as party music became their cry of ghetto pain and their
great hope for a way out. And as hip-hop _ not just rap music but
fashion, break-dancing, graffiti and the magazines that chronicle
it all _ blossomed into the radiant center of youth culture, Billy
Wimsatt and lots of other white kids found in it a way to flee
their own orderly world by discovering a sexier, more provocative
one. Like many young hip-hop heads, he regarded hip-hop, with its
appeal to whites and blacks, as a bold modern hope to ease some of
the abrasiveness between the races. Elliott Wilson, a young black
man, had never met Billy Wimsatt, but their lives had traced
similar trajectories across the hip-hop landscape. As a writer and
editor, he too had spent much of his adult life thinking about
hip-hop. And not just hip-hop, but race and hip-hop. Race was

   CALIF-PRISONS (Los Angeles) _ The California state prison
system, which led the huge national prison-building boom, has
recorded the first decline in its prison population in more than
two decades, according to state officials. The drop, albeit slight,
is the most tangible evidence that the rate of incarceration in
many states is beginning to level off. While California is the
first of the big states to actually report a decline, others have
in the past few years have begun to report that the rate of growth
is slowing. By Don Terry.

   GORE (Philadelphia) _ After a spring of stressing fiscal
responsibility, Vice President Al Gore has turned to more red-meat
class-based themes that appeal to the Democratic faithful. On
Wednesday he criticized drug companies for the second time in three
days, accusing them of ``price gouging'' and putting ``millions of
dollars'' into a ``phony'' group ``which is polluting the public
airwaves with special interest TV ads designed to deceive the
American people about a prescription drug benefit.'' Last week he
was crusading against ``Big Oil'' suggesting that high fuel prices
in the Midwest could be due to collusion. Gore's populist tones
have given him his own voice _ distinct from President Clinton's.

SOMETHING TO WATCH OVER ME

<P>
   FEDERAL HEIGHTS, Colo. _ The future of electronic surveillance,
family style, can be found at Hyland Hills Water World, a theme
park north of downtown Denver.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical summer day, thousands of children cavort among 65
acres of water slides, wave pools and rafting rides, and their
parents try to keep up with them. Now two companies have introduced
an electronic locating system, ParkWatch, that helps parents do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can wear watch-size ParkWatch devices that transmit
signals to antennas throughout the park. Family members can go to
special kiosks in the park to have the whereabouts of others in
their group displayed on a video map.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows all of us a little bit more freedom and
flexibility,'' said Chery Wick of Denver, who, like many parents,
had never been comfortable allowing her children to roam freely in
a theme park. But at Water World recently, she rested by a pool,
knowing that while her daughters, ages 9 and 12, were nowhere to be
seen, she could find them because they were wearing the devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't be on their own right now without it,'' Wick
said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the system, developed by ParkWatch of Clarksburg, Md.,
and WhereNet of Santa Clara, Calif., is being used only at Hyland
Hills Water World. But the companies hope that the equipment,
adapted from technology used to track parts in warehouses and
factories, will catch on at other parks.
</P>
<P>
   It is a precursor of systems that could track a person just
about anywhere. Applied Digital Solutions of Palm Beach, Fla.,
plans to demonstrate a prototype later this year of its Digital
Angel, a small tracking device that can be implanted under the skin
or attached to a wristwatch. The wearer's location is determined
using the Global Positioning System. And at least two other
companies plans to adapt technology for use in tracking humans,
with prototypes available in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone believes that the tracking devices are a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a myriad of ethical and security issues,'' said
Andrew Shen, a policy analyst for the Electronic Privacy
Information Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd worry about the people with malicious intent,'' Shen said,
``and opening yourself up to abuses from people working at those
companies where the tracking takes place.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a locator system in an amusement park, he added,
``shouldn't be a substitute for keeping a watchful eye on a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you may be able to find your son or daughter,'' he added,
``but that doesn't mean your kid is going to stay out of trouble.
Kids can get hurt or upset if they are lost, and wearing a tracking
device on their wrist doesn't help that much.''
</P>
<P>
   The developers of ParkWatch note that the use of the system is
voluntary so security concerns are not a problem. People can choose
to rent the devices, which cost $2 or $3 a day, depending upon the
size of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have a large crowd, there is a possibility of
separation,'' said Joanne Dobbs, communications manager for the
park. ``This can give parents peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech aspect of the system has a certain appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty cool,'' said Gabrielle Villanueva, 8, as
she raced toward a rafting ride at Water World. ``It's keeping us
safe even if we are separated.''
</P>
<P>
   ParkWatch officials said setting up the system at Water World
was a good test of its capacity because of the park's hilly terrain
and its numerous slides and other rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``This location was relatively challenging,'' said Andrew
O'Neill, general manager of ParkWatch. ``We had to establish a
system that would resolve problems and build a transmitter that
could be used everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The park has 14 antennas, many of them hidden, around the
perimeter and six kiosks for calling up maps. Each tracking device
weighs only a few ounces and is attached to the wrist, ankle or
bathing suit with a fiber band that can be removed only by cutting
it.
</P>
<P>
   Each device has a serial number, and users can assign names or
other labels.
</P>
<P>
   To locate someone, anyone in the group can go to one of the
electronic maps and scan a bar code on the wrist device. Within
seconds, icons corresponding to the other members will appear on
the screen, with their names or other labels. For example, Johnny
might be at the Thunder Bay water slide while Susie is across the
park, tubing on the Lazy River ride.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the device sends out a signal, with a unique code
for each device, every eight seconds. The signal is picked up by
the antennas, and then a computer uses triangulation (based on the
slight time differences of the signal reaching the various
antennas) to determine location within about 10 feet. The devices
do not work underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Doles, president of WhereNet, compared ParkWatch with cell
phones. ``There are towers or antennas where you are within a
coverage area,'' Doles said. ``Except a cell phone has about 1
watt, and ParkWatch has only 2 to 3 milliwatts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken it to upside-down GPS,'' O'Neill said. ``In a GPS
environment, you know where it is from the satellite. Here it sends
out a signal after it identifies itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Applied Digital Solutions' product, Digital Angel, which is in
development, actually uses GPS data to get location information,
which is then transmitted to a receiver or cell phone network.
</P>
<P>
   ``In concept, a mother could pull up a screen on a cell phone
and enter the code for her `angel' and then be able to get the
location of the device, literally within several feet,'' said
Richard Sullivan, chief executive of Applied Digital Solutions.
Sullivan said the device would be powered by a small battery that
would be recharged by body motion.
</P>
<P>
   Like WhereNet, the transmitter already has a more mundane use,
in the food industry. ``It tracks everything from beef to poultry,
from the time it leaves the grazing field to the supermarket
shelves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Angel was first developed by a former police officer who
had become frustrated by missing-children cases, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His hope was that at least someone might be able to recover
the child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan estimated that Digital Angel might cost about $50 when
it entered the commercial market and might also be used to monitor
things like heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Digital Angel can improve the safety and well-being of
families and children, improve people's quality of life, then it's
met the goal,'' Sullivan said, adding that other potential uses
could be to track soldiers during wartime, missing hikers and
people with Alzheimer's. The devices could even be used inside
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin Technologies of Canada currently markets a wireless
tracking device called Boomerang for use in motor vehicles and
marine and construction equipment. The devices track locations
using an analog cellular network system, and users find their
property by getting real-time location data from a secure Internet
site.
</P>
<P>
   The company (www.vehicletracking.com) plans to miniaturize
Boomerang by August 2001 for use in tracking children, pets and
small valuables.
</P>
<P>
   SnapTrack, a subsidiary of Qualcomm in California, currently has
a Palm-like device available in Japan that can transmit the user's
location, based on GPS data.
</P>
<P>
   SnapTrack's device is marketed to business people and is
generally used like other GPS devices, using the user's location in
conjunction with maps for navigation within a city. But it could
also transmit the user's location to another person.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two people have them, they have to subscribe, have to be
willing to be found,'' said John Cunningham, marketing director for
SnapTrack. And at $500 each, however, the devices are probably
prohibitively expensive for family tracking.
</P>
<P>
   But SnapTrack is working with Loc8.net and Glenayre Technologies
on a two-way pager that will give authorized friends and family
access to location data through map displays on the Internet or
through a 911 call center.
</P>
<P>
   Parents at Water World who have used ParkWatch said it was an
idea whose time had come. ``As a parent, everybody's concerned with
kids getting abducted in this day and age,'' said Dan Villanueva,
33, who had his 8- and 4-year-old daughters with him. ``This is one
way to help us out when we go to events.''

WITH NEW PHONE SYSTEM, UNIDENTIFIED CALLERS MIGHT NOT GET EVEN ONE
RING
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by PRIVACY MANAGER-COSTS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that every time Albert Harris sat down with his
family to eat supper, the phone would ring. On the other end would
be some ``crazy computer noise or somebody trying to sell
something,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got so bad we started to ignore it, but it made the family
members mad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then a month ago, Harris' wife went out and bought Southwestern
Bell's Privacy Manager, a new call-screening service that stops
unidentified calls before the phone even rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the greatest invention since the pocket on a
shirt,'' Harris said recently in a telephone interview from his
home in Princeton, Texas. ``We even get to sleep in on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   If Harris seems overjoyed, it is because, he said, his family's
quiet time was no longer their own, stolen by overzealous
telemarketers who called as many as six times an evening and even
on Saturday morning, the only time the family could sleep in.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they had Call Blocker, Call Waiting, and CallerID.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (my wife) has pretty much everything now,'' Harris
said of his phone features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see the commercial on TV with the man seated at the
computer on one side and the man on the other side about to eat,''
Harris asked. ``Just as they started to get a bite, the phone rang
_ well, that was us.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy Manager works as an enhancer to the widely used CallerID
feature, which has eclipsed even Call Waiting as the phone
company's most popular add-on service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes beyond the traditional call-blocking services that we
have today and gives customers more personal control by offering
them a choice of how to handle calls on an individual basis,'' said
Gary Perry, product director for Southwestern Bell's Privacy
Manager.
</P>
<P>
   A similar service, Privacy Director, is being offered by
BellSouth for residential customers in Atlanta, South Florida and
some cities in Alabama, Kentucky and Louisiana for $5.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Jeffers, spokesman for BellSouth in Atlanta, said the
service has been available since September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been extremely well-received,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy Manager intercepts all calls that would show up on a
CallerID display as ``unavailable,'' ``out-of-area,'' ``blocked,''
``private'' or ``unknown.'' When an unidentified call is
intercepted, Southwestern Bell Privacy Manager prompts the caller
to record his name before the call is connected, and then tells the
subscriber who is calling. Callers who intentionally block their
Caller ID information are given the option to temporarily unblock
their numbers in order to get connected. Those who fail to identify
themselves are disconnected, and the subscriber won't hear the
telephone ring.
</P>
<P>
   Once a caller identifies himself, Perry said, the subscriber can
either accept the call, ignore it with a pre-recorded message,
transfer the call to Southwestern Bell CallNotes or an answering
machine, or reject solicitor calls with a pre-recorded message.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, subscribers receive a personal code that will allow
frequent callers to pass through Privacy Manager altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``This speeds up the screening process when the person, maybe a
friend or family member, is calling from a pay phone or making a
long-distance call that may not be fully identified by CallerID,''
Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   The service, available in St. Louis since December and in
Dallas-Fort Worth since May 22, was developed, Perry said, to give
customers more control over incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, calls come in that are not identifiable,'' he
said. ``Privacy Manager also aids in stopping telemarketing calls
without the need of a written request.''
</P>
<P>
   Television advertisements for Privacy Manager feature a
telemarketer explaining what he calls a ``formation attack'' on
unsuspecting consumers, calling them over and over again until they
break. Then the 30-second spot ends with this: ``There's nothing to
be gained by letting people alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Brosnahan, public relations manager for the American
Teleservices Association, which represents some 2,000 call centers
and related companies, said there's nothing to be gained by cutting
telemarketers off either. Besides, most of ATA's members, he said,
don't block their information when calling consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members don't want to block their CallerID information,''
he said. ``Nor do they want to waste their time with customers who
don't want to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people think telemarketers are blocking their
ID, but the majority of our members are not. They want to create
brand identification. They want customers to know who's calling
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell extended the service yesterday to the Houston
area and will expand by mid-2001 to the larger cities in its
five-state Southwest region: Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas and
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said it's too early to tell exactly how many subscribers
have snapped up the service, but the numbers, he said, have so far
exceeded the company's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Costs for the service, Perry said, are unique to each state. In
Texas, the service is available for $5 a month or the discounted
price of $4 a month for subscribers to other Southwestern Bell
services. In addition, there is an installation charge of up to
$5.40 for residential customers, $10.75 for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For the service to work, subscribers must also have a
push-button telephone and a CallerID subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Local customers may order Privacy Manager by calling
Southwestern Bell at (800) 464-7928. For more information or to
listen to a demonstration, call (888) 560-9299.

ELECTRICAL GROUNDING: MAKING SURE IT'S DONE RIGHT

 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In order for electricity to power a lamp, motor, appliance or
other load, it must travel from a source through a conductor and a
load, then out into the ground. This path from source to ground is
a circuit.
</P>
<P>
   In a residential home circuit, the source is the service panel
where electricity comes into the house from the local electric
company. The wires from the source to the outlets are called the
hot wires and are color-coded with black insulation. The wires
running from the outlets to the ground are called neutral wires and
are color-coded with white insulation.
</P>
<P>
   This two-wire configuration was the standard for circuits in
American homes until about 1958. But the neutral wire did not
always capture and control electrical leaks from loose wires or
malfunctioning appliances, and engineers proposed adding a ground
wire as an auxiliary safety measure. This new wire was called the
equipment ground, and it became a standard feature on all
residential wiring.
</P>
<P>
   New outlets were created with a third, round-prong hole that
connected to the ground circuit. Plugs were created with a third
prong that was wired to the appliance housing and siphoned off
leaked electricity and routed it to the ground circuit. At first
the ground wire ran from a green screw on the receptacle to a screw
on the metal junction box.
</P>
<P>
   The ground connection ran from the metal box through the metal
sheathing, either BX cable or steel conduit, around the hot and
neutral wires. Later this design was improved by adding a third
wire alongside the hot and neutral wires.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most homeowners assume that their circuits are
properly grounded if they have they have three-hole receptacles in
the outlets, but this is not always the case. In older houses, the
receptacle could be in place but not wired to an equipment ground.
In newer homes, even if the three-prong outlet is present and
connected to the third ground wire, there is the possibility of a
loose connection in the ground circuit.
</P>
<P>
   These conditions are called an open ground. The outlet will
still deliver power to appliances, but it is unsafe because there
is no path for stray electricity. Should the wiring in an appliance
prove defective, the user could get a potent, even lethal shock. An
open ground can also affect the operation of some appliances with
microprocessors, like a computer, even if the appliance has no
internal faults.
</P>
<P>
   It is important then for the homeowner to check the house
circuits to make sure that all connections are safe. Fortunately,
this is not as difficult as it may sound. You can check the
receptacles in your house with a simple device called a circuit
tester. It is available in home centers and electrical supply
stores for about $5.
</P>
<P>
   Plug the tester into an outlet and read the pattern of lights on
the display panel. Match that up with the chart on the body of the
tester. With this device, you can test all the outlets in your
house in about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   What if you do find an open ground? Leave the tester plugged
into the outlet and turn off the breaker controlling that circuit.
The tester light will go out, indicating that power is off and the
circuit is cold. Remove the cover plate, pull the receptacle from
the box and carefully examine all the wiring. In many cases, the
open ground can be traced to a loose connection in the box.
</P>
<P>
   If all the wiring is secure, try to see if the conduit or BX
cable is coupled to the box; this is important in circuits that
only have a black and white wire in the circuit because the ground
connection runs through the metal jacket around the wires. If the
cable is not connected to the box, see if you can pull it back to
the box clamp. If this fails, you may have to open a small section
of the wall to get at the cable.
</P>
<P>
   If all the connections are in place at the box, look in the
basement and attic for any exposed cable or conduit along the
circuit line. You may spot a loose connection here, but if
everything looks all right, then the problem may be within the
circuit, and you should call in an electrician to trace the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 a new safety device was added to house circuits. This is
the ground fault circuit interrupter, and it was designed to shut
off power in less than one-fortieth of a second in areas with
exposed plumbing like the kitchen and bathroom. The interrupters
have test buttons and they should be checked at least once a week.

   Viburnums Under Attack
</P>
<P>
   Q. In my Western New York garden I used native viburnums, partly
because they are supposed to be more pest resistant. Now, I find
that my arrowwood and cranberry bush viburnums are being attacked
by something. The leaves look more like lace tatting, and
underneath some of them I am finding small larvae. If native shrubs
are supposed to be more pest resistant, why are they being
attacked? Is there something I can do about it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Native shrubs and trees are normally better adapted to the
resident pests as well as to the climate, but the viburnum leaf
beetle (Pyrrhalta viburni) is a stranger who has come to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Originally European, the beetle was first discovered in Ontario
in 1947, and has now migrated to 27 Western and Central counties of
New York, as well as Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The larvae skeletonize leaves in May and June, starting from the
bottom of the plant and working their way up, and the adults finish
up any leftovers from July to October.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs are laid in slits on the underside of the tips of young
branches in nice, straight lines that appear as dark brown bumps.
And that's the key to their control.
</P>
<P>
   Prune and remove any branch tips that have eggs laid in them,
any time from mid-October, when the adults finish depositing them,
to early May, when the larvae hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Left untreated, heavy infestations can kill vulnerable viburnums
in two or three years through repeated defoliation. Plants too
large to prune can be treated chemically. Call your local county
cooperative extension for the name of a control product labeled for
use against the viburnum leaf beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Most vulnerable to the beetle are arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum),
European cranberry bush (V. opulus), American cranberry bush (V.
trilobum) and, to a lesser degree, Sargent viburnum (V. sargentii),
and their cultivars.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrids and cultivars of Viburnum x burkwoodii, V. carlesii, V.
x juddii and V. rhytidophyllum resist the beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Raking vs. Mulching
</P>
<P>
   Q. We've been using a mulching lawn mower regularly for several
years now. When leaves start to drop in fall, we mulch and leave
them in place as well. We cut once or twice a week. Our lawn is one
of the better looking and healthier ones in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   However, we can't convince any of our neighbors that they should
stop picking up grass clippings and spending hours removing leaves
in the fall. Why do the majority of homeowners insist on the
removal of grass clippings and leaves from their lawns? That is,
are there big risks associated with mulching?
</P>
<P>
   A. Don't brag about your lawn; it just sets the neighbors to
dumping more fertilizer on theirs. Just mention that according to
studies done at Michigan State University, the nutritive value of
mulching and leaving grass clippings saves 20 to 25 percent of the
fertilizer one would ordinarily use. And then talk about how
improved your golf game is since you have been spending more time
with a club and less with a rake.
</P>
<P>
   And if they start talking about thatch buildup, inform them that
a three-year Cornell University experiment found no difference in
thatch thickness or quality of turf between areas where 6 inches of
fallen leaves, both oak and maple, were shredded by a mulching
mower and left on the grass, and areas where the leaves were raked
off. Thatch is the dead, dying and decaying organic matter, mostly
old turf stems, that accumulates in a layer just above the soil.
</P>
<P>
   But weekends can't be all golf. You either have to rake or run
the leaves over with a mulching mower. You can't just leave them
there because they'll block the light and eventually kill the
grass, along with your neighborhood reputation.

 &HT;    Southern humor: Hip to maudlin
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Humor, Southern style
</P>
<P>
   Southern humor is often dismissed as being a notch or two below
the more cerebral (Dennis Miller) and ironic (Chris Rock) material
of the HBO standup specials _ mostly jokes about why the chicken
crossed the road and blacked-out teeth. This trio of CDs from
Atlanta humorists shows that reputation is both true and false.
Columbus native Tim Wilson is from the old school, with a batch of
literal jokes and parody songs that are a cross between Speck
Rhodes and Ray Stevens. While most of it is so literal it makes you
groan, Wilson does have some funny regional material about the cop
at the foot of Monteagle Mountain and buying fireworks in
Tennessee. Jeff Foxworthy, on the other hand, is a national-caliber
comic who just happens to have a Southern accent. His album,
recorded live at Indiana University, is clean, family stuff (no
expletives). It's also quite funny, with stories about the lack of
concern for safety growing up in the '60s (e.g., wood-burning
sets), living in a house full of girls (he has three daughters) and
male/female relationships (``women want to talk''). The CD by Lewis
Grizzard, late Journal-Constitution columnist, isn't standup comedy
_ it's a collection of songs. Sadly, this reissue album (first
released in 1994) is more maudlin than humorous and should have
been left in the vaults.

   ``Mirror Mirror''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Price. Def Soul. 15 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, new Atlantan Kelly Price has the kind of pipes that can
circumvent the pretty regular sentiments expressed on her sophomore
album, ``Mirror Mirror'': ``You could have let me know you'll be
home late'' (``At Least''), ``You should have told me I wasn't
small enough'' (``You Should've Told Me'') and ``You should have
told me you have a wife'' (``Married Man'') mostly sum this up
(standouts ``Lullaby'' and blues-tinted ``Can't Run Away'' being
the exceptions). But even with as many problems as Price seems to
have with men on record, pair her with K-Ci Hailey and Gerald
Levert on ``All I Want Is You,'' or R. Kelly on the funny, much too
brief ``National Anthem,'' and the occasional targets of her ire
also clearly inspire her.

   The Tragically Hip. Sire. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Tragically Hip have remained a ``fringe'' band,
earning modest critical acclaim as they methodically churn out
releases in hopes of gaining a wider audience. Unfortunately, the
Hip's bluesy pop sound lacks substance; really catchy hooks are in
short supply, and melodies often meander aimlessly. The opening
title track, ``My Music at Work,'' features the sort of crisp,
ringing guitars and power-chord punch pop/rock fans latch onto in
droves. But the remainder of the album feels drained of energy,
artistry and creativity. ``Music (at) Work'' doesn't, ultimately,
and the Tragically Hip sound considerably less with it than their
name implies.

<P>
   Rarely do artists accomplish so much with so little as does the
groundbreaking Brazilian Joao Gilberto in his first studio
recording in a decade, ``Joao Voz e Violao.'' With nothing but his
mellow voice and melodic acoustic guitar licks, Gilberto
regenerates his own invention _ the bossa nova _ in ways that would
intrigue listeners who weren't born when he first gained fame in
the late 1950s. As always, Gilberto's is music for lovers;
whisper-soft songs, including remakes of his out-of-print classics,
the Antonio Carlos Jobim-composed ``Desafinado'' and ``Chega de
Saudade.'' Gilberto's sound remains hypnotic, especially for
non-Portuguese speakers. His voice and his musicianship still evoke
a mysterious language of love.

</P>
<P>
   Capping a decade of retrospectives, this is the album Moodies
fans have been waiting for. The band's first studio album since
1991, ``Strange Times'' is a glossy near-return to the ``Days of
Future Passed,'' the band's 1967 debut. Prog-rock orchestral
touches elevate these tracks of love and longevity without
cluttering up the works. Justin Hayward's unmistakable voice is as
pure and intimate as ever. And there's even a spoken-word coda on
the apt closer, ``Nothing Changes.'' Highlights, including the
Beatle-esque ``Love Don't Come Easy'' and pastoral ``Words You
Say,'' hint at the grandeur of ``Nights in White Satin'' and
``Tuesday Afternoon.'' And while there are some missteps _ the
metaphysical mush of early Moodies lyrics reappears in spots _ this
outing is a welcome deep breath of fresh air.

 &HT;    Do it yourself window box advice
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like all container gardens, window boxes can be planted from
scratch each spring and fall or, like a wardrobe, updated with a
few changes.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet Kirkpatrick, an Atlanta home and garden stylist, prefers
to start with a foundation of evergreen plants and build on that
with annuals that can be replaced with new bursts of color and
texture as the old ones fizzle out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always decide what colors I want to use first, then go to
the plant store with no preconceived notion of what to buy,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She aims for a mixture of plants that will cascade over the
sides, provide height in the back and supply mass in the center.
She also shoots for a contrast in leaf sizes and textures, some
solid and some variegated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also fun to go in and start from scratch,'' said David
Ellis, an Atlanta garden designer.
</P>
<P>
   A fun way to jazz up a hayrack, he said, is to cover it in sheet
moss, poke holes in the sides and insert trailing plants. Examples
include petunias, scaevola and lantana for sun and ivy,
plectranthus and asparagus fern for shade.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Weber takes things a step further. The horticulturist
accents her boxes with small ornaments for a three-dimensional
effect. By placing an object or piece of furniture in front of the
box, you can design an interesting vignette.
</P>
<P>
   Still don't know where to begin? Here's how Kirkpatrick does it:
</P>
<P>
   STEP 1
</P>
<P>
   Using a metal hayrack, lay a cocoa liner inside the form, in
this case, sheet liner. Before trimming the edges, fill the rack
about halfway with soil. Avoid compaction by using a light,
all-purpose growing mix instead of heavy potting soil. Mix in a
slow-release granular fertilizer, such as Osmocote.
</P>
<P>
   STEP 2
</P>
<P>
   Trim the liner's edges even with the form. Finish adding the
potting mix and wet it thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   STEP 3
</P>
<P>
   Start with a foundation of plants that will remain constant
throughout the seasons, such as ivy. In this case, Kirkpatrick used
a hanging basket of ivy and broke it into three smaller plants.
Baskets are great, she said, because the plants are fuller and
typically less expensive than individual pots.
</P>
<P>
   STEP 4
</P>
<P>
   Place tall plants, such as Boston fern, in the back of the
window box. Before planting, she douses the rootball in a bucket of
water to moisten the soil.
</P>
<P>
   STEP 5
</P>
<P>
   Fill in the center of the box with medium-size plants. Angle the
rootballs slightly forward so that the tops of plants are more
visible. Aim for a mix of dark green, chartreuse and white foliage
to provide contrast. Finally, add color where it's needed. Water
daily during dry spells and feed every one to two weeks with a
water-soluble fertilizer.

 &HT;    Six recipes for winning window boxes
 &HT;    By Danny C . Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some ideas never grow old.
</P>
<P>
   Take the window box.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to give your house a little personality _ both from
indoors and out _ these container gardens make a statement that
says, ``Welcome.'' If you're a townhouse or high-rise dweller tight
on space, they offer a solution to your gardening frustrations. And
if outdoor watering bans have forced you to curtail yard work, they
can be an even more practical option.
</P>
<P>
   Save money by designing your window box with a mix of evergreens
and annuals. By including a foundation of ivy, a small boxwood or
other shrubs, you'll need only to swap out the annuals from season
to season for a new punch of color.
</P>
<P>
   That's important, because window box materials can be expensive.
You can go as simple as a homemade wooden box, for less than $10,
or as high end as metal hayracks, which sell for $50 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   After selecting a box, decide where it will go _ in sun or
shade. That will help narrow your plant selections.
</P>
<P>
   Planning is important, but don't forget to be spontaneous. Have
a little fun with your box.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, Home &AMP; Garden section staffers asked three
Atlanta-area gardening experts _ David Ellis, Marcia Weber and
Harriet Kirkpatrick _ to cook up two window boxes each, one for sun
and one for shade. Their ``kitchen'' was Habersham Gardens, an
Atlanta garden center, where they had access to a candy shop of
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Check out their recipes on these pages. Give them a try _
keeping in mind, of course, that some of the best cooks never use a

   POTLUCK TIPS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For good scale, the planted window box should be 25 percent of
the height of a short window or 20 percent of the height of a tall
one.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure your window box has drainage holes along the front,
not the back, so that water won't drain against the house.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Choose a material that complements your house; likewise, use
plants that complement ones in the garden.

 &HT;    Series comes to bloody finale
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's not much steam left in ``Scream 3.'' Still, this final
chapter (they swear) of the smarty-pants slasher series manages to
wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the trilogy in
satisfying fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The setting now is Hollywood, primarily the film studio where
movie-within-movie ``Stab 3'' is being shot. But production shuts
down when actors start winding up dead, knifed by the latest psycho
wearing the familiar ghost costume. Enter dirt-digging reporter
Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette), who runs into estranged
beau Dewey (David Arquette). The former lawman has moved to Los
Angeles to be technical adviser on the new film. He's also gotten
cozy with Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), the actress playing Gale
in the movie-within-the-movie.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, our much-stalked heroine, Sidney (Neve Campbell), is
living in heavily alarmed seclusion in one of the city's leafy
canyons, though the killer (whose toys include a very sophisticated
voice modifier) is trying to track her down. As with the other two
movies, the less you know about the plot, the better.
</P>
<P>
   This one continues to treat mass murder as an extension of show
biz, a bloody game whose rules come from horror movies. We even get
a beyond-the-grave cameo from video geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy).
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' isn't as clever with its clues as its predecessors.
It's easy to guess, if not the killer's name, then his connection
to Sidney.
</P>
<P>
   The flick gets off to a shaky start, resorting to Hollywood
in-jokes and pop-culture references. These were novel in the first
``Scream,'' but after only three years, it's a worn-out and much
imitated device, threatening to tip the first hour of the new flick
beyond self-parody and straight into farce.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the series will enjoy a surreal sequence in the film
studio, when Sidney has to elude her nemesis on a series of sets
duplicating the major locations in ``Scream.'' The scene has some
of the creepy dreaminess of director Wes Craven's biggest
pre-``Scream'' hit, ``A Nightmare on Elm Street.''

   &QR;  ``Divine Trash'' (unrated) _ Remembering the excesses of John
Waters' early movies, a Baltimore film censor still goes apoplectic
with horror and disgust. This documentary about the filmmaker
returns to her repeatedly for comic relief. Yeah, she's
self-righteous. But her shock is genuine. After all, in the late
1960s and early '70s, it was a little hard to adjust to Divine, a
300-pound cross-dressing heroine who killed people, engaged in
comic-gruesome sex scenes and in one memorable finale was ravished
by a giant lobster. Intercutting film clips and interviews with
Waters and his surviving cast members, the movie is an affectionate
look at a man who took bad taste into the mainstream. Grade: B

 &HT;    12 Ideas for surviving a costly drought
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I set the alarm to get up two hours early just so you can water
the fescue and four-o'clocks. Then, in your comatose state, you
realize it's not your day _ literally _ according to the
state-imposed watering restrictions. You drift back to sleep while
your plants cower, having been rejected first by the clouds, then
by you. (Sure hope your garden doesn't include forget-me-nots.)
Like your plants, you need help. Fortunately, there's plenty out
there, from new products designed to make irrigation easy to Web
sites that monitor the drought to seminars on how to water
efficiently. To point you in the right direction, we've compiled a
drought survival kit of 12 products or ideas you might want to try
_ some old, others new.
</P>
<P>
   1. MULCH, MULCH, MULCH
</P>
<P>
   It may seem a no-brainer, but it works. Conserve what water
plants receive by applying 2 to 3 inches of mulch, such as pine
straw or shredded wood chips, around plants. Mulch also cools the
soil and prevents weeds. (Available by bale or bag at most garden
centers.)
</P>
<P>
   2. A DOWN-TO-EARTH APPROACH
</P>
<P>
   Overhead watering may be fast, but in most forms it's
inefficient for delivering water to the base of plants, where it's
most needed. A more direct route is the soaker hose, lined with
holes for emitting water slowly. (Available at most garden
centers.)
</P>
<P>
   3. SLOWLY BUT SURELY ...
</P>
<P>
   Dripper systems direct moisture where you want it instead of
allowing water to evaporate. Drip systems are available in
different sizes for various emission rates. They're also ideal for
container gardens and can be easily adapted for use with automated
irrigation systems (available from garden suppliers and irrigation
companies).
</P>
<P>
   4. CAST A SPELL ON ROOTS
</P>
<P>
   Hand-held wands offer an efficient means for placing water at
the base of plants quickly. Attach the wand to your garden hose.
Choose a wand with a cutoff valve to avoid wasting water as you
move from one area to another. (Sold at most garden centers for
under $10.)
</P>
<P>
   5. HUGGED YOUR TREE TODAY?
</P>
<P>
   Get to the root of the matter when watering trees by surrounding
them in a Treegator, a portable drip irrigation system. Fill the
doughnut-shaped bag, available in green or brown, with water and
let it drip. (20-gallon size, $49.97; 14-gallon size, $39.97 at
Hastings Nature &AMP; Garden Center.)
</P>
<P>
   6. CHECK BEFORE YOU WATER
</P>
<P>
   Lawns require an inch of water a week during droughts. How much
is that? Don't guess; underwatering can be as bad as overwatering.
Use a rain gauge to determine when your turf's had enough, such as
this plastic cone ($11.97 at Hastings Nature &AMP; Garden Center). Or
you can set out empty tuna fish cans. When they're full, you're
done watering.
</P>
<P>
   7. S-T-R-E-T-C-H IT!
</P>
<P>
   Who says a heavy hose has to beat up your plants? The Garden
Coil Indoor/Outdoor Watering Wand features a lightweight coiled
hose ideal for reaching high places, such as hanging baskets. The
coil can be attached to a hose or the faucet, and its spray nozzle
adjusts for stream, mist or spray. ($74.97 at Hastings Nature &AMP;
Garden Center.)
</P>
<P>
   8. SAY AHHHH
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there's a drought, but plants can be deceiving. Some wilt
because of the heat, not lack of water. Before wasting more water,
test the soil's moisture level with a Moisture, Light &AMP; pH Meter.
Simply plant the probe in the ground and follow instructions.
($19.97 at Hastings Nature &AMP; Garden Center.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Water in early morning: Aim for 4 to 8 a.m. to prevent
evaporation. That's when soil is coolest and best able to absorb
moisture. Watering in the evening is better than in the heat of
afternoon, but remember: When not given time to dry, wet lawns and
foliage attract insects and disease.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Water for long spells: Short waterings promote shallow root
growth. During dry spells, lawns need at least 1 inch of water per
week, which takes a sprinkler about 90 minutes to deliver to one
spot. If you don't have a rain gauge, set out an empty tuna fish
can; when it fills, you've watered enough.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Water feet, not foliage: Use soaker hoses or hoses with
hand-held wands to deliver water at the base of plants, not on
them. Overhead sprinklers and irrigation systems are effective for
large lawns but waste water when it comes to trees, shrubs and
small plants. (Up to 40 percent of air-bound water can be lost to
evaporation.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Water to the touch, not the sight: Some plants wilt in the
afternoon heat even when not dry. Before watering, make sure
they're dry by digging down several inches in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Water your biggest investments: If need be, let the turf and
annuals go and focus your watering on your most expensive plants _
trees and shrubs. Grass and annuals are usually more
drought-tolerant and less costly to replace. An established Bermuda
lawn can endure up to eight weeks without supplemental water,
whereas trees and shrubs are less likely to survive. Remember: It's
expensive not only to replace a dead tree but to have one removed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Emphasize drought-resistant plants in your garden. Crape
myrtles and junipers are tough trees and shrubs, as opposed to
dogwoods and azaleas. Among annuals and perennials, consider
lantana, portulaca, geraniums, black-eyed Susans, coneflower and
sedum.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Have your irrigation system inspected by a professional to
ensure it's calibrated correctly and distributing the correct
amount of water. A system that's not working properly not only
wastes water but also can damage lawns by uneven distribution or
overwatering.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Conserve water by mulching beds with 2 to 3 inches of pine
straw or shredded wood chips. Fine-textured mulches hold moisture
better than coarse-textured ones. Keep mulch 2 to 3 inches away
from the base of trees and shrubs to prevent the spread of insects
and disease.

 &HT;    Poundcake proves to be just peachy
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lisa Hale of Kennesaw, Ga., is a peach for digging out her copy
of a frosted peach poundcake published here many years ago that
Lydia Miller of Decatur requested.
</P>
<P>
   Make the cake with fresh peaches when they are available. Cook 2
cups sliced peaches in a bit of water until they reduce to a
heaping cupful. Then use half in the cake and half in the frosting.
When fresh peaches aren't in season, canned ones will do _ just
chop or mash and add.

 &HT;    SHOPPING DESTINATION: East Atlanta Village
 &HT;    Urban chic fuses with neighborhood charm
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ East Atlanta Village hasn't always been a bastion of
urban grunge chic. Those who haven't visited in the past half-dozen
years or so might remember it as the poster child for urban blight.
But that was before the Heaping Bowl and Brew restaurant and the
oh-so-trendy Sacred Grounds Cafe landed on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Today you'll see the beginnings of an up-and-coming area that's
sure to attract attention. And the feel here is that of a
neighborhood in the truest sense, where many business owners live
and work.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Park owns Park Pet Supply, reminiscent of an
old-fashioned pet store and radically different from the massive
marts so prevalent today. Customers and their pets wander in and
are known by their first names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here four years, and being a pet owner and knowing
a lot of pet owners here, I saw a need and just went for it,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   At Park you can buy pet toys, accessories and an abundance of
natural pet foods (consider senior dog food fortified with shark
cartilage and glucosamine) alongside more traditional brands.
</P>
<P>
   As you'd expect from a conscientious pet lover, Park doesn't
sell pets, but don't be surprised if you find some stray kittens
available for adoption in her store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do take in strays sometimes because it's the season and the
problem is really bad around here, but it's not part of our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   As you wander past the brightly painted storefronts, it's not
hard to picture an early Greenwich Village _ one sprinkled with
avocado, plum, tangerine and silver Dixie dust, that is.
</P>
<P>
   While the sidewalks could use a bit of TLC, the Village is still
walker-friendly, when you consider that the shopping and dining
districts encompass two short blocks. Most of the stores are on
Flat Shoals Avenue, while the bulk of the eateries (except for
Heaping Bowl and Brew and Sacred Grounds) reside on Glenwood
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Merav Simon opened Village Wear with business partner
Shannan Muery. This sleek blond-and-white store offers casual
women's clothing from BCBG Separates, Buffalo Jeans and French
Connection. For accessories, don't miss delicate jewelry and handy
small shoulder bags in subdued black and vibrant Indian silks
dotted with shimmering mirror diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Simon likes the area so much that she suggested her best friend,
Tracey Cabrey, open an art gallery a few doors down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't know if this place was ready to support a
gallery,'' says Cabrey, ``so instead I opened Bella's Splendor. I
like to say that I sell handmade functional artwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Her store is chock-full of glassware, pottery, kitchenware and
linens _ most of which are hand-crafted.
</P>
<P>
   Cross the street to Bubbles and you'll be met by a lipstick-pink
awning and a pair of flamingo-tinted lawn chairs, which match
perfectly with the bathtub inside. As its name implies, Bubbles
offers a wonderland of bath and body treasures. You'll trip over
soaps by the slice, sisal body brushes, lush bath towels and enough
aromatherapy products to keep your olfactory sense in perpetual
nirvana. This is the place to go for fish-splattered hot water
bottles and one of the best greeting card selections in the metro
area.
</P>
<P>
   Take a few steps to Glenwood and you'll run into Blumen for the
Home. Owner Brian Story calls his store an eclectic mix of home
accessories, gifts and a European florist.
</P>
<P>
   The way Steven Malcolm describes his gifts and gadgets store,
Space Tribe, pretty much sums up what you'll encounter in East
Atlanta Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to fill it with things that are really mod and
futuristic,'' he says, ``with a little '70s retro thrown in.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take the Downtown Connector to the I-20 exit.
Merge onto I-20 east. Take the Moreland Avenue exit and go right
about half a mile and turn left onto Glenwood Avenue, then take a
sharp left onto Flat Shoals Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most stores are open 10 or 11 a.m.-7 p.m. weekdays;
until 10 or 11 p.m. Fridays-Saturdays; noon-5 p.m. Sundays; closed
Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: In front of the stores; and free parking in the lot
adjacent to Park Pet Supply.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Some stores are more accessible than
others.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: No public restrooms, but they're available in
restaurants for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The urban pioneer of East Atlanta Village, Heaping Bowl and
Brew, offers plenty of its namesake. Here you'll dine on filling
bowls of fusion fare in a casual storefront setting. Note that the
restaurant is now serving lunch. $3.95-$6.95. Hours: 11 a.m.-11
p.m. Mondays-Thursdays; 11a.m.-midnight Fridays-Saturdays; 11
a.m.-10 p.m. Sundays. 469 Flat Shoals Ave. 404-523-8030.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pastificio Cameli provides an ideal spot in which to indulge
in a wide range of well-executed pasta dishes at reasonable prices.
$9.75-$17. Hours: 5-10 p.m. Sundays, Tuesdays-Thursdays; 5-10:30
p.m. Fridays-Saturdays; closed Mondays. 1263 Glenwood Ave.

 &HT;    Locate hard to find items
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having trouble finding a particular item? We'll try to help you
locate it. But because of the volume of mail, we cannot track down
every request. Readers whose queries are answered in the column
will receive a blue-and-cream canvas Buyer's Edge tote bag. Write
us at Buyer's Edge Find It,The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, P.O.
Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302; e-mail us at buyersedge(at)ajc.com
(please include your name, the city you live in and daytime phone
number); or call 404-582-7642.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been trying without luck to find Allerest, which is
excellent for my allergies. Has it been discontinued? If not, can
you locate it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Diane Carlson, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: No more sneezing for you. Pick up Maximum Strength Allerest
(24-tablet box, $3.99) at CVS, 3010 Centerville Road, Snellville
(770-736-6512), or at Drug Emporium, 2320 Pleasant Hill Road,
Duluth (770-623-9444). A 24-tablet box is $4.97. This
antihistamine/nasal decongestant, says Heritage Consumer Products,
offers allergy and hay fever sufferers temporary relief from runny
nose; sneezing; itchy, watery eyes; and nasal congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for the stain remover DidiSeven. It comes in a
box with a green and red label.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brett Foster, Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another request: Can you locate DidiSeven, a cleaning
product? I have called all over Atlanta, with no luck.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patricia Foster, Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another request: I have been trying hard to find a source
for DidiSeven, a reliable stain remover. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _ Trudy Kretchman, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: You fans of DidiSeven _ advertised as The Miracle Stain
Remover _ can pick it up at Walgreens, 5455 Lawrenceville Highway,
Lilburn (770-381-8582). A 2-ounce tube is $5.99. Interwood Products
Limited says DidiSeven ``will remove hundreds of stains, including
grease, grass stains, blood, crayon and lipstick.'' The product
also takes stains out of china and cleans walls, floors,
appliances, carpets and upholstery _ even whitewall tires.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find Salad Cream, made by Heinz? I tasted it in
England and fell in love with it. My husband is British and would
also like to enjoy the dressing here.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nancy P. Quinn, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Queen Elizabeth probably enjoys this dressing on her salads,
too, since the bottle bears the official royal seal: ``By
Appointment to her Majesty the Queen.'' We found Heinz Salad Cream
at Harry's Farmers Market, 2025 Satellite Pointe, Duluth
(770-416-6900). A 10-ounce glass bottle is $1.59. It's also stocked
at Taste of Britain, 73 S. Peachtree St., Norcross (770-242-8585).
A 15-ounce plastic bottle is $4.99. For a taste treat, drizzle this
mayo-type dressing _ imported from England _ on sandwiches, baked
potatoes, burgers and pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the travel season upon us, I have been searching for two
travel games for my children _ Auto Bingo and Traffic Safety Bingo.
They look like bingo cards with red plastic ``windows.'' When you
find the indicated item, you close the window.
</P>
<P>
   _ Andrea Pace, Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: No more cries of ``Are we there yet?'' when your kids can
play travel bingo. Each card has such items as a truck, traffic
light, train, billboard, etc. As a player spots an object, he or
she ``closes'' the window. The player who first marks a complete
row either across, up and down or diagonally wins. And no pencil or
board markers are needed. Auto Bingo ($2 a card) is available at
Restoration Hardware stores in the Atlanta area. Buy the cards on
the Internet at www.familyonboard.com. You get two boards each of
Auto Bingo and Traffic Safety Bingo for $6. Or order at
1-800-793-2075.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Cajun Chef Louisiana Hot Sauce. It's red and
has a great taste, but I can't find it in any of the grocery stores
around here. Do you know where I can buy it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Guy S. Green,
</P>
<P>
   Cedartown, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Spice up your life, and gumbo, with this hot sauce, which we
tracked down at Long John Silver restaurants. We found our 12-ounce
bottle ($1.49) at the Norcross location, 5309 Jimmy Carter Blvd.
(770-449-8506). For real Cajun flavor, pour the sauce, which is
made from Louisiana cayenne peppers and distilled vinegar, on
seafood before frying and after boiling.

 &HT;    Cooks can improve dishes by hitting the bottle
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If your cooking occasionally gets lackluster and devoid of a
certain spirit, perhaps it is time to add that spirit directly with
_ what else? _ spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyday cooks are somewhat familiar with using rum or
brandy for holiday baking, but bourbon, gin, scotch, tequila, vodka
and a host of other liqueurs can add an exciting dimension to most
everything you cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like spirits to liberate the flavor of
whatever you are cooking,'' said Gary Regan, chef and co-author
with his wife, Mardee Haidin Regan, of numerous books on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find so fascinating about cooking with spirits,'' Regan
said, ``is the degree that they will intensify the flavor of a
dish. Dairy products like cream, milk and butter will do that, but
not to the degree of spirits. Alcohol has the power of grabbing,
heightening and distributing the flavors of all the other
ingredients in a dish.''
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to gourmet cooks and wine connoisseurs, we
everyday cooks know that an unmeasured splash of wine _ almost any
wine you have on hand _ can work a little magic on just about
whatever is simmering on the stove.
</P>
<P>
   But cooking with liquor requires a bit more study. To get the
best results, certain rules apply.
</P>
<P>
   For instance:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start with good-quality alcohol. Cooking will not improve a
spirit that doesn't taste good to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure the alcohol is cooked. Even if a recipe calls for it
to be added near the end of the process, if it's not cooked, an
unpleasant taste can result. If it's added at the end, make sure
it's reduced over a high heat, which will cause most of the alcohol
to evaporate and concentrate the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep in mind that you are using spirits as an ingredient. Be
as judicious with liquor as you would with any other spice or
flavoring.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use the liquor in a dish it marries well with. A powerful
liquor will overwhelm a delicate dish.
</P>
<P>
   So if you are ready to add little mini-bottles of liquor next to
the rosemary and thyme on your spice shelf, check out these sites
on the Internet for a good start and some exciting recipes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To begin, go to the helpful chart put out by the Distilled
Spirits Council of the United States at
www.discus.health.org/favorite.htm to see at a glance what liquor
goes well with what meat, fish, poultry, cheese, fruit or
vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   You will see that gin goes especially well with lamb roasts and
chops, fish of all kinds _ especially salmon _ and cold cooked
shrimp. Save your rum for ham, pork roasts and veal and your
bourbon for bratwurst, Italian sausage, beef roasts, roast chicken,
duck, goose and turkey. You'll see that vodka can do wonders for
all citrus, melons, berries and tomatoes, while scotch brings out
the best in apples, bananas, prunes, raisins, baked carrots,
onions, potatoes, acorn squash and candied yams. There are also
lists of what herbs and spices go well with what spirits.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About.com predictably offers excellent and well-presented
information about cooking with beer, tequila and champagne. Go to
homecooking
</P>
<P>
   .about.com/food/homecooking/library
</P>
<P>
   /weekly/topicsubalc.htm for detailed articles, history and links
to other related sites.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You would expect a site called ``Cocktailtimes'' at
www.cocktailtimes.com to have information about cocktails, and you
won't be disappointed. There are recipes for every cocktail you
ever heard of and many you haven't. But there is also an excellent
section on cooking with spirits that includes recipes for meat,
seafood, pasta, soups, side dishes and desserts and appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Cooking with Spirits'' at
www.cookingwithspirits.com/index.html is essentially a gathering
place for enthusiasts to share recipes. Contributors have added
brandy to onion soup, tequila to turkey chili and cognac to
cranberries. And one has blended 1/2 cup gin, 1/4 cup dry vermouth,
1/4 cup vinegar, 2/3 cup oil and 1 envelope of Italian Good Seasons
dressing to make Martini Salad dressing _ sounds intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Association of Canadian Distillers sponsors a cooking show
on Canadian television. For some spirited recipes from the show,
see www
</P>
<P>
   .canadiandistillers.com/eng/AboutSpirits
</P>
<P>
   /foodshowrecipe.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Inferno Vodka site at www.infernovodka
</P>
<P>
   .com/food.htm offers a compilation of recipes contributed by
vodka specialists, which includes putting a tad of vodka in
everything from onion rings to biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And don't forget to spend a little time at Jack's _ that's the
Jack Daniel's Web site, which devotes quite a bit of quality space
to the culinary wonders of Tennessee's favorite whiskey. See Around
the Tennessee Table at www.jackdaniels.com/tennesseetable/main.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For an industry insider's look at how some of America's top
chefs are ``hitting the bottle,'' see an article at
www.rimag.com/05/menu.htm.
</P>
<P>
   If using any alcohol is a concern to you, then you should be
aware that there is a common misconception that alcohol evaporates
when it is used in cooking. In fact, much of it does, but there is
always some residue, however small, that will remain in the dish,
according to Gary Regan. ``It depends on how much you use, how long
it cooks and the amount of other ingredients,'' he said.

<P>
   Here are just a few of the recipes that have earned ``Mama
Lois'' Heard a reputation as the best cook on the Nashville tour

she cooks for at Lanierland Country Music Park just outside
Cumming, Ga.

   Triple Berry Dessert Salad (Diet)
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: about 20 minutes Chilling time: several hours,
divided
</P>
<P>
   Using sugar-free gelatin cuts some of the calories in this
recipe, which is probably closer to dessert than salad _ but with
all the cream cheese and sour cream, it may not fit a
nutritionist's definition of ``diet.'' Whatever. It's still pretty
and tastes good, especially on a hot summer day.
</P>
<P>
   2 (.3-ounce) boxes triple berry sugar-free gelatin (or 1 box
strawberry sugar-free gelatin, 1 box raspberry sugar-free gelatin)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups hot water
</P>
<P>
   1 (21-ounce) can strawberry pie filling

   20 individual serving packs Equal
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   In a medium mixing bowl, stir gelatin into hot water until
dissolved. Add pie filling, blueberries and blackberries. Pour into
a 1 1/2-quart baking dish and refrigerate until congealed, about 1
hour.
</P>
<P>
   In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat together the cream
cheese, sour cream, Equal and vanilla until smooth. Spread on
gelatin layer. Sprinkle pecans on top and chill for several hours
before serving.

<P>
   1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick) butter, melted
</P>

   In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a large mixing
bowl, combine 5 cups flour and the sugar. Cut in shortening using a
pastry blender or two knives. Add yeast and buttermilk, mixing
well. Turn out onto a generously floured surface and knead lightly.
Pat or roll dough out to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Cut out
biscuits using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter. Brush a baking sheet
with melted butter and place the biscuits on it. Brush the biscuits
with the remaining melted butter. Let rise about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While biscuits are rising, preheat oven to 450 degrees. After
they have risen, place in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, or

DIXIE REDESIGN: FUN AND FANCY WITHOUT THE DUST 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Her name _ Angele Parlange _ could be a new
perfume. And when she opens the door, wearing aqua silk pants
printed with 19th-century signatures, legs slim as dental floss, it
hardly seems surprising to encounter a silk tent over the dining
table, festooned with ostrich plumes.
</P>
<P>
   Is it decor or a masked ball?
</P>
<P>
   In a city of ancestor worship, where family history comes
entombed in leather-bound albums, Parlange may be the nerviest gal
in town. The eighth generation to be raised at Parlange, one of
Louisiana's most celebrated plantations, she has ancestors who
include a justice of the state Supreme Court and the Parisian
socialite Virginie Gautreau, better known as Madame X of the John
Singer Sargent portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Like Scarlett O'Hara, who fashioned a dress by ripping down her
mother's curtains, Parlange has creatively and flamboyantly
reinterpreted her family traditions in fabric, china and interior
designs of the hyperfeminine variety. She thinks nothing of
borrowing from the legacy of her great-great-grandmother and then
dressing it up Mardi Gras-style in feather boas and fuchsia
taffeta: Call the look Parlangerie.
</P>
<P>
   Her boudoir-style bedroom exhibits the come-hither look now
coursing through the fashion world. Perhaps only Parlange _ whose
great-great-grandmother saved the plantation from destruction by
wooing Union troops with food, wine and riveting repartee _ could
fashion turquoise silk curtains printed with French love poems and
not come across like a floozy. ``Angele is comfortable with
antebellum culture, but with her it becomes a living thing rather
than stuffed behind glass,'' said Jane Stubbs, her friend and now
proprietor of a rare books and prints boutique at Bergdorf Goodman.
``We usually get a big dose of the Old South. It's pride-making to
have a Southern designer not going down that road.''
</P>
<P>
   Parlange grew up surrounded by gilt mirrors and Sevres vases
shipped back from Paris by her great-great grandmother, Virginie de
Ternant Parlange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the proper things,'' she says of a childhood in which
silver egg cups appeared daily at the breakfast table and milk was
served in silver mint julep cups. ``I've always been surrounded by
portraits and stories and family furniture. I like expressing
myself using history. It forms you.''
</P>
<P>
   Parlange, who taught Martha Stewart how to mix a sazerac, the
beloved New Orleans cocktail, on national television, lives in a
five-room apartment in the city's Uptown district.
</P>
<P>
   Her home is itself a cocktail of creolized influences, not the
least of which is autobiography. Family photographs are
silk-screened on draperies. The silk tent, for instance, an
extravaganza of yardage with cascading organdy sheers, recalls her
girlhood at Parlange, where pigeonniers lined pea-gravel pathways
and there were stroll gardens dense with camelias and ardisia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were little tents in the garden,'' she recalled one
evening, graciously offering a sazerac, made from rye whiskey,
locally produced Peychaud's bitters, Herbsaint (a locally made
absinthe substitute) and sugar, and there were always places to
hide behind the odd Remington statue. ``I loved the feeling of
pretending, of being somewhere else. My mother always assured us
there were fairies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There were certainly illustrious visitors, like the Duchess of
Devonshire, owner of Chatsworth in England. (Parlange itself, built
in the style of a raised West Indian cottage, is considered the
cover girl of Louisiana plantation architecture.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the grandest time,'' her mother, who is known as Lucy,
says of her daughter's childhood.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Parlange has recreated the festive atmosphere at home. At dinner
beneath the big top, she sets the table with raspberry- and
tangerine-trimmed china, her own Maltby Lustree collection,
available at Bergdorf Goodman. Place cards are in the shape of
poodles or mermaids. Lump crabmeat frequently overflows from the
soup tureen. An architect friend of Parlange's, William Sonner,
collaborated in the design of an aqua table, its arabesque shape
inspired by her fabric. Their fleur-de-lis chairs are conversation
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get dressed up when they go to Angele's,'' observes
Julia Reed, a Vogue writer, who regards the masked-ball decor as a
Southernized version of ``The Thin Man.'' ``They don't want to look
dull in the setting.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Parlange conceives of rooms the way that consummate set designer
Walt Disney might, as a series of vignettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to dress up,'' she says nonchalantly. ``It lets life
be a little lighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Practically every nook contains some element of family history.
The guest bedroom, for instance, was inspired by her grandmother's
lilac-color lusterware oyster plates, which hang decoratively on
the wall near the aubergine draperies. (The word purple does not
exist in Parlange's vocabulary.) They are printed with silver
scroll motifs adapted from New Orleans ironwork.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the 20th century, when oysters on the half shell
were fashionable, the leading porcelain and china manufacturers
produced decorative sets of oyster plates as the appetizer
equivalent of cake plates. (They can also be found in antiques
shops or in New Orleans at Lucullus Antiques, on Magazine Street
and Chartres Street, which specialize in French culinary antiques.)
</P>
<P>
   The spool bed is the one she grew up in, its headboard
slipcovered with lavender silk. A beaded chandelier drops
romantically from the canopy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to go to bed in something that's pretty and
unusual,'' she said. ``I like to have a little surprise in rooms
that makes them interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   She tweaks antiques, upholstering them in hothouse colors _ the
French daybed in the living room, for instance, covered in orchid
silk. It is perhaps the home-design equivalent of paintings one's
toenails Lilly Pulitzer coral.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Parlange, a former dress designer, often uses dress fabrics for
furniture, especially douppioni, an Indian silk, and feather boas
and ostrich plumes from theatrical and costume shops. She bought a
1950s steel laboratory cabinet in New Roads, her hometown, and
brought it to a Corvette auto-body shop to have it spray-painted
celadon. ``Corvette colors weren't the right look,'' she said, ``so
I had to go to BMW.''
</P>
<P>
   Her fabrics are not in release, but like her china and tabletop
accessories, they wittily plumb the ancestral depths. One pattern
was inspired by Virginie, who forsook the swamps to spend half the
year in Paris in her chateau and salon. Visiting barons and
viscounts and other aristocrats would leave their calling cards,
which Parlange unearthed, impressed by their beautiful script and
crests. She based another fabric on an 1842 plantation inventory
itemizing the family's possessions, including a candle-burning
crystal bronze chandelier, which still hangs at Parlange.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Angele Parlange, who is working as an independent style
consultant, says she began her entrepreneurial career selling
horseback rides down the endless driveway of Parlange, then
eventually graduated to selling Kleenex, two for a nickel, by the
side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, she had a store called the Tree House set up on the
porch of Parlange, where she sold beaded matchboxes to tourists
visiting the house. More recently, she developed the A-list for the
opening of the W Hotel in New Orleans. She briefly had a store but
closed it, sending out announcements inviting friends and customers
to an IADT sale (translation: I Already Did That).
</P>
<P>
   The invitations were illustrated with a cartoon of a young woman
in a vintage convertible _ a chic young woman who was eager to go
places.

&HT;     MORE CONTROVERSY OVER SUPREME COURT AND RELIGION IN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, July 9)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1789, as the new American government began to
function with George Washington at is helm, Benjamin Franklin wrote
a friend: ``Our Constitution is in actual operation; everything
appears to promise that it will last, but in this world nothing is
certain but death and taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were living today, that wise statesman might expand his
list of certainties to include fervent debate over the role of
religion in our schools and other taxpayer-supported institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The issue resurfaced with dramatic impact last month when the
Supreme Court ruled, 6-to-3, that it was unconstitutional for a the
Santa Fe, Texas, school district to allow a student, chosen in a
school-sponsored election, to deliver a prayer before a high school
football game.
</P>
<P>
   In his majority decision, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote: ``The
religious liberty protected by the Constitution is abridged when
the state affirmatively sponsors the particular religious practice
of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the minority, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,
said that the majority opinion ``bristled with hostility to all
things religious in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men are able jurists dedicated to protecting the
Constitution. They are the two senior members of the current court
and both were appointed by Republican presidents who were lawyers _
Rehnquist by Richard Nixon and Stevens by Gerald Ford. But they
often differ in their interpretation of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist tends to be a pillar of the court's conservative bloc,
although he joined the moderates on June 26 in upholding the 1966
Miranda ruling that suspects who are arrested must be informed of
their rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer during police
questioning. Stevens is a guiding force among the moderates.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of religion in public schools, their opposing
views reflect a national dichotomy. Millions of Americans believe
organized religion should play a larger role in our lives and
millions more are equally committed to the Jeffersonian concept of
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   So wedded was Thomas Jefferson to that belief that he had listed
on his gravestone at Monticello, near Charlottesville, Va., the
three accomplishments he was most proud of: ``Author of the
Declaration of Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for
Religious Freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia.''
Since 1962 and 1963, when the court decreed in two rulings that
daily recitation of prayer in public schools was unconstitutional,
the issue has divided Americans and led many to make foolish,
intemperate comments. One such remark came a few years ago from
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who contended that the crisis in public
education could be traced back to the court's decrees.
</P>
<P>
   That is sheer poppycock. The crisis in public education has
resulted from many factors, including a breakdown in family life
and an almost revolutionary change in where and how members of our
society live.
</P>
<P>
   Religion has not been taken away from the American people. Its
practice and its teaching simply have been relegated, through
interpretation of the Constitution, to the home and the church,
where they belong.
</P>
<P>
   But a ruling like the June 19 school prayer decision is bound to
ignite anger and lead normally composed individuals to resort to
inflammatory rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that most people on both sides of the religious
issue are sincere. They either were angered or pleased by the
court's decision. But it would be unfair to demonize them for
holding deeply-felt ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has cropped in the campaign between George W. Bush and
Al Gore for the White House. Bush, who supported the Santa Fe
school district's prayer policy, is under heavy pressure from
conservatives to promise to appoint to the high court individuals
who are considered ``strict constructionists'' in their reading of
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Gore is under pressure to name justices who
are relatively liberal in their reading of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the next president is Bush or Gore, he probably will
have the opportunity to nominate two or three new justices. Stevens
is now 80; Rehnquist is 75, and Sandra Day O'Connor is 70. In
addition, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 67, has had cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who is president, the controversy will continue. The
next chapter could be the high court's decision on laws, such as
one recently passed Virginia, that permit a moment of silence in
public classrooms at the beginning of each day. Most of these laws
were written to convey a secular purpose, but the justices could
decide that such wording is just a subterfuge.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, it is a certainty that the school prayer issue will
remain a source of contention.

<P>
   ROYAL OAK, Md. _ As the architect behind the $81 million
renovation of the Library of Congress, Arthur Cotton Moore would
seem to be an expert on coordinating complex projects. But his own
home here, some 50 miles east of Washington, was almost his
undoing. On the lawn behind the house lie several 30-foot-long
curved steel girders. Has Moore acquired a Richard Serra sculpture?
``Actually,'' he explained, ``those are some of the pieces that
didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Pieces, that is, of Moore's house, in which 77 girders _ many of
which are curved and all of which were usable only if correctly
formed to within 1/16th of an inch _ collide. Assembling the house,
in a style Moore has dubbed ``industrial baroque,'' took more than
nails. As Moore's wife, Patricia, observed, ``Other people have a
family doctor; we have a family welder.''
</P>
<P>
   Seen from the water, the house has two main parts: On the right
is the master bedroom, roughly the shape of a quarter circle. On
the left is a two-story living room, also a quarter circle, but
turned up on its side.
</P>
<P>
   Between them is a ``tower wall'' sheathed in squares of
extra-tough stainless steel. ``It's the only grade of stainless
that can hold up to A-1 steak sauce,'' Patricia Moore said. (The
material, she explained, is generally used for restaurant
kitchens.)
</P>
<P>
   The tower culminates in an observation deck decorated with the
kind of asymmetrical S-curves that have become Moore's trademark.
His buildings, including the multi-use Washington Harbor complex,
take as many turns as the Potomac. During his decade-long
renovation of the Library of Congress, already one of the most
ornate buildings in the country, Moore managed to work in a few
more undulations while outfitting four new reading rooms. At his
house, every element that can assume the S-shape _ including
railings, rain gutters, even a ladder meant to be used by window
washers _ does.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has been fascinated by what he calls ``reciprocating
curves'' since he was an architecture student at Princeton in the
1950s. He said, ``In nature there's often one curve followed by a
smaller curve _ picture a blade of grass blowing in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Curves like those employed by Moore often appeared in baroque
architecture, as fanciful decoration. Centuries later, after a dry
spell for architectural curves, they reappeared in such aerodynamic
structures as airplane wings and sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   His work somehow brings these disparate impulses _ one the
height of impracticality, the other mandated by laws of physics _
into a dalliance, if not an alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 65, explained: ``The first cars, the Model T's, were
boxes with vertical windshields. No one would build a car that way
today. But houses are still boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``For thousands of years, buildings have been built to
resist gravity, but winds have largely been ignored. And winds do
more damage to buildings than gravity ever did. The box pays a
price for being a box.''
</P>
<P>
   Because wind directions _ especially on waterfront lots _ are
fairly predictable, Moore said, it was possible to build his house
to withstand 150-mile-an-hour gusts even with large expanses of
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after construction was completed (in mid-1999), Hurricane
Floyd came along to put Moore's design to the test. ``Things were
blowing all around,'' Moore said. ``The trees were literally
doubled over. But being in the house was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife interjected, ``I was scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to strict setback requirements, the shape of the house,
which has 4,000 square feet, assumes the shape of its site. Since
those requirements apply even to decking, most of the outdoor
living space is on the roof, reached by a long ramp, which Moore
said he designed for ``wheelchairs and an occasional cocktail
trolley.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moores are known in Washington as bon vivants. So how did
this citified couple end up building their house 10 miles from the
nearest supermarket?
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington, the approval process is byzantine,'' Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   After 40 years as the architect behind a number of closely
watched projects, he explained, ``I wanted to do something that had
a lot of freedom so it could be a study in pure form, a project
where you can really let 'er rip.''
</P>
<P>
   The site had to be a point of land _ because it would have no
``adjacencies'' (Moore's term for neighbors); because it would be
windy enough to test Moore's theories (``Why do you think they're
always calling these places Breezy Point?''); and because the very
shape of the property would suggest a kind of pedestal rising out
of the water. Such a pedestal would demand a bold sculptural form.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sydney Opera House is the prototypical building on a point
of land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took the couple seven years to find the right point. After
searching in Maine, on Cape Cod, Mass., and on eastern Long Island,
N.Y., they discovered Talbot County, Md., which Moore says has more
points of land than any other county in the country. One of them,
Benoni Point, had never been built on.
</P>
<P>
   Construction wasn't easy. The other houses in the area are
colonials, so it was hard to find people to do the kind of
metalwork required. Moore says the construction cost was ``several
times as much'' as a conventional dwelling's.
</P>
<P>
   The customs of rural workmen also took getting used to. ``First
there was hunting season, then there was fishing season, then there
was boating season,'' Moore said. Not to mention skepticism season.
``At first,'' Moore recalled, ``they'd say, `There's no way we can
build this.' But a few months later they were bringing their
children to see what they had done.''
</P>
<P>
   When the building was completed, the couple began filling it
with Moore's curved metal furniture, as well as with modernist
classics by Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and the Eameses. The
kitchen sports a giant, curved-steel range hood.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Moore, 58, has been the general manager of Arthur
Cotton Moore Associates since 1966. She and her husband commute
between the house and their Washington apartment, in the undulating
Watergate complex. In addition to restoration work, the firm just
completed a 600,000-square-foot Federal Communications Commission
building. Arthur Moore, a frequent author and lecturer, also
lobbies on behalf of several pet projects, including a set of steps
behind the Kennedy Center that would help link that boxy building
to the Potomac.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Moore joined the profession, his curves made him
seem iconoclastic. But today a new generation of architects, led by
Frank Gehry, are creating buildings in which curved surfaces are
the rule, not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Moore continues to use horizontal curves, as in the bedroom, and
vertical curves, as in the living room, without trying to connect
the two.
</P>
<P>
   But Gehry and others are working with continuous curves _ that
is, nearly biomorphic skins that curve in three dimensions. Their
work requires computers; Moore is most comfortable using a a
pencil. Still, he said, ``The majority of structures aren't even
putting their toe in the water when it comes to curvilinear
design.''
</P>
<P>
   Glancing at the unused girders on his lawn, Moore added,
``Curving steel in two dimensions is hard enough.''

&HT;     MORE CONTROVERSY OVER SUPREME COURT AND RELIGION IN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1789, as the new American government began to
function with George Washington at its helm, Benjamin Franklin
wrote a friend: ``Our Constitution is in actual operation;
everything appears to promise that it will last, but in this world
nothing is certain but death and taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were living today, that wise statesman might expand his
list of certainties to include fervent debate over the role of
religion in our schools and other taxpayer-supported institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The issue resurfaced with dramatic impact last month when the
Supreme Court ruled, 6-to-3, that it was unconstitutional for a the
Santa Fe, Texas, school district to allow a student, chosen in a
school-sponsored election, to deliver a prayer before a high school
football game.
</P>
<P>
   In his majority decision, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote: ``The
religious liberty protected by the Constitution is abridged when
the state affirmatively sponsors the particular religious practice
of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the minority, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,
said that the majority opinion ``bristled with hostility to all
things religious in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men are able jurists dedicated to protecting the
Constitution. They are the two senior members of the current court
and both were appointed by Republican presidents who were lawyers _
Rehnquist by Richard Nixon and Stevens by Gerald Ford. But they
often differ in their interpretation of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist tends to be a pillar of the court's conservative bloc,
although he joined the moderates on June 26 in upholding the 1966
Miranda ruling that suspects who are arrested must be informed of
their rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer during police
questioning. Stevens is a guiding force among the moderates.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of religion in public schools, their opposing
views reflect a national dichotomy. Millions of Americans believe
organized religion should play a larger role in our lives and
millions more are equally committed to the Jeffersonian concept of
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   So wedded was Thomas Jefferson to that belief that he had listed
on his gravestone at Monticello, near Charlottesville, Va., the
three accomplishments he was most proud of: ``Author of the
Declaration of Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for
Religious Freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia.''
Since 1962 and 1963, when the court decreed in two rulings that
daily recitation of prayer in public schools was unconstitutional,
the issue has divided Americans and led many to make foolish,
intemperate comments. One such remark came a few years ago from
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who contended that the crisis in public
education could be traced back to the court's decrees.
</P>
<P>
   That is sheer poppycock. The crisis in public education has
resulted from many factors, including a breakdown in family life
and an almost revolutionary change in where and how members of our
society live.
</P>
<P>
   Religion has not been taken away from the American people. Its
practice and its teaching simply have been relegated, through
interpretation of the Constitution, to the home and the church,
where they belong.
</P>
<P>
   But a ruling like the June 19 school prayer decision is bound to
ignite anger and lead normally composed individuals to resort to
inflammatory rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that most people on both sides of the religious
issue are sincere. They either were angered or pleased by the
court's decision. But it would be unfair to demonize them for
holding deeply-felt ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has cropped in the campaign between George W. Bush and
Al Gore for the White House. Bush, who supported the Santa Fe
school district's prayer policy, is under heavy pressure from
conservatives to promise to appoint to the high court individuals
who are considered ``strict constructionists'' in their reading of
the Constitution.
</P>

public classrooms at the beginning of each day. Most of these laws

U.S. JOINS OTHER NATIONS IN BANNING CHILD SOLDIERS AND
EXPLOITATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton signed two international
agreements Wednesday, one intended to prevent anyone under 18 from
being sent to war and the other to protect children from
exploitation by the sex trade and other forms of human trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the agreements should be ``signposts to the
future of the global society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To give life to our dream of a global economy that lifts all
people, first we must stand together for all children,'' he said.
Several hundred thousand children are fighting in wars, some in
civil conflicts of savage brutality. And tens of millions of
children are trafficked around the world as bonded labor or sex
slaves, according to U.N. estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day around the world and even here in the United States,
children are sold into virtual slavery or trafficked for the worst
forms of sexual abuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two agreements Clinton signed are known formally as the
Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict
and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child
Prostitution and Child Pornography. Both were approved in May by
the General Assembly as side agreements to the 1990 Convention on
the Rights of the Child, which the United States also signed, in
1995, but has never ratified.
</P>
<P>
   That core covenant on children's rights has been ratified by 191
nations, with only one other holdout, Somalia, which is effectively
without a government.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. signature is important in giving a measure momentum
around the world, officials say. But U.N. officials and diplomats
from many nations have grown accustomed to seeing the
administration in Washington back away from a fight to ratify
signed agreements after meeting resistance in the Pentagon or in
the Senate, which has been reluctant to approve treaties on a range
of issues from the environment to international criminal law or
arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would send the agreements to the Senate promptly
for ratification within the year.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than six years of international negotiations to win
Pentagon approval for the measure on child soldiers. Until January,
the U.S. military had balked because the agreement sought a blanket
ban on recruitment under the age of 18 and the United States
recruited 17 year olds with parental consent. After acknowledging
that the measure could affect fewer than 3,000 U.S. soldiers of the
1.4 million men and women in uniform, the Pentagon dropped its
objections.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on child soldiers, which is intended to apply not
only to national armies but also to guerrilla forces or irregulars
who recruit, often forcibly, the majority of the 300,000 children
thought to be involved in armed conflict, asks governments to raise
to at least 16 the minimum age of recruitment, and demands that no
one under 18 be involved in combat.
</P>
<P>
   The second agreement signed by Clinton makes it a criminal
offense to sell, trade or use children for a variety of purposes
including sexual exploitation and pornography. The measure was
first proposed by Cuba and Guatemala, among other nations, because
of other perceived violations of children's rights, including the
selling of organs and forced adoptions, said Marjorie
Newman-Williams, the communications director of Unicef.
</P>
<P>
   But with the rapid growth in human trafficking, especially the
sale of girls into brothels in Asia, the measure has gained very
wide support in the United States, Europe and other regions. Six
nations now have signed the agreement; 10 ratifications are needed
for it to come into force.

<P>
   As you belly-up to your summer barbecue, consider that David
George Gordon is probably out behind his vintage Port Townsend,
Wash., home slathering hot sauce on some barbecued cockroaches.
</P>
<P>
   That's right _ what you are trying to keep away from your picnic
are the same things this fellow with three first names is serving
up as haute cuisine. And although cockroaches will never replace a
good David Berg kosher red hot covered with dark mustard and
sauerkraut on a steamed poppy seed bun, the creepy-crawlies are
making their baseball park debut soon.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready, baseball fans: cockroach-eating contests outside
several major ballparks, including Seattle's Safeco Field (make
your July 24 reservations now).
</P>
<P>
   It all begins, appropriately enough, on July 19 outside
Chicago's Wrigley Field, home of the Cubs and who knows how many
million cockroaches. Appropriate, because it's close by Gordon's
boyhood home _ we must assume that was bug-free _ and his alma
mater, Lane Technical High School.
</P>
<P>
   And I note that because in the not-so-long-ago when I attended
Lane's arch rival, Schurz High, farther west on Addison Street, we
always considered the all-boy Lane student body as lower life
forms. I suspect that Wrigley Field went so long without night-game
lights because they were afraid of damage from cockroach stampedes
when the lights were turned on.
</P>
<P>
   As boys, we used to get free Cubs home-game tickets by going to
Wrigley Field before games to lift seats upright so sweepers could
clean beneath them. If they had counted the cockroaches beneath
those seats, the Cubbies would've had the league's best attendance
record.
</P>
<P>
   But I digress from the true social significance of Gordon's, no,
David's, or Whatsizname's accomplishment: a Chicago native who
might have gone unrecognized in his own hometown _ despite all
those photos in the post office and on milk cartons _ were it not
for his prodigious and entertaining output of nature books.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you remember his big hit, ``The Compleat Cockroach'' (Ten
Speed Press, 178 pages, $11.95). That was followed by ``The
Eat-A-Bug Cookbook'' (Ten Speed Press, 102 pages, $12.95). And
there were all those earlier field guides to the geoduck, the slug
and other indigenous creatures of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the cookbook, I've been besieged with appearance
requests,'' said David, who's actually a university-trained
biologist. ``A cable-TV company (USA Network) is making a movie
called, I think, `They Swarm,' (actually, ``They Nest'') about bugs
taking over a small town in New England ... sort of a buggy version
of Hitchcock's `The Birds,' and they approached me to do eat-a-bug
contests in four cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts July 19th, outside Wrigley Field, where they're
gonna set up some sort of little `Bug Cafe' and stage the
cockroach-eating contest. Of course, I'll have to oven-bake all of
them first _ you never want to eat a raw bug, particularly a
cockroach,'' he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a lot of preliminary work on this, like figuring out
how many cockroaches to order from Carolina Biological Supply,
which supplies most of the laboratory-reared specimens for schools
and research. I don't know how the contest people will narrow it
down, but there will be five semifinalists at each ballpark, and
each will get a plate of my `Orthopteran Orzo' (crickets in orzo
pasta) dish adapted for cockroaches. Whoever finishes the heaping
plateful first wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't just give a prize to whoever actually eats the
most cockroaches, because, well, that might seem too disgusting.
Besides, there'd always be some strange guy in Chicago or Seattle
who'd eat a couple hundred. So if we just mix them in the orzo and
see who finishes a heaping plateful first, that should work.''
</P>
<P>
   After Chicago, David takes his cockroach and pasta road show to
Yankee Stadium in New York, then to Boston, and it all comes to a
grand finale at Safeco Field on July 24.
</P>
<P>
   The contest organizers haven't set all the details yet, he said,
but David's been told that the winner in each venue gets $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, if only my mother could see me now!'' David said of his
notoriety. Lots of bona fide organizations and associations have
besieged him with appearance requests since the bug cookbook came
off the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``And wherever I travel, I try to catch a local cockroach and
bring it home to preserve and stick on a big wall map with pinned
cockroaches from Washington, D.C., New Orleans. I'm also booked to
give a cooking demonstration in Boston, at the Massachusetts Museum
of Contemporary Art, and this fall, in New Hampshire and
Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (July 11) is the high point: I'm going to give a short
cooking demonstration in Pasadena, at a convention of American TV
critics.''
</P>
<P>
   High point?

   NORRISTOWN, Pa. -- They call it the Keystone State, and in this
unpredictable election year, Pennsylvania is living up to its name.
</P>
<P>
   Often overlooked in national politics, Pennsylvania suddenly
finds itself playing a central role in the 2000 campaign -- not
only in the race for the White House, but also in the cutthroat
competition for control of both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The state will officially step into the spotlight at the end of
this month, when the National Republican Convention begins in
Philadelphia. The focus will become even sharper if Tom Ridge,
Pennsylvania's popular Republican governor, is chosen as George W.
Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   But the importance of the nation's fifth-most populous state is
already hard to exaggerate. In the race for the White House it is a
swing state, and too close to call. In the struggle for control of
the Senate, Pennsylvania has one of the nation's most vulnerable
incumbents, freshman Republican Rick Santorum. In the House
campaign, at least three seats are up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   All this in a wide-open year, when the potential for
simultaneous change in partisan control of the presidency, the
Senate and the House is considered greater than in any year since
1952, when the Eisenhower landslide swept the Democrats out of the
White House and both chambers of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pennsylvania is ground zero in national politics this year,''
said Rich Bond, a former chairman of the Republican National
Committee. ``In every important arena of this year's elections,
Pennsylvania is on the cutting edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing underscores the importance of the Keystone State like
the swirl of speculation around Ridge, a second-term governor whose
support of abortion rights could help Bush expand his appeal to
moderate voters in key swing states -- if he doesn't alienate the
GOP's core anti-abortion vote in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Ridge as a running mate would send a clear
signal that Bush wants to make a stand in the Rust Belt states that
run west through Illinois -- a group of states that, with the
exception of Indiana, went Democratic in the 1990s. Pennsylvania,
with its 23 Electoral College votes, is a key prize in this region.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the White House contest between Bush and Vice
President Al Gore is a toss-up here. The latest statewide poll,
conducted in May by the American Research Group, found Bush ahead
by 3 points, 45 percent to 42 percent, which is within the 4-point
margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shaping up as a neck-and-neck race,'' said G. Terry
Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at
Millersville University. ``The selection of Ridge as a running mate
would probably help Bush, but even that wouldn't necessarily be
decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania has been a touch-and-go state in just about every
presidential election of the past century, and its residents have
shown a tendency to split their votes between Republican and
Democratic candidates in the same election. For instance, they
voted for Bill Clinton in the 1990s even while electing Ridge, two
Republican senators and a Republican majority in both houses of the
state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider Pennsylvania one of the three best bellwether
states in presidential races -- right up there with Michigan and
Missouri,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, a veteran political observer
who edits the Rothenberg Report, a nonpartisan campaign newsletter.
``As usual, it is shaping up as one of the closest races in the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   What this means, of course, is that Bush and Gore, along with
the two national parties and dozens of special-interest groups,
will bombard the state with television advertising, radio spots and
direct mail. And because New Jersey is another key presidential
target, the Philadelphia media market, which includes southern New
Jersey, is likely to be one of the most saturated in the country
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity is already being felt. ``I've been in this
business for a long time, and I've never seen anything like this
year,'' said Vito Canuso, the chairman of the Republican Party in
Philadelphia. ``Things are competitive at every level, and the
number of fund-raising letters, invitations and solicitations I am
receiving is totally crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Santorum's Senate seat will probably be just as
tough as the presidential contest. Although most political analysts
believe Democrats face an uphill battle in their quest to regain
Senate control -- a feat that would require a net change of six
seats -- Santorum is seen as particularly vulnerable. As a result,
his opponent, Ron Klink, is getting help from Democrats nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see Santorum as the second-weakest Republican incumbent in
the country,'' said Jamie Fox, executive director of the national
Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, rating Sen. Rod Grams of
Minnesota ahead of him. ``We will definitely spend money there, and
we think that is very fertile ground for us.''
</P>
<P>
   There has not been a reliable statewide poll on the Senate race
in two months, but a survey by the Mellman Group in April found
Santorum leading the lesser-known Klink by only 12 points --
suggesting Klink has room to improve as he begins to make his case
to the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Klink has got some ground to make up, but we think he can win
even if he is outspent 3-1,'' Fox said. Campaign officials estimate
that Santorum will raise between $12 million and $14 million while
Klink raises between $5 million and $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the struggle for control of the House -- which, like the
Senate, hinges on a six-seat swing -- three races in Pennsylvania
rate among the 20 closest in the nation. The race for Klink's seat,
in the western 4th District, is one; the other seats belong to
freshman Democrats Don Sherwood in the 10th District and Joe
Hoeffel, whose 13th District has its center here in Norristown.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled against the rippling flank of the Schuylkill River, the
13th District is an affluent swath of suburbia that defines the
northwestern edge of metro Philadelphia. It trends Republican but
has a streak of moderation, and its congressional seat has changed
hands from party to party in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel, who defeated Republican Jon Fox in 1998 after losing to
him in the nation's closest congressional election of 1996 (84
votes separated the two), finds himself now in a close contest with
moderate Republican state Sen. Stuart Greenleaf, whose politics
seem ideally matched for the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give the edge to Hoeffel simply because incumbents
always have the advantage,'' said Millersville University's
Madonna. ``But if Hoeffel is going to get beaten, it will be at the
hands of someone like Greenleaf, so who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the result in the Hoeffel-Greenleaf race, the 13th
District is a perfect gauge not only for Pennsylvania but for the
nation in this competitive election year. Its rolling hills are
filled with the kind of moderate-minded professionals and soccer
moms the major parties will target nationally.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for both parties right now is that voters don't
seem focused on -- or even very interested in -- the 2000
elections. Random interviews with three dozen voters in Norristown
and the nearby towns of Gladwyne and Conshohocken found a profound
level of apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even on my radar screen,'' said Alice Mindicino of
Gladwyne, who described herself as an independent voter with
Republican leanings. ``I know we've got the Republican convention
coming up and all that stuff, but the election is a long way off.''
</P>
<P>
   Political professionals here are somewhat stymied by the depth
of unconcern, but most predict that voters will clue in to the
historic nature of this year's elections by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many close races, and there will be so much
advertising this year that you won't be able to get away from it,''
predicted the Philadelphia GOP's Canuso. ``It's going to be a wild
ride.'' PH END HASSELL (John Hassell is a staff writer with The
Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J.)

MEDICAL RESEARCH ENGINE IS SPUTTERING DESPITE PROMISING ADVANCES

 By BRUCE TAYLOR SEEMAN 
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- A serious problem is emerging in the corridors of
medical schools and pharmaceutical companies: There are not enough
doctors to transfer new knowledge into real medicine.
</P>
<P>
   This is an era of unprecedented medical promise, a time when the
decoding of genetics and other secrets of life is spawning wondrous
strategies against disease. But without specially trained clinical
researchers, medical experts say, test tube discoveries may
languish in the lab -- no new drug to prevent migraines, perhaps;
no gene manipulation to block breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the researcher shortage is among several worries
clogging the gears of clinical research just when the enterprise
should be shifting into overdrive. Among others:
</P>
<P>
   -- Some tests are funded by the government, others by drug
companies or foundations. No one is tracking how many studies are
ongoing, or for what diseases. Some tests may be redundant, and
deserving illnesses may be getting scant attention.
</P>
<P>
   -- Not enough patients participate in tests. Fewer than 3
percent of adult cancer patients, for example, enroll in clinical
trials. Experts say sign-ups are low because doctors rarely
recommend the tests and patients are often afraid.
</P>
<P>
   -- The government continues to wrestle with how to protect
patients. Although the January death of a teen-ager in a gene
therapy trial was a rare event, local oversight boards are often
too busy to properly monitor safety, a federal investigator
recently concluded.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent round table organized by the Institute of Medicine,
part of the National Academy of Sciences, leading doctors outlined
an urgent need to jump-start clinical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we find a gene that affects a disease, the public is
going to expect life will change for the better,'' said Dr. William
Crowley, a Harvard University medical professor who directs
clinical research at Massachusetts General Hospital. ``But if we
don't deliver on that promise, we're going to see support wane''
for continued experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   The realm of clinical research is complex and loosely defined.
Some clinical trials test new drugs or theories. Others examine
current drugs for new uses, or current drugs at new doses. Others
give medical devices, like pacemakers, a series of test runs.
</P>
<P>
   A trial may take five years or more, requiring cooperation among
doctors at several locations. Often, small armies of nurses and
others conduct the tests and compile the encyclopedic reports
required to verify results.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of doctors and other health professionals oversee clinical
trials -- 50,000 or more, according to expert estimates. They might
work for the federal government, universities, drug companies or
other health groups.
</P>
<P>
   But many don't stick with it because of modern health care
pressures to see patients and earn more for their practices or
hospitals. Others lack the extensive training the field requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been, `Follow me around, see what I do, and you can be a
clinical researcher,''' said Dr. David Korn, a senior vice
president at the Association of American Medical Colleges. ``It's
been a very loose apprenticeship. An awful lot of clinical
researchers don't know how to do clinical research.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of doctors who view research as their primary
activity dropped 6 percent between 1980 and 1997, according to a
study by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental
Biology (FASEB), a Bethesda, Md., professional group that
represents biomedical scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is acute among doctors 45 or younger. Nominations
to honorary societies such as the American Society of Clinical
Investigation have dipped 30 percent in the past decade, the study
found.
</P>
<P>
   It has proven difficult, analysts said, to measure the shortage
of researchers needed to study the growing wellspring of medical
ideas. But anecdotal evidence suggests some tests have been
delayed, done improperly or put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got one call the other day for (a study on) ulcerative
colitis, which is a disease that affects the gastrointestinal
system,'' said Dr. Adrian Dobs, director of clinical trials at
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. ``And I told the drug
company, `I don't have a doctor.' And I feel bad, because that's a
study that needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   This all resonates deeply with patients like Patricia Delaney,
57, of Washington, D.C. Delaney was diagnosed with Hodgkin's
disease, a form of cancer, in 1987. She enrolled in a clinical
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients received an experimental mix of drugs. Delaney,
part of the control group, received a different set of medicines
that already had proven promising against Hodgkin's.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers entering the study, being randomly assigned to the
control group, then having a severe allergic reaction to one of the
drugs in her treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But she remained enrolled in the test. Today, she understands
that the concoction of drugs that saved her life would not have
existed had it not been for earlier clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Had she been diagnosed in 1970, Delaney said, ``I would have
been dead. I think I would have been dead in 1980.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Clinical research occupies a narrow sliver of the medical
endeavor. Defined broadly, it involves transferring the findings of
basic science into practical understanding and applications for
human health.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a basic scientist, for example, who would pinpoint
the gene that causes a specific mutation in yeast. It would be a
clinical researcher, however, who would discover that the same gene
mutation makes people vulnerable to colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Many regard the specialty as a calling.
</P>
<P>
   Top clinical research requires extensive training -- six or
seven years for dual medical and doctoral degrees, five years for
postgraduate work, then two more years for a research fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   That educational marathon might be twice the length of the
training required of the family doctor who goes to medical school
and spends three years on postgraduate work. Moreover, researchers
typically earn less than peers who perform surgery or fill their
appointment books with patient exams. That reality has become
increasingly important in an era when medical school debts
typically top $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the night I chose to be a researcher,'' said Dr.
Daniel W. Foster, chairman of internal medicine at University of
Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. ``I told my wife, `I
want to go into academic medicine. We're always going to be poor,
but that's what I want to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, important changes have reshaped clinical
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   New challenges confront researchers at university hospitals.
Those doctors, often relied on to explore ideas at the earliest
stages, are feeling fiscal pressures as managed care pushes them to
concentrate more on seeing patients and less on doing research.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, revolutionary discoveries in genetics,
cloning, tissue engineering and other areas have prompted drug
companies and other private concerns to establish clinical research
labs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, academic medical centers were responsible for 75
percent of clinical research projects paid for by industry, said
Kenneth Getz, president of CenterWatch, a publisher that tracks the
clinical trials industry. Today it's down to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Academic centers have lost much of the research enterprise
because they were too bureaucratic, unreliable and expensive given
their high overhead, Getz said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   All clinical trials, whether executed by public researchers or
private companies, must follow the same four-phase approval process
for the safety, effectiveness and side effects of a new drug or
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the private companies, Getz said, that are most often
hired to conduct a test's final phases. Getz said about 10,000
research centers are now competing to do about $3.5 billion worth
of clinical trials each year. The National Institutes of Health
(NIH), which relies on academic institutions to conduct its tests,
spends about $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a race against the clock,'' Getz said. ``There might
be competitors. There might be public pressure. Companies start
shifting a lot of research over to the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who pays for the clinical trials, momentum is
increasing for reform in patient participation, safety and training
for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   A recently established Web site, www.ClinicalTrials.gov,
recruits for upcoming tests. It currently lists about 4,000 ongoing
trials, most sponsored by the NIH. One test, for example, is
exploring if the drug tamoxifen blocks the ``uptake'' of estrogen
and fights breast cancer. Another tests DNA samples for genetic
links in pancreatic disorders. A third studies whether acupuncture
eases carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Participation rates for clinical studies are low, analysts
agree. Too few patients get referred by doctors. Many patients fear
they will get a placebo -- a do-nothing pill used to compare
against new treatments -- even though that happens only in special
cases.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage enrollment, President Clinton recently ordered
Medicare to begin covering ``routine costs'' of clinical trials,
such as lab tests and doctors' office visits. Specifics are under
review, but the change would help more older people participate in
clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Gelsinger, an 18-year-old Arizonan who died in January in
a gene therapy test in Philadelphia, represents a rare case of a
patient killed in a clinical trial. But federal investigators have
warned about safety problems in general.
</P>
<P>
   June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the federal Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS), was particularly critical of the
system that assigns test oversight to 3,000 to 5,000 institutional
review boards.
</P>
<P>
   The boards, composed of scientists and lay people, are
overwhelmed by their work and often make decisions about tests in a
``rushed atmosphere,'' Brown said in a June 1998 report.
</P>
<P>
   Another report authored by Brown this year concluded that HHS
had made only ``minimal progress'' in protecting patients. In May,
the department issued a new set of safeguards aimed at reinforcing
testing standards.
</P>
<P>
   The new Office for Human Research Protection was established in
June, as HHS vowed to increase training of doctors and review board
members. HHS also will push for fines against researchers who don't
properly inform patients of risks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, HHS will require enhanced monitoring of clinical
trials. New conflict of interest rules are expected to more fully
inform patients when doctors have invested in a company that may
benefit from research results.
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Other groups are focusing on replenishing the ranks of qualified
clinical researchers.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to reduce the debt of young researchers is being
advocated by FASEB, the biomedical scientists group. The NIH now
spends more than $25 million annually on programs to recruit and
retain clinical researchers, plus underwrite university courses in
research ethics and biostatistics.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond these efforts, some say, is a need for a more focused
national agenda for clinical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask 200 researchers and 200 members of the public, I
think you'd get 400 priorities about what's important,'' said
Elaine Larson, a pharmaceutical and therapeutic research professor
at Columbia University. LF END SEEMAN

   Shopping on the Internet. People talk about it, but are they
really doing it? Or are these shoppers like Internet millionaires _
people we've heard about but don't really know.
</P>
<P>
   We recently asked groups of 10- and 20-somethings if _ and where
_ they were shopping. Most tend to browse rather than buy, others
browse and then head to the old brick-and-mortar for the deal, but
a few revealed some of their favorite sites for shopping. And while
we can't guarantee the sites will last forever (little does on the
Web), here's a good start if you're up at 2 a.m. and desperate to
spend.
</P>
<P>
   REFLECT.COM
</P>
<P>
   One of the things our respondents claim to like the most about
the Internet is its ability to allow them to customize products to
feel more special. Reflect.com lets surfers select ingredients to
make shampoos, cleansers and other body products. On top of that,
they can name the product after themselves _ or someone else.
That's one way to make sure that your medicine chest is unique!
</P>
<P>
   PURPLESKIRT.COM
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has watched Tracey Ullman's comedy routines might
question her fashion sense. But clearly she was acting. This
somewhat limited site offers some of the coolest fashion trends at
reasonable prices. The picks tend to be on the cutting edge,
offering even the funniest fashionista a chance to upgrade her
look.
</P>
<P>
   THEHOMEBISTRO.COM
</P>
<P>
   We've been hearing a great deal about the trend toward cooking
at home. Xers who grew up on microwave feasts and fast food are
returning to the kitchen in droves. The one catch _ they don't know
how to cook! And while some are content to learn as they go, others
are looking for short cuts. Enter Thehomebistro.com. This site
offers pre-prepared meals, with ingredients, cut, measured and
bagged so that the recipient has only to follow some simple
directions and whip up a masterpiece. Thehomebistro.com also allows
you to select the number of portions, avoiding that ever-present
fear of running out, or (even worse), having leftovers that last a
week.
</P>
<P>
   CNET.COM
</P>
<P>
   According to our respondents, the Web can be just that _ a maze
of choices that snag and snare. When it comes to electronics at
least, Cnet.com untangles the mess. This site provides its own _
and customers' _ ratings on electronics, comparing at least 10
stores on price, availability and shipping. While it won't
guarantee that you'll know how to use what you purchase, at least
you'll feel like a smart shopper.
</P>
<P>
   NETAPORTER.COM
</P>
<P>
   Did we say shop? We meant lust. This site is one of the most
fashion-forward sites around, with high-end brands like Jimmy Choo,
Vanessa Bruno and Anya Hindmarch. In addition, netaporter.com,
which is headquartered in London, assembles some of the hottest
European brands. What makes this site so appealing is its magazine
approach. Photos feature put-together outfits that entice the
viewer to click further. Be warned, though, prices are in British
pounds, so you might want to visit oanda.com first to exchange
currency.
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINESCLOSET.COM
</P>
<P>
   For our respondents who love the look of vintage clothing but
hate sorting through the remnant bins, this site offers some of the
coolest classics around. From Pucci to Pulitzer, Sergio Valente to
sneakers from the 1970s, this site has all the stuff you wish you
hadn't let your mother throw out. Each piece is rated, reasonably
priced and ready to take you back.
</P>
<P>
   ALLOY.COM
</P>
<P>
   What started as a teen catalog has morphed into a teen community
center. But what smart shoppers have discovered is the site's
auction area where everything from beanie babies to action figures
to hard-to-get Pokemon cards can be found. Alloy.com feels like a
less intimidating E-bay, where you won't get carried away with the
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   LUXURYFINDER.COM
</P>
<P>
   This site should be used only in emergencies _ like when you
forgot your dad's 60th or your partner's passing the bar. This
amalgamation of high-end products assembles the best of the best.
From Porthault sheets to more moderately priced Frederic Fekkai
hair-care products, you'll know you're buying the top of the line.
And for those pesky times when you find yourself in immediate need
of your own personal jet, look no further.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPASSURED.COM
</P>
<P>
   Before you shop anywhere, check out this site that warns you
when you've entered a site with a bad reputation. It's a free
plug-in; it won't have info on every site, but since the Web will

WINDOWS MILLENNIUM: AN UPGRADE WHOSE TIME MAY NOT HAVE COME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first thing one needs to know about upgrading to the new
Windows Millennium Edition operating system _ besides that PC
makers plan to offer it on new home computers this summer and that
Microsoft will make it available as an upgrade for older computers
in September _ is that the ``uninstall'' routine is inside the
Commands folder, which is tucked inside the Windows folder.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the first thing one needs to know is that Windows Me
is an interesting but hardly crucial upgrade for Windows 98, with a
bunch of clever new features intended to make home computers easier
and more fun to use. And if Windows Me is factory-installed on a
new computer, it will almost certainly make the computer faster to
boot up, more reliable, easier to connect to other computers and to
the Internet, and much more entertaining and versatile in the areas
of music and video.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Me was sent to PC manufacturers two weeks ago and will
start showing up factory-installed on new home PCs any day now. The
do-it-yourself upgrade package will go on sale in computer stores
on Sept. 14 with a suggested price of $109 and a probable street
price of $90.
</P>
<P>
   But based on my recent experience with five Windows computers,
two Windows Me upgrade discs supplied by Microsoft and a hot line
connection to a friendly Microsoft technical support specialist
named Don, I think I'll skip this upgrade and wait to take
advantage of the new operating system the next time I buy a new PC.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Windows Me is a great reminder that an operating
system upgrade is not to be undertaken casually, especially if
there are other ways to improve a computer's performance without
tampering with its most fundamental code. An operating system has
powerful juju and running afoul of it calls down the wrath of the
computer spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft describes Windows Me as ``an initial step towards
delivering on Microsoft's vision for home users.'' Unlike the new
Windows 2000 operating system, which was built atop a foundation of
industrial-strength code written for business and corporate
computers, Windows Millennium Edition is a direct descendant of
Windows 95 and 98. It is a remodeling project, in other words.
Microsoft is already hard at work creating the next step in its
consumer operating system strategy (Windows Me Two?) but for now
Windows Me is Microsoft's best operating system for home PCs.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a scary thought.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five computers I tried to upgrade, only one accepted the
new software without a fight. On that machine, Windows Me performed
flawlessly and revealed its many good features, which fall into
four main categories.
</P>
<P>
   The first is digital media and entertainment, including a snazzy
new Windows Media Player and a digital movie-making feature that is
similar to the one Apple has had on its iMacs for the past year.
Windows Me makes it easier to work with digital picture and music
files. It also comes with more games, including online games that
allow the user to compete against others over the Internet and
insult one another verbally with a feature called DirectPlay Voice.
</P>
<P>
   I especially like the built-in support for copying audio CDs to
the hard drive, and for transferring those digital music files to a
portable MP3 player like the Diamond Rio.
</P>
<P>
   The second category is home networking. The number of homes with
two or more computers is growing rapidly, but getting the computers
to share files, printers and Internet connections has not been
easy. Windows Me has new software wizards that help the user set up
home networks. It adds support for high-speed IEEE 1394 (Firewire)
peripheral connections, and it improves the support for instant
messaging and streaming audio and video.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft calls the third category the ``online experience,''
and it includes everything from a new version of Internet Explorer
(IE 5.5) to new network plumbing borrowed from Windows 2000.
Windows Me does a better job of supporting cable and DSL Internet
connections, and it has better support for online chat sessions and
conferencing.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth and most important category is called ``PC Health,''
ironically, as it turned out, given the woes I had trying to
install Windows Me.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Me has been fortified with features intended to make it
more stable and reliable, to automatically fix its own technical
problems, to shield the consumer from accidentally overwriting
esoteric system files, to simplify Microsoft's notoriously cryptic
error messages, and to restore the computer to a state of health if
something does go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One new feature is System File Protection, which keeps newly
installed applications from either accidentally or deliberately
messing around with system files, including the treacherous little
rascals known as DLLs, or dynamic link libraries. Conversely,
another new feature, System Restore, allows the user to beat a
retreat in case something does go awry during the installation of
new software or hardware. As the name suggests, System Restore lets
the user roll back the clock to a point before the problems
started.
</P>
<P>
   The Help system has been completely redesigned and expanded to
include both online and disk-based support and troubleshooting.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, did I need help.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first disastrous attempt to load Windows Me on my IBM
Thinkpad 240 reinforced Computing Rule No. 1: Never attempt an
operating system upgrade without first making a backup of important
files.
</P>
<P>
   It also underscored the importance of clicking ``yes'' when the
installation routine asks if the user wants to squirrel away a copy
of the computer's existing Windows configuration, just in case, and
``yes'' again to make an emergency boot diskette, just in case the
new operating system causes the computer to have a grand mal
seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Even after what the computer wizards call a clean install, which
involves bypassing the earlier version of Windows on the machine,
and after laboriously shutting down every program or software
routine that might conflict with the installation of a new
operating system, Windows Me still fought with some unknown
software antagonist on my laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Despite claims that Windows Me has simplified the error
messages, it still spit out such gems as ``Rundll32 has caused an
error in unknown. Rundll32 will now close,'' and ``MSMSGSIN has
caused an error in unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way to regain use of the computer was to uninstall
Windows Me.
</P>
<P>
   New error messages popped up when I tried to install Windows Me
on a Dell desktop computer. After two more installation attempts,
and two more uninstalls, the new software took residence but
reported ``script errors'' that blanked every file menu and
directory screen.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to get Windows Me installed on a third computer, also a
Dell, succeeded only after I erased most of my favorite
applications from the hard disk. From then on, Windows Me worked
like a champ.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth computer choked when Windows Me tried to commandeer
nearly 500 megabytes of disk space. Microsoft says the minimum
requirement is 320 megabytes of free space, but a clean install can
chew up half a gigabyte.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth computer, a nearly virginal laptop computer, absorbed
Windows Me without a hitch on the first try. This suggests strongly
that the problems on other machines arose from conflicts between
Windows Me and one or more other programs, even though all
applications were shut down during installation.
</P>
<P>
   On the machines where it took root, Windows Me was a welcome
improvement over Windows 98 Second Edition. But unless you have an
urgent need for the new features, it is probably a good idea to
wait until you need to replace your computer, or at least until
Microsoft finds and fixes potential software conflicts.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>

 (PLEASE NOTE: To publish Bernard Gladstone's ``Home Improvement
Questions and Answers'' it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndication Sales. For purchase
information call toll-free 1-888-269-8796.) 
 (The NYTSS sales representative also has information on how to
subscribe to Gladstone's ``Home Improvement Questions and Answers''
weekly column which moves on Wednesdays.) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: We are remodeling our kitchen and planning to install an
island counter in the center.
 &HT;    I want to have a stove or cooktop in this island, but my husband
says this would be impractical because of the need for an overhead
vent for this stove.
 &HT;    I agree that an overhead vent coming down from the ceiling would
not be attractive, but have heard that it is possible to install a
``downdraft'' ventilator that would go down through the floor and
then out through an exterior wall, instead of going up through the
ceiling.
 &HT;    Is this possible?
 &HT;    A: Downdraft vents for a stove or cooktop in an island counter
are not unusual, but must be properly designed and installed.
 &HT;    The usual method is to install a motor/blower in an enclosed
chamber under the stove, then run a duct down through the floor
from this chamber. The duct then continues horizontally through the
nearest exterior wall to the outside.
 &HT;    The duct lengths should be kept as short as possible and there
should be no more elbows or bends than absolutely necessary.
 &HT;    Use rounded or curved sections to avoid sharp right-angled
bends. Stainless steel ducting would be best.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I have heavy doors with glass panels and when it comes to
painting them I prefer to take them off entirely. However, because
they are heavy I often have difficulties.
 &HT;    After taking out the top and middle hinge pins (the doors have
three hinges) the door starts to sag and almost falls off before I
get a chance to remove the bottom or third hinge pin.
 &HT;    Sometimes the weight of the door causes one or two of the hinge
screws to pull out of the wood and then it becomes awkward to
remove the last hinge pin.
 &HT;    Is there anything you can suggest I do to remove such hinged
doors easily when working alone?
 &HT;    A: Swing the door open at right angles before you start to take
out any hinge pins.
 &HT;    Then wedge a book, magazine or stack of newspaper under the
outer edge of the opened door. This will keep the door from
swinging in or out while you are working, and will support the
weight of the door to keep it from sagging as you pull out the
hinge pins.
 &HT;    After all the hinge pins have been removed you will be able to
easily lift the door off without damaging the hinges or wood.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I am refinishing some varnished cabinets, but find that even
though I am using a top quality bristle brush I still cannot get a
really smooth finish.
 &HT;    The varnish seems to dry with a slightly ``pebbly'' surface that
is not as smooth and glossy as it should be.
 &HT;    What am I doing wrong?
 &HT;    A: One possibility is that you have been stirring the varnish
immediately before and during use. This creates tiny air bubbles
that are almost impossible to brush out.
 &HT;    Such air bubbles can also be created by wiping the brush across
the rim of the can to remove excess after you dip it into the
varnish. Air bubbles are created in the varnish that runs back into
the can.
 &HT;    To remove excess varnish after dipping you should tap the
bristles lightly against the side of the can (above the level of
the varnish).
 &HT;    Excessive back-and-forth brushing is another frequent cause of
tiny bubbles in the finish.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I installed a light colored ceramic tile in my bathroom but
colored the grout in the joints a dark brown by adding lots of
pigment to the original grout.
 &HT;    Now the dark color has begun to fade, creating an unattractive
mottled appearance.
 &HT;    Any idea what caused this and what I can do to restore the
original color?
 &HT;    A: It sounds as though too much pigment was added to the grout
to darken it.
 &HT;    This pigment is now starting to fade and discolor, possibly from
exposure or from frequent washing.
 &HT;    There is no way I know of to restore the color without scraping
out much of the existing grout and then replacing it with new
material.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NOTE: Drawing captioned ``VENTING AN ISLAND STOVE IN KITCHEN''
goes with this column.
 &HT;    CAPTION: A downdraft vent that goes through the floor and then
horizontally out through an exterior wall will vent a stove located
on an island counter.

THIEF II STRESSES STEALTH OVER STRENGTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By CHARLES HEROLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've just entered the study when I hear a guard moving in the
hall outside, whistling tunelessly. Quickly I douse the torch on
the wall with one of my water arrows and wait in the dark. The
guard passes by, oblivious; I see that he's carrying a key.
Planning to pick his pocket, I quickly exit the study, but I've
forgotten that between the room and hall carpets there is a brief
stretch of wooden floor, and the sound of my boots startles the
guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who goes there?'' he shouts as I quickly duck back into the
study. He enters the room. I press up against the wall and hold my
breath. He looks around carefully, but my black cloak blends into
the deep shadows. He comes closer and closer, seeming to stare
right at me.
</P>
<P>
   In any other game, I would pull out my broadsword or laser gun,
and the guard would be history. But in Thief II: The Metal Age, a
self-described ``first-person sneaker'' from Looking Glass Studio,
brute strength takes a back seat to cunning stealth. So I just keep
quiet and hope that he doesn't realize I'm here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must have been rats,'' the guard mutters and turns away. I run
up and knock him out with my blackjack, and I drag his body deeper
into the study to hide him from the other guards. After I grab the
key, I slip out into the hall.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds less exciting than all-out carnage, it isn't. A
refreshing alternative to games that glorify violence, Thief II
instead glorifies thievery. You play Garrett, a master thief who
steals from the wealthy and powerful for a living and saves the
world as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Garret lives in a world that is part Ivanhoe, part 19th-century
mechanics and part Information Age robotics. An ancient stone
castle can be guarded by clanking mechanical beasts that are
powered by an internal furnace.
</P>
<P>
   In the typical 3-D action game, which Thief II resembles at
first glance, a favored technique is to run into a room with
supercharged weapons and rain down destruction on your enemies. But
in Thief II your weapons are primitive and awkward, and if three
guards gang up on you, you are dead, pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting is the surest way to lose the game. Not that Garrett is
a pacifist (he can fire off arrows from a safe distance), but it is
a lot safer to hide in the shadows or run away. At a higher level
of difficulty, you are often required to show even more restraint,
completing your mission without leaving any trace of your presence.
That means leaving everyone else alive and conscious.
</P>
<P>
   The story is slight. Garrett is recruited to help destroy the
Mechanists, a cult that worships machines and is turning the poor
and disenfranchised into living robots. The overthrow of this cult
entails traveling over rooftops and through people's apartments,
following Mechanist messengers and reading their communiques. In
one of my favorite missions, you follow a dying man by the
bloodstains he leaves behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else you have to do _ frame a corrupt official, find
secret documents, kidnap an important Mechanist _ you must never
forget to steal things. Snatch those golden candlesticks, slip the
purse off that woman's belt, pick up a stack of coins from a
gambling table. This is your job, and you are very good at it. And
after all, saving the world doesn't put food on the table.
</P>
<P>
   While most game engines supply rather dimwitted antagonists, the
denizens of Thief II give a remarkable impersonation of real
intelligence. Guards don't just try to kill you _ they get other
guards to help. ``Come quickly, an intruder!'' one will shout, and
any guard in earshot will come running, sword drawn. If you come
across a noncombatant, that character will whimper, ``Please don't
hurt me,'' then start screaming, ``Come quickly _ a thief is
here!''
</P>
<P>
   Guards will search for you if they hear your step on a marble
floor or find an unconscious body. They peer into every shadow and
shout, ``Only a coward hides!'' If they find you, you must escape
or fight. If you give a guard a couple of good thrusts with your
sword, he will run away and call for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways, Thief II shows its game engine's limitations.
Except for highly scripted conversations, the people in the game
never acknowledge one another. When a guard passes another guard he
never says, ``How are the kids?'' And while these guards are far
smarter than typical game enemies, they still cannot form a posse
and methodically hunt you down. They all try to kill you, but they
don't really cooperate with one another. (If the guards were that
smart, you'd never make it out alive.)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fun of Thief II comes from playing fly on the wall.
Poking around an office, you might find an exchange of mail from
two clerks plotting against their boss, or you might overhear
guards debating religion. You can hear people muttering about their
personal travails as they pass by. You will even see the occasional
ghost reliving the moment of death.
</P>
<P>
   The world in Thief II is amazingly alive, almost making you feel
that the people you are robbing are real characters with lives of
their own. They seem so real that leaving them alive may feel like
not only the best strategy but also the best moral choice. As that
guard crumples to the ground and whimpers, ``Help me,'' you might
just feel a little guilty. Poor guy, he was only doing his job.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Putting up wallpaper a project you can tackle
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putting up wallpaper is not the easiest home improvement project
you can take on, but it's not the hardest either.
</P>
<P>
   And wallpapering is a project that gives you a lot of bang for
the buck; wallpaper dramatically alters the look of a room by
taking flat vertical walls, the blandest elements in most rooms,
and turning them into focal points of color and design.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in adding wallpaper to a room, check with a
home improvement store; many conduct periodic wallpaper seminars.
There are also plenty of brochures and pamphlets on the subject in
paint and home improvement stores and books at any public library.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few tips to help you get the hang of hanging
wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Concentrate on preparation. Pros agree that you work twice as
hard getting the wall ready than in putting up the paper.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Try a flat wall with few obstructions first. A big mistake
many amateurs make is starting with a bathroom because it's a small
room. Bathrooms and kitchens usually are harder than bedrooms
because of the cabinetry and plumbing you'll have to work around.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Enlist help. The work is greatly simplified if you've got one
person to hold while the other cuts and so on.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Follow instructions. The paper you buy will come with
instructions on how it should be applied. Read them twice before
wetting, cutting or doing anything else. Then do as you're
instructed, working slowly and carefully through the whole job.
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding on a room to wallpaper, take a look around for
potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Among the things that make a papering job more complex and time
consuming are recessed windows and doors, curved archways, plumbing
fixtures, high ceilings, overhangs, ``outside'' corners (junctions
that look like a corner on the outside of a box rather than a
corner on the inside of the box) and cramped spaces where two
people can't work together easily.
</P>
<P>
   Wallpapers with stripes, plaids and other patterns that have to
be matched also are harder to hang than solids or abstract
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Typical wallpapers are vinyl or vinyl-coated and come prepasted.
To apply it, you wet the paper, allow it to cure for a few minutes,
position it on the wall in a way to keep the pattern continuous and
trim away the excess.
</P>
<P>
   Vinyl papers are generally fairly easy to hang, and they're
washable. Some even come with a Teflon coating that allows crayon
marks and grease to be wiped away.
</P>
<P>
   Some finishes are nongloss, while some are shiny silk looks.
Remember that a shiny surface will show imperfections in the wall
underneath, while an abstract pattern may disguise minor blemishes.
</P>
<P>
   Because wallpaper is expensive, you might be tempted to buy just
enough. It's better to err a bit on the side of excess and have a
little extra paper to make up for mistakes and to use as patches
later.
</P>
<P>
   Consult an expert or a book on measuring your rooms and take all
your measurements at least twice. The measurements and a simple
drawing of the room will allow a sales clerk to help you estimate
how much paper you need.
</P>
<P>
   Try to avoid going back for more paper. But if you do have to go
back, buy paper with the same ``dye lot'' number or you'll end up
with mismatched walls.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using a wallpaper with a large pattern that must be
matched between sheets, expect a lot more waste and buy
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   HANGING PAPER:
</P>
<P>
   You'll need a set of wallpaper tools.
</P>
<P>
   You need a water tray, used for wetting the paper to activate
the glue, a brush or plastic smoother to work air pockets and
wrinkles out of the paper once it's on the wall, a metal straight
edge to provide a guide for straight cuts and a wallpaper cutter
with a supply of breakaway blades
</P>
<P>
   Also get a retractable metal tape measure, a weighted line to
act as a plumb and a seam roller.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting, remove as many obstacles from the wall as
possible: Switch plates, medicine cabinets, towel bars, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth walls are crucial: Irregularities like nail holes will
show through the new wall covering and ruin its appearance. If
you're not proficient with joint compound, patching materials and
so on, consult a book or expert.
</P>
<P>
   Over typical walls, apply a premixed acrylic wall primer (also
called wall prep). Wall primer keeps the porous drywall and any
fresh repairs you've made from absorbing so much adhesive that the
paper doesn't stay up.
</P>
<P>
   If your room doesn't have a natural floor-to-ceiling break, such
as a fireplace, you'll have to create a joint where the last piece
of wallpaper meets the first. Plan your layout to keep that joint
as inconspicuous as possible.
</P>
<P>
   After soaking wallpaper in water to activate the adhesive,
gently fold the sheets without creasing them and set them aside a
while. This allows time for the paper to absorb the paste.
</P>
<P>
   When cutting the paper, position your straight edge and cut
along it. When you reach the end of the straight edge, leave the
cutter in place and lift and reposition the straight edge before
continuing the cut. Lifting the cutter in the middle of a cut may
create a jagged edge.
</P>
<P>
   Change your cutter blades often. If your knife is at all dull,
it will tear or skin your wallpaper. Blades are cheap; wallpaper is
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Paste always oozes from seams and edges. Once the piece has been
hung, use a soft, clean rag or good-quality soft sponge to remove
paste from the face of the paper and from moldings and such.
</P>
<P>
   Don't try to wrap a sheet of wallpaper around a corner. Corners
are rarely plumb, and they'll throw the wallpaper out of level.
</P>
<P>
   If your paper has a bubble, slit a small opening with a cutter.
Insert some adhesive sparingly through the slit and press the paper
down. If seams curl, squirt adhesive under the edge and smooth the
paper down gently with your fingertips. Let glue set up for 30
minutes, then use a seam roller to press it in place.
</P>
<P>
   Some solid-colored wallpapers will be lighter on the right than
on the left, or vice versa. To hide the shading, run one sheet from
top to bottom and the next sheet from bottom to top.
</P>
<P>
   Seams are butted together, not overlapped. Use vinyl-to-vinyl
adhesive to hang a border over wallpaper.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some relationships sag during a move, and when a
drawn-out renovation is added, some collapse altogether from the
strain. But Laura Bohn and Richard Fiore never seem happier than
when they are abandoning one renovated apartment to overhaul the
next. The husband-and-wife team have lived through seven
renovations, starting with the apartment Bohn was living in when
Fiore met her 21 years ago. (``She told me that if she was going to
allow me to stay there, I had to rebuild it for her,'' Fiore said
recently, still amused.) Three years ago, they took on their
riskiest project. They bought a bank.
</P>
<P>
   The gamble was a true test of personal and professional ties.
Only the stout of heart would spend $2 million on a 1907 Beaux-Arts
bank, with landmark status and an address at Eighth Avenue and 14th
Street, and then invest nearly $10 million more of their own money
to convert it to condos, with a penthouse for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Bohn had noticed the bank while walking home from her
office in the West Village, admiring its bays of arched windows,
marble facade, imposing portico with columns and spread-winged
eagle perched on the pediment. The building is typical of banks
built across the nation from the 1870s to the 1920s: small-scale
temples meant to represent the strength and durability of the
banking system. Until shortly before its sale to Fiore and Bohn, it
was a branch of Manufacturers Hanover Trust, an admirable, if
smallish, example of Beaux-Arts clarity and function.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, as banks merged and drop-in ATMs usurped the role
of the sober and imposing neighborhood bank, some of these gems
came onto the market, most fated to become commercial space, a
Banana Republic here and a Duane Reade there. The 19th-century
neo-Classical New York Savings Bank across 14th Street, a far more
ornate edition of the genre with its domed copper roof and pillared
hall, had been turned into an Oriental rug store in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, Bohn said, ``no one was buying these types of
buildings'' because ``developers said forget it _ they're too much
work.'' So the City Landmarks Commission was delighted with Fiore
and Bohn's proposal for condos.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it appears the gamble might just work. Six of 11 new
condos, ranging from $588,000 to $2 million for a rooftop triplex,
have buyers, and the others await those brave enough to take on raw
soaring space. Three weeks ago Bohn and Fiore moved into their new
3,500-square-foot duplex. ``It was horrendous, the whole thing,''
Bohn said deadpan. Her husband finished her thought: ``We loved
every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   An interior designer who prefers big architectural gestures over
fussy decorations, Bohn, 60, recommends big furniture and unadorned
walls of windows wherever possible. Raised in Texas, she still
speaks with the ghost of a twang and strides like someone who knows
her way around the back country barefoot. Her steely-haired
Brooklyn-bred husband, 61, is a contractor and the president and
owner of Bohn Fiore Inc., a construction management company that
recently completed a new space for the Phillips auction gallery at
the American Craft Museum. He is also among his wife's biggest
professional admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workmen don't understand how dramatic her work is while
they're doing it,'' he said, sliding into contractor-speak. ``Her
basic curtain wall construction is to die for.''
</P>
<P>
   On a tour of the building, Bohn threaded her way past
construction detritus and five floors of vast unfinished
concrete-scapes. Down a dimly lighted hall, the one dustfree door
opened with Kansas-to-Oz impact onto their sun-swept, green-washed,
glass-walled penthouse, which has a 1,000-square-foot wraparound
terrace with an ornate stone wall on the 14th Street side.
</P>
<P>
   Bohn and Fiore hired John Reimnitz, an architect with whom they
often collaborate, to do the design work; Fiore took charge of
construction. The arched windows looking onto 14th Street provided
some emphatic architecture, and the 11 condominiums are laid out to
take advantage of them. Aside from the facades on Eighth Avenue and
14th Street, which the Landmarks Preservation Commission wanted
painted to match the original, there was little to be preserved. A
roof addition was permissible, if it was mainly hidden from sight
from the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   To get some height without becoming obtrusive, Fiore and
Reimnitz lowered the bank's roof by about 6 feet. This allowed
construction of a 27-foot-high duplex whose first floor is largely
camouflaged by the carved stone balustrade. A new, appropriately
traditional, pitched roof of standing seam metal is a response,
Reimnitz said, to the more flamboyant dome on the bank across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   For Bohn, the pitched metal roof recalls the rural architecture
of the town where she grew up. She says it makes the duplex a real
house _ her first in Manhattan after many years of designing houses
outside the city for other people.
</P>
<P>
   The duplex actually looks more like a greenhouse, with walls
almost entirely of glass framed in metal. Windows and doors blend
and look out onto the terrace. There is a small grove of potted
trees with hydrangeas and hostas. One of the best things, Bohn
said, is that ``you can actually see the rain falling on the the
leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   On the north side, the balustrade is a buffer against wind and
grime, with the stone suggesting the outlines of a castle keep.
</P>
<P>
   If the bank facade provides solidity, Bohn has added plenty of
effervescence. Of the 20 or so shades she chose for the interior,
most are subtle variations of green and one is milky blue, creating
the impression of a perpetual dawn on a summer day. ``I love all
shades of green, especially chartreuse,'' Bohn said, sipping water
from a chartreuse glass. ``It's nature, and it's very calming.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she normally chooses pale tints for walls. But here,
she needed the boldest shades to counteract the blasting sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   She had no intention of blocking the light with shades, even if
that meant a loss of privacy. ``So they can see us watching TV _ so
what?'' she said. In any case it's not a ``Rear Window'' situation;
the only tall building nearby contains offices that close down at
night. For now, at least, most of the West Village skyline is wide
open.
</P>
<P>
   Bohn did concede that a glass penthouse isn't very
energy-efficient. She should know: her father was an
air-conditioning engineer. ``He'd faint if he saw this,'' she said,
noting the absence of overhangs and thick walls.
</P>
<P>
   Bohn wanted terrazzo tiles on the first floor because they stay
cool and hide dirt. An uneven concrete base made tiles impractical,
so she had a slurry of pebbles and concrete mixed and installed
on-site.The poured terrazzo allowed her to custom-blend the colors,
moving from a dark shade in the living room (more black pebbles) to
something lighter in the kitchen (more tan). ``They can be filthy
and you'd never know it,'' she said, shooting an indulgent look at
the couple's two energetic dogs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bohn is known for the studied informality of her interiors,
which depend on simple, large pieces like the 10-foot sofa she
designed for the duplex and a few old favorites like the gray
lacquered coffee table that has followed the couple from apartment
to apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intention of adding any pretensions,'' she said of
her new home, whose living room ceiling soars to 18 feet. ``The
space is already pretentious enough as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she tried to soften it with rural touches. They include
louvered doors, a straw-embedded plaster wall and screen doors that
turn up on kitchen cupboards, air-conditioner vents and the
laundry-and-dog room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Eula turned me on to them,'' she said, referring to the
colorful New York fashion artist. ``He had a copper screen door in
his bedroom that just blew my mind. It was so out of context, so
airy, so different.''
</P>
<P>
   To get to the monumental living room, one passes through an
entrance and a dining area of average height. A wall that doesn't
quite reach the ceiling partly blocks the view to the living room,
making its enormous size that much more a surprise. It's a trick
that works every time. The wall has a fireplace with a steel-plate
surround and hearth that Bohn hopes will rust to Georgia-clay red.
The guest bedroom is next to the living room, and with
floor-to-ceiling glass walls, it has some of the best views.
</P>
<P>
   The second floor is more a mezzanine overlooking the living room
and the terrace. It accommodates the master bedroom, a bathroom and
a small study.
</P>
<P>
   Bohn worried that the 18-by-22-foot living room was simply too
big to be comfortable. ``It's about three times grander than any
other home we've ever had,'' she said. Before they even moved in,
she tried to think of ways to tone down the space.
</P>
<P>
   Her first thought was to suspend an antique turquoise kayak from
the ceiling. But then she realized her urban aerie hardly called
for a fake country touch. After all, it is a bank building.

<P>
   Q. I have a Pentium PC with about one megabyte of available
space on my hard drive. I would like to increase the speed of my
computer and equip it to handle more programs and wondered what was
meant by acquiring ``more bandwidth.'' Exactly what does this mean,
how do I get it and how much faster will my PC run with it?
</P>
<P>
   A. The term bandwidth is most often used these days to refer to
the transmission speed of computer data, and it most commonly
refers to the speed of an Internet connection. High bandwidth
(e.g., a DSL connection or cable modem) is faster than low
bandwidth (e.g., a dial-up modem).
</P>
<P>
   The word bandwidth is sometimes tossed around to mean speed in
general, but the problem you are having with your PC's poor
performance probably has more to do to do with the computer itself.
A computer needs a certain amount of available hard-drive space to
run efficiently, and having only 1 megabyte left can be a problem
because the system does not have a lot of room to work with. You
should try to keep at least 10 percent of your hard drive's space
free at all times.
</P>
<P>
   After you have deleted as many old files as possible, you may
want to defragment your drive to clean up your hard disk. To use
the software that comes with Windows to do this, go to the Start
menu and choose Programs, then go to Accessories, System Tools and
Disk Defragmenter. Defragging your hard disk helps your computer
store the files it has more efficiently. You can also find
third-party utility programs that offer their own defragmentation
programs along with other disk-care software.
</P>
<P>
   If you find that you cannot delete enough files, you may want to
think about adding another hard drive to your system. Adding more
RAM can also increase your system's performance.
</P>

GUSTAW HERLING, 81, POLISH AUTHOR WHO DESCRIBED SOVIET PRISON
CAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: optional sidebar at end of article) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gustaw Herling, whose memoir, ``A World Apart,'' was one of the
first and among the most powerful and enduring accounts of life and
death in the Soviet network of prisons and labor camps, died on
Tuesday in Naples, Italy, according to the Polish embassy in Rome.
He was 81 and lived in Naples.
</P>
<P>
   Herling was Polish by birth and language and in much of his
sensibility, but as in the case of his fellow writer and countryman
Joseph Conrad, whom he greatly admired, he never lived in his
native land after leaving it as a young man. A veteran of bitter
combat as a soldier in the Polish army fighting with the Allies in
central Italy during World War II, he later married the daughter of
Benedetto Croce, the Italian philosopher and anti-fascist, and
settled in Naples.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Conrad, who in 1874 went to the West to escape
Russian oppression, Herling as a young man went East, setting off
on an impulsive, romantically patriotic and ultimately tragic
journey that led him to the horrors of Soviet imprisonment, horrors
that were then largely unknown except by those who experienced
them.
</P>
<P>
   When German forces launched their lightning invasion of Poland
in September 1939, to begin World War II, Herling was then a
20-year-old student at Warsaw University, studying Polish
literature and reading the French neo-Thomist Jacques Maritain and
Croce's works on aesthetics. He was the editor of the university's
literary journal and he belonged to an anti-fascist student group.
Within days after the attack he was heading East with the intention
of finding weapons to resist the Germans, who had already occupied
the western part of his country.
</P>
<P>
   He never found the arms, but as he kept searching in what had
been Eastern Poland, Russia, acting in accordance with Moscow's
nonaggression pact with Hitler, also attacked Poland, grabbing what
territory remained. Herling was arrested by the a Soviet security
agency called the NKVD, thrown into a crowded prison, and
confronted by officers who hurled seemingly absurd accusations at
him. As he wrote in ``A World Apart'' (which appeared 12 years
later, in 1951), his interrogator pointed to the high leather boots
he was wearing, a gift from his sister, and said they proved he was
a major in the Polish army. There also was the matter of his name,
Herling, which in Russian was rendered into ``Gerling.'' That was
enough for the prosecutor to accuse him of being a relative of
Hermann Goering, the field marshal of the German air force. After
months of imprisonment and repeated interrogations, the charges
against Herling were reduced to just one accusation: ``Attempting
to cross the Soviet-Lithuanian frontier in order to fight the
Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   At the last interrogation, he wearily asked if the words ``to
fight against Germany'' could be substituted. Then, he wrote, ``A
blow to the face brought me back to my senses. `It comes to the
same thing anyway,' the judge consoled me as I signed the
confession of guilt which had been placed in front of me.'' He was
sentenced to five years at the hardest labor and transported by
slow trains to Yercova, a section of the Kargopol prison camps
above Archangel on the White Sea.
</P>
<P>
   With remarkable dispassion, he wrote ``A World Apart'' less
about his own sufferings and anguish than he about what was
experienced by those around him. He described the old criminals who
with the blessings of authorities imposed harsh order and he
detailed the hunts for women prisoners by gangs of rapists. He
wrote about the backbreaking work in the forests that inevitably
caused malnourished prisoners to collapse and of a house where
dying people were sent to await death on less than half the normal
meager rations. He wrote of betrayals, self-mutilations and hunger,
but mostly he wrote about people enduring the gulag: the
still-believing Communists who saw their own suffering as
historically justified, the man who escaped and walked into the
wilderness for a week before blundering back to the camp, the woman
who risked punishment by passing him a tattered copy of
Dostoevsky's ``House of the Dead,'' which revealed to him
persistent echoes of brutality and suffering in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Herling described how a prisoner's personality is deliberately
broken down by his captors, how his ``thoughts and emotions become
loosened in their original positions and rattle against each other
like the parts of a broken-down machine.'' Then, he said, ``the
whole world suddenly shrinks to the limits of the camp'' and the
captive ``begins to dread the prospect of having again to live at
liberty,'' because ``at the very depth of human degradation there
occur moments when every possibility of change, even change for the
better, appears risky and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, after German troops broke the Hitler-Stalin pact and
attacked the Soviet Union, Stalin approved an amnesty for his
Polish prisoners. But six months later, Herling still was forced to
remain in his camp. His memoir concludes with a description of how
he finally gained his release by going on a hunger strike and
setting off _ sick, weak and ragged _ in search of one of the
recruiting offices where a Polish army was being raised. He was
bold enough, however, to steal his prisoner photographs from his
dossier as Labor Inmate Number 1872.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to find a recruiter and enlist in the Polish army
that wound its way through Kazakhstan, Iran, Palestine and Egypt
and across the Libyan desert. In 1943 he was with this force as it
took part in the Allied assault up the boot of Italy. He was a
member of the Polish assault troops that sustained huge casualties
before finally overwhelming the German positions at the Benedectine
abbey at Monte Cassino, which for months had blocked the Allied
advance on Rome. For his bravery in that final breakthrough battle,
Herling, who was then a radioman, was awarded the Virtuti Militari,
Poland's highest military medal.
</P>
<P>
   When the war ended he made his way to England, where he lived
and wrote for some years, publishing ``A World Apart'' seven years
before Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn drew on similar but somewhat later
experiences to write ``A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and
gain an international readership. Over the years that followed,
Herling's writing would regularly be compared in its artistic,
psychological and moral force to the works of Solzhenitsyn, to
Dostoyevsky's ``House of the Dead'' (which he had read through
twice in his term of forced labor) and to Primo Levi's ``Survival
in Auschwitz.'' But his work would be banned in his native country
because of its author's anti-communism.
</P>
<P>
   When ``A World Apart'' first appeared, its impact was blunted by
Soviet sympathizers in the West who denied or minimized the
existence of the chain of Soviet prisons and forced labor camps
that Solzhenitsyn would later label the Gulag Archipelago. In his
preface to ``A World Apart,'' Bertrand Russell wrote about those
letter-writing apologists: ``Those who write such letters and those
fellow-travelers who allow themselves to believe them share
responsibility for the almost unbelievable horrors which are being
inflicted upon millions of wretched men and women, slowly done to
death by hard labor and starvation in the Arctic cold.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving England and settling in Naples, Herling continued
to write in Polish, primarily for Kultura, the remarkable
publication he helped Jerzy Giedroyc establish outside Paris in
1947. Kultura virtually sustained Polish culture through the
decades when Communists ruled Poland and sought to censor free
expression. Herling contributed critical essays and excerpts from
his ``Diary Written at Night, ``which he kept through the 1970s,
'80s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   After the the collapse of Communism in 1989, Herling began to
visit his native land, where he was born Gustaw Herling-Grudzinski
in the town of Kielce in 1919. His censored books were all
published, excerpts from his diary were offered weekly by a major
Warsaw newspaper, and his comments commanded attention from the
media.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his essays and interviews, he frequently demonstrated a
feisty aggressiveness in disputing the conversions of former
Communists. In 1997 he touched off much controversy in Poland by
publishing a short story called ``Beata Santa,'' which is about a
Polish girl detained in a prison camp run by Bosnian Serbs during
the war who is raped many times by her captors. Unlike other raped
prisoners who found themselves pregnant and arranged for abortions
once they were freed, the Polish girl heeds the instructions of her
church and decides to have her baby. She dies in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was provoked by a man whom I admire very much, John Paul
II,'' Herling said in discussing the motives that led him to write
the story. ``But he made an appeal to young girls who have been
raped in Bosnia not to have abortions. I thought it was very unjust
_ terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from ``A World Apart'' and some essays collected in
anthologies, most readers in English would know only one other work
by Herling, ``The Island,'' a novel consisting of three linked
tales, which was published in 1967 by World and again in 1992 by
Viking. The common theme that subtly ties together stories set
hundreds of years apart is Herling's view that ``conflict, all real
conflict, is actually just of one kind: between the recognition of
the essential worth of a man and it's cancellation.''
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing ``The Island,'' for The New York Times Book Review
in 1992, Louis Begley, the Polish-born author of the World War II
memoir ``Wartime Lies,'' said it ``rightfully belongs to the canon
of great works of literature,'' and expressed the hope that its
publication would make more widely known a writer ``of
extraordinary talent and scope.''

   Begley found the three tales linked by ``the atrocious
persistence of life, and of a kind of hope, in the face of pain,
humiliation and extremes of solitude. The title story is set on
Capri; the paradisiacal beauty of `the pearl of the Mediterranean'
is rendered with the eye for detail and descriptive gifts of a
nature writer. So is the contrast, in the story called `The Tower'
between the Val d'Aosta, a `domain of darkness,' and the green
countryside where the valley suddenly opens up and makes the
traveler forget how `nature has imprisoned this colored bowl in a
fist of naked peaks and glaciers.' In `The Second Coming : A
Medieval Tale,' it is 13th-century Orvieto and its surroundings
that are depicted with the precision and sense of mute menace that
recall the landscapes of Passion scenes in Umbrian altarpieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Begley said of Herling: ``Like too many great Eastern European
writers, he has suffered the double misfortune of being exiled from
the country where his language is spoken and yet confined within
that country's language, which is not in international use.''

   A HERLING SAMPLER
</P>
<P>
   From ``A World Apart,'' (Oxford University Press, 1987),
Translated from the Polish by Joseph Marek:
</P>
<P>
   ``Please read this,'' _ her voice trembled _ ``but don't tell
anyone where you got it from. It is banned these days _ especially
here,'' she added with a smile. I took a ragged, disintegrating
book from her hand and looked at the cover: Dostoevsky, The House
of the Dead, Petersburg 1894.
</P>
<P>
   `` Two months passed; during that time I read The House of the
Dead twice, but I saw Natalia Ivanova only from a distance in the
zone, and greeted her always with a friendly wave of the hand. She
looked at me with anxiety, as if she wanted to see from my
expression whether the book had made the expected impression on me.
I avoided talking to her, though I would always regret my decision
as I watched her walking slowly to her barrack, greeting everyone
who passed with a polite nod.
</P>
<P>
   `` I avoided her because from the moment when I read the first
few pages of the book until I closed it for the second and last
time at the final paragraph: `Yes, with God's blessing! Freedom,
new life, resurrection from the dead ...` I lived in a state of
trance, as if I had woken from a long mortal sleep. The thing about
the book was not Dostoevsky's ability to describe inhuman suffering
as if it were a natural part of human destiny, but that aspect of
it which also struck Natalia ...: that there was not the slightest
break between his fate and ours. I read the book in the evenings,
at night, and also in the daytime, robbing myself of sleep. My
heart beat like the clapper of a bell and my head hummed with a
tumult which increased like the infinitely repeated echo of
countless drops of water, which fall at regular intervals on the
same spot of the skull, and seem to crack it every time with the
resounding blow of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most difficult periods of my prison life. I
read the book at night under the cover of my jerkin, and in the
daytime concealed it in the safest place on the bunk, under a loose
plank near the head. I hated it and loved it, as a victim can
become attached to the instrument of his torture. After my return
from work I always looked anxiously to see if it was still in
place, but on the way to the barrack I subconsciously longed for it
to disappear without return, that I might be free once and for all
from this nightmare of life without hope. I did not know then that
a mental condition of full consciousness is more dangerous in
slavery than hunger and physical death. Until then I had lived like
other prisoners, instinctively avoiding the necessity to come face
to face with my own existence . . .''
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Island,'' (Penguin Books, 1967) translated by Ronald
Strom:
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a pause after the first strong knell broken by the
dying heartbeats of iron on bronze; they were strung out like
broken pearls, smaller and ever quieter, until they melted in their
own echoes. Then a few more knells but violent and rapid as if the
bell-ringer hoped to overcome his fatigue with sheer obstinacy,
like a traveler on the last stretch of road before the peak. Again
a chaotic sequence of broken sounds and echoes filled the air,
bouncing off each other, suffocating, going off in all directions,
and gradually vanishing in the commotion of a new day and in the
cries of the fisherman. The silence that followed was so long that
it seemed that the bell- ringer must still be hanging onto the
rope.''

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-$ADV09 _ ONI, Georgia _ High in still snowy
mountain passes separating Russia from its southern neighbors,
Chechen rebels have found a near
</P>
<P>
   impenetrable lair. From these hideouts, the rebels have
unleashed a new round of fighting their almost yearlong war against
the Russian army. The worrisome problem is that the rebels have
moved across the international border, to the Republic of Georgia,
threatening to escalate what Russia has always called a ``domestic
issue'' into a regional war. (Coker, Cox News Service). WITH

   BRITIAIN-CRIME-$ADV09 _ LONDON _ The crime rate has risen

   MEXICO-REVOLUTION _ MEXICO CITY _ It's being called the second
Mexican Revolution, the Revolution of the 21st Century, Mexico's
Velvet Revolution, the electoral earthquake. To the surprise of
virtually all political observers here, Mexicans rose up last
Sunday and decisively ended 71 years of domination by the world's
longest-reigning political party. In just one week, life in Mexico
has changed spirtually if not materially. Many people sense a
mantle of control has been lifted. A federal employee here who was
forced to pass out literature for the ruling party said she hopes
such coercion is dead in Mexico. A TV comic pushed the envelope on
freedom of expression by performing a sketch using amusing video of
President-elect Vicente Fox, and then bantering with the real Fox
in a live telephone interview. The audience went wild. Mexico is
enjoying a democratic fiesta, even though
</P>
<P>
   there are rumblings of how tough Fox's job is going to be as he
struggles to shape a new government here. (Ferriss, Cox News

   MEXICO-PRI _ MEXICO CITY _ The worst of times for Mexico's
freshly defeated ruling party included the 1968 student massacre,
several crippling peso devaluations and spate of fratricidal
assassinations. And now the ultimate _ unexpected defeat at the
polls of 71 years in power. Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party is in the throes of a crisis, as its leaders squabble among
one another and stunned supporters wonder what will happen to their
special favors. President Ernesto Zedillo, who accepted the PRI's
defeat and won praise from abroad and the opposition here, is being
reviled within
</P>
<P>
   his own party as a traitor. The PRI will now be a minority power

   SURPLUS _ WASHINGTON _ Like Uncle Sam finding a $20 bill in the
pocket of his striped pants on laundry day, the U.S. government
last month came up with an extra $100 billion in revenue over the
next 10 years. While this boost in the projected federal surplus
certainly sounds like good news, it raises some disquieting
questions. How can revenue estimates change so quickly, and can
they go down as fast as they went up? And could the new revenues
lead lawmakers to create spending or benefit programs that would be
hard to roll back if the windfall evaporates? (Deans, Cox News

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ How would Southern politics change - or would it
change at all _ if we knew all the dire predictions about global
warming were really true? With all the scientific controversy over
that subject we can't be sure. But if there's one area which could
be looked at as a present-day laboratory for the consequences of
such an unprecedented crisis, it lies along the Carolina coastline.
That's because whether global warming affects it or not, there is
convincing evidence that over the next 30 years, storms like the
one which caused record flooding in North Carolina last year will
increase in frequency. That increases the potential like more
environmental disasters like the one last year in which North
Carolinians saw their rivers polluted with the carcasses of
thousands of drowned hogs. But it also brings a risk of political
disaster, as South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges found out last year
when he ordered the coast evacuated for a disaster which didn't
materialize. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   TRANSEXUAL-MINISTER _ The Rev. Erin Swenson's heart thumped
wildly. She was so close to panic that her fingertips tingled.
Facing her, the crowd crammed inside the Shallowford Presbyterian
Church in Atlanta stared at her in disbelief. Swenson, an ordained
minister and father of two daughters, had just walked to the front
of the church in a green dress, heels and an eggshell-white blouse.
She was going to speak publicly for the first time about a
49-year-old secret that had driven her to thoughts of suicide.
Swenson told the hushed crowd that she was a woman born in a man's
body. Now that she had taken steps to correct that, she made an
unprecedented request before the assembly of Presbyterian church
leaders: Allow her to retain her ordination as a minister. Five
years later, Swenson is stepping back in the spotlight. She _ along
with , her ex-wife, daughter and father _ is are finally talking
about the extraordinary journey _ as a family and as individuals _
they have taken together since that autumn morning. (Blake, Atlanta

   COVER _ The idea seems obvious, so why didn't anyone think of it
before? ``Women get to accessorize with great shoes and handbags,
so why shouldn't our Palm Pilot covers and planners express who we
are and be fabulous also?'' asks Sunny Knox. The Dayton native, who
now makes her home in Los Angeles, theorized that women would be
anxious to replace ``black and boring'' accessory covers with those
more funky and fashionable. She figured right. Today Sunshine

cities in the Southeast are engineering new art museums or
expanding existing facilities in a major way. Just about everywhere

repositories. Total cost of this building boom: an estimated $325
million. (Sabulis, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   EARLE _ Renegade country rocker Steve Earle is the last artist
one would expect to be a Savior. After building a reputation as one
of the most gifted _ and angry _ musicians in Nashville (and years
of herion addiction), he has become the icon of Americana music, an
eclectic collection of alternative country artists too esoteric for
mainstream radio. Earle's new album, ``Transcendental Blues,'' sold
20,000 copies during its first week of release, and remains at the
top of the Americana charts. He kicks off his national tour in
Atlanta on Tuesday, in a week loaded with Americana performances,
including Shelby Lynne and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. We talk to Earle

down an invitation to apply to be endorsed. He chose instead to
spell out his stands on education within school classrooms or in
other educational forums. Since 5 percent of the nation's
voting-age adults are in the families of AFT or NEA members, and
they are more likely than most adults to vote, that was a
calculated gamble that could hurt Bush in a close race in November.

kitchen like the 83-year-old grandmother she is, serving up sweaty
glasses of sweet tea,passing around a tray piled with fat slices of
coconut pound cake. For country music's biggest stars, however,
``Mama'' Lois's cooking is the equivilent of any listing you'll

 &HT;    Georgia woman Amazon.com's top reviewer
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harriet Klausner has been a page turner ever since she breezed
through ``The Princess and the Pea'' at age 3. By the time she was
12, she was tackling ``War and Peace'' and ``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four decades later, the Morrow, Ga., homemaker and former
librarian shows no signs of slowing down. She reads books as
regularly as most people brush their teeth _ one in the morning and
one at night _ and for the past five years she has written more
than 500 reviews for Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Her unpaid critiques have attracted a following of admirers on
the Web site and prompted Amazon.com to dub her its No. 1 reviewer.
According to the online bookstore, the top reviewers are selected
not only for the number of reviews they contribute, but also for
the number of votes they receive from readers rating the
helpfulness of the criticism. Klausner has received more than 5,000
``helpful'' ratings from her fellow readers.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com has used customer reviews since the site was launched
in July 1995, says spokeswoman J.J. Jacobi. Anyone can submit a
review, but not all books are reviewed _ just the ones readers feel
strongly about, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers are passionate about sharing information and
helping others,'' says Jacobi, who estimates that Amazon.com has
more than 2 million reviews posted and more than 17 million
potential reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's scary about doing this is the power the reader bestows
on you,'' says Klausner, 48. ``I never forget the responsibility I
have to the readers. I have to be honest. If I don't like a book in
the first 50 pages, I won't review it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into Klausner's Morrow ranch house is like entering a
literary maze. Shooing her two dogs and four cats into another
room, the short, compact woman makes her way through stacks and
stacks of books to her computer desk. More books are stacked here,
too, and the bedroom, she explains in a Bronx accent that sounds
eerily like Fran Drescher's, barely has room for the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had 7,500 books at last count,'' says her husband,
Stan, as he directs their 21-year-old son, Chris, to clear a path
through the latest arrivals. ``I'm sure there are more now.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, Harriet Klausner worked as a librarian in
Harrisburg, Pa., before moving to Atlanta in 1983 when her husband
took a job at Fort McPherson. She began writing reviews in
Pennsylvania when library patrons asked for recommendations. Later,
she reviewed for Romantic Times magazines and other publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never interested in money,'' she says. ``I decided this
was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I wanted to help
the mid-list authors who don't get much publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   She now writes free-lance synopses for the Literary
Guild/Doubleday Book Club, sifts through unsolicited manuscripts
for an unnamed national publisher, and works with a movie company _
also unnamed _ writing analyses of books that she thinks would make
good movies.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all these duties, speed-reader Klausner says she
doesn't let her reading interfere with her family life. ``I read
one book from 10 to 12 in the morning and another from 11 to 1 at
night and write the reviews. I try not to take time away from the
family, or the two dogs, or the four cats, because if it did, I
wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband encourages Klausner to pursue her passion, but he's
not a big reader. ``I don't have time usually,'' he says. ``But I'm
going on a trip to D.C. soon, and I'm going to take a book she
recommended, `Hammerhead Ranch Motel.' That's when I do my reading,
when I'm on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, says her husband, the woman who is Amazon.com's No.
1 reviewer was terrified of the Internet for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept trying to get her to try it, but she wouldn't,'' he
says. ``After a while, she took it as a challenge and got on it.
Now she's an expert.''
</P>
<P>
   Klausner began writing reviews for Amazon.com because she
thought the site was the most reader-friendly. ``They didn't treat
the readers like idiots, but like informed consumers. It was the
kind of place I didn't mind putting my reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her reading taste, it's eclectic to say the least. She
gravitates to mysteries, romances and horror fiction, but she also
likes literary works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't usually do the big names, but once in a while I'll
read something I really love, like Patricia Cornwell's book, and
I'll put my two cents in. I do a lot of ethnic mysteries and a lot
of gay mysteries,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay books are fantastic because there's a lot of emotion, a
lot of depth, a lot of romance. Readers, whether they want to admit
it or not, would love gay mysteries because usually there's a great
love story within the mystery. For instance, `Little Miss Evil' by
Lev Raphael is the funniest thing I've read lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Klausner's reviews are positive _ with the maximum
five-star rating _ but once in a while she'll pan a book. When she
does, the hate e-mail pours in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a negative review of one of the Father Dowling
mysteries, and the readers said it was blasphemy. I'm sorry, I like
some of the Father Dowlings, but I'm not going to lie for
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Klausner buys a lot of her books, and now that she's famous _
she was mentioned in the June 19 People magazine _ she gets dozens
of books every week from publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the books that give you an uplifting feeling,'' she
says, moving a new stack of books to her desk. ``They give you a
natural high. They're better than alcohol or drugs or bungee
jumping.''
</P>

&HT;     SOME SCIENTISTS SAY GENETIC MAPPING ACHIEVEMENT OVERHYPED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Is the mapping of the human genome the
biological equivalent of the moon landing, an achievement that will
revolutionize medicine and enable humanity to guide its future
evolution?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it an overhyped stunt ballyhooed by biotech capitalists
that will fall far short of its most romantic ambitions?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it somewhere in between, a technological feat like so many
others, from rocketry to nuclear power, that will bring its share
of wonders, disappointments and occasional disasters?
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems clear: The final answer isn't likely to come for
a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genome project is a major contribution to society. But
this is only the first step. Now comes the hard work to turn it
into practical benefit for society,'' said David Martin, president
of the San Francisco-based company Eos Biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the struggle to grasp the astronomical complexity
of human genes, and the baffling ways in which they interact, will
keep scientists burning the midnight oil for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the perspective offered by Harvard biologist Ruth
Hubbard, who delights in pricking DNA scientists' biggest balloons:
Imagine that you copied all the works of Shakespeare by stringing
all the words together, without any spacing or punctuation. Then
imagine that you presented the text to someone who doesn't know
English.
</P>
<P>
   That, Hubbard said, is what scientists face as they confront the
genetic challenge of the coming century. Genes are strung together
in long chains, often with no obvious rhyme or reason. So
scientists will have great difficulty figuring out what all those
genes do and how they do it.
</P>
<P>
   The majesty of that challenge was underlined last month at a
White House news conference. There, flanked by big-name
geneticists, President Clinton oratorically toasted the mapping of
the human genome and asserted, ``Today we are learning the language
in which God created life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although sharing Clinton's excitement and high hopes for the
future, many scientists describe the achievement in less
theological terms.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ``important landmark. But it's only one step in a long
process of understanding how human genes work and how human genes
relate to disease,'' said Lewis ``Rusty'' Williams, head of
research and development at the Chiron Corp., one of the nation's
premier biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists chuckled over the banner headlines reporting
that scientists had cracked the genetic code _ as if it had
happened all of a sudden, like Neil Armstrong stepping onto the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like all of a sudden Moses came down with the
tablets,'' said Geoffrey Duyk, chief science officer of Exelixis, a
biotech company in San Francisco. ``People have been living with
the reality that this (genetic) sequence was on the horizon for
over a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply knowing the genetic code doesn't answer a crucial
question: How does the code lead to the next-higher building blocks
of life, namely proteins?
</P>
<P>
   Genes tell cells how to manufacture larger molecules, including
proteins, which are basic structural and metabolic elements in
organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Once its chemical constituents are assembled, a protein folds
into a unique pretzel-like shape that enables it to perform
specific biological functions, just as the shape of a key enables
it to open a specific door.
</P>
<P>
   Yet scientists have never been able, despite immense effort and
computerized number-crunching, to use a particular gene's chemical
code to predict the shape of protein for which it codes.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this so-called protein folding or functional genomics
problem, and for many other reasons, Richard C. Strohman, a
professor emeritus of molecular and cell biology at the University
of California at Berkeley, is an outspoken critic of what he calls
genetic totalitarianism, the dogma that genes are the answer to all
biological mysteries. Biology simply is too complicated for DNA to
explain it all, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding genome mapping, ``There's cause for celebration, but
scientists have been carried away with euphoria,'' said Lily E.
Kay, the author of ``Who Wrote the Book of Life? A History of the
Genetic Code'' (Stanford University Press). Scientists have
oversimplified the simplicity of genetics ``for funding reasons,
mainly,'' she said.

PUTIN VISITS BASE NEAR CHECHNYA TO DISCUSS SECURITY IN THE REGION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Vladimir Putin made a surprise trip to the
Mozdok military base near Chechnya Wednesday night to review the
deteriorating security situation in the secessionist republic.
</P>
<P>
   He convened a meeting of top aides, a presidential spokesman
said, to consider military and economic steps to secure Russia's
hold on Chechnya, where Russian forces have waged a 10-month
campaign against separatist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting followed a string of bombings last Sunday against
Russian bases and checkpoints, which left at least 33 dead, shocked
the nation and illustrated that Russia has only a tenuous hold on
much of the territory nominally under its control.
</P>
<P>
   An emotional funeral was held Wednesday in Chelyabinsk, a city
in the Urals that was home to many of the militia killed in
Sunday's bombing attacks. Putin sent condolences to families of the
victims, but otherwise he has had little to say about the latest
rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting in Mozdok included Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev;
Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo; the chairman of Putin's
Security Council, Sergei Ivanov; and the commander of Russian
forces in Chechnya, Col. Gen. Gennady Troshev. Akhmad Kadyrov, who
was appointed by Putin to administer Chechnya, also was on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Putin had flown to Mozdok from Tajikistan, where he met with
leaders from China, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The five
countries decided Wednesday to set up an anti-terrorism center in
the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, to combat threats to the region's
stability from Muslim fundamentalists. Some of Putin's senior aides
accompanied him to that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was elected largely on his reputation as a tough, former
intelligence chief who promised to restore Russian pride and defeat
the Chechen rebels. But instead of a speedy and decisive victory,
Chechnya has turned into a quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials on Wednesday sought to prepare the population
for more fighting and more causalities. Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the
Russian government spokesman, said the rebels were taking advantage
of the cover provided by Chechnya's thick summer foliage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to expect a strike from behind at all times,''
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
   After the attacks Sunday, one a suicide truck bomb, Russian
authorities instituted a shoot-on-sight evening curfew and
increased bombing raids. Russian news reports said that on
Wednesday one Russian military truck had been damaged by a mine and
that some soldiers had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site controlled by the rebels warned of more attacks,
including beyond Chechnya: ``We remind the Russian people that the
martyrdom operations that are taking place in Chechnya today and
that will take place beyond Chechnya's borders in the future will
have been caused by Putin's criminality.''

THE OLD ECONOMY IS NEW IN THE INTERNET WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and adjunct
professor of social sciences at Cooper Union.) 
 By JEFF MADRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the relentless search to find something
unprecedented in the new economy, many business gurus, and even
some well-trained economists, now say that the theoretical
principles underlying it are novel as well. Don't bet on it.
Increasingly, it looks as if old-economy principles are saving the
day.
</P>
<P>
   The main claim is that we now live in a ``network society,'' one
in which profits and economic growth can reach heights that will
make other industrial revolutions look pallid. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers displayed just such new-age thinking in a speech
this spring. Citing an example used by many a new-economy guru, he
noted that one fax machine is useless, but when we have two and
more, we have a network. If there are 100,000 fax machines, we have
10 billion possible relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Because of such networks, the argument goes, profitability does
not diminish as investment expands. (Diminishing returns are
supposedly old-economy ideas.) Rather, there are now ``positive
feedback loops'' because it costs so little, sometimes almost
nothing, to reach a new customer or make a new connection. Thus,
the bigger the network, the higher the returns on investment. The
ultimate network is, of course, the World Wide Web and the
countless private Internet-like systems run by large corporations
and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But how new is all this? Has Summers ever heard of telephones?
Or television? Or the A&AMP;P, for that matter, which was started in
the late 1800s? Granted, television and the A&AMP;P were not the sort
of networks that could isolate 25 or 2,500 people, as ideally may
happen on the Net. But the basic economic advantage was the same:
positive feedback loops. One A&AMP;P &UR;  &LR; was only a large mom-and-pop
store. Two or more, and we had a network. With every additional
outlet, the owners increasingly enjoyed the benefits of large-scale
purchases of inventories, aggressive advertising and the mass
distribution of their product. The more they invested, the lower
their average costs.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider steel. In 1880, steel rails cost about $68 a ton to
produce. But largely because of economies of scale, the price fell
to about $18 a ton by 1900. The fixed cost to put up a modern steel
mill was high, but the cost of producing extra rails was small.
Thus, the more rails that could be sold, the lower the average cost
for each ton. Those who sold the most could underprice the
competition, spend more on marketing and lower costs still more.
</P>
<P>
   The same economies of scale that worked in the late 1800s and
throughout most of the 1900s may also be creating rapid
productivity gains in the new economy. New companies are selling
standardized products to enormous mass markets, just as in the good
old days. Industry after industry back then exploited the
advantages of scale, from petroleum companies to cigarettes
manufacturers to rail lines to automakers to retail chains. Huge
companies came to dominate their markets.
</P>
<P>
   In the new economy, standardization and economies of scale are
clearly back. It is too early to get precise data. Moreover, most
new economies of scale are being earned in service industries, and
as John Kwoka, a George Washington University economist, points
out, the government does not gather data about them.
</P>
<P>
   But has there ever been a more standardized product in America
than MS-DOS, Microsoft's operating system, or Windows? Consider
today's most successful companies _ Microsoft, Cisco Systems,
America Online, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Dell Computers, eBay and
so on. All have enormous shares of their particular markets, and
all enjoy economies of scale based on standardized (if complex)
products. The more these companies sell, the higher their
productivity as they reduce labor costs per unit to a minimum. The
national economic data shows that most of the outsize gains in
productivity are being created in just such computer and software
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Technologists tell us it will be the next generation of software
that will ultimately connect the niche markets. My guess is that
true profitability will continue to come to those business that
sell products with the broadest appeal. AOL wants more subscribers,
eBay more participants and Amazon.com hopes to reach the huge
critical mass needed to make it profitable at last. In fact, the
Internet probably gives even more advantage to large companies than
they had in the past because the nonmarketing costs of reaching one
additional customer is virtually nil. The real advantage will be to
those companies that either have a piece of technology that cannot
be duplicated or can afford to advertise aggressively enough to win
brand-name recognition in the mass market.
</P>
<P>
   For antitrust authorities, old questions, not new ones, are
being raised. The new networks give rise to monopolies. But the
economic benefits of such big business should not be
underestimated. Through economies of scale, stable markets, uniform
standards, investment in research and development and permanent,
well-trained labor forces, big business has long been a boon to
America.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, monopolies can go too far by suppressing
innovation and keeping prices high. Especially now that size may
have a renewed advantage, the antitrust authorities are correct to
be vigilant. Moreover, there are other traditional concerns. In the
pursuit of more scale, mergers among media companies threaten
American principles of free speech. The consolidation of financial
services makes us more vulnerable to crisis. The concentration of
wealth has skewed political power toward the rich.
</P>
<P>
   The real niche economy was the one started by Japanese auto
companies in the late 1970s. Consumers demanded a wide choice of
products, and our sleepy big businesses did respond, albeit slowly,
with innovative ways to meet these needs more productively. But
they could not raise productivity as rapidly as they did in the
more standardized century between the Civil War and the 1970s. In
my view, this contributed to America's historically slow growth
from the 1970s to the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, that changed radically. Business again made
standardized products that corporations and consumers craved in
mass volume. For good and ill, welcome back the old economy.

(EDS: Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New
York Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is
Lived in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort
by a team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of

   He waited until the bus was ready to leave before squeezing up
front to address the passengers. The Greyhound was going from
Chicago to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   He surveyed the bunched rows of seats. There were only 19
passengers, most of them young, most of them black. Billy Wimsatt
was white. It was an audience that made him especially comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   He held aloft a slender book. ``I wrote this book,'' he said
over the chitter of talk. ``It's pretty good. It normally sells for
$12. On this bus, I'll sell it for $5, and you can read it along
the way free.''
</P>
<P>
   It was called ``No More Prisons,'' and was about incarceration
and philanthropy and hip-hop, always hip-hop, for hip-hop was the
everlasting undertone to his life. He was a writer and activist,
and over the years his work had made him something of a minor cult
figure in the hip-hop world, a white man with unusual credibility
among blacks deeply protective of their culture. He was an
unbudgeable optimist, convinced he could better the world by
getting whites and people of other races to talk together and work
together. He spent most of his time on the road, on a yearlong tour
of several dozen college campuses, preaching his message. Now the
bus was taking him to Earlham College in eastern Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Some passengers gave grudging looks of curiosity. What gives
with this guy? Six people beckoned for copies. One woman gave hers
back after 15 minutes, opting for sleep. A man behind her bought
one. A woman said she'd take one, too. ``Cool,'' Wimsatt said. He
gave her a big smile and a hug.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wimsatt was 27, still clinging to the hip-hop life. He
didn't look terribly hip-hop, and not because he was white. He was
balding and brainy-looking, with an average build and an exuberant
nature.
</P>
<P>
   He was born as rap music was being invented by blacks and
Latinos in the South Bronx. What began as party music became their
cry of ghetto pain and ultimately their great hope for a way out.
And as hip-hop _ not just rap music but fashion, break-dancing,
graffiti and the magazines that chronicle it all _ blossomed into
the radiant center of youth culture, Billy Wimsatt and lots of
white kids found in it a way to flee their own orderly world by
discovering a sexier, more provocative one.
</P>
<P>
   Like many young hip-hop heads, he regarded hip-hop, with its
appeal to whites and blacks, as a bold modern hope to ease some of
the abrasiveness between the races. Hip-hop, as he saw it, endowed
him with cultural elasticity, allowed him to shed the privilege of
whiteness, to be as down with blacks as with whites. For a long
time, he felt black in every respect but skin color, he says, which
was why he had been able to get away with that much-noticed article
seven years ago in The Source, a magazine considered one of the
bibles of hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   It was a withering critique of ``wiggers,'' whites who try too
hard to be black so they will be accepted. Soon, he argued, ``the
rap audience may be as white as tables in a jazz club.'' In the
last paragraph, which The Source cut from the final version, he
warned black artists that the next time they invented something,
they had better find a way to control it financially, because
whites were going to steal hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``And since it's the '90s,'' he concluded, ``you won't even get
to hear us say, `Thanks, niggers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Billy Wimsatt seemed about as authentically hip-hop as a
white guy could get. But as he slid into the complexities of
adulthood, he said, he often found himself wondering if that was
enough, unsure which culture was truly his. He had drifted a long
way from his black hip-hop roots. Now, on these unsettled grounds,
he was far from certain he could stay true to his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   A BELIEVER ON THE BRINK
</P>
<P>
   On a clangorous Manhattan sidewalk, Elliott Wilson stopped to
study the bootleg rap tapes splayed on a street vendor's blanket.
Music emanated from a portable stereo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some dope stuff here,'' Wilson, a gangly, light-skinned young
black man with inquisitive eyes and a contagious laugh, said
approvingly. The bargains got him pumped up. He peeled off a $5
bill and bought ``Opposite of H2O'' by Drag-On.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Wilson had never met Billy Wimsatt, but their lives had
traced similar trajectories across the hip-hop landscape. As a
writer and editor, he too had spent much of his adult life thinking
about hip-hop. And not just hip-hop, but race and hip-hop. Race was
unavoidable in hip-hop _ what with all those black rappers idolized
by white teen-agers _ and like Billy Wimsatt, Elliott Wilson was
preoccupied with that conjunction and what it meant in his own
life.
</P>
<P>
   Which culture was his was not Elliott Wilson's worry. Hip-hop
had inspired him to believe that, precisely because he was black,
he could achieve what whites simply assumed was theirs by
birthright _ a gainful life over which he asserted control.
</P>
<P>
   When he read Wimsatt's ``wigger'' article, he and a black friend
were beginning their own hip-hop publication, Ego Trip. They saw it
as a brash challenge to the established, white-owned magazines like
The Source. Bubbling with assurance, Wilson had judged the
``wigger'' article amusing; for all its ridicule of whites, he had
still considered it ``a white boy's perspective on hip-hop.'' He
certainly hadn't seen it as a prophecy of personal doom.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he sometimes had to wonder. He was closing in on 30, trying
to hold fast to his own idea of the hip-hop life. He had watched
with anger and growing pessimism as Ego Trip folded and whites
asserted ever-greater control over the hip-hop industry. Recently,
he had become editor of a promising hip-hop magazine, XXL. It was
white-owned. And so he wondered if he was selling out, if he would
ever become what he wanted on his own terms. Was hip-hop his story,
the black man's story, after all? Did hip-hop unite the races or
push them further apart?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the editor's job at XXL was offered to him last August,
Elliott Wilson was put in a delicate spot. He was broke. In
college, he accepted a flurry of credit cards and bought all the
``fly'' clothing. Now he owed $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers thinking about how blacks needed to think more like
whites. ``We have a short expectancy in life,'' he said. ``So we go
for the quick buck. That's why kids sell drugs. That's why they
rob. We don't feel we can be on a five-year plan to success.''
</P>
<P>
   The XXL job came with excellent pay _ low six figures. But talk
of racial tension stained the place. He asked himself, he said:
Would blacks think he was selling out?
</P>
<P>
   As a black man, how many opportunities would come his way? He
had this unslaked desire to prove his mettle. He took the job.
</P>
<P>
   A REASON FOR RHYMES
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang. Dog got it: ``He here. We here. I'll hit you
back later. You gonna be in the crib?''
</P>
<P>
   It was afternoon. Like a lot of aspiring rappers, Dog and his
friend Trife were living life small, passing time in Dog's
rampantly messy apartment in Brooklyn's Clinton Hill section.
Passing time was what they did most days. They played games,
gossiped, drank Hennessy, chewed over the future. Weekends, they
went bowling. They were 23, young black men seeking sanctuary from
the streets by rhyming their lives.
</P>
<P>
   With their friends Po and Sinbo, they had formed a rap group,
Wanted and Respected. Dog's closet was stuffed with recording
equipment; his specialty was creating the beats. He made some slim
money doing tapes for kids with their own rap dreams ($100 a tape)
and selling shirts on the street. The group had played a few clubs,
always gratis. Others shuttled in and out, but life weighed on the
composition: members kept getting jailed, and one had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Dog and Trife had followed a trajectory of intense poverty and
outlaw life. Dog's grandmother basically raised him _ a dozen
relatives packed into a three-bedroom place. Trife grew up with his
mother, an R &AMP; B singer, and seven others in the nearby projects;
he still lived there with her.
</P>
<P>
   They had belonged to a gang called the Raiders, they said,
selling drugs and doing other things that landed them in prison. If
a white person came into their neighborhood, they said, they robbed
him. They all packed guns. ``It was bad as Beirut,'' Dog said.
Trife said he still sold drugs, and some of the others did dubious
things.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, they gravitated to rap, embracing it the way so
many poor blacks have long embraced basketball. But it was better.
There were more slots. And it seemed to demand less talent. ``You
don't even have to sing well,'' Dog said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is my sanity,'' Trife said. ``If I wasn't doing this,
I'd probably be doing 25 to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dog laughed. ``If it weren't for rap, I'd be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Many older blacks felt rap denigrated their race. They hated the
constant use of ``nigga'' in the songs. Dog and Trife shrugged this
off. Rap was raw and ugly, but this was their lives. Rap was a
blunter truth.
</P>
<P>
   Dog found it curious that whites _ suburban mall rats, college
backpackers _ bought most rap records. ``White people can listen to
rap, but I know they can't relate,'' he said. ``I hear rap and I'm
saying, `Here's another guy who's had it unfair.' They're taking,
`This guy is cool, he's a drug dealer, he's got all the girls, he's
a big person, he killed people.' That is moronic.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Dog said: ``Hip-hop is bringing the races together, but
on false pretenses to make money. Look at Trife. He's got two
felonies. That means he's finished in society. But he can rap. His
two felonies, in rap, man, that's a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's messed up,'' Trife said. ``In hip-hop, I'm valid when I'm
disrespected.''
</P>
<P>
   Trife recited some lyrics he had written:
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't walk in my shoes,
</P>
<P>
   If you ain't lived my life.
</P>
<P>
   Hustling all day, clapping out all night.''
</P>
<P>
   THE COOL RICH KIDS' MOVEMENT
</P>
<P>
   The road to Earlham was speckled with billboards for Tom Raper
RVs, the Midwest's largest RV dealer. The trees were sheathed in
glass from the freezing rain.
</P>
<P>
   Earlham, a small Quaker college, was predominantly white,
marginally into hip-hop. Upski, as Wimsatt signed his work as as
one of Chicago's most prolific graffiti artists, was to give a
talk, accompanied by a hip-hop group, Rubberoom.
</P>
<P>
   Upski had dropped out of Oberlin College in his junior year. He
had only reluctantly gone to college at all. He spent more time
doing graffiti and reading magazines than going to class. He wrote
an anonymous column for the black paper that scathingly denounced
white people. He had a hip-hop radio show: ``Yo, this is live from
Chicago.'' Many people thought he was black.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he says, he was sporadically queasy about his hip-hop
moorings. He knew his infatuation with blacks could be taken
different ways. He could be accepted as credible, or taken as
exploitative.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the great fear of blacks,'' he said. `` `Oh, you'll be
fascinated with us, and then go back to dominating us and you'll be
better at it because you'll have inside information.''' When he had
shown drafts of his writings about race to a black classmate at
Oberlin, she had slipped them back under his door and stopped
talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   He committed himself to journalism and activism. As he put it,
``I saw it as my job to get white people to talk about race.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a year after his influential ``wigger'' article, he
self-published ``Bomb the Suburbs'' _ part memoir of a white man's
life in hip-hop, part interviews with hip-hop figures, part
treatise on race and social change. It sold an impressive 23,000
copies. The gangsta rapper Tupac Shakur declared it ``the best book
I read in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Upski hitchhiked around the country, promoting the book, pushing
his views on racial cohesion, further cementing his eccentric
renown. ``I thought white people would start listening to and
liking black people,'' he said, but ultimately, he was discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   He refocused. He would become a social-change agent, motivating
whites to be activists. Last fall, he published ``No More Prisons''
and began the ``Cool Rich Kids' Movement.'' He would coax cool rich
kids to give money to the cause. He started the Active Element
Foundation and, with an ally, a well-to-do white woman, also
started a group, Reciprocity, that paid him a modest salary. This
year, he began his college tour.
</P>
<P>
   At Earlham, before a mostly white audience, Upski said: ``The
thing that drives me is getting to know people and making
relationships across race and class, which doesn't happen so much
in America. Some of the stuff I'm going to say is going to sound
heavy, and you're going to say, `Let me go smoke some weed and
chill.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He bounced around the room, his manner that of the motivational
speaker. He said: ``My goal today is to encourage you to accept the
best and worst things about yourself.'' He talked about how they
were too comfortable in this school, and how he had been ``saved''
by transferring to a black school after sixth grade. And then
Rubberoom performed, and a lot of people left and the remaining
ones danced. Upski danced.
</P>
<P>
   Upski had brought along a copy of Stress, a small hip-hop
magazine published by people of color. Upski told the students to
read this, not the white-owned magazines.
</P>
<P>
   He used to write for XXL, a fledgling magazine with a white
owner and publisher. In 1997, the original black editor and black
staff quit after being refused an ownership stake. There were
innuendos of racism, but whether it was just business or race
depended on the vantage point. Upski, however, swore never to work
for XXL again.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there were always ways for a smart white guy to make
money.
</P>
<P>
   UPSKI MEETS DOG AND TRIFE
</P>
<P>
   Upski had gone to get his hair cut at the black-owned Freakin U
Creations. He only went to black barbers, and part of his manifesto
was to direct at least half his money to minority stores. Fort
Greene afforded plenty of possibilities. All in all, though, he
found the neighborhood imperfect, already too gentrified. His
girlfriend lived there, so he did. He had lived in a black
neighborhood in Washington. He said he felt he belonged either in a
rich white neighborhood, where he could persuade residents to
integrate, or in the true 'hood, where he could organize. He mused
about moving to East New York.
</P>
<P>
   Upski chatted with one of the owners, Justice Cephas. Two young
black men waited their turn. Cephas was a hip-hop promoter on the
side and was working with their group. They were Dog and Trife.
</P>
<P>
   Upski said, ``Don't take anything off the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Dog studied Upski's pate and said, ``What's there to take off?''
</P>
<P>
   Upski laughed. He asked how they felt about whites' moving into
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, I would have beaten you up just for sitting in
that barber chair,'' Dog told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Upski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've matured,'' Dog said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, he talked about how he was still deeply bitter
toward white people. No white person had ever done anything
positive for him, he said. As he remarked of whites: ``I've never
been with you. Why would I want to be with you now?''
</P>
<P>
   Trife added, ``If you're not my people now, you're not my people
down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Dog and Trife had told Upski about their group, Wanted and
Respected. Trife's older brother had started a record label,
Trife-Life Records, and they were working on its first album. They
hoped to sell it on the street, create some buzz. All the while,
Trife said later, he was thinking, ``What is this white guy doing
in this barbershop?''
</P>
<P>
   Upski smiled. These young men, he said, reminded him of the
black friends he used to run with in Chicago. If he were younger,
he mused, he might want to run with them.
</P>
<P>
   `I PREACH TO MESS UP'
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday dawned muggy. It started badly and got worse. Upski was
addressing about 250 students at Evergreen College in Olympia,
Wash. Maybe 10 weren't white.
</P>
<P>
   He had gathered a panel of half a dozen students. One, Evelyn
Aako, was black. Introducing her, he said: ``I don't know her very
well, but she's black. And she's going to talk about issues of
being black on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Aako gave him an arch look. ``That was very weird,'' she
recalled thinking. ``Like I was a little dark object.''
</P>
<P>
   As Upski began talking, the white audience got defensive. One
student said: ``Why do we have to talk about race? Why can't we
talk about how we're alike?''
</P>
<P>
   Aako was getting disgusted. Finally she told Upski: ``I've been
sitting here with an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach about how
you introduced me. I felt tokenized and on display. This follows a
tradition where black people serve as entertainment for white
people. That's not what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Upski said: ``I screwed up. But what can we do? The world is
screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some white students were looking irritated. One said: ``Can't we
hear Upski talk? We can talk about race later.''
</P>
<P>
   A black student said: ``What do you mean later? We never talk
about race.''
</P>
<P>
   Some whites left. Virtually all the students of color followed.
Before leaving, Aako said, ``It's not my job to educate you.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Upski sounded no less confident of his ability to
stimulate change. But perhaps, he said, he needed to refine his
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main thing that keeps white people from growing is
they're afraid to look bad,'' he said. ``So I preach to mess up.
One of my blind spots at Evergreen was that Evelyn wasn't going to
trust me, that black people and white people, we're still at war.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, he said, he was questioning his own evolution.
Here he was intent on helping blacks, and spending most of his time
in white culture. He had had a string of black girlfriends, but now
he was with a white woman. A few years ago, probably two-thirds of
his friends were black and Latino. Now it had flip-flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop itself had moved away from political and racial talk and
for the most part sold excess and riches, women and violence. So
much of hip-hop, he said, was self-denigrating, imitative and
shallow. It was candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I have the least respect for about parts of
black culture,'' he said, ``is there's so much pain and insecurity
that it gets medicated by aping the worst aspects of white
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about how so many of his old black and Latino graffiti
friends hadn't survived hip-hop too well. One got locked up for
firebombing a car. Another fell from a fire escape while trying to
rob an apartment. He is now a paraplegic, drinking away his life,
Upski says.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Upski had to admit, he was cruising along. His
girlfriend, Drury, had inherited money, though they lived modestly.
He didn't earn a lot, but he didn't worry. Until recently, he never
took cabs and rarely ate out; he called it flaunting privilege. But
now he was traveling more in white circles where everyone took cabs
and ate out. So he did, too. And, he acknowledged, he liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part of Billy that wanted to be black for a good part of
his youth, that's fading,'' Drury said. ``One of the issues in our
relationship is he's a chameleon. The thing with Billy, he wants to
be liked.''
</P>
<P>
   He had always cared so much about how he looked through black
eyes, he said. Now his success depended on how he looked through
white eyes. He had always dressed poorly and now he owned three
suits. Where was he going? As you got older, he reflected, holding
onto your hip-hop values was a lot harder if you were white.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The humidity fell substantially along the Northeast Seaboard on
Wednesday as a large high pressure system over Canada filtered dry
air into the region. The high pressure will continue to influence
the Northeast on Thursday, providing mainly clear skies and
comfortable conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, clusters of thunderstorms will plague parts of the
Midwest and Ohio Valley as humid air intercepts a slow-moving
front. Locally heavy rain and hail will occur in a few places,
especially near Iowa. Additional thunderstorms will erupt in the
northern Plains as low pressure travels along the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   A heat wave will grip the central and southern Plains on
Thursday. Abundant sun will send temperatures past 100 degrees in
many places. The Northwest will stay rather cool while the
Southeast will be partly sunny and humid.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DRY TALLAHASSEE
</P>
<P>
   Tallahassee, Fla., is normally one of the wettest cities in the
United States, averaging about 65 inches of rain a year.
Precipitation this year, however, has been far off the typical
pace. The first six months of this year have been the driest on
record, with slightly more than 11 inches of rain, or about 22
inches below normal. Much of the South has been quite dry this
year. Along the Gulf coast the deficit has been impressive with
most places having less than half their normal rainfall. Summer is
often wet along the Gulf coast, but the current trend of dry
weather will last into this weekend.

CAMBODIA'S `YEAR ZERO' HAUNTS A PHOTOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (Duplication warning: also moving in `i' category) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ He risked his life to take the pictures
25 years ago in one of the most terrifying moments this country has
known. And in a few more years, he says, he may finally be ready to
publish them.
</P>
<P>
   Al Rockoff, once a wild and daring much-wounded freelance
photographer _ and now an only slightly less wild free spirit with
a frighteningly untrammeled gray beard _ has become a part of the
history he recorded, pretty much by standing still.
</P>
<P>
   He is the man portrayed by John Malkovich in the movie ``The
Killing Fields'' _ a portrayal he hates _ who stayed here in Phnom
Penh, along with the tiniest handful of other journalists, to
photograph the end of the war and the dawn of Cambodia's horror
under the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade Rockoff, 51, has been returning regularly
from his tiny home in Florida to chronicle the country's slow
emergence from the devastation of the rule of the Khmer Rouge,
under which more than a million people died from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't got it quite right yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to finish in maybe two or three years,'' he said as he
sat under the ceiling fans of the Foreign Correspondents Club of
Cambodia, whose view of the broad, unchanging Tonle Sap River is
dotted with tiny fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the history of Cambodia from the 1970 American
invasion,'' he said. ``There are still a few key events that I
need, like the passing of King Sihanouk. That will be the end of a
cycle. It could be soon; he's 77 now.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, Rockoff conceded, it could be many more years.
</P>
<P>
   While he waits, he has decided for the first time _ apart from a
half dozen pictures that were published years ago _ to let people
take a look at some of his work in an exhibition of 55 photographs
that cover the walls of the club. The pictures focus on the day of
the fall of Phnom Penh, April 17, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   They are a heart-stopping glimpse of a moment when history came
to a standstill; ground zero of what came to be known as ``Year
Zero'' _ the moment when thousands of grim Khmer Rouge soldiers
trooped single file into the city, tough, sometimes barefoot young
men in black pajamas silently carrying their rifles and grenade
launchers, looking at nobody.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew they had just won a victory, but there were no
smiles,'' Rockoff said. ``They weren't like Americans. If Americans
had won a victory they'd be smiling, high-five-ing.''
</P>
<P>
   From the top of a tank or a jeep or walking side by side with
the silent soldiers, Rockoff captured the fear of the city's
residents as they watched in careful clusters, smiling hopefully,
raising a tentative cheer. No one could imagine the devastation,
the ruin, the mass killings that were about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs show men with bullhorns and pistols riding
through Phnom Penh telling people: ``The war is over. Do not
resist. The war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   People wanted to believe, Rockoff said. But the moment of hope
was brief. ``The first two or three hours it was easy getting
around,'' Rockoff said. ``Then on two occasions they started asking
for Americans. I just kept walking and then I hid behind a truck.''
</P>
<P>
   His work became more furtive as the day became more dangerous.
Along with other reporters, Rockoff was stopped repeatedly. Twice,
he said, his camera and film were taken from him and then,
miraculously, returned.
</P>
<P>
   As the shifting shadows in his pictures show the progress of the
day, the occupying troops take up positions around the city, corral
the crowds, collect weapons, make arrests. The faces of the
onlookers grow more worried.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the poignant and chilling photograph of officials
from the defeated government responding to a call to gather at the
Information Ministry, standing under the trees as a Khmer Rouge
officer addresses them. Some of the officials have put on their
cleanest clothes and neckties for their surrender. Some may know
what is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took this picture probably an hour before they were all
taken out to the back of the building and shot,'' Rockoff said.
</P>
<P>
   All around the city the Khmer Rouge, in their new twist on
communist utopia, began to assert their law: all 2.5 million
residents of the capital were forced into the countryside, where
thousands of them died in the following days of hunger or exposure
or by execution.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon foreigners were ordered into the French
Embassy, where they remained for three weeks before being trucked
across the border into Thailand. Rockoff's pictures show his
colleagues walking toward the embassy as hundreds of Khmer Rouge
soldiers continue to file past them into the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed, Rockoff chronicled the scenes inside
the embassy, but he also spent considerable energy concealing his
film, hiding it in the dry tank of a toilet and then, during the
truck ride to Thailand, taping it to the inside of his leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had destroyed my film it would all have been for
nothing,'' he said. Apart from death, he said, ``that was another
fear I had, that I'd get out alive and have nothing to show for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, 25 years later, he is just beginning to show what he
has to show for it: the images of impending horror that he has
lived with and dreamed of and spent hours alone studying in his
darkroom.
</P>
<P>
   Today Rockoff lives what he describes as a minimal life in
Florida, using a bicycle rather than a car and living mostly off
his benefits as a wounded former Army photographer in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He denies that he is obsessed with Cambodia and the trauma that
he witnessed and shared. But he is quite happy to describe himself
as suffering from what he calls PTSD _ post-traumatic stress
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've got it,'' he said. ``But how you handle it defines
whether you've got PTSD For what I've got, I'm normal.''
</P>
<P>
   As proof, he said, ``I'm not so PTSD'd that I can't live in
America. I still spend half the year there. This is my other life.
I'm glad that I could come back here all these years. I consider

 &HT;    Charleston wrestles with the downsides to upsurge in tourism
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. - Mayor Joseph Riley couldn't have picked a
worse day to disprove the Charlestonians who complain tourists are
squeezing the charm right out of this historic city.
</P>
<P>
   It's hot, muggy and thick with traffic along Concord Street,
congested by out-of-towners dragging luggage. Most are headed for
the Carnival Destiny cruise ship moored along the Cooper River.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens only three days a year,'' said Riley, explaining
that the gigantic ship and its passengers would soon depart this
city of 100,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   But left behind in bustling, prosperous Charleston is the debate
over whether 57-year-old Riley, mayor for the past quarter century,
knows when to drop the anchor on tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3.7 million tourists a year descend on the Charleston
region, up from 3 million in 1996, says the Charleston Metro
Chamber of Commerce. Their economic impact has risen by nearly 40
percent since 1996, to $3.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But some Charlestonians say Riley has gotten carried away by the
growing tourist dollars in his long quest to restore the city's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to make this into Atlanta,'' said Lynn McBride, vice
president of The Committee to Save the City. ``There comes a point
when you destroy the things that people come to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Representing more than 500 downtown residents, the committee has
lobbied, with partial success, for curbs on buses and horse-drawn
carriages. They provide tours of Charleston's historic sites and
beautifully restored neighborhoods on the peninsula, where the
city's Civil War history blends with modern-day commerce.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, motorists backed up behind a pokey carriage
at King and Tradd streets, illustrating Charleston's charm and
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Pink and lavender petunias spill from window boxes of
centuries-old houses along King, a sunny stretch with crepe myrtles
in full bloom. Piano music wafts from behind a pair of closed
shutters.
</P>
<P>
   But wrought-iron gates protecting residents' private gardens
along King don't stop tourists from peeking through and taking
photographs. Parked cars line the right side of this one
way-street, too narrow for vehicles to pass carriages.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks north, along a stretch of King dotted by antiques
stores, Candida Gaillard said she's seen a ``different class of
tourists'' frequenting Charleston in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has gone from being a snobby town, with people in blazers,
to shirtless people with fanny packs,'' said Gaillard, owner of
Gaillard Antiques.
</P>
<P>
   But out of towners now represent a majority of her business.
``The downtown area is a bigger draw for tourists than locals,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley has lived on Gibbes Street on the peninsula since 1971, in
a white clapboard house where he and his wife, Charlotte, a real
estate broker, raised two sons in relative seclusion from the
congestion of recent years. Riley says it's not that bad now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a city where blind boosterism has a foothold,''
Riley said. ``This is a city where we need to be very shrewd and
strategic and careful about how we develop it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the debate has intensified north of the polished brass and
rainbow colors of the million-dollar houses along the Battery, at
the convergence of the Ashley and Cooper rivers. Most recently, the
ruckus has reached neighborhoods in the vicinity of the South
Carolina Aquarium, a $69 million dream-come-true for Riley and
other backers of the project, counting on 800,000 visitors a year
to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   So far, neighborhood leaders say, street banners have done a
good job of directing buses to stay on main thoroughfares leading
to the aquarium. But some residents fear a worsening of traffic
cutting through their neighborhoods and hogging scarce parking
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``What all of this does is destroy the livability for the
residents, who are the mainstay of the city,'' said Courtenay
McDowell, former president of the neighborhood association in
Ansonborough, a few blocks southwest of the aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think there is a Charlestonian who does not like
tourism,'' McDowell said. ``It is the amount of tourism and the
concentrated focus on what appeals to the visitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, an IMAX theater opened next to the aquarium,
which overlooks the Cooper River between two shipping yards
operated by the state ports authority. Restaurants and shops are
planned along with waterfront condominums with prices approaching
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The high-brow development clashes with the gritty, working-class
feel of the Union Pier Terminal, where tall barbed-wire fences
protect South Carolina-made BMW roadsters awaiting export to other
ports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new vibrant area of the city that has come
alive,'' said Ted Stoney, a commercial real estate broker involved
in the IMAX theater. He is also past president of the nearby Mazyck
Wraggborough neighborhood association.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Stoney has mixed feelings about how favorable
publicity in travel magazines and the city's perennial ranking as
one of America's most mannerly cities has transformed Charleston
into a year-round tourist destination. Some locals complain they
have few opportunities to claim the city's parks, restaurants and
waterfront for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Charleston when it was a sleepy little town with
weed-infested lots,'' said Stoney, 50. ``Now there are no more
vacant lots. Even parking lots are being developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1975, when first elected, Riley set out to reverse
Charleston's declining downtown. He pushed controversial
projects_such as the Charleston Place hotel complex and the Cooper
River waterfront park_that have spurred a renaissance of the city's
business corridor and opened up once-uninviting stretches of
riverfront.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Riley envisions the completion of a
waterfront walkway looping around the peninsula from the aquarium
on the Cooper River to the minor-league baseball stadium (named
after the mayor) on the Ashley River.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe strongly that the city should seek to give its most
beautiful zones to the public,'' Riley said, ``and in a city that
is on the water, water is your most beautiful zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk inspires some Charlestonians and has earned Riley a
national reputation as a masterful city planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He defines what a city should be,'' said Dayna Elliott, whose
husband, Dick, operates some of Charleston's most popular
restaurants, including High Cotton and Slightly North of Broad.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two mayoral elections, in 1999 and 1995, Riley
easily won re-election with more than 70 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   With such broad support, McBride said The Committee to Save the
City has tried to influence the mayor rather than try to defeat him
at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Other neighborhood leaders say they've found the mayor willing
to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say he has become increasingly receptive because of people
voicing objections to unbridled growth,'' said Bill Prewitt,
president of the Historic Ansonborough Neighborhood Association.
``I think he is smart enough to listen.''

CAMBODIA'S `YEAR ZERO' HAUNTS A PHOTOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (Duplication warning: also moving in `e' category) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ He risked his life to take the pictures
25 years ago in one of the most terrifying moments this country has
known. And in a few more years, he says, he may finally be ready to
publish them.
</P>
<P>
   Al Rockoff, once a wild and daring much-wounded freelance
photographer _ and now an only slightly less wild free spirit with
a frighteningly untrammeled gray beard _ has become a part of the
history he recorded, pretty much by standing still.
</P>
<P>
   He is the man portrayed by John Malkovich in the movie ``The
Killing Fields'' _ a portrayal he hates _ who stayed here in Phnom
Penh, along with the tiniest handful of other journalists, to
photograph the end of the war and the dawn of Cambodia's horror
under the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade Rockoff, 51, has been returning regularly
from his tiny home in Florida to chronicle the country's slow
emergence from the devastation of the rule of the Khmer Rouge,
under which more than a million people died from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't got it quite right yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to finish in maybe two or three years,'' he said as he
sat under the ceiling fans of the Foreign Correspondents Club of
Cambodia, whose view of the broad, unchanging Tonle Sap River is
dotted with tiny fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the history of Cambodia from the 1970 American
invasion,'' he said. ``There are still a few key events that I
need, like the passing of King Sihanouk. That will be the end of a
cycle. It could be soon; he's 77 now.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, Rockoff conceded, it could be many more years.
</P>
<P>
   While he waits, he has decided for the first time _ apart from a
half dozen pictures that were published years ago _ to let people
take a look at some of his work in an exhibition of 55 photographs
that cover the walls of the club. The pictures focus on the day of
the fall of Phnom Penh, April 17, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   They are a heart-stopping glimpse of a moment when history came
to a standstill; ground zero of what came to be known as ``Year
Zero'' _ the moment when thousands of grim Khmer Rouge soldiers
trooped single file into the city, tough, sometimes barefoot young
men in black pajamas silently carrying their rifles and grenade
launchers, looking at nobody.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew they had just won a victory, but there were no
smiles,'' Rockoff said. ``They weren't like Americans. If Americans
had won a victory they'd be smiling, high-five-ing.''
</P>
<P>
   From the top of a tank or a jeep or walking side by side with
the silent soldiers, Rockoff captured the fear of the city's
residents as they watched in careful clusters, smiling hopefully,
raising a tentative cheer. No one could imagine the devastation,
the ruin, the mass killings that were about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs show men with bullhorns and pistols riding
through Phnom Penh telling people: ``The war is over. Do not
resist. The war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   People wanted to believe, Rockoff said. But the moment of hope
was brief. ``The first two or three hours it was easy getting
around,'' Rockoff said. ``Then on two occasions they started asking
for Americans. I just kept walking and then I hid behind a truck.''
</P>
<P>
   His work became more furtive as the day became more dangerous.
Along with other reporters, Rockoff was stopped repeatedly. Twice,
he said, his camera and film were taken from him and then,
miraculously, returned.
</P>
<P>
   As the shifting shadows in his pictures show the progress of the
day, the occupying troops take up positions around the city, corral
the crowds, collect weapons, make arrests. The faces of the
onlookers grow more worried.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the poignant and chilling photograph of officials
from the defeated government responding to a call to gather at the
Information Ministry, standing under the trees as a Khmer Rouge
officer addresses them. Some of the officials have put on their
cleanest clothes and neckties for their surrender. Some may know
what is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took this picture probably an hour before they were all
taken out to the back of the building and shot,'' Rockoff said.
</P>
<P>
   All around the city the Khmer Rouge, in their new twist on
communist utopia, began to assert their law: all 2.5 million
residents of the capital were forced into the countryside, where
thousands of them died in the following days of hunger or exposure
or by execution.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon foreigners were ordered into the French
Embassy, where they remained for three weeks before being trucked
across the border into Thailand. Rockoff's pictures show his
colleagues walking toward the embassy as hundreds of Khmer Rouge
soldiers continue to file past them into the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed, Rockoff chronicled the scenes inside
the embassy, but he also spent considerable energy concealing his
film, hiding it in the dry tank of a toilet and then, during the
truck ride to Thailand, taping it to the inside of his leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had destroyed my film it would all have been for
nothing,'' he said. Apart from death, he said, ``that was another
fear I had, that I'd get out alive and have nothing to show for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, 25 years later, he is just beginning to show what he
has to show for it: the images of impending horror that he has
lived with and dreamed of and spent hours alone studying in his
darkroom.
</P>
<P>
   Today Rockoff lives what he describes as a minimal life in
Florida, using a bicycle rather than a car and living mostly off
his benefits as a wounded former Army photographer in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He denies that he is obsessed with Cambodia and the trauma that
he witnessed and shared. But he is quite happy to describe himself
as suffering from what he calls PTSD _ post-traumatic stress
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've got it,'' he said. ``But how you handle it defines
whether you've got PTSD For what I've got, I'm normal.''
</P>
<P>
   As proof, he said, ``I'm not so PTSD'd that I can't live in
America. I still spend half the year there. This is my other life.
I'm glad that I could come back here all these years. I consider
myself having a reason to be here: taking pictures for my book.''

INTERNET PHONES STARTING TO GO MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shortly after moving from Albuquerque, N.M., to
Portland, Ore., last year, Peter Boghossian discovered he could
keep in touch with friends and family around the country by placing
telephone calls over the Internet. Since then, he has not paid a
cent for long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Like millions of others, Boghossian plugged into a fast-growing
craze for Internet-based voice communication. Thanks to
improvements in technology and the growth of services from roughly
two dozen companies offering long-distance calls over the Web _
free or substantially cheaper than otherwise available _ many
consumers are slashing their telephone bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you pay one penny for something when you can get it
for free?'' asked Boghossian, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Quality still has a way to go, with the best conversations
resembling a choppy cell-phone call and the worst a wobbly
walkie-talkie transmission. But much of the growing interest in
so-called Internet telephony has to do with its relative
simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Most users need only an Internet hookup and headphones and a
microphone, plugged into a computer. Then, after shopping around
with companies providing Internet telephone service, one can start
placing domestic and international calls to people with any kind of
phone.
</P>
<P>
   According to an estimate from Jeff Pulver, an independent
analyst of the Web-based voice communication industry, roughly 15
million people in the United States use voice communication over
the Internet, compared with 5 million a year ago. In addition,
there are several million users abroad, where the popularity of
services allowing people to call the United States has spread.
</P>
<P>
   Counting on rapid growth rates, the combined revenue of Web talk
providers is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 200
percent a year over the next several years, from $208 million in
2000 to $16.5 billion by 2004, according to the International Data
Corp., a research firm in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an outside observer, I'm supposed to have a jaded view of
this new whiz-bang stuff,'' said Mark Winther, vice president of
telecommunications research at International Data. ``But the
brilliance of voice communications on the Internet is in the
merging of the Internet's power with the ease of use of the
telephone. It's a no-brainer that this industry will take off.''
</P>
<P>
   One company, Dialpad.com of Menlo Park, Calif., exemplifies the
industry's expansion. Using technology developed by a team of
Korean engineers that facilitates the transmission of voice calls
over the Internet, the company offers free service to any number in
the United States from anywhere in the world. Such calls might cost
5 to 25 cents a minute through a conventional long-distance carrier
and as much as $1.25 a minute if calling from, say, Brazil. (The
calls are not altogether free, since they require dialing a local
access number, for which the local phone company collects either a
flat or per-minute charge for a local call.)
</P>
<P>
   Dialpad claims to have signed up 7.5 million users in the last
seven and a half months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've grown grass-roots style through viral marketing,'' said
Peter Hewitt, Dialpad's vice president of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, this means that users of Dialpad's technology
informed others about it by communicating over their system or
through word of mouth, much the way free e-mail addresses on
services like Microsoft's Hotmail began to spread several years
ago. Analysts say Dialpad's growth has been much quicker than its
free e-mail counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dialpad is probably the fastest-growing Internet service
ever,'' Winther said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other Internet startups, Dialpad loses money, though
it does not disclose how much because it is privately held.
Instead, the company prefers to emphasize its growth indicators,
like the doubling of its work force in a year to 40 from 20.
Eventually, Dialpad hopes to become profitable through the sale of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``When harnessing change-the-world technology with such growth
rates, you can be assured real estate on your site will get quite
valuable,'' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, like Net2Phone Inc. of Hackensack, N.J., offer
long-distance calling all over the world, but charge a fee. A call
anywhere in the United States costs 3.9 cents a minute. A call to
the Netherlands from the United States costs 5 cents a minute,
compared with $1.25 to $2.05 a minute using AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While companies like Dialpad have made it simpler to place
long-distance calls over the Internet by discarding cumbersome
credit card registrations, the underlying technology is not so
simple, explaining in part the current limitations of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Transmissions of information online, like e-mail, other written
data, or even voice and video, are generally sent in small packets
of information over the World Wide Web. When a real-time exchange
of information is not necessary, as is the case in most e-mail
exchanges, a small delay in the delivery of the packets is not that
important. But in real-time voice conversations, these delays can
make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   When taken together with an Internet connection of dubious
quality, an Internet voice call can become dicey. Often, if voice
packets are delayed beyond a given threshold, software programs
will guess at the packets' content and transmit a distorted version
of what was said.
</P>
<P>
   While the effect can be disconcerting _ like having a discussion
next to a windswept thoroughfare _ companies are working to improve
the technology. In the meantime, the best way for individuals to
guarantee a good voice call over the Web is to attain a quality
Internet connection, with a high-speed telephone line, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its limitations, the growth of Internet telephony has
caught the attention of large telecommunications companies. This is
no wonder, given even conservative estimates that the nascent
industry, which first showed promise after growing in popularity
among hard-pressed graduate students in the mid-1990s, will account
for at least 15 percent of long-distance traffic in the United
States in five years, up from roughly 1 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, for instance, Deutsche Telekom has introduced
Web-based voice communication services in an effort to capture part
of the market. And in the United States, AT&AMP;T, after unveiling its
own Web-based voice products, led a group that plans to invest $1.4
billion in Net2Phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that Internet telephony has evolved from a geeky,
hobbyist thing into something we want included in our array of
offerings,'' said Glenn Edens, president of AT&AMP;T strategic
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is bullish on the prospects for the Internet-based
voice communication industry. Skeptics point to the telephone's
convenience and the trend of ever more competitive prices for
traditional telecommunications services, regardless of Internet
telephony's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt that Internet telephony is a cheapo substitute,
but a telephone is more convenient and getting cheaper,'' said
Amanda McCarthy, a telecommunications analyst at Forrester Research
in Cambridge, Mass. ``Plus, what type of advertising are you going
to want to sell for people who are such penny-pinchers?''
</P>
<P>
   Another concern for the budding industry is the looming
possibility of taxation. Traditional telecommunications companies
have lobbied to make Internet telephony companies subject to the
same treatment as other communications firms, including taxes and
fees paid to the local phone companies that complete the calls.
(Such fees are already assessed by carriers in some foreign
countries on calls placed over the Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of this proposal, though, assert that potential
investors would be scared away and that the creative capacity of
the industry to hone its technology would be stifled if taxes were
introduced. So far, the Federal Communications Commission has been
reticent to introduce any taxes, fees or other regulatory measures.
</P>
<P>
   But it could only be a matter of time before these issues come
to a head if more consumers make long-distance voice calls over the
Internet and prices for conventional services fall further as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either prices go down and the current regulatory system is
discarded or you start to regulate the Internet,'' said Nicholas
Economides, an economics professor at New York University whose
specialty is telecommunications networks. ``Clearly, for now, the
first choice is better for consumers.''

passengers, most of them young, most of them black. Billy Wimsatt
was white. It was an audience that made him especially comfortable.

   He held aloft a slender book. ``I wrote this book,'' he said

figure in the hip-hop world, a white man with unusual credibility
among blacks deeply protective of their culture. He was an

getting whites and people of other races to talk together and work
together. He spent most of his time on the road, on a yearlong tour
of several dozen college campuses, preaching his message. Now the
bus was taking him to Earlham College in eastern Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Some passengers gave grudging looks of curiosity. What gives
with this guy? Six people beckoned for copies. One woman gave hers
back after 15 minutes, opting for sleep. A man behind her bought
one. A woman said she'd take one, too. ``Cool,'' Wimsatt said. He
gave her a big smile and a hug.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wimsatt was 27, still clinging to the hip-hop life. He
didn't look terribly hip-hop, and not because he was white. He was
balding and brainy-looking, with an average build and an exuberant
nature.
</P>
<P>
   He was born as rap music was being invented by blacks and
Latinos in the South Bronx. What began as party music became their
cry of ghetto pain and ultimately their great hope for a way out.
And as hip-hop _ not just rap music but fashion, break-dancing,
graffiti and the magazines that chronicle it all _ blossomed into
the radiant center of youth culture, Billy Wimsatt and lots of
white kids found in it a way to flee their own orderly world by
discovering a sexier, more provocative one.
</P>
<P>
   Like many young hip-hop heads, he regarded hip-hop, with its
appeal to whites and blacks, as a bold modern hope to ease some of
the abrasiveness between the races. Hip-hop, as he saw it, endowed
him with cultural elasticity, allowed him to shed the privilege of
whiteness, to be as down with blacks as with whites. For a long
time, he felt black in every respect but skin color, he says, which
was why he had been able to get away with that much-noticed article
seven years ago in The Source, a magazine considered one of the
bibles of hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   It was a withering critique of ``wiggers,'' whites who try too
hard to be black so they will be accepted. Soon, he argued, ``the
rap audience may be as white as tables in a jazz club.'' In the
last paragraph, which The Source cut from the final version, he
warned black artists that the next time they invented something,
they had better find a way to control it financially, because
whites were going to steal hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``And since it's the '90s,'' he concluded, ``you won't even get
to hear us say, `Thanks, niggers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Billy Wimsatt seemed about as authentically hip-hop as a
white guy could get. But as he slid into the complexities of
adulthood, he said, he often found himself wondering if that was
enough, unsure which culture was truly his. He had drifted a long
way from his black hip-hop roots. Now, on these unsettled grounds,
he was far from certain he could stay true to his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   A BELIEVER ON THE BRINK
</P>
<P>
   On a clangorous Manhattan sidewalk, Elliott Wilson stopped to
study the bootleg rap tapes splayed on a street vendor's blanket.
Music emanated from a portable stereo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some dope stuff here,'' Wilson, a gangly, light-skinned young
black man with inquisitive eyes and a contagious laugh, said
approvingly. The bargains got him pumped up. He peeled off a $5
bill and bought ``Opposite of H2O'' by Drag-On.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Wilson had never met Billy Wimsatt, but their lives had
traced similar trajectories across the hip-hop landscape. As a
writer and editor, he too had spent much of his adult life thinking
about hip-hop. And not just hip-hop, but race and hip-hop. Race was
unavoidable in hip-hop _ what with all those black rappers idolized
by white teen-agers _ and like Billy Wimsatt, Elliott Wilson was
preoccupied with that conjunction and what it meant in his own
life.
</P>
<P>
   Which culture was his was not Elliott Wilson's worry. Hip-hop
had inspired him to believe that, precisely because he was black,
he could achieve what whites simply assumed was theirs by
birthright _ a gainful life over which he asserted control.
</P>
<P>
   When he read Wimsatt's ``wigger'' article, he and a black friend
were beginning their own hip-hop publication, Ego Trip. They saw it
as a brash challenge to the established, white-owned magazines like
The Source. Bubbling with assurance, Wilson had judged the
``wigger'' article amusing; for all its ridicule of whites, he had
still considered it ``a white boy's perspective on hip-hop.'' He
certainly hadn't seen it as a prophecy of personal doom.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he sometimes had to wonder. He was closing in on 30, trying
to hold fast to his own idea of the hip-hop life. He had watched
with anger and growing pessimism as Ego Trip folded and whites
asserted ever-greater control over the hip-hop industry. Recently,
he had become editor of a promising hip-hop magazine, XXL. It was
white-owned. And so he wondered if he was selling out, if he would
ever become what he wanted on his own terms. Was hip-hop his story,
the black man's story, after all? Did hip-hop unite the races or
push them further apart?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A WHITE BOY CONFINED IN HIS SKIN
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Chicago, Billy Wimsatt remembers, he believed the
only way he could have a good life was to be black.
</P>
<P>
   His own life felt proscribed. He was an only child. There was
rarely music in the house, just the droning news stations. He saw
an awful lot of ``Nova'' on PBS. He was to avoid the unsavory black
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he recalls, black children seemed to roam freely. They
seemed to grow up faster. In fourth grade, his teacher asked if
anyone baby-sat. A black girl's hand shot up. Incredible. Black
girls were mature enough to baby-sit. He longed to live in the
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Where he lived was the integrated neighborhood of Hyde Park, in
a perfectly diverse six-flat: two white families, two black, two
mixed. His father taught philosophy of science at the University of
Chicago. His mother was sort of a perpetual student.
</P>
<P>
   At his mostly white private school, he was not especially
popular. He imagined becoming a computer programmer, a scientist,
an astronaut. Then, in sixth grade, a black kid told him to listen
to a rap song, ``Jam On It.'' ``It was like a message from another
world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, he disconnected from a white culture that he
equated with false desires. He had jumped out of his container, he
said, ``like spilled milk.'' After sixth grade, he persuaded his
parents to transfer him to a largely black public school. The cool
kids, he noticed, wore fat sneaker laces, favored gold jewelry, did
graffiti. He began shoplifting fat laces, fake gold jewelry and
markers and selling them to hip-hop heads.
</P>
<P>
   He started break-dancing on the streets. And at 13, he began
sneaking out at night and riding the trains with black and Latino
friends, bombing the city with spray paint. Upski was his chosen
tag. From then on, little Billy Wimsatt became Upski, one of
Chicago's most prolific graffiti artists.
</P>
<P>
   His frazzled mother, dogged by insomnia, would discover him gone
at 2 a.m. She barred his graffiti crew from the house (one of them
even burglarized the place), sent him to a psychiatrist, threatened
military school. When he persisted, his parents plunked him back in
private school. But he barely associated with white classmates, he
says. Hip-hop had cloaked him in a new identity.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, and much to the dismay of many older people who
abhorred its defiant attitude, its frequent misogyny, violence and
vulgarity, hip-hop culture was becoming a great sugar rush for
young people of all races. Before long, rap would eclipse country
and rock to become America's top-selling pop-music format. And
whites would be the ones buying most of those rap albums _ a full
70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For many, even most, young whites, hip-hop was ultimately a
hobby, to be grown out of in good time. For Upski, it became a
cause, especially as the late '80s gave rise to politically
conscious rappers like Public Enemy, with its peppery blend of
black nationalism and rebellion. ``Once it became a pretty full
critique of American life _ race, politics and political hypocrisy
_ that's when it really registered with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A BLACK `LEADER OF THE NERDS'
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Wilson grew up in the Woodside Houses project in Queens,
New York City, the oldest of three brothers. His mother was of
Greek and Ecuadorean roots; his father, a printer from Georgia, was
black. Elliott was very light-skinned, and his hair was different
from the black kids'. When it came to skin color, he picked up some
mixed messages.
</P>
<P>
   He was 5 when his father told him: ``You're going to be judged
by who your father is. I'm black. So you're black. Accept it before
you get hurt.'' And he did, he said: ``I felt like the black man
from the jump.''
</P>
<P>
   He also spent a lot of time with his father's mother. She was
tough, and she had friends of all races. She called white people
crackers, but told Elliott, ``Never trust a black person darker
than you.''
</P>
<P>
   Attending predominantly white schools, self-conscious about his
looks, he never really fit in, he says, recalling that time now.
The black and white students didn't mix much, and while the black
football players were cool, he was no football player. Instead, he
befriended the outcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a cool kid and I wasn't,'' he said. ``But I
didn't want to sacrifice who I was to fit into the system. I'd
rather create my own system. I wasn't going to be a fake. So I was
the leader of the nerds.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents sheltered him from the influence of the streets. He
watched a lot of television. He loved ``Happy Days'' and ``Good
Times,'' admired Howard Cosell and imagined becoming a
sportscaster. In high school, he says, he increasingly felt himself
an outsider. His grades, always good, fell.
</P>
<P>
   But there was hip-hop. Hip-hop was cool, and his growing love of
it made him begin to feel cool. His parents bought him a set of
Technics 1200 turntables and a mixer. On weekend nights, while
classmates were out on dates, he would be home taping the hip-hop
shows off the radio.
</P>
<P>
   When he listened to Public Enemy, he began to shake his head
knowingly. For young Elliott Wilson, unaware of so much, the
group's powerful lyrics of oppression and rage, especially the
album ``It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back,'' were an
awakening to what it meant to be black in America. He got a Public
Enemy jacket, with the group's logo on the back: a black man in the
cross hairs of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   He became more aloof. He no longer said hello to white people,
even family friends, unless they greeted him first, he now says.
They asked his parents, What's gotten into Elliott?
</P>
<P>
   He went to La Guardia Community College _ in part because Run of
Run-DMC had gone there to major in mortuary science _ and then to
Queens College. He began writing for hip-hop publications. One day
first semester, he had an interview with Kool G. Rap. School felt
irrelevant. He walked out of class and never returned. He entrusted
his fate to hip-hop, and hip-hop breathed possibility into his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I came out of school without hip-hop, I wouldn't have
thought of owning my own business and having power,'' he said. ``As
a person of color, to be legit, you think you have to be a worker
for someone. Hip-hop made me believe.''
</P>
<P>
   But hip-hop was full of bizarre crosscurrents. When he saw white
kids simulating his behavior, he got annoyed. It was one thing if
they had grown up in the culture. But those well-to-do young whites
who tried to appropriate hip-hop for themselves, he says, were
simply insecure ``image chameleons.''
</P>
<P>
   Right here was the enigma of hip-hop: The black rappers
certainly weren't preaching integration, inviting whites into their
homes. They were telling their often dismal stories, the
pathologies they felt had been visited on them by a racist system
they yearned to escape. But so many white kids were turning that on
its head. They wanted to live life large, the way the rappers did.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A REASON FOR RHYMES
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang. Dog got it: ``He here. We here. I'll hit you
back later. You gonna be in the crib?''
</P>
<P>
   It was afternoon. Like a lot of aspiring rappers, Dog and his
friend Trife were living life small, passing time in Dog's
rampantly messy apartment in Brooklyn's Clinton Hill section.
Passing time was what they did most days. They played games,
gossiped, drank Hennessy, chewed over the future. Weekends, they
went bowling. They were 23, young black men seeking sanctuary from
the streets by rhyming their lives.
</P>
<P>
   With their friends Po and Sinbo, they had formed a rap group,
Wanted and Respected. Dog's closet was stuffed with recording
equipment; his specialty was creating the beats. He made some slim
money doing tapes for kids with their own rap dreams ($100 a tape)
and selling shirts on the street. The group had played a few clubs,
always gratis. Others shuttled in and out, but life weighed on the
composition: members kept getting jailed, and one had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Dog and Trife had followed a trajectory of intense poverty and
outlaw life. Dog's grandmother basically raised him _ a dozen
relatives packed into a three-bedroom place. Trife grew up with his
mother, an R &AMP; B singer, and seven others in the nearby projects;
he still lived there with her.
</P>
<P>
   They had belonged to a gang called the Raiders, they said,
selling drugs and doing other things that landed them in prison. If
a white person came into their neighborhood, they said, they robbed
him. They all packed guns. ``It was bad as Beirut,'' Dog said.
Trife said he still sold drugs, and some of the others did dubious
things.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, they gravitated to rap, embracing it the way so
many poor blacks have long embraced basketball. But it was better.
There were more slots. And it seemed to demand less talent. ``You
don't even have to sing well,'' Dog said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is my sanity,'' Trife said. ``If I wasn't doing this,
I'd probably be doing 25 to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dog laughed. ``If it weren't for rap, I'd be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Many older blacks felt rap denigrated their race. They hated the
constant use of ``nigga'' in the songs. Dog and Trife shrugged this
off. Rap was raw and ugly, but this was their lives. Rap was a
blunter truth.
</P>
<P>
   Dog found it curious that whites _ suburban mall rats, college
backpackers _ bought most rap records. ``White people can listen to
rap, but I know they can't relate,'' he said. ``I hear rap and I'm
saying, `Here's another guy who's had it unfair.' They're taking,
`This guy is cool, he's a drug dealer, he's got all the girls, he's
a big person, he killed people.' That is moronic.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Dog said: ``Hip-hop is bringing the races together, but
on false pretenses to make money. Look at Trife. He's got two
felonies. That means he's finished in society. But he can rap. His
two felonies, in rap, man, that's a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's messed up,'' Trife said. ``In hip-hop, I'm valid when I'm
disrespected.''
</P>
<P>
   Trife recited some lyrics he had written:
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't walk in my shoes,
</P>
<P>
   If you ain't lived my life.
</P>
<P>
   Hustling all day, clapping out all night.''
</P>
<P>
   THE COOL RICH KIDS' MOVEMENT
</P>
<P>
   The road to Earlham was speckled with billboards for Tom Raper
RVs, the Midwest's largest RV dealer. The trees were sheathed in
glass from the freezing rain.
</P>
<P>
   Earlham, a small Quaker college, was predominantly white,
marginally into hip-hop. Upski was to give a talk, accompanied by a
hip-hop group, Rubberoom.
</P>
<P>
   Upski had dropped out of Oberlin College in his junior year. He
had only reluctantly gone to college at all. He spent more time
doing graffiti and reading magazines than going to class. He wrote
an anonymous column for the black paper that scathingly denounced
white people. He had a hip-hop radio show: ``Yo, this is live from
Chicago.'' Many people thought he was black.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he says, he was sporadically queasy about his hip-hop
moorings. He knew his infatuation with blacks could be taken
different ways. He could be accepted as credible, or taken as
exploitative.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the great fear of blacks,'' he said. `` `Oh, you'll be
fascinated with us, and then go back to dominating us and you'll be
better at it because you'll have inside information.''' When he had
shown drafts of his writings about race to a black classmate at
Oberlin, she had slipped them back under his door and stopped
talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   He committed himself to journalism and activism. As he put it,
``I saw it as my job to get white people to talk about race.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a year after his influential ``wigger'' article, he
self-published ``Bomb the Suburbs'' _ part memoir of a white man's
life in hip-hop, part interviews with hip-hop figures, part
treatise on race and social change. It sold an impressive 23,000
copies. The gangsta rapper Tupac Shakur declared it ``the best book
I read in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Upski hitchhiked around the country, promoting the book, pushing
his views on racial cohesion, further cementing his eccentric
renown. ``I thought white people would start listening to and
liking black people,'' he said, but ultimately, he was discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   He refocused. He would become a social-change agent, motivating
whites to be activists. Last fall, he published ``No More Prisons''
and began the ``Cool Rich Kids' Movement.'' He would coax cool rich
kids to give money to the cause. He started the Active Element
Foundation and, with an ally, a well-to-do white woman, also
started a group, Reciprocity, that paid him a modest salary. This
year, he began his college tour.
</P>
<P>
   At Earlham, before a mostly white audience, Upski said: ``The
thing that drives me is getting to know people and making
relationships across race and class, which doesn't happen so much
in America. Some of the stuff I'm going to say is going to sound
heavy, and you're going to say, `Let me go smoke some weed and
chill.'''
</P>
<P>
   He bounced around the room, his manner that of the motivational
speaker. He said: ``My goal today is to encourage you to accept the
best and worst things about yourself.'' He talked about how they
were too comfortable in this school, and how he had been ``saved''
by transferring to a black school after sixth grade. And then
Rubberoom performed, and a lot of people left and the remaining
ones danced. Upski danced.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Upski had brought along a copy of Stress, a small hip-hop
magazine published by people of color. Upski told the students to
read this, not the white-owned magazines.
</P>
<P>
   He used to write for XXL, a fledgling magazine with a white
owner and publisher. In 1997, the original black editor and black
staff quit after being refused an ownership stake. There were
innuendos of racism, but whether it was just business or race
depended on the vantage point. Upski, however, swore never to work
for XXL again.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there were always ways for a smart white guy to make
money.
</P>
<P>
   AGONIZING AT THE MONKEY ACADEMY
</P>
<P>
   When the editor's job at XXL was offered to him last August,
Elliott Wilson was put in a delicate spot. He was broke. In
college, he accepted a flurry of credit cards and bought all the
``fly'' clothing. Now he owed $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers thinking about how blacks needed to think more like
whites. ``We have a short expectancy in life,'' he said. ``So we go
for the quick buck. That's why kids sell drugs. That's why they
rob. We don't feel we can be on a five-year plan to success.''
</P>
<P>
   The XXL job came with excellent pay _ low six figures. But talk
of racial tension stained the place. He asked himself, he said:
Would blacks think he was selling out? First, he had to discuss it
with the Ego Trip collective. He went over to the Monkey Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Two rooms in a basement in Manhattan's Chelsea section, the
Monkey Academy was a shrine to hip-hop. Roosting on a shelf was a
``Talking Master P'' doll (``Make 'em say uhhh'') and a memento
from Puff Daddy's 1998 birthday gala. Rap posters adorned the wall:
Snoop Doggy Dogg, RZA, Jungle Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Ego Trip was five young men of color with ambitions of hip-hop
entrepreneurship: Wilson, Sacha Jenkins, Jeff Mao, Gabriel Alvarez
and Brent Rollins. They saw race as a depressive undercurrent to
everything, and it was the focus of their scabrous humor. ``We're
always talking about the blacks and the whites,'' Wilson said.
``That's the way me and my boys are.''
</P>
<P>
   The very name Monkey Academy reflected their saucy attitude. As
Jenkins explained it: ``Call me paranoid, but when I meet with
white people, I feel that with their eyes they're calling me
monkey. So why not wear that proudly? Everyone in hip-hop wants to
use the N-word, so why not take it to the next level? Call us
monkeys.'' They especially liked to trace their understanding of
society to the ``Planet of the Apes'' movies, where the
light-skinned orangutans controlled the dark gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the group published Ego Trip, which they saw
as a magazine about race disguised as a hip-hop magazine. They
invented a white owner, one Theodore Aloysius Bawno, who offered a
message in each issue, blurting his bigoted views and lust for
Angie Dickinson. His son, Galen, was a Princeton-educated liberal
who professed common cause with blacks. But in truth, he was an
unaware bigot, as Wilson says he feels so many young whites are.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the hip-hop ruling class was white. As Wilson put it,
Ego Trip wanted ``to strike at all the black magazines that are
white-owned and act as if they're black.'' It was a small irony
that Ego Trip's seed money of $8,000 came from a white man, but at
least he was a passive partner.
</P>
<P>
   Though it gained a faithful following, Ego Trip stayed
financially wobbly. No new investors came forth; the collective
suspected the reluctance had to do with skin color. Ego Trip gasped
and expired.
</P>
<P>
   Now its founders scrambled with day jobs and worked on projects
like ``Ego Trip's Book of Rap Lists'' and a companion album.
Hip-hop Web sites were proliferating, and they hoped to start one,
too. They said they wanted to hear the roar of money, on their
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black people create, but we don't reap the benefits,'' Wilson
said. ``We get punked and pimped. If we were white boys, we'd all
be rich by now.''
</P>
<P>
   On that August day, he recalls, he sat on the couch, his
emotions in an uproar. He had to wonder: was he now going to work
for a true-life Ted Bawno? The others, he says, expressed a dim
view of the XXL offer: ``They were feeling I was pimping.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long before, he had been music editor of The Source. One
duty was to rate new albums, on a scale of one to five
``microphones.'' When he gave three microphones to ``Corruption''
by Corrupt, he says, the white publisher, David Mays, increased it
to three and a half without telling him. When he confronted Mays,
he concluded that the publisher did not respect him. Mays wouldn't
give his side, but as Wilson tells it, he quit over half a
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   He felt strongly, he recalls, that he had to help himself. He no
longer saw hip-hop as a great equalizer. ``Who because of hip-hop
now believes, `I've seen the light, I'm going to save the
blacks'?'' he would say.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there was something positive in white kids' idolizing
black rappers, but ``what's going to happen when these white kids
lose their little hip-hop jones and go work for Merrill Lynch?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   What should he do? Months later, he remembers the confusion, the
vectors of his life colliding. His throat tightened and he began to
cry. He went to the bathroom of the Monkey Academy and composed
himself. The message left hanging in the air from the others was,
Do what you got to do.
</P>
<P>
   As a black man, how many opportunities would come his way? He
had this unslaked desire to prove his mettle. He took the job.
</P>
<P>
   TAPPING THE UNCONSCIOUS BIASES
</P>
<P>
   Upski went to the laundromat. Shaking in detergent, he talked
about how he was a bundle of contradictions, subject to irrational
racist phantasms for which he had no cogent defense. ``I have
patterns like every other white guy that I'm not very aware of that
play out as racist,'' he admitted. He laughed at racist jokes.
Walking down the street at night, he felt threatened if he saw a
shabbily dressed black man. ``I frequently feel I have more of a
level of comfort and trust with white people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He talked differently to black friends (``Yo. . . That's wack. .
. Peace, brother.''). It infuriated his white girlfriend, Gita
Drury. ``I'll say to him, `Do you know you're talking black now?
Can you talk white, because that's what you are,''' she said. ``I
think it's patronizing.'' When he got on the phone, she could
detect at once the caller's race. When he talked black, she would
wave a sign at him: ``Why are you talking like that?''
</P>
<P>
   She saw this episodic behavior in other ways: ``If we walk down
the street and a black person walks by, he will give this nod,
raise his chin a bit. He wouldn't do it with a white guy. I'll say,
`Oh, you have to prove to a black person that you're down.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Upski recalled, he spoke about race at a prominent
college along with a black friend. He was paid twice as much as his
friend. He spoke longer, but not twice as long. He never told his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he said, he believed that black people were dumber
than whites. Sometimes he felt the opposite. Now, as the washers
ended their cycles, he hauled the wet clothes to the dryers. A
stout black woman stood beside an empty cart. He asked if she was
using it. She stared at him, bewildered. He asked again. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, he simply grabbed the cart and heaped it with his
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, he said: ``When that happened, part of my gut reaction
was, `This is a black woman who has limited brain capacity, and it
fits my stereotype of blacks having less cognitive intelligence.'''
</P>
<P>
   Would a white woman have understood?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous for me to even say that,'' he said. ``But
that's what I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   EMBARRASSED BY RAP'S `BABIES'
</P>
<P>
   The strip club was scattered with patrons with embalmed looks,
solemnly quaffing their beverages. Elliott Wilson pulled up a stool
beside a dancer. A fistful of dollars flapped from a rubber band
curled around her wrist, the night's rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Strip clubs, in particular this one in Queens, had a powerful
hold on him. Though rap was his music, he said, he liked to unwind
here rather than at a hip-hop club. There, everyone wanted
something. Here, no one wanted anything but his money. ``I'm not
caught up in me and Puffy having each other's cell phone numbers,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had conflicted feelings about rap and rappers. ``A lot of
rappers rap about sex and violence, because people are interested
in it,'' he said. ``But it's art. It's poetry. If a rapper says,
`Kill your mother' in a song, it doesn't mean kill your mother. You
can't take anything at face value.'' The real-life violence and
arrests of rappers were something else. ``Rappers are babies,'' he
said. ``They don't know how to balance their success and their
street life. When I hear about Jay-Z this and Puffy that, I'm
embarrassed to be part of the profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and his friend Gabe Alvarez shared an apartment in
Clinton Hill, next to Fort Greene, a gentrifying neighborhood
promoted by Spike Lee before he moved to the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it's good and part isn't,'' Alvarez said. ``You go a
block over and there're the drug dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the classic black neighborhood,'' Wilson said. ``The
liquor store, the bodega. I want good restaurants. I don't want to
live in the 'hood. Who wants to live in the 'hood?'' He wanted to
move to Park Slope.
</P>
<P>
   It was not his thing to go out of his way to patronize black
businesses. It was fruitless, he said. He had seen that so much in
hip-hop. ``There's always a white man somewhere making money,'' he
said. ``You can't avoid the white man. My going to a black barber
or something doesn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   UPSKI MEETS DOG AND TRIFE
</P>
<P>
   Upski had gone to get his hair cut at the black-owned Freakin U
Creations. He went only to black barbers, and part of his manifesto
was to direct at least half his money to minority stores. Fort
Greene afforded plenty of possibilities. All in all, though, he
found the neighborhood imperfect, already too gentrified. His
girlfriend lived there, so he did. He had lived in a black
neighborhood in Washington. He said he felt he belonged either in a
rich white neighborhood, where he could persuade residents to
integrate, or in the true 'hood, where he could organize. He mused
about moving to East New York.
</P>
<P>
   Upski chatted with one of the owners, Justice Cephas. Two young
black men waited their turn. Cephas was a hip-hop promoter on the
side and was working with their group. They were Dog and Trife.
</P>
<P>
   Upski said, ``Don't take anything off the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Dog studied Upski's pate and said, ``What's there to take off?''
</P>
<P>
   Upski laughed. He asked how they felt about whites' moving into
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, I would have beaten you up just for sitting in
that barber chair,'' Dog told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Upski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've matured,'' Dog said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, he talked about how he was still deeply bitter
toward white people. No white person had ever done anything
positive for him, he said. As he remarked of whites: ``I've never
been with you. Why would I want to be with you now?''
</P>
<P>
   Trife added, ``If you're not my people now, you're not my people
down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Dog and Trife had told Upski about their group, Wanted and
Respected. Trife's older brother had started a record label,
Trife-Life Records, and they were working on its first album. They
hoped to sell it on the street, create some buzz. All the while,
Trife said later, he was thinking, ``What is this white guy doing
in this barbershop?''
</P>
<P>
   Upski smiled. These young men, he said, reminded him of the
black friends he used to run with in Chicago. If he were younger,
he mused, he might want to run with them.
</P>
<P>
   THE BEATLES PARALLAX
</P>
<P>
   Inside Elliott Wilson's XXL cubicle was a computer, a stereo and
a table strewn with rap albums. The music was on _ loud.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes scanned the screen _ copy for the next issue. He
fiddled with it. ``I'm adding curse words,'' he said. ``Putting in
ain'ts. Making it more hip-hop.''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, Dennis Page, came in with his beneficent smile.
``Hey, man, we doing OK?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Page peeked over his shoulder at the screen. He nodded: ``That's
dope.''
</P>
<P>
   They went on like that, bantering.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson called his boss D.P.G. _ Dennis Page Gangsta, after Snoop
Doggy Dogg's crew, the Dogg Pound Gangstas. Wilson had given D.P.G.
an inscribed copy of ``Ego Trip's Book of Rap Lists.'' He wrote,
``I don't care what people say, I know your favorite color is
green.''
</P>
<P>
   It was how he felt about the relationship. They were both there
for the money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Page was 46. He had the black walk, the black talk. His
father had run a liquor store in Trenton, N.J., and Page had hung
around with black kids and absorbed their ways. Now, he says, he
has no real black friends. He admits he's been called a wigger. ``I
feel stigmatized by black people in hip-hop who feel I'm exploiting
them,'' he said. ``I don't feel I'm exploiting. It's a business.
The record companies are white-owned. But I feel I take more heat.
Certain black people feel that white people shouldn't even buy
hip-hop albums, no less write about it. I'm not saying a black man
can't buy a Beatles record.''
</P>
<P>
   XXL was just going monthly, and its circulation, which it gave
as 175,000, was still far below the leading magazines' _ Vibe sold
more than 700,000 copies, The Source 425,000. XXL had been heavily
political, clearly aimed at blacks. To build up the white audience,
Page and Wilson agreed to tone it down, focus it almost entirely on
the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``My magazine isn't some white-boy magazine, though,'' Wilson
said. ``It's black, too. I'm not sacrificing what XXL stands for.''
Even so, he added, ``it can't be totally black if a white man is
signing the check.''

WILLIAMSES BRING TOGETHERNESS TO A NEW LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ They spent Wednesday the way they like to spend all
their days: inseparably. There was a bonus, too: They got to be
partners on the tennis court, as they have been in life.
</P>
<P>
   In a doubles match, they teamed to defeat the legendary Martina
Navratilova and Mariaan de Swardt, 4-6, 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   There will be an interlude in the cherished routine thursday,
and its ripples will be felt throughout the tennis world, if not
the world in general. Venus and Serena Willams, America's two
prodigious, precocious tennis sisters, will oppose one another on
Centre Court in the women's semifinals of the sport's most
prestigious tournament, Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   They insist this is merely a temporary aberration, not a vise,
in their bond. Because they were placed in the same half of the
128-player field, Venus, who is ranked fifth in the world, and
Serena, who is No. 8, have known since the competition began last
week that this confrontation was possible. The way they've played _
Venus toppled the world's top-ranked woman, Martina Hingis, in the
quarterfinals Tuesday, and Serena has ripped through her matches
like a buzz saw, finishing off three opponents in less than an hour
apiece _ it became inevitable. But even though one will be
eliminated, they consider this a can't-lose proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to have that opportunity,'' Venus said early in the
tournament. ``At least one Williams would be in the final.''
</P>
<P>
   It will mark the first time since Wimbledon welcomed
professionals onto the grounds of the All England Lawn Tennis &AMP;
Croquet Club in 1968 that sisters have opposed one another in
singles, and only the third time ever: Maud Watson beat her sister
Lilian in the inaugural ladies' singles final in 1884, and Gail
Sherriff-Chanfreau defeated her sister Carol in the second round in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   But this transcends those encounters, which were prehistoric in
tennis terms because the game was strictly amateur then. The
Williams sisters _ Venus, at 20, is two years older and, at 6 feet
1 inch, 3 inches taller _ have been considered anomalies, and not
just because they are among only a handful of African-Americans
playing on the Women's Tennis Association Tour. They have taken
tennis by storm with sass, savvy, and a smashing style that
revolutionized the women's game, making power as invaluable as
finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they have faced numerous questions about racism,
which _ like everything else concerning these preternaturally
poised and polite sisters _ they handle in stride, thoughtfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been, what is it, not even a hundred years in
America since slavery has been gone,'' said Serena. ``So obviously,
there's still going to be people who have lived during that time
who still experience this, who (instilled) it in the next
generation, the next generation. It's something that's innate in
them that this color might be better than this color. Apparently,
there is still something out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But what sets them apart, what makes them lightning rods of
attention and occasional criticism, is that they were developed
almost as anti-tennis tennis players.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to determine where fact ends and myth begins,
but their father and coach, 58-year-old Richard Williams, claims
that he hid the birth control pills of his wife, Oracene,because he
wanted to add two more children to a clan that consisted of three
daughters, Lyndrea, Isha, and Yetunde. And these were not to be
just any two children: Richard wanted to breed champions. He
supposedly consulted tennis and fitness experts for advice on the
best methods to nurture his daughters athletically.
</P>
<P>
   First he took attitude into account. Richard, who says he owned
a small security firm in Los Angeles, raised his girls on the
crime- and poverty-infested LA outskirts of Compton because, he has
said, he wanted them to be mentally tough. Since his daughters have
become multimillionaires, he has instituted various youth programs
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses moved to Florida just before adolescence and now
live in palatial splendor in exclusive Palm Beach Gardens. But
despite spending their youth in the tennis hotbeds of Southern
California and Florida, they spurned the carnivorous junior
circuits, notorious for turning prodigies into problem children.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Richard was dismissed as just another
domineering tennis father when in fact he was the antithesis of the
stereotypical mentor/parent. He insisted that the girls maintain a
normal lifestyle, getting their high school diplomas, practicing
incessantly with one another while following his regime, and
bypassing the preteen tournaments that have been condemned for
devouring the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad is really a man that's really into education,'' said
Serena. ``He'd like to see us kids succeed in things off court
because sport can only last for so long. You never know what can
happen. One day you can be in a car accident, never be able to walk
again. What do you have to fall back on? He's really into that.
He's always preaching that to us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Venus, considered the more powerful of the two, who burst
onto the big-time scene first. Her peak so far has been reaching
the 1997 final of the US Open _ one of the four Grand Slam
tournaments, along with Wimbledon, the French Open, and the
Australian Open _ where she lost to Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   But Serena, considered the more athletic, has enjoyed more
tangible success since she joined Venus on the WTA circuit two
years ago. She won the US Open last year, beating Hingis in the
final after the Swiss star had beaten Venus in the semis.
</P>
<P>
   Nice symmetry. If one can't take care of something, the other
will. That is their philosophy, always sticking together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually on our days off (from tournaments), we train
together,'' said Serena. ``On our days off (during tournaments), we
usually are playing doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many days when they have not been together amid
charges that Richard manipulates their schedules to avoid
confrontations like Thursday's.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to think what they are going to think,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't kept them completely apart. They have met four
times as professionals. Venus won in the 1998 Australian Open
second round, the 1998 Italian Open quarterfinals, and the 1999
Lipton final at Key Biscayne, Fla. Serena prevailed in their most
recent engagement, the 1999 Grand Slam Cup final in Munich in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, those conflicts were conducted on a somewhat
different level than some of their childhood matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a problem with cheating when I was younger,'' said
Serena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Serena was a cheater,'' Venus concurred, laughing. ``I
just rolled with it. It's tough to argue against Serena because she
was so good at arguing, so good at cheating, it was no use.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's match will be on the up-and-up. And the stakes will
be the highest ever. So high that Richard _ making his first visit
here because Oracene is tired of the travel _ would just as soon
not watch ``unless they insist on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are the sisters will. After all, despite appearances,
this match is bringing them together, not tearing them apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most exciting,'' said Venus, ``is that we both are here.''
</P>
<P>
   And both trying mightily to win. It's what Hingis calls ``a
family matter.'' Nothing personal and everything personal at the
same time.

   `I PREACH TO MESS UP'
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday dawned muggy. It started badly and got worse. Upski was
addressing about 250 students at Evergreen College in Olympia,
Wash. Maybe 10 weren't white.
</P>
<P>
   He had gathered a panel of half a dozen students. One, Evelyn
Aako, was black. Introducing her, he said: ``I don't know her very
well, but she's black. And she's going to talk about issues of
being black on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Aako gave him an arch look. ``That was very weird,'' she
recalled thinking. ``Like I was a little dark object.''
</P>
<P>
   As Upski began talking, the white audience got defensive. One
student said: ``Why do we have to talk about race? Why can't we
talk about how we're alike?''
</P>
<P>
   Aako was getting disgusted. Finally she told Upski: ``I've been
sitting here with an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach about how
you introduced me. I felt tokenized and on display. This follows a
tradition where black people serve as entertainment for white
people. That's not what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Upski said: ``I screwed up. But what can we do? The world is
screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some white students were looking irritated. One said: ``Can't we
hear Upski talk? We can talk about race later.''
</P>
<P>
   A black student said: ``What do you mean later? We never talk
about race.''
</P>
<P>
   Some whites left. Virtually all the students of color followed.
Before leaving, Aako said, ``It's not my job to educate you.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Upski sounded no less confident of his ability to
stimulate change. But perhaps, he said, he needed to refine his
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main thing that keeps white people from growing is
they're afraid to look bad,'' he said. ``So I preach to mess up.
One of my blind spots at Evergreen was that Evelyn wasn't going to
trust me, that black people and white people, we're still at war.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, he said, he was questioning his own evolution.
Here he was intent on helping blacks, and spending most of his time
in white culture. He had had a string of black girlfriends, but now
he was with a white woman. A few years ago, probably two-thirds of
his friends were black and Latino. Now it had flip-flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop itself had moved away from political and racial talk and
for the most part sold excess and riches, women and violence. So
much of hip-hop, he said, was self-denigrating, imitative and
shallow. It was candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I have the least respect for about parts of
black culture,'' he said, ``is there's so much pain and insecurity
that it gets medicated by aping the worst aspects of white
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about how so many of his old black and Latino graffiti
friends hadn't survived hip-hop too well. One got locked up for
firebombing a car. Another fell from a fire escape while trying to
rob an apartment. He is now a paraplegic, drinking away his life,
Upski says.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Upski had to admit, he was cruising along. His
girlfriend, Drury, had inherited money, though they lived modestly.
He didn't earn a lot, but he didn't worry. Until recently, he never
took cabs and rarely ate out; he called it flaunting privilege. But
now he was traveling more in white circles where everyone took cabs
and ate out. So he did, too. And, he acknowledged, he liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part of Billy that wanted to be black for a good part of
his youth, that's fading,'' Drury said. ``One of the issues in our
relationship is he's a chameleon. The thing with Billy, he wants to
be liked.''
</P>
<P>
   He had always cared so much about how he looked through black
eyes, he said. Now his success depended on how he looked through
white eyes. He had always dressed poorly and now he owned three
suits. Where was he going? As you got older, he reflected, holding
onto your hip-hop values was a lot harder if you were white.
</P>
<P>
   TRAPS AND TRAPPINGS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Wilson climbed the stairs to the basketball court. The
old guys were already there. The doctor had told him he had high
blood pressure, a real slap in the face. ``I've got the black man's
disease,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew the factors, but he had never eaten properly. He was
also feeling the pressure of his job, he said. A friend who had
been editor of The Source said the same thing had happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor put him on medication, urged exercise. So he had
begun playing full-court basketball three mornings a week. There
was an early crowd of young guys, but Wilson wasn't ready for them.
He played with a bunch of white guys, some in their 50s and 60s,
and one black guy in his 70s. He hit some baskets and missed some.
He changed and headed for XXL.
</P>
<P>
   He had now edited four issues. The first one, with DMX on the
cover, had outsold any previous issue. He felt he was making a
mark, he said. He had his disputes with Dennis Page, but they got
along. His Ego Trip comrades felt proud of him.
</P>
<P>
   He was making such good money, more than three times what Upski
made, but somehow, he said, that wasn't the point. What he really
wanted was to ``take The Source out in a year or two,'' then expand
the reaches of Ego Trip. Still, there were always seeds of
self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel secure?'' he said. ``No. Because I'm black and I
have bad credit. Having bad credit in this country is like being a
convict. You don't have a prosperity mind-set when you're a person
of color. You have something, you always feel someone is going to
take it. You're always on edge, wondering what next.''
</P>
<P>
   `I JUST WANT THE MONEY'
</P>
<P>
   Dog twirled the dials and gave Trife the signal to start. In the
tiny apartment, Dog and Trife and Sinbo and Po were rehearsing for
their album, the one they believed would be destiny's next chosen
one.
</P>
<P>
   Scrizz, Trife's brother and the CEO of Trife-Life Records, was
listening like a jittery father. With no product yet, Trife-Life
was not a paying job for him. His background, like that of the
others, was drugs and crime. At the moment, he was out on bail
while fighting an assault charge.
</P>
<P>
   Wanted and Respected started in on its song ``All the Time.''
Golden bars of light streaked through the windows. Scrizz tapped
his foot. He, too, had a got-to-happen mentality. He didn't much
care who bought the album, white or black, but he knew where the
money was. ``I just want them to eat it up,'' he said. ``I just
want the money.''
</P>
<P>
   It came down to that. A group of young black guys in Brooklyn
rhyming their lives, betting on a brighter tomorrow sponsored by
white kids' money.
</P>
<P>
   Dog turned up the music. They cleared their throats and kept
rapping.

NEW RICH SET DIFFERENT GOALS IN GIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   By REED ABELSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It isn't his father's philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   In Sioux Falls, S.D., where Scott Reardon grew up, giving meant
supporting the local United Way or leading a fund-raising drive for
a school in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But for Reardon, the president of the Dakon Group, a venture
capital firm in Sioux Falls that backs communications and
technology companies, the impulse to give is different. ``I don't
feel attached to the local community,'' said Reardon, who divides
his time between Sioux Falls and Darien, Conn. And he does not find
appealing what he described as ``write a check and walk away''
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware of his success in creating significant wealth for
himself, Reardon, 51, said that he was interested in seeing his
charity have a geographically wider impact, with the potential to
create greater changes. ``I ask myself, `Where can I make a
difference?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His current choice is the Deutsche Bank Microcredit Development
Fund, a program in which individual entrepreneurs, typically women,
are given loans, often just a few hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very primitive investment banking,'' said Reardon, who
serves as the fund's chairman and helps decide which local
organizations scattered around the world will receive money.
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a scattering of wealthy people whose
philanthropy is directed at sweeping change and who usually choose
to start a new charity, said Paul G. Schervish, director of the
Social Welfare Research Institute at Boston College, who helped
conduct a new study on wealth and philanthropy. But this kind of
giving is now spreading among the ranks of the wealthy, he said,
and not just the super rich, high-profile technology gurus like
Bill Gates or the many dot-commers making their fortunes from the
Internet. As they are more able to make substantial gifts, they are
increasingly interested in feeling that their charitable efforts
are creating results, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy ``don't want to be profligate in their charity,''
Schervish said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, affluent givers seem especially eager to have
a more direct role in making sure they can actually see results.
They also seem interested in carrying over to charity the
entrepreneurship that helped make them successful. And many want to
address the other side of the extraordinary wealth created in
recent years: the problems of poverty, hunger and the lack of
access to health care and housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a return to the Carnegie philosophy _ getting engaged
while you're alive,'' said Eugene R. Tempel, executive director of
the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy. Among the changes,
he added, is a shift away from gifts to established charities as
the public has become increasingly skeptical of these
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Today's philanthropists, many of whom do represent new wealth,
are particularly interested in fresh initiatives, Tempel added.
``It's just a generation trying to flex its muscles and do things
differently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent survey Schervish helped conduct, an anonymous study
of wealthy people by Deutsche Bank's Bankers Trust Private Banking
unit, whose clients provide some of the microcredit program's
financing, suggests that Reardon has plenty of company in his
desire to participate in a kind of charity he considers both
personal and effective, Schervish said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which was not limited to the company's clients,
probed the thinking of the very rich _ nearly all 112 respondents
were from households with a net worth of at least $5 million. The
findings of the survey, which has not yet been released, were made
available to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   While those surveyed are only a small sampling of the roughly
600,000 households in the United States whose wealth exceeds $5
million, Schervish said, their responses offer some insight into

   Like most Americans, they said they were convinced of the
importance of giving. The overwhelming majority describe themselves
as self-made, deriving some or all of their wealth through
entrepreneurial and professional efforts. On average, they gave to
charity $1.2 million, or about a fifth of their family income, in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The participants also favored giving through their own
foundation, trust or gift fund. Two-thirds reported using one of
these vehicles during the year.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that there are not many wealthy people who
view philanthropy primarily as a social milieu: sitting on the
board of an opera guild, say, with three dozen or so other
prominent figures. Many others prefer to limit their involvement to
signing checks or to making a donation that leads to a building at
a college or hospital sporting their name.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of people with money are increasingly interested in
taking a more active role in their charity.

   ``We don't tend to give to big institutions because they have
support,'' said Robert Arnow, whose family has long been active in
charity. Arnow, 75, is the semi-retired chairman of Weiler Arnow
Management, a New York real estate company. He and his wife, Joan,
are involved in a variety of causes, ranging from the arts to
after-school programs, but he has become most concerned over the

opportunities. The former chairman of Ben-Gurion University in
Israel, Arnow pushed for the establishment of the university's
Center for Bedouin Studies and Development. He is now considering
building an endowment for it.
</P>
<P>
   While Arnow works closely with the university and the center to
back initiatives like developing a special set of math and science
courses for Bedouin high school students, he is not operating
through an organized charity. ``It's one man's efforts,'' he
explained.

   Closer to home, Burton M. Freeman, 74, who retired two years ago
as a lawyer for Bankers Trust, is also taking a hands-on approach.
Through his family foundation, Freeman has started a program that
has allowed some 600 third-graders in East Harlem to each buy $50
worth of books. He accompanies the classes to the Bank Street
Bookstore, a children's bookstore near Columbia University. At one
such session, Freeman helped a little girl pick out a book on human
biology and then one on evolution featuring the Galapagos Islands.
``I get some real big thrills,'' he said. Freeman works with the
chancellor's office at the New York City Board of Education to
identify some third-grade classes and, through an associated
not-for-profit fund, to finance the program.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, education, which appears to be a perennial cause,
was cited by 60 percent of the respondents in the Bankers Trust
survey when they were asked which policy issues they wanted to
influence. Poverty, inequality, hunger, affordable housing and
health care for the uninsured were listed by nearly half. Arts and
culture was named by only a third, followed by family stability and
economic growth.

   While many entrepreneurs view their business activities as
accomplishing worthy social goals, according to Schervish, they
also seem to increasingly favor endeavors that blend aspects of

bureaucracies and harnesses the power of the marketplace to
accomplish social change.

his father's foundation, which finances a variety of local
initiatives, including a new diabetes center at
Columbia-Presbyterian, the younger Berrie wants to combine his
passion for doing good with his business. And he has taken an

coal mining in Czechoslovakia, for example, elected to spend her
50th birthday last year building a house in Jacksonville, Fla., for
Habitat for Humanity, the seventh such project she has done for the

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It isn't his father's philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   In Sioux Falls, S.D., where Scott Reardon grew up, giving meant
supporting the local United Way or leading a fund-raising drive for
a school in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But for Reardon, the president of the Dakon Group, a venture
capital firm in Sioux Falls that backs communications and
technology companies, the impulse to give is different. ``I don't
feel attached to the local community,'' said Reardon, who divides
his time between Sioux Falls and Darien, Conn. And he does not find
appealing what he described as ``write a check and walk away''
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware of his success in creating significant wealth for
himself, Reardon, 51, said that he was interested in seeing his
charity have a geographically wider impact, with the potential to
create greater changes. ``I ask myself, `Where can I make a
difference?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His current choice is the Deutsche Bank Microcredit Development
Fund, a program in which individual entrepreneurs, typically women,
are given loans, often just a few hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very primitive investment banking,'' said Reardon, who
serves as the fund's chairman and helps decide which local
organizations scattered around the world will receive money.
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a scattering of wealthy people whose
philanthropy is directed at sweeping change and who usually choose
to start a new charity, said Paul G. Schervish, director of the
Social Welfare Research Institute at Boston College, who helped
conduct a new study on wealth and philanthropy. But this kind of
giving is now spreading among the ranks of the wealthy, he said,
and not just the super rich, high-profile technology gurus like
Bill Gates or the many dot-commers making their fortunes from the
Internet. As they are more able to make substantial gifts, they are
increasingly interested in feeling that their charitable efforts
are creating results, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy ``don't want to be profligate in their charity,''
Schervish said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, affluent givers seem especially eager to have
a more direct role in making sure they can actually see results.
They also seem interested in carrying over to charity the
entrepreneurship that helped make them successful. And many want to
address the other side of the extraordinary wealth created in
recent years: the problems of poverty, hunger and the lack of
access to health care and housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a return to the Carnegie philosophy _ getting engaged
while you're alive,'' said Eugene R. Tempel, executive director of
the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy. Among the changes,
he added, is a shift away from gifts to established charities as
the public has become increasingly skeptical of these
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Today's philanthropists, many of whom do represent new wealth,
are particularly interested in fresh initiatives, Tempel added.
``It's just a generation trying to flex its muscles and do things
differently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent survey Schervish helped conduct, an anonymous study
of wealthy people by Deutsche Bank's Bankers Trust Private Banking
unit, whose clients provide some of the microcredit program's
financing, suggests that Reardon has plenty of company in his
desire to participate in a kind of charity he considers both
personal and effective, Schervish said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which was not limited to the company's clients,
probed the thinking of the very rich _ nearly all 112 respondents
were from households with a net worth of at least $5 million. The
findings of the survey, which has not yet been released, were made
available to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   While those surveyed are only a small sampling of the roughly
600,000 households in the United States whose wealth exceeds $5
million, Schervish said, their responses offer some insight into
the behavior of the very wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Americans, they said they were convinced of the
importance of giving. The overwhelming majority describe themselves
as self-made, deriving some or all of their wealth through
entrepreneurial and professional efforts. On average, they gave to
charity $1.2 million, or about a fifth of their family income, in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The participants also favored giving through their own
foundation, trust or gift fund. Two-thirds reported using one of
these vehicles during the year.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that there are not many wealthy people who
view philanthropy primarily as a social milieu: sitting on the
board of an opera guild, say, with three dozen or so other
prominent figures. Many others prefer to limit their involvement to
signing checks or to making a donation that leads to a building at
a college or hospital sporting their name.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: The other secret drug money

<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore, in Philadelphia today, challenged a drug
industry-backed group critical of his prescription drug plan. Make
public your secret donor list, he asked. ``The American people
deserve to know who exactly is trying to influence this critical
issue,'' Gore said in a letter to Citizens for Better Medicare.
Gore has clashed repeatedly with that group, which has been
attacking his proposal to expand Medicare by adding a prescription
drug benefit. Dan Zielinski, a spokesman for the group, said the
organization received Gore's letter today and is ``still in the
process of reviewing it.''
</P>
<P>
   TEACHERS' PET
</P>
<P>
   After months of supportive speeches, fat donation checks and
thousands of hours of volunteer campaign work, the two national
teachers' unions formally endorsed Al Gore in separate votes in
Philadelpia. The endorsements of the American Federation of
Teachers and National Education Association came as no surprise,
but could prove significant in a campaign in which both candidates
are making education a top priority. While Gore will try to use the
endorsements to show that his education agenda reflects the
opinions of classroom experts, his opponent, George W. Bush,
undoubtedly will accuse Gore of being in the unions' pockets and
uninterested in true school reform.
</P>
<P>
   THE KEYSTONE STATE _ FOR REAL
</P>
<P>
   Often overlooked in national politics, Pennsylvania suddenly
finds itself playing a central role in the 2000 campaign _ not only
in the race for the White House, but also in the cutthroat
competition for control of Congress. The importance of the nation's
fifth-most populous state is hard to exaggerate: It's a swing state
and too close to call. Both Al Gore and George W. Bush have spent a
lot of time there, but the state will officially step into the
spotlight at the end of this month, when the National Republican
Convention begins in Philadelphia. The focus will become even
sharper if Tom Ridge, the popular Republican governor, is chosen as
Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   HOME FIELD ADVANTAGE _ BARELY
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is feeling pressure at home. A new poll gives him a
45-40 percent edge over George W. Bush in Tennessee, just larger
than the poll's error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The poll was taken for the Knoxville News-Sentinel between June
19-24. Bush has a big lead over Gore in polls in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   TWO SIDES OF GORE
</P>
<P>
   In his April interview with federal investigators, two very
different Al Gores seemed to be present, according to law
enforcement officials. One was a confident master of detail, the
other a defensive witness who could not recall basic facts about
his fund-raising activities. For example, Gore remembered with
precision how long he had served as vice president and as a
senator: ``seven years and two months and 28 days,'' and ``eight
years and 18 days.'' But later he said he didn't know whether the
now-infamous Buddhist temple luncheon was a fund-raiser, and said
he thought he had attended only one White House coffee when
documents showed that he attended 23. It was that kind of
contradiction that fueled investigators' skepticism about his
truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   OPENING NIGHT SHOW-STOPPER?
</P>
<P>
   Convention strategists for Al Gore think it may be wise to ask
President Clinton to speak on Monday night, Aug. 14, National
Journal reports. Said the publication:``One reason is to speed
along Gore's transformation into the Democratic Party's Alpha Male;
the sooner Clinton speaks and exits the Los Angeles stage the
better. The other reason is to force ABC television to rethink its
plans to broadcast Monday Night Football that evening.''
</P>
<P>
   BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT: SEND CHECKS
</P>
<P>
   What does George W. Bush want for his 54th birthday? How about a
signed card from a loyal Republican. A check to the Republican
National Committee would be even more welcome. Such is the message
in a letter written and signed by Bush's wife, Laura. ``A Bush
birthday celebration always includes dear friends,'' she wrote in
the two-page letter. ``Because of your tremendous loyalty and
support of my husband, you are certainly in that category. ... If
you can, I hope you will consider commemorating George's 54th
birthday with a special gift, one that we can all share.'' The
letter includes a birthday card for supporters to sign and return,
along with a check for anywhere from $54 to $540. Bush's birthday
is Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A HOLIDAY FROM CAMPAIGN ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush basked in the spirit of Independence Day by
strolling in a traditional small-town parade in Belton, Texas,
about 135 miles south of Dallas. ``I love the Fourth of July. I
love Texas,'' he said. Al Gore took the holiday off, spending time
with family in Washington to mark the first birthday of his
grandson, Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO BURN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
</P>
<P>
   With George W. Bush breaking all fund-raising records, a lot of
people in the political consulting and media business are reaping a
windfall. A new report by the Center for Responsive Politics shows
how Bush spent the $73 million raised for his primary bid: Some of
the major expenses include $21.7 million for campaign advertising,
mostly for TV; $4.7 million for air charters; $1.4 million for
other forms of travel _ buses, cars, parking and hotels; $4.2
million in direct-mail expenses, with another $4.1 million for
postage, printing and delivery; $2.9 million for payroll; $135,741
for consultants; and, of course, $672,210 for fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   SPARKS WAITING TO IGNITE
</P>
<P>
   The battle-prone Reform Party has been on a short fuse for
months, and some members fear it may be headed for explosion at its
August national convention in Long Beach, Calif. At issue is
whether the party that Ross Perot built will become the party of
Pat Buchanan. ``The baton has passed from Perot,'' said national
chairman Gerry Moan. ``In some circles, they say it has been passed
to Buchanan.'' But the fight over the party's infrastructure and
its dominant voice is far from over: Perot loyalists want to focus
on governmental reform and trade issues raised by their party
founder. New members brought in by Buchanan embrace his
conservative positions on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY'S WEB VOTING
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party presidential primary will feature not only
traditional paper ballots, but voting via the Internet. It's
another sign that balloting on the Web is slowly becoming a
reality. Party members will be mailed a packet with a traditional
ballot and instructions for online voting, to be conducted at
www.eballot.net. The packet gives voters a personal ID number and
instructions to find the ballot on the Web. Electronic votes can be
submitted for a limited time before the Aug. 9 convention. ``A
mixed-media election provides our nationwide constituency with
greater choice,'' said Michael Farris, head of the party's election
committee.
</P>
<P>
   PRESS CORPS OF THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   From boutique start-up ventures like Speakout.com to virtual
empires like America Online, Web sites and Webzines are looking to
the political conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles as
potential defining moments in the evolution of news on the
Internet. Officials of both parties say online enterprises are
requesting space in numbers no one anticipated. The Web is even
infiltrating that august symbol of convention coverage, the
skybooth. This year, the old-line networks and all-news cable
channels have new dot-com neighbors high above the convention
floors. PseudoPolitics.com, America Online and USAToday.com, have
been allotted booths, and online magazines Slate and Salon, and Web
news operations ZDNet and Wired News all have been accredited.

<P>
   UPSTATE GUY, CITY GAL
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senate candidate Rick Lazio marched in three Fourth
of July parades in northern New York. Democrat Hillary Clinton was
with President Clinton in New York City observing OpSail 2000, the
parade of tall ships on the Hudson River. ``She's out taking an
aircraft carrier for a vanity cruise and we're out here on Main
Street,'' said Lazio political strategist Mike Murphy. ``I think it
really tells the story of the difference in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   `COVETS POWER' _ JUST LIKE A MAN WOULD?
</P>
<P>
   In his harshest attack to date, Rick Lazio says in a
fund-raising letter that Hillary Clinton and her husband ``have
embarrassed our country and disgraced their powerful posts. ... She
covets power and control and thinks she should be dictating how
other people run their lives. No other Senate hopeful enjoys a
liberal national press that hangs on her every word and treats her
never-ending soap opera of scandals as `irrelevant' and
`yesterday's news.' '' Clinton's own direct-mail appeal declared
that Lazio's candidacy is the product of ``Republican Party
kingmakers'' and outlined their differences on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   HELMS AT THE HELM IN 2002?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) was characteristically blunt about
everything but his own plans in an interview, saying he's not
decided whether he'll run for a sixth term two years from now. ``I
don't think anybody better get cranked up raising money for the
Senate unless they want to run against me,'' he quipped to the
Raleigh News &AMP; Observer. But he quickly added: ``That's not to say
I'm going to run.'' At 78, Helms has lost most of the feeling in
his feet because of a condition that disrupts the functioning of
nerves. He relies on a motorized scooter to get around Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   GOP EMPHASIS ON HOUSE RACES
</P>
<P>
   With the House Republican majority hanging in the balance, the
GOP's fund-raising arm has sharply increased its spending for the
November elections. A few Republicans are questioning how wisely
some of the money was being spent, but leaders of the National
Republican Congressional Committee say the investment will pay off.
The NRCC spent $56 million during 1999 and the first quarter of
this year _ a 60 percent increase over the $35 million it spent
during the same period before the 1998 elections.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Washington) _ President Clinton announced
Wednesday that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, will come to a Camp David summit
next week intended to resolve the hard-core issues that have
divided their peoples for more than 50 years. Speaking in terms
that portrayed the weight of the undertaking, Clinton said the two
leaders would face the ``most profound questions'' and that there
was no guarantee of success. By Jane Perlez.

   RACE-HIP-HOP (Undated) _ Billy Wimsatt, 27, was born as rap
music was being invented by blacks and Latinos in the South Bronx.
What began as party music became their cry of ghetto pain and their
great hope for a way out. And as hip-hop _ not just rap music but
fashion, break-dancing, graffiti and the magazines that chronicle
it all _ blossomed into the radiant center of youth culture, Billy
Wimsatt and lots of other white kids found in it a way to flee
their own orderly world by discovering a sexier, more provocative
one. Like many young hip-hop heads, he regarded hip-hop, with its
appeal to whites and blacks, as a bold modern hope to ease some of
the abrasiveness between the races. Elliott Wilson, a young black
man, had never met Billy Wimsatt, but their lives had traced
similar trajectories across the hip-hop landscape. As a writer and
editor, he too had spent much of his adult life thinking about
hip-hop. And not just hip-hop, but race and hip-hop. Race was
unavoidable in hip-hop. Hip-hop had inspired him to believe that,
precisely because he was black, he could achieve what whites simply
assumed was theirs by birthright _ a gainful life over which he
asserted control. By N.R. Kleinfield. (6775 words, plus an abridged

   EUROPE-CHEAP-GASOLINE (London) _ Paul Cheringou, a Frenchman,
gets his in Spain. In London, Ken Reddy, a Briton, prefers to pop
over _ or rather under _ the Channel to France for his. And in
Berlin, Monika Brauer, a German, finds Poland a favored venue for
hers. What these cross-border voyagers have in common is the quest
for (relatively) cheap gasoline. And what drives them to traverse
international frontiers just to fill the tank is one of Europe's
most pervasive yet surreptitious taxes, ensnaring Europeans in an
offer they can't seem to refuse. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-GUNS (Washington) _ This year, Al Gore has placed gun
control front and center in his campaign. He has attacked George W.
Bush as a pawn of the NRA and proposed an array of tough laws,
including licensing new handgun buyers, limiting gun sales to one a
month and banning inexpensive and easily concealed handguns. But in
promoting his own gun agenda, Gore's campaign has largely
air-brushed away an early record in Congress of fighting
gun-control legislation. Gore and his supporters argue that his
embrace of gun control was a heart-felt response to a rising tide
of gun violence in the late 1980s. Gore himself credits Mrs. Brady
_ whose husband, James, was partially paralyzed by a bullet meant
for President Reagan _ with helping to change his views. A review
of Gore's record over 24 years suggests that his journey through
the gun-control wars has been more complicated than either side
admits. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   GRAHAM-DANCE-COMPANY (New York) _ Things looked bleak for the
virtually bankrupt Martha Graham dance company six weeks ago when
it canceled its performances for the year and closed down its
school. Now they look bleaker. The board changed locks on the
warehouse where it keeps costumes fearing that Ron Protas, its
former artistic director would take them. Protas, whom Graham
herself chose, is working to prevent the company from performing
any of Graham's dances. Many of the troupe's 17 members have been
discussing whether to organize a boycott of the dances, and Protas
is talking of establishing a new company to supplant the one that
Martha Graham left him in charge of. The wrestling match at times
takes on aspects of an opera bouffe, but for many too much is at
stake for any laughter. By Doreen Carvajal.

   NEW YORK _ Shortly after moving from Albuquerque, N.M., to
Portland, Ore., last year, Peter Boghossian discovered he could
keep in touch with friends and family around the country by placing
telephone calls over the Internet. Since then, he has not paid a
cent for long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Like millions of others, Boghossian plugged into a fast-growing
craze for Internet-based voice communication. Thanks to
improvements in technology and the growth of services from roughly
two dozen companies offering long-distance calls over the Web _
free or substantially cheaper than otherwise available _ many
consumers are slashing their telephone bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you pay one penny for something when you can get it
for free?'' asked Boghossian, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Quality still has a way to go, with the best conversations
resembling a choppy cell-phone call and the worst a wobbly
walkie-talkie transmission. But much of the growing interest in
so-called Internet telephony has to do with its relative
simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Most users need only an Internet hookup and headphones and a
microphone, plugged into a computer. Then, after shopping around
with companies providing Internet telephone service, one can start
placing domestic and international calls to people with any kind of
phone.
</P>
<P>
   According to an estimate from Jeff Pulver, an independent
analyst of the Web-based voice communication industry, roughly 15
million people in the United States use voice communication over
the Internet, compared with 5 million a year ago. In addition,
there are several million users abroad, where the popularity of
services allowing people to call the United States has spread.
</P>
<P>
   Counting on rapid growth rates, the combined revenue of Web talk
providers is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 200
percent a year over the next several years, from $208 million in
2000 to $16.5 billion by 2004, according to the International Data
Corp., a research firm in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an outside observer, I'm supposed to have a jaded view of
this new whiz-bang stuff,'' said Mark Winther, vice president of
telecommunications research at International Data. ``But the
brilliance of voice communications on the Internet is in the
merging of the Internet's power with the ease of use of the
telephone. It's a no-brainer that this industry will take off.''
</P>
<P>
   One company, Dialpad.com of Menlo Park, Calif., exemplifies the
industry's expansion. Using technology developed by a team of
Korean engineers that facilitates the transmission of voice calls
over the Internet, the company offers free service to any number in
the United States from anywhere in the world. Such calls might cost
5 to 25 cents a minute through a conventional long-distance carrier
and as much as $1.25 a minute if calling from, say, Brazil. (The
calls are not altogether free, since they require dialing a local
access number, for which the local phone company collects either a
flat or per-minute charge for a local call.)
</P>
<P>
   Dialpad claims to have signed up 7.5 million users in the last
seven and a half months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've grown grass-roots style through viral marketing,'' said
Peter Hewitt, Dialpad's vice president of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, this means that users of Dialpad's technology
informed others about it by communicating over their system or
through word of mouth, much the way free e-mail addresses on
services like Microsoft's Hotmail began to spread several years
ago. Analysts say Dialpad's growth has been much quicker than its
free e-mail counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dialpad is probably the fastest-growing Internet service
ever,'' Winther said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other Internet startups, Dialpad loses money, though
it does not disclose how much because it is privately held.
Instead, the company prefers to emphasize its growth indicators,
like the doubling of its work force in a year to 40 from 20.
Eventually, Dialpad hopes to become profitable through the sale of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``When harnessing change-the-world technology with such growth
rates, you can be assured real estate on your site will get quite
valuable,'' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, like Net2Phone Inc. of Hackensack, N.J., offer
long-distance calling all over the world, but charge a fee. A call
anywhere in the United States costs 3.9 cents a minute. A call to
the Netherlands from the United States costs 5 cents a minute,
compared with $1.25 to $2.05 a minute using AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While companies like Dialpad have made it simpler to place
long-distance calls over the Internet by discarding cumbersome
credit card registrations, the underlying technology is not so
simple, explaining in part the current limitations of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Transmissions of information online, like e-mail, other written
data, or even voice and video, are generally sent in small packets
of information over the World Wide Web. When a real-time exchange
of information is not necessary, as is the case in most e-mail
exchanges, a small delay in the delivery of the packets is not that
important. But in real-time voice conversations, these delays can
make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   When taken together with an Internet connection of dubious
quality, an Internet voice call can become dicey. Often, if voice
packets are delayed beyond a given threshold, software programs
will guess at the packets' content and transmit a distorted version
of what was said.
</P>
<P>
   While the effect can be disconcerting _ like having a discussion
next to a windswept thoroughfare _ companies are working to improve
the technology. In the meantime, the best way for individuals to
guarantee a good voice call over the Web is to attain a quality
Internet connection, with a high-speed telephone line, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its limitations, the growth of Internet telephony has
caught the attention of large telecommunications companies. This is
no wonder, given even conservative estimates that the nascent
industry, which first showed promise after growing in popularity
among hard-pressed graduate students in the mid-1990s, will account
for at least 15 percent of long-distance traffic in the United
States in five years, up from roughly 1 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, for instance, Deutsche Telekom has introduced
Web-based voice communication services in an effort to capture part
of the market. And in the United States, AT&AMP;T, after unveiling its
own Web-based voice products, led a group that plans to invest $1.4
billion in Net2Phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that Internet telephony has evolved from a geeky,
hobbyist thing into something we want included in our array of
offerings,'' said Glenn Edens, president of AT&AMP;T strategic
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is bullish on the prospects for the Internet-based
voice communication industry. Skeptics point to the telephone's
convenience and the trend of ever more competitive prices for
traditional telecommunications services, regardless of Internet
telephony's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt that Internet telephony is a cheapo substitute,
but a telephone is more convenient and getting cheaper,'' said
Amanda McCarthy, a telecommunications analyst at Forrester Research
in Cambridge, Mass. ``Plus, what type of advertising are you going
to want to sell for people who are such penny-pinchers?''
</P>
<P>
   Another concern for the budding industry is the looming
possibility of taxation. Traditional telecommunications companies
have lobbied to make Internet telephony companies subject to the
same treatment as other communications firms, including taxes and
fees paid to the local phone companies that complete the calls.
(Such fees are already assessed by carriers in some foreign
countries on calls placed over the Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of this proposal, though, assert that potential
investors would be scared away and that the creative capacity of
the industry to hone its technology would be stifled if taxes were
introduced. So far, the Federal Communications Commission has been
reticent to introduce any taxes, fees or other regulatory measures.
</P>
<P>
   But it could only be a matter of time before these issues come
to a head if more consumers make long-distance voice calls over the
Internet and prices for conventional services fall further as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either prices go down and the current regulatory system is
discarded or you start to regulate the Internet,'' said Nicholas
Economides, an economics professor at New York University whose
specialty is telecommunications networks. ``Clearly, for now, the
first choice is better for consumers.''

RELATIVES OF JEWS SENTENCED IN IRAN MEET WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Relatives of some of the 10 Jewish men sentenced to
prison in Iran on espionage charges met privately with President
Clinton on Wednesday to build pressure against the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is the leader of the free world and does have some
moral persuasion,'' said Malcolm I. Hoenlein, who attended the
hour-long meeting as executive chairman of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. ``The president
is fully committed to doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, eight relatives who live in the United States met with
Clinton and his aides in the Cabinet Room. None of the relatives
spoke to reporters as they left the session, but one was contacted
later by telephone and spoke on the condition that she not be
identified for fear of reprisals against her imprisoned brother.
</P>
<P>
   She said of the trial: ``To me it was more like a kidnapping,''
and said of the group of prisoners, ``We're very concerned about
their emotional health, as well as their physical health. We don't
know how long a person can last in those conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has condemned the prison sentences, which were handed
down on Saturday by an Iranian judge who acted as both prosecutor
and jury in the case. The 10 men were accused by the Revolutionary
Court of engaging in espionage and other illegal activities on
behalf of Israel. Israel has denied that the men were spies and has
questioned confessions that were made by eight of the defendants
without lawyers present.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledged that the White House's
ability to influence the case was limited. But they said Clinton's
visit with the relatives was designed to show his concern about the
due process of the trial and disappointment with the verdicts.
``The president said that he is fully committed to do all he can to
pressure for their release,'' an administration official said after
the meeting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also attending the meeting were first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who has criticized the verdicts while campaigning in New
York's U.S. Senate race; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; and
Samuel Berger, the president's national security adviser. The
relatives were joined by leaders of various U.S. Jewish
organizations, including a group representing Jews of Iranian
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Hoenlein said the tearful session allowed the relatives to pass
along the plight of Iranian Jews, a dwindling population of about
30,000 people who are allowed to practice some aspects of their
religion but are forbidden to teach Hebrew.

MAD MAC FIRST IN BRITISH HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ This has been a good Wimbledon for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 players who reached the quarter-finals of one of
tennis' four Grand Slam championships, half were Americans. Three
of the four women semi-finalists are Americans, including the Los
Angeles-born Williams sisters, who electrified the crowds at Centre
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi is perennially the most popular player here, and no
matter how he fares, Pete Sampras is the undisputed king of the
venerable grass courts of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   But according to many Britons, the actual star at Wimbledon has
been John McEnroe, the former champion and one-time terror of the
All England Club, who this year became a television commentator for
the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   When he first burst onto Centre Court, swearing like a sailor
and breaking his rackets the way rock star Pete Townshend of The
Who used to smash his guitars, many Brits were appalled.
</P>
<P>
   Sportsmanship was always valued at least as much as talent at
the All England Club. There was a grudging respect for McEnroe's
ability on a tennis court, but as a person he was seen by many as a
bad-tempered vulgarian. Some of the more snooty members of the
gin-and-tonic crowd who lord over the All England Club wanted to
ban McEnroe because of his loutish behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the tabloids loved Mad Mac, as they dubbed him. He
was good copy, whether he was challenging the eyesight of the
umpires or cursing the crowds that inevitably cheered his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But now, long after his retirement top level tennis, Mad Mac has
mellowed, and the Brits, suddenly and effusively, love him.
</P>
<P>
   His candid, incisive commentary has breathed life back into the
BBC's coverage, which could often be as dull as the skies that
invariably bring the tarpaulin onto the courts several times over
the two-week tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Observer's notoriously fickle Kathryn Flett gushed over
McEnroe's commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brilliant, irreverent, informed, intelligent, exasperated,
inspired, anxious, and always keeping his solid, reliable BBC
commentary doubles partners on their metaphorical toes,'' said
Flett, confessing that the only two people she fawns over
professionally are McEnroe and David Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by his BBC colleague John Inverdale, who plays Abbott to
McEnroe's Costello, whether perennial English hopeful Tim Henman
would ever win the championship, McEnroe smirked and replied,
``Sure, when Sampras is no longer around.'' McEnroe added that
Henman would never raise his game until he got a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the British media, especially the BBC, had spent
considerable time hyping Henman's chances, McEnroe's comments were
a cold slap of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps unconsciously, the normally-reserved Henman was
McEnroesque when he exited the tournament with a pedestrian
fourth-round loss to the big-serving Mark Philippoussis of
Australia: he smashed his racket against his foot in frustration,
breaking it _ the racket, that is, not his foot.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe has been manna for the BBC, which has been fighting an
uphill battle to outbid commercial stations to hold onto the rights
to prestigious sporting events like Wimbledon and the British Open
golf tournament, which the Brits refer to simply as ``The Open.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5 million Britons play tennis, testimony to their
perseverance and love of the game on an island where it rains so
often. Many more millions have been tuning in daily to listen to
McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   Even the royal family has put aside its reservations over a man
who, when he had a band, was more likely to play the Sex Pistols'
version of ``God Save The Queen'' than the British national anthem
of the same name. Prince Andrew invited McEnroe to play an
exhibition match against his old nemesis and now close friend Bjorn
Borg on the Queen's courts in back of Buckingham Palace last
weekend, as a fund-raiser for a children's charity. McEnroe got
bigger cheers from the palace crowd than even some past British
champions.
</P>
<P>
   After a close line call went against him, an obliging McEnroe
trotted out a tongue-in-cheek ``You can't be serious!'' to the
umpire at the match, which he won. The crowd, many of whom cringed
when he yelled such abuse at Centre Court years ago, played along
and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an international fad of late to beat up on the
Brits. The national soccer team is a frustrating collection of
underachievers, the cricket team pathetic, beaten regularly by
those they colonized. The $1 billion Millennium Dome exhibition
hall in London is a white elephant, the Millennium Bridge over the
River Thames closed because it sways too much. English soccer
hooligans have again terrorized European cities recently.
</P>
<P>
   Yet lost in all this is recognition of the admirable ability of
the British to forgive, of their sense of fair play. They have
forgiven Prince Charles and his mistress, Camilla Parker-Bowles,
allowing the couple to step out in public with public approval.
They widely back the peace process in Northern Ireland, willing to
put aside the bitter memories of bombs in London.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have not only forgiven Mad Mac, they have embraced him.

FLORIDA UNIVERSITY USES RACING MONEY FOR TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARRIE MILLER   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Do greyhounds run faster if they're fed raw
meat? Can the wrong horseshoe cause injuries in thoroughbreds? Will
an ice hockey helmet stop a jai alai ball going 150 mph?
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the questions being answered by professors at
the University of Florida with the help of state gambling revenues.
The university will receive $2.26 million from the Pari-mutuel
Wagering Trust Fund in the coming school year, a part of the $62
million in tax revenue collected in fiscal year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, $300,000 is earmarked to investigate topics of interest
to the industries of horse racing, greyhound racing and jai alai.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the university's allocation, $1.76 million, will finance
the laboratory on campus, where blood and urine specimens from
racehorses and greyhounds competing around the state are tested for
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Another $200,000 will pay for a related project in drug
elimination studies. Using a treadmill that will support a
1,300-pound racehorse running at 40 mph, researchers study whether
common medications increase or impede performance, and how long it
takes for them to leave the animal's system.
</P>
<P>
   When it's running, the treadmill is one of the few places where
one can stand next to a running thoroughbred. Researchers monitor
the horse's vital signs and oxygen intake, and with the help of
arterial catheters, can draw blood as the animal runs.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Courtney, a professor of veterinary medicine, said the
lessons learned from thoroughbreds and greyhounds can benefit
pleasure horses and pet dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pari-mutuel industry contributes many tens of millions of
tax dollars to the state of Florida,'' Courtney said. ``The horses
are not only raced here, they're bred here. The horse industry
alone contributes numerous jobs and billions of dollars to the
state economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund money is allocated by the Legislature and comes
from taxes paid by the owners of dog and horse tracks and jai alai
operations. While revenues from those sports have declined, they
still generate more than $60 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Cross and Dan Lewis, who are small-animal veterinarians,
have used the funding to test treatments of hip fractures on
greyhounds. Cross said what they've learned can be applied to other
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects seem of little use to the general public, though,
including Richard Hill's findings that feeding greyhounds raw meat
before a race is likely to slow them down rather than speed them up
_ from an average 34.7 mph to 34.5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Large-animal veterinarian Jorge Hernandez is studying whether
using ``toe grabs,'' a kind of horseshoe cleat, increases the risk
of muscle or skeletal injuries in racehorses.
</P>
<P>
   And the jai alai helmet study conducted a couple of years ago by
Dr. Jeffrey Bauer of the College of Health and Human Performance
found that ice hockey helmets commonly worn by jai alai players
weren't suitable for impacts with the hard rubber ``pelota.''
</P>
<P>
   All animals competing at Florida's 15 greyhound tracks and five
horse tracks are screened for drugs at a university laboratory. The
laboratory tests more than 100,000 specimens per year, and less
than 500 test positive. And just a handful of those come back with
``performance-enhancing'' drugs such as cocaine, the lab director,
Ian Tebbett, said.
</P>
<P>
   The university's drug elimination laboratory is working to make
Tebbett's job easier. Under current racing rules, Florida is a ``no
tolerance'' state, which means even small traces of medicines are
not allowed in a racing animal's system with three exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   At the drug elimination lab, professor Pat Colahan is trying to
determine whether antibiotics or other medicines have an effect on
the performance of race horses. If the laboratory can rule out
drugs as performance enhancers, the state may choose to add them to
the short list of accepted drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory also evaluates how long it takes drugs to pass
through a horse's system, providing a benchmark for trainers to
know how close to a race they can treat an animal with antibiotics
and other medications.

MAD MAC FIRST IN BRITISH HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON _ This has been a good Wimbledon for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 players who reached the quarter-finals of one of
tennis' four Grand Slam championships, half were Americans. Three
of the four women semi-finalists are Americans, including the Los
Angeles-born Williams sisters, who electrified the crowds at Centre
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi is perennially the most popular player here, and no
matter how he fares, Pete Sampras is the undisputed king of the
venerable grass courts of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   But according to many Britons, the actual star at Wimbledon has
been John McEnroe, the former champion and one-time terror of the
All England Club, who this year became a television commentator for
the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   When he first burst onto Centre Court, swearing like a sailor
and breaking his rackets the way rock star Pete Townshend of The
Who used to smash his guitars, many Brits were appalled.
</P>
<P>
   Sportsmanship was always valued at least as much as talent at
the All England Club. There was a grudging respect for McEnroe's
ability on a tennis court, but as a person he was seen by many as a
bad-tempered vulgarian. Some of the more snooty members of the
gin-and-tonic crowd who lord over the All England Club wanted to
ban McEnroe because of his loutish behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the tabloids loved Mad Mac, as they dubbed him. He
was good copy, whether he was challenging the eyesight of the
umpires or cursing the crowds that inevitably cheered his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But now, long after his retirement top level tennis, Mad Mac has
mellowed, and the Brits, suddenly and effusively, love him.
</P>
<P>
   His candid, incisive commentary has breathed life back into the
BBC's coverage, which could often be as dull as the skies that
invariably bring the tarpaulin onto the courts several times over
the two-week tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Observer's notoriously fickle Kathryn Flett gushed over
McEnroe's commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brilliant, irreverent, informed, intelligent, exasperated,
inspired, anxious, and always keeping his solid, reliable BBC
commentary doubles partners on their metaphorical toes,'' said
Flett, confessing that the only two people she fawns over
professionally are McEnroe and David Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by his BBC colleague John Inverdale, who plays Abbott to
McEnroe's Costello, whether perennial English hopeful Tim Henman
would ever win the championship, McEnroe smirked and replied,
``Sure, when Sampras is no longer around.'' McEnroe added that
Henman would never raise his game until he got a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the British media, especially the BBC, had spent
considerable time hyping Henman's chances, McEnroe's comments were
a cold slap of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps unconsciously, the normally-reserved Henman was
McEnroesque when he exited the tournament with a pedestrian
fourth-round loss to the big-serving Mark Philippoussis of
Australia: he smashed his racket against his foot in frustration,
breaking it _ the racket, that is, not his foot.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe has been manna for the BBC, which has been fighting an
uphill battle to outbid commercial stations to hold onto the rights
to prestigious sporting events like Wimbledon and the British Open
golf tournament, which the Brits refer to simply as ``The Open.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5 million Britons play tennis, testimony to their
perseverance and love of the game on an island where it rains so
often. Many more millions have been tuning in daily to listen to
McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   Even the royal family has put aside its reservations over a man
who, when he had a band, was more likely to play the Sex Pistols'
version of ``God Save The Queen'' than the British national anthem
of the same name. Prince Andrew invited McEnroe to play an
exhibition match against his old nemesis and now close friend Bjorn
Borg on the Queen's courts in back of Buckingham Palace last
weekend, as a fund-raiser for a children's charity. McEnroe got
bigger cheers from the palace crowd than even some past British
champions.
</P>
<P>
   After a close line call went against him, an obliging McEnroe
trotted out a tongue-in-cheek ``You can't be serious!'' to the
umpire at the match, which he won. The crowd, many of whom cringed
when he yelled such abuse at Centre Court years ago, played along
and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an international fad of late to beat up on the
Brits. The national soccer team is a frustrating collection of
underachievers, the cricket team pathetic, beaten regularly by
those they colonized. The $1 billion Millennium Dome exhibition
hall in London is a white elephant, the Millennium Bridge over the
River Thames closed because it sways too much. English soccer
hooligans have again terrorized European cities recently.
</P>
<P>
   Yet lost in all this is recognition of the admirable ability of
the British to forgive, of their sense of fair play. They have
forgiven Prince Charles and his mistress, Camilla Parker-Bowles,
allowing the couple to step out in public with public approval.
They widely back the peace process in Northern Ireland, willing to
put aside the bitter memories of bombs in London.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have not only forgiven Mad Mac, they have embraced him.

 &HT;    Williams sisters will make family, Wimbledon history today
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Most fans wouldn't know they should look
twice at Richard Williams, one of thousands wandering the grounds
at Wimbledon this week. His trademark dark tennis shorts and
ballcap don't identify him as a celebrity, and he doesn't have an
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   But wherever he goes at the All England Club, the proud papa
from Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., eventually attracts a small crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a great dad,'' one spectator said while Williams talked
with reporters this week. He called back with a laugh, ``Tell Venus
and Serena that so they give me more pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughters should have some cash to spare after their
career-best showings this week at Wimbledon. At least one will make
Saturday's final _ to play either defending champion Lindsay
Davenport or Jelena Dokic _ after today's historic all-sister
matchup in one semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first meeting of sisters in a Wimbledon semifinal
and the Williams sisters' fifth career matchup - by far the most
important.
</P>
<P>
   It's creating a scene around London, with newspaper reporters
pursuing every angle of the family's background and British
Broadcasting Corp. reporters staging stories such as Wednesday's
``surprise'' meeting between the sisters and awed singers Dionne
Warwick and Gladys Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Ladbrokes, a bookmaker, announced lines on an unusual series of
bets for the semifinal, including 10-1 on whether either sister
will serve underhanded as a surprise tactic, 1-3 on whether the
winner will leap the net to ``commiserate with the loser'' and 50-1
on the wrong sister serving after the umpire says ``Miss Williams
to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters, however, maintain this is just another match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really just happy to play another match,'' Serena said.
``It's just another meeting between the both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is disturbed that their father might not watch or that
he's taking two days off from his coaching duties because he
doesn't want to advise either of them. They won't stop speaking
this morning or spike each other's drinks or even wish ill on their
sister, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis is just a game,'' Serena said. ``Family is forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus, 20, had dominated their matchups, winning the first
three, but 18-year-old Serena broke through for the first time late
last year at the Grand Slam Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Williams wouldn't make a prediction on this outcome
or even say if he wanted a close match. He still might not even
watch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy there will be a Williams in the final,'' he said.
``And the Williams that gets to the final, she'll win the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters found a doubles match against Wimbledon legend
Martina Navratilova and partner Mariaan de Swardt to be a welcome
distraction Wednesday, allowing them to avoid an intense practice
session with each other.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters won in three sets, ending Navratilova's run at a
20th title and revealing how tennis of 2000 might be dominated by a
pair of athletes who dwarf the powerful Navratilova.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the capability of taking it another step,'' said
Navratilova, who gives Serena a slight edge today. ``They're just
so big. I thought I was big. I'm a pipsqueak next to them. If they
put it together technically, we could see them in the finals for a
lot of years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   And these sisters aren't just impressing players on the women's
side. Some men, many notorious in their disdain for the women's
game, are taking notice of the sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think those two girls are a level of athlete above all
the other girls,'' said second seed Andre Agassi. ``Even if they're
not playing well, they're still athletic enough to present a bunch
of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Top men's seed Pete Sampras echoed Richard Williams' line when
asked to pick a winner, saying ``I'll take a Williams. Maybe the
younger one.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi leaned toward Serena, even though he's watched more of
Venus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, I think Serena is a better player. I think her
second serve is better. I think her forehand is better. I think
she's a sounder mover,'' he said. ``It's always a psychological
matchup. I can't even imagine what it's like playing your
sibling.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena admits she used to have to cheat to beat her older
sister, because Venus ' size and strength was an ``unfair
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, there won't be any cheating and they hope they'll enjoy
the occasion more than they did their meeting in the 1999 final at
Key Biscayne. Both played stone-faced, and Venus celebrated victory
with little more than a smile.
</P>
<P>
   They think experience will make this matchup easier, even though
they know the result will be bittersweet. Venus vividly remembers
the agony of watching Serena win the family's first Grand Slam at
last year's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think we'll be able to smile,'' Serena said,
smiling. ``We're always filled with smiles. We like to smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus smiled in agreement, but they _ unlike their father who
held court throughout the day on subjects including raising
children, why his wife stayed home instead of coming to England and
his sharecropper mother _ had tired of the questions about playing
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really beginning to be repetitive,'' Venus said. ``What
can I say? We're going to go out there; we're going to play.''

FAMILY OF DEAD DANCER SUES BALLET COMOPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One day shy of the third anniversary of her daughter's
fatal collapse, the mother of Boston Ballet dancer Heidi Guenther
has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the ballet and its
artistic director, charging that their pressure on Guenther to lose
weight had contributed to the 22-year-old's death.
</P>
<P>
   Guenther, who died suddenly on a family car trip to Disneyland
while home in California on summer break, was 5 feet 3 inches tall
and weighed 93 pounds when she died.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed last Thursday as the statute of limitations
in the case was scheduled to expire, adds a new chapter to an
incident that brought unflattering national attention to the
widespread practice of encouraging dancers to achieve extreme
thinness.
</P>
<P>
   The suit reopens an embarrassing episode for the ballet and its
artistic director, Anna-Marie Holmes, who acknowledged telling
Guenther that losing weight would increase her chances of joining
the dance company's elite Corps de Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Holmes and the ballet engaged in
``reckless and grossly negligent'' conduct for ``repeatedly
admonishing'' Guenther to lose weight ``despite the fact that the
defendants knew or should have known that Ms. Guenther suffered
from anorexia nervosa,'' an eating disorder characterized by
intentional starvation.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said Guenther labored under the perception ``whether
correct or incorrect, that advancement from apprentice to Corps de
Ballet member, and from Corps de Ballet member to soloist and,
ultimately, principal, was driven by being thin.''
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy found that Guenther died of a ``fatal ventricular
arrhythmia, or the loss of life-sustaining heart rhythm...due to
natural causes.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a California coroner did not directly link the
irregular heartbeat that caused Guenther's June 30, 1997 death with
her apparent eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, Guenther began to experience severe pain
in her right foot during her first season as an apprentice with the
ballet in 1994-95 but refused to take time off because she feared
ruining her chances for a contract with the Corps de Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   When she wasn't dancing, Guenther spent most of her time resting
her foot, causing her to gain more than five pounds, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Guenther left for the summer recess in June 1995,
Holmes informed her that the ballet would not offer her a contract
to join the Corps de Ballet until she lost weight, according to the
suit. During that summer, Guenther discovered that her right foot
was broken and was advised to refrain from dancing to allow it to
heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unable to engage in any physical activity, Ms. Guenther
strugged to lose weight as ordered by Ms. Holmes,'' the suit said.
``She continued to fear that her failure to lose weight might
jeopardize her chance to move into the Corps de Ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the dance company in October 1995, Guenther
was still not offered a position with the Corps de Ballet, even
though she had managed to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, according to the suit, Guenther began
skipping meals, purging, ingesting laxatives, and smoking
cigarettes in an effort to shed additional pounds, according to the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the continued pressure on Guenther to lose
weight, her anorexia nervosa went unchecked and worsened,
ultimately resulting in the fatal irregular heartbeat, according to
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had not yet seen the suit, ballet spokesman John
Michael Kennedy declined to comment. Through Kennedy, Holmes, who
announced in December that she would leave her position in June
2001 to ``pursue her opportunities to enhance her career
internationally,'' also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   After Guenther's death, Holmes told a Globe reporter that she
had advised Guenther to lose weight because, ``She was looking a
little pudgy -- her boobs, her hips, her thighs. You see a girl on
stage, her butt is going up and down, it's not attractive. It's a
visual art. Because it's a visual art, I can advise what looks
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes also told the Globe that she had advised Guenther in a
private meeting that the ballet could help her find a nutritionist.
And according to ballet records, Holmes and four other ballet staff
members told Guenther in January 1997, ``Be careful not to get too
thin. We are concerned and hope you are eating well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at her home in San Francisco, Guenther's mother,
Patricia Harrington, said she filed the suit ``just to protect the
statute of limitations, and now I have to decide what to do. But
after I did it, this thing inside me said, `God, I did the right
thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said she decided to pursue the case after speaking
with members of her grief group, where ``the general feeling was
that I would always regret it if I didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, who is divorced and also has a 17-year-old son and a
23-year-old daughter, said she asked her ex-husband to be a part of
the lawsuit, but he refused.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Guenther could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said that Heidi had a heart murmur, ``But lots of
kids have heart murmurs and the doctor never said it was anything.
That was her only history of a heart problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The autopsy was really inconclusive,'' she added. ``It said
her heart defect was probably a factor, but there was nothing
conclusive that that alone would have caused Heidi's death.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington is representing herself in the case, but said she
received free help drafting and filing the lawsuit by J. Owen Todd,
a Boston attorney. Todd did not return a call for comment
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Guenther's death, the ballet has developed mandatory
seminars for dancers on nutrition and eating disorders.

 &HT;    TEACHER UNIONS UNITE BEHIND GORE
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The nation's two biggest teachers unions favored a
proven friend when they endorsed Vice President Al Gore in this
fall's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic hopeful has relied on their support and worked
with the unions in elections and policy battles dating back to his
days as a senator from Tennessee, and he actively sought their
support for his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republican hopeful, Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
declined to seek the union's official support.
</P>
<P>
   Like the GOP rivals he defeated in the Republican primaries and
caucuses, Bush turned down an invitation to apply to be endorsed.
Instead, Bush plans to spell out his stands on education within
school classrooms or in other educational forums. Accepting the
endorsements, Gore spoke Wednesday at the convention in
Philadelphia of the one-million-member American Federation of
Teachers. He will speak Thursday in Chicago to the convention of
the 2.5-million-member National Education Association, which
endorsed him Tuesday by a secret-ballot vote of 7,553 to 889.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using his appearance to plug his program to expand health
insurance for children, Gore told the teachers, ``I am committed to
bring access to fully affordable health coverage to every child in
this nation by the end of the next presidential term.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has taken steps as governor of Texas that impressed some
teachers, but snubbing the teachers unions could cost him some
votes. About 5 percent of the nation's voting-age adults are in
families of AFT or NEA members, and they are more likely than most
people to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, a candidate endorsed by the NEA gets 10 percentage
points more in support from such voters than from the general
electorate, said Mary Elizabeth Teasley, director of government
relations for the NEA. She said other voters are often influenced
indirectly by conversations with NEA members, especially the half
who live in rural areas or small towns.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush had little choice during the primaries, because he was
seeking support from the most committed members of the Republican
party, which just four years ago adopted a platform calling for the
abolition of the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, he stressed his support for tax-paid
vouchers that could be used for private school tuition by parents
of children whose public school was labelled as ``failing'' several
years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Since cinching the GOP nomination, Bush has started to stress
proposals with wider appeal, such as his suggestion that Head Start
is so important as an educational tool that it should be
transferred from the Department of Health and Human Services to the
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore, he has called for the federal government, which
supplies about 13 percent of the funding for special education, to
raise its share to 40 percent over an unspecified period of years.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he has outlined several specific educational
innovations, such as a program to increase the number of qualified
math and science teachers. The programs to which he has attached a
price tag at this point would raise federal spending on education
by more than $3 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though short of the $11 billion a year in new education spending
proposed by Gore, Bush's plans are a far cry from proposals pending
in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to limit
education spending and fold many specific programs into block
grants controlled by the states.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who was the
GOP nominee in 1996, Bush has refrained from attacking the teachers
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very pleased by the fact that he has not bashed
teachers and has not bashed teachers unions,'' NEA president Bob
Chase told reporters Wednesday. ``On the other hand, he said, since
Bush hadn't reached out to the teachers groups, ``we have not
reached out yet to Gov. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers seemed to strike a strong chord with the teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at their records, Vice President Gore seems to
have supported public education more than Gov. Bush,'' said Willie
A. Terrell Jr., president of the Dayton (Ohio) Education
Association. ``Gore is opposed to _ and Gov. Bush favors _ a
voucher system, which takes money from public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is a strong supporter of public education,'' said Jackie
Wooten, a fourth-grade teacher in Stokes, N.C. ``He's very much
opposed to vouchers and subsidizing private schools with tax
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire some of the hard work Gore did, especially on the
technology piece _ the wiring of the classrooms,'' said Essie S.
Johnson of Savannah, the outgoing president of the Georgia
Association of Educators. Her successor, Ralph Noble, who teaches
fifth grade in Whitfield County, said teachers were impressed by
Gore's strong opposition to vouchers, whereas Mr. Bush is for
vouchers which take money away from the public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has a much clearer understanding of what is needed to
make sure every child gets educated,'' said Shelley Vana, president
of the Palm Beach Teachers Association. Phillip Carlson of West
Palm Beach, an NEA staff member assigned to Florida, said that
while the Texas governor has read to students in many schools,
``visiting schools doesn't mean you're better at education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say Bush is a complete zero in education, but I
would say that Gore has been more pro-active in finding solutions
to problems in education,'' said John Burrows of Grand Junction,
Colo., president of the Mesa Valley Education Association. Nola
Daily of Grand Junction, a third-grade teacher at Dos Rios
Elementary School, said, ``One problem is Bush supports vouchers,
and if money goes out of the system that way, it's not available
for the public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people in Texas know that the education
reforms whose results Gov. Bush brags about were already in place
before he even took office,'' said Brenda Urps, a special education
teacher who is co-president of Education Austin. ``I believe we
should spread the word to other states.''
</P>
<P>
   The unions give some financial help to Gore and other endorsed
candidates from the voluntary contributions from their members to
their political action committees supporting Gore and other
candidates. But in a presidential contest that will be dominated by
large contributions of ``soft money'' to the parties, unions are
outspent by business in that kind of activity by more than 10 to
one.
</P>
<P>
   Far more important are the teachers' knowledgeable paid and
volunteer political operatives, who hone their skills constantly in
local and state battles over funding of the public schools. With
education high among the concerns of voters in general, the opinion
of teachers may influence their acquaintances as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the most influential activity of all is probably the work by
both unions to convince their own members and their families to
vote. With participation in presidential elections hovering just
above 50 percent, a heavier turnout by those groups can have a
disproportionate effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 40 percent of our members tell us they don't identify
with any party, and the rest are split fairly evenly between
Republicans and Democrats,'' Teasley said. ``Historically, our
post-election polls have showed the votes by our members exceed the
numbers for the recommended candidate by 10 percentage points or
more.''

has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the ballet and its
artistic director, charging that their pressure on Guenther to lose

   Guenther, who died suddenly on a family car trip to Disneyland
while home in California on summer break, was 5 feet 3 inches tall
and weighed 93 pounds when she died.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed last Thursday as the statute of limitations
in the case was scheduled to expire, adds a new chapter to an
incident that brought unflattering national attention to the
widespread practice of encouraging dancers to achieve extreme
thinness.
</P>
<P>
   The suit reopens an embarrassing episode for the ballet and its
artistic director, Anna-Marie Holmes, who acknowledged telling
Guenther that losing weight would increase her chances of joining
the dance company's elite Corps de Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Holmes and the ballet engaged in
``reckless and grossly negligent'' conduct for ``repeatedly
admonishing'' Guenther to lose weight ``despite the fact that the
defendants knew or should have known that Ms. Guenther suffered
from anorexia nervosa,'' an eating disorder characterized by
intentional starvation.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said Guenther labored under the perception ``whether
correct or incorrect, that advancement from apprentice to Corps de
Ballet member, and from Corps de Ballet member to soloist and,
ultimately, principal, was driven by being thin.''
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy found that Guenther died of a ``fatal ventricular
arrhythmia, or the loss of life-sustaining heart rhythm...due to
natural causes.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a California coroner did not directly link the
irregular heartbeat that caused Guenther's June 30, 1997 death with
her apparent eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, Guenther began to experience severe pain
in her right foot during her first season as an apprentice with the
ballet in 1994-95 but refused to take time off because she feared
ruining her chances for a contract with the Corps de Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   When she wasn't dancing, Guenther spent most of her time resting
her foot, causing her to gain more than five pounds, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Guenther left for the summer recess in June 1995,
Holmes informed her that the ballet would not offer her a contract
to join the Corps de Ballet until she lost weight, according to the
suit. During that summer, Guenther discovered that her right foot
was broken and was advised to refrain from dancing to allow it to
heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unable to engage in any physical activity, Ms. Guenther
strugged to lose weight as ordered by Ms. Holmes,'' the suit said.
``She continued to fear that her failure to lose weight might
jeopardize her chance to move into the Corps de Ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the dance company in October 1995, Guenther
was still not offered a position with the Corps de Ballet, even
though she had managed to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, according to the suit, Guenther began
skipping meals, purging, ingesting laxatives, and smoking
cigarettes in an effort to shed additional pounds, according to the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the continued pressure on Guenther to lose
weight, her anorexia nervosa went unchecked and worsened,
ultimately resulting in the fatal irregular heartbeat, according to
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had not yet seen the suit, ballet spokesman John
Michael Kennedy declined to comment. Through Kennedy, Holmes, who
announced in December that she would leave her position in June
2001 to ``pursue her opportunities to enhance her career
internationally,'' also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   After Guenther's death, Holmes told a Globe reporter that she
had advised Guenther to lose weight because, ``She was looking a
little pudgy -- her boobs, her hips, her thighs. You see a girl on
stage, her butt is going up and down, it's not attractive. It's a
visual art. Because it's a visual art, I can advise what looks
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes also told the Globe that she had advised Guenther in a
private meeting that the ballet could help her find a nutritionist.
And according to ballet records, Holmes and four other ballet staff
members told Guenther in January 1997, ``Be careful not to get too
thin. We are concerned and hope you are eating well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at her home in San Francisco, Guenther's mother,
Patricia Harrington, said she filed the suit ``just to protect the
statute of limitations, and now I have to decide what to do. But
after I did it, this thing inside me said, `God, I did the right
thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said she decided to pursue the case after speaking
with members of her grief group, where ``the general feeling was
that I would always regret it if I didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, who is divorced and also has a 17-year-old son and a
23-year-old daughter, said she asked her ex-husband to be a part of
the lawsuit, but he refused.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Guenther could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said that Heidi had a heart murmur, ``But lots of
kids have heart murmurs and the doctor never said it was anything.
That was her only history of a heart problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The autopsy was really inconclusive,'' she added. ``It said
her heart defect was probably a factor, but there was nothing
conclusive that that alone would have caused Heidi's death.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington is representing herself in the case, but said she
received free help drafting and filing the lawsuit by J. Owen Todd,
a Boston attorney. Todd did not return a call for comment
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Guenther's death, the ballet has developed mandatory
seminars for dancers on nutrition and eating disorders.

ADVERTISING: COLA MAKERS GO AFTER THE YOUTH MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONNIE HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With thousands of American children signing up to
play baseball and soccer in the years before they metamorphose into
full-fledged consumers, the Pepsi-Cola Co. is seizing on those
pastimes _ one national, the other imported _ to market its soft
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which began nationwide last year, is known as
``Takin' It to the Fields'' and offers ice chests and 12-packs of
Pepsi to coaches, along with a scorekeeping book if the coach
happens to have a baseball team. Teams composed of children from
age 6 through 13 are eligible. The equipment and the Pepsi are
free, and the coaches are supposed to distribute the drinks once
the game ends to mark the celebration, if there is one. And even if
there isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to be saving you money as we know how postgame
refreshments and a score book are the very least that are
required,'' notes the promotional material prepared by Pepsi, under
the heading ``How Much Does This Program Cost?'' Little League
teams in the New York area can compete for a trip to a Mets game,
although the odds might be a little long: Last year, four teams out
of 6,000 got tickets. Pepsi estimates about 90,000 baseball teams
have signed up for the program, which also promises visits by
``Pepsi Ambassadors'' who will give away prizes, like batting
gloves with the Pepsi logo. About 22,000 soccer teams have signed
up for the Pepsi soccer program.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be overlooked is the marketing for major-league baseball
that Pepsi, a unit of PepsiCo, offers through the children's
program. The company has signed agreements with 14 teams, including
the New York Mets and the Detroit Tigers, in which Pepsi products
are the only ones served in their stadiums. There are similar
agreements with eight major-league soccer teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a great grass-roots tool to promote baseball and
the New York Mets to a very targeted audience, boys and girls who
play Little League,'' said Mark Bingham, the Mets' senior vice
president for marketing and broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Why tie the program to Pepsi-Cola, a sugary, carbonated drink,
and not water or fruit juice, which Pepsi also markets? Dawn
Hudson, the company's senior vice president for advertising and
marketing, said the point was to build connections in people's
minds between Pepsi and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supporting the future stars of baseball who are in
Little League,'' Hudson said. ``It's not a short-term volume kind
of program. We certainly see results with brand recognition, and
kids who participate feel more positive about Pepsi than kids who
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The company's desire is to generate interest in Pepsi-Cola, a
brand that, like its archrival Coca-Cola, has been trailing off in
recent years as consumers discover alternatives, ranging from iced
tea to juice to sports drinks. The idea is ``brand-building at the
heart of the echo-boomer market,'' Hudson said, referring to the
children born in the last decade or so to the baby boom generation,
whose members are now in their 40s and 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Tie-ins with local supermarket chains are also in the works, she
added, and Pizza Hut, once part of the PepsiCo empire, has been
included in the program. Coupons for a free pizza, which are
supposed to be given to the player who shows the most sportsmanlike
conduct, are included in the baseball packages.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent innings, so to speak, Pepsi may offer its bottled
water as part of the program, Hudson said. ``We are testing the
possibility of having Aquafina during the game,'' she said. ``But
we want to make sure we don't dilute the impact of Pepsi by
offering Aquafina.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Katie Lacey, Pepsi's director of sports and grass-roots
marketing, said the company had been able to appeal to baseball's
administrators by pointing out that the two had common goals.
``We're both trying to stay very relevant to youth,'' she said.
``This is one great example of how we can jointly market to achieve
our mutual objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's version of the program has increased the number of
teams participating, ranging from the sandlots of Kinston, N.C., to
the greenswards of Anaheim Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are penetrating something on the order of 15
percent of teams,'' Hudson said. ``If 25 percent wanted to
participate, we'd accelerate it. We want it to be part of growing
up in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents may worry that this is one more broadside that
marketers are taking at childhood. Many schools have signed
exclusive deals with Pepsi, Coke and other soft-drink companies,
which lock them into serving one brand or another in vending
machines, for example. Critics say schools should be off limits to
corporate efforts to win over consumers; baseball diamonds and
soccer fields seem to occupy a gray area as far as children and
commercialism are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, meanwhile, has come up with a related effort linking
baseball to its products that zero in on New York City. And its
particular focus is Hispanic families, with programs called ``Batea
La Sed,'' or ``Bat Your Thirst,'' and ``Familia de Beisbol,'' the
``Baseball Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Magliocco, Coke's promotions manager for New York, said that
``Batea La Sed'' featured baseball skills contests for children
ages 13 through 15 in parks citywide. The most recent contest was
in Brooklyn on June 25.

   ``We go to a league president and say, `Here is great added
value, a great thing for you to bring your kids from Coca-Cola,'''
Magliocco said. Coaches can register up to 50 players, who then
take turns batting, running and pitching by age group. The winners
get ``goodie bags'' from Coke, Magliocco said, and free tickets to
Yankees games. Coke has an exclusive contract for Yankee Stadium,
meaning that only Coke soft drinks are served there (although
Cracker Jack, made by PepsiCo's Frito-Lay division, is still
permitted).
</P>
<P>
   The onlookers get samples of Coke and other promotional items,
he added. The ``Familia de Beisbol'' program features players from
different Spanish-speaking countries, including Venezuela, Mexico
and the Dominican Republic. The players appear in posters hung
inside stores and on Coke vans driven around neighborhoods like
Inwood and Bushwick.
</P>
<P>
   Through their tie-ins to baseball and soccer, both Coke and
Pepsi seem determined to win consumers by appealing to them while
they are playing sports. Marketers have learned, the hard way, that
younger consumers don't necessarily listen to TV commercials or
develop brand preferences easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be there on a number of fronts to grow the
brands,'' Hudson said. And tying a soft drink to a baseball game,
or a soccer match, and celebration seems to play well with parents,
she added. ``Right or wrong,'' she said, ``kids drink soda.'' &QL;

IT FEELS SO GOOD TO CONFESS

   In a dramatically lighted room, two police officers stand over a
criminal defendant. One reads the Miranda rights, and the accused
closes his eyes. Suddenly, his chair seems more comfortable and the
one-way mirror on the wall becomes a sea of interested faces. The
female officer's uniform seems a softer shade of blue, and the look
on her face becomes one of sisterly concern. The defendant opens
his eyes and begins to recount his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did you think you were, the Oprah Winfrey Show?'' I snap
at my client. I have just received a copy of the statement he
provided to the police, including a written waiver of his Miranda
rights. My expression is one of incredulity, but in fact, I am used
to this. I have represented hundreds of criminal defendants, and
all of those who were told about their right to remain silent ended
up waiving it. Even those with tattoos professing their disdain for
law enforcement seem to love to tell the police their side of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   I have reached an inescapable conclusion: Miranda has become
meaningless. In the age of Oprah, everyone wants to confess.
</P>
<P>
   I was therefore less than impressed last week by the Supreme
Court's decision to reaffirm the Miranda rule. Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist characterized the Miranda rights as ``part of
our national culture,'' and he was more right than he knew. The
Miranda warnings _ intended to protect the accused from unwittingly
providing the best evidence against himself _ have become so much a
part of our culture, so familiar, that no one who receives them
pays any attention.
</P>
<P>
   I have often wondered why my clients make statements to the
people who are prosecuting them. Are they really so naive? In some
cases, yes. One man told the assistant district attorney
questioning him: ``I wanted to have a lawyer present, but that's
OK. You seem real nice.'' He proceeded to explain how the incident
was just an argument, not a robbery. The ``nice'' prosecutor got
him indicted _ for robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Many others share a common misunderstanding about Miranda. One
client proudly boasted, ``When they arrested me, they didn't read
me my rights!'' He clearly expected this to make the charges
against him disappear. When I explained that the police don't have
to give Miranda rights precisely at the time of arrest, he looked
crestfallen. Of course, at the precinct, after being read his
rights, he had confessed. He thought it didn't matter at that point
because the police had made such a big mistake in failing to read
them when he was first handcuffed _ ``like on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   But by far the most popular reason for confessing is the Oprah
phenomenon. Everybody wants his turn in the spotlight. Why else
would people go on national television to talk about their cheating
spouses or their food addictions or their cheating spouse's food
addictions?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the attention of those who are building a criminal
case against you has the same appeal. So, as the Miranda warnings
are read, my clients don't seem to be thinking, ``Should I talk?''
but rather, ``How can I keep my viewers interested?''
</P>
<P>
   That is why I don't much feel like rejoicing over Miranda's new
lease on life, even though I embrace the principles that underscore
the rule. For me, the recitation of ``you have the right to remain
silent ...'' sounds just like theme music for a precinct version of
a talk show.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa has so
exasperated AIDS researchers that some have decided not to attend
the international AIDS conference next week in his country. First
he said AZT, which has safely helped prolong the lives of hundreds
of thousands of people with HIV, might be too toxic for his people.
Then he announced that he was willing to entertain the ridiculous
views of the marginalized scientists who say HIV does not cause
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mbeki spoke to an audience in San Francisco a few
months ago, his iconoclasm began to make sense. He focused on a
stark reality: the pharmaceutical-based model of HIV care in the
West is not applicable to South Africa. He may be arriving at this
conclusion by a route involving some indefensible detours, but the
conclusion itself is sound.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. South Africa has one of the fastest-growing
HIV epidemics in the world, though with 20 percent of the adult
population infected, it is in better shape than many of its
neighbors in southern Africa, where 25 percent to 35 percent of
adults have HIV. Most of the infected South Africans will die of
AIDS, leaving behind hundreds of thousands of orphans with fewer
resources and adult caretakers than if AIDS had been kept at bay.
The economy is likely to weaken as people in their working years
fall ill. The world held its breath as South Africa moved
essentially bloodlessly from apartheid to a stable democratic
government. Will HIV unravel its stability?
</P>
<P>
   Cost is the obvious barrier to drug therapy. An HIV cocktail
costs between $10,000 and $15,000 a year _ unaffordable at a tenth
of the price for the South African government, which spends about
$40 a year per person on health care. But Mbeki stressed something
else: the lack of a social, economic and medical structures to make
drug treatment work. Even in the West, where we have an array of
social agencies to help, patients do not always comply with
complicated regimens of HIV treatment. If cheaper drugs arrived in
South Africa by the shipload, how would one get people to take
them?
</P>
<P>
   The history of another disease, tuberculosis, is sadly
instructive. For years some southern African nations have had
large-scale TB programs with cheap, easy-to-take drugs, but have
not made a dent in infection rates. Meanwhile, on black markets, TB
drugs have different value depending on whether they are ``wet'' or
``dry.'' A wet pill is one that a patient puts under his or her
tongue in the presence of a health care worker and then spits out
later to sell. If South Africans had easy access to HIV drugs,
imagine their black market value in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa,
where there are virtually no medications.
</P>
<P>
   A more immediately compelling issue is transmission of HIV from
mother to child. AZT for mothers-to-be, combined with Caesarean
section and other medical care, has practically eliminated
transmission during birth in the United States, and when Mbeki
dismissed AZT, he angered many physicians. But in a way his stance
is perfectly rational.
</P>
<P>
   With no medical intervention, about one-third of children born
to an infected mother will contract HIV; AZT treatment alone could
cut this rate in half. But the United Nations estimates that 15
percent of HIV-positive mothers infect their children through
breast-feeding. So even if mother-to-child infection were lowered
at birth to 15 percent, six months later many infants would end up
infected. One might legitimately ask if an AZT program is worth the
effort and cost if you still end up with a high infection rate
among infants.
</P>
<P>
   There is no alternative to breast-feeding for most women in
South Africa. There is little infant formula, and even if there
were more, many rural women would not have clean water to mix it
with. Moreover, HIV carries such a social stigma that infected
women have been driven from their homes and villages. Few would
want to signal infection by bottle-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   What Africa most needs is an HIV vaccine. Although there is an
international research effort, pharmaceutical companies, motivated
by profit, have not put their formidable resources into a vaccine,
since the nations that need it would not be able to pay much for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling HIV in South Africa now would require an
international effort on the scale of the Marshall Plan: creating
incentives to produce and distribute medicines and providing clean
water, sanitation, clinics, health education, refuge for women and
care for children. This is not on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves South Africa little choice but to aim for less and
hope for an affordable vaccine. The best policy would probably be
to provide inexpensive antibiotics to fight the principal
opportunistic infections of AIDS and the sexually transmitted
diseases that increase HIV infection rates and to finance
preventive education and efforts to destigmatize HIV infection. As
Mbeki says, the Western model of fighting AIDS is of little use to
Africa now.

at Parsons School of Design, treats HIV-positive patients.)

   I had opted for an excursion with Hollywood Fantasy Tours, which
operates out of a side-street storefront in the part of Hollywood,
just east of Highland Avenue, that vaguely resembles Belgrade after
the bombing runs. For about $40, a tourist can get a Beverly
Hills/Hollywood combo tour _ two hours seeing stars' homes in
Beverly Hills and Bel-Air, with a short stop at Rodeo Drive,
followed by a one-hour meander through Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   (What they didn't tell us is that these tours are not
necessarily contiguous. The two-hour morning tour came in at an
hour, 35 minutes _ ``You still got to see everything; traffic was
just light today,'' the driver/guide said _ and the one-hour tour
was pushed back an hour, from noon to 1 p.m. That left a
time-killing gap of about an hour and a half in between the two.)
</P>
<P>
   The excursion is obviously popular with international travelers:
Among our group of six were Bovenkerk, his French wife and an older
couple from Wales.
</P>
<P>
   The guide on the first portion was astonishingly knowledgeable
about the region, offering his charges a juicy mix of celebrity
eccentricities, overdoses, indulgences, divorces, murders. To his
credit, he was careful to point out which homes were currently
owned by entertainment figures and which ones formerly were. Also,
he noted that most of the homes are just one of several owned by
the major stars, such that they might physically occupy the mansion
only a few weeks of the year.
</P>
<P>
   As for the sizzling young personalities of the day, forget it.
They favor Laurel Canyon and the Hollywood Hills, we were told.
</P>
<P>
   It was intriguing to see which stars' residences _ current or
former _ generated the greatest stir of interest. Rosemary Clooney,
Ira Gershwin ... nothing. Suzanne Somers, Ricardo Montalban ...
``Ooh!''
</P>
<P>
   Cameras were swung into firing position every few seconds, for
homes associated with Cary Grant, Joan Collins, Clark Gable,
Sylvester Stallone, Perry Como, Jean-Claude Van Damme ... Ray Kroc
_ yes, the founder of McDonald's rated quite a bit of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Would these people really be able to remember which house was
which once they got back home and spread the prints out on the
kitchen table for neighbors and family? And imagine the composition
of those photos. Most of the homes are positioned behind massive
gates at the end of winding drives, and the tour driver can't
exactly pull to the curb and let everybody out in this type of
neighborhood. So the description of any particular shot might have
to be: ``This is the side post of the van, part of the seat belt,
that's a gate to Joe Pesci's house _ I think _ and this fuzzy part
back here is a corner of his roof.''
</P>
<P>
   The Welshman was leaving nothing to chance, though. He rode
shotgun with his camcorder, so he could enjoy a 180-degree aim
while also recording the driver's running commentary. And he never,
ever seemed to stop filming. Thus, he saw all of Beverly Hills and
Bel-Air through an eyepiece, and his tape figures to be roughly as
long as our tour. (Sure to provide many a scintillating evening
back home.)
</P>
<P>
   We made a brief stop at the Greystone Mansion, maintained by the
City of Beverly Hills and used in so many movies that the guide
twice had to stop for breath while rattling off every last one of
them. ``The big shootout at the end of `Beverly Hills Cop' was shot
right over there,'' he said, pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah! Oh, yeah!'' the couple from Holland squealed in
recognition before scurrying through the shrubbery to see the
swimming pool area used for the party scene in ``The Bodyguard.''
(``It's so shallow,'' one said, in obvious disappointment.)
</P>
<P>
   Later, while motoring slowly past the Beverly Hills Hotel, the
guide indicated a bungalow and said, ``9A. That's where Marilyn
Monroe met with John F. Kennedy. That's a fact _ unless you're from
Boston, then it's a rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there,'' he said at another point, ``W.C. Fields used to
sit on the sidewalk on Saturdays and shoot at children and dogs
with a BB gun. He was usually so drunk he didn't hit anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, one of the foreign tourists said to me, ``Very
interesting. So, do you believe him?''
</P>
<P>
   In this setting, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   In the Hollywood portion of the tour that came later, with a
different guide, foreign visitors _ especially those for whom
English is a second language _ were sure to wrestle with a
different challenge: simple comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   As we crawled through the congested, hazy streets of Hollywood,
the young woman who was our guide referred to a mural that depicts
``the departure of the Red Sea in `The Ten Commandments,'''
provided some information about ``director Cicely DeMille,'' noted
the distinctive architecture of ``the Cinema Dome,'' and said of
Melrose Avenue: ``It's, like, a famous street because there's a lot
of famous stuff going on on Melrose.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the trolley-like bus made a two-minute stop along
Hollywood Boulevard so the occupants could get a quick photo of the
Hollywood sign, which was barely visible through the June gloom.
The tourists would have to be content with a shot framed by the
landscaping of a Tommy's hamburger joint.
</P>
<P>
   But disenchantment has always come with the territory in this
town. At the end of the day, I recalled the four young men who
pulled their car to the curb at Rodeo Drive. At least two guidebook
maps were opened on laps. ``Do you know how to get to Planet
Hollywood?'' one had asked in broken English and obvious
exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there used to be one here, but it went out of business.
There isn't one for miles.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. visitors bureau's Martinez noted a few days later,
``You don't know how many people are mad because they can't find
Planet Hollywood in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   It's probably equal to the number who can't find Hollywood in
Hollywood. But give credit to those intrepid visitors from distant
lands: They keep looking.

INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS CRAVE HOLLYWOOD GLITZ
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes wire service clients. ART AVAILABLE)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Barrymore was getting the worst of it. William S. Hart
wasn't faring much better. These film legends were being callously
trampled, their handprints and footprints and cursive signatures
disdained by a group of Japanese tourists stampeding toward ... the
chunk of concrete devoted to Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists regarded this segment of the Mann's Chinese Theatre
entryway as if it were a shrine, clustering around its edges,
clicking cameras, rolling camcorders, stooping to be photographed
while beaming up from a tacky tribute to sad, sorry Norma Jean
Mortenson.
</P>
<P>
   This is what international travelers clamor for when they visit
Southern California. They are fascinated by the world of illusion
that is movies, TV and entertainment celebrity, according to a
survey of tour guides, hotel concierges and other tourist-industry
professionals. Our foreign guests are desperate for a glimpse of
this world. Of stars. Of neighborhoods that might be home to
real-life ``Melrose Place'' or ``90210'' angst and melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for the most part, this world doesn't exist. But the
tourists don't seem the least bit deterred. Hey, this is L.A. They
seem determined at least to search.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want anything that comes out of Hollywood,'' said Sam
Hiasat Jr., tour manager for Corporate Coach Charters and a former
tour guide. ``For some reason, Hollywood has a lot of influence
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not Hollywood, it's (Universal) CityWalk,'' added Jeff
Dickey, author of ``Los Angeles: The Rough Guide,'' which is
marketed extensively in Great Britain and Australia. ``I think,
unfortunately, that's one of the sad realities of travel in
general. People will go for the stereotype first and then go to
actual exploration of the city later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best attractions of L.A. are the ones people miss _ Old
Town Pasadena, the L.A. County Museum of Art, downtown, the Bunker
Hill area. But a lot of these places fall by the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's stereotypes the international visitors want, L.A. is
certainly flush.
</P>
<P>
   According to several travel professionals who serve foreign
tourists, the sites and attractions in greatest demand are, in
order (take a deep breath): Mann's Chinese Theatre, tours of movie
stars' homes, Universal Studios and CityWalk, the Hollywood sign,
the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a studio tour (either Paramount or
Warner Bros.), any taping of any TV show, and a visit to a beach
where lifeguards wear bright-red suits and carry around those
oblong plastic floats.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, which maintains
offices in Tokyo, London and Frankfurt, Germany, has observed a
peculiar phenomenon in terms of specific interests of visitors. In
many foreign lands, according to spokeswoman Carol Martinez, ``they
get our TV shows, but they get them late. I ask (international
tourists) what's popular in their countries and they say, `Melrose
Place,' `Friends,' `Baywatch.'''
</P>
<P>
   The preoccupation with Hollywood glitter is so acute, according
to Hiasat, that ``in the last few years, Universal has taken over
from Disneyland (as the leading theme-park preference).'' Paul
Mones, a member of the concierge staff at the Century Plaza Hotel,
has observed a similar interest in the park, because ``unlike the
one in Florida, we actually make movies here. You can see sets of
movies that will come out at Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the foreign tourists have sated their hunger for the world
in front of the camera's eye, their tastes run a wide gamut,
according to the travel professionals. Fortunately _ refreshingly _
some dabs of culture are mixed among the diversions. Roughly in
order of popularity, the other tourist sites are: Rodeo Drive,
Disneyland, the Venice Beach boardwalk, the Getty Center, shopping
malls (especially popular with visitors from countries that don't
offer the astounding variety and value of our outlet stores), the
Santa Monica Pier, the Queen Mary and Malibu/Pacific Coast Highway.
</P>
<P>
   But since Tinseltown, by resounding consensus, is the hottest
button for the majority of L.A.'s international visitors, it seemed
appropriate to sign up for one of the many van tours that serve the
area _ thereby seeing this mecca from the perspective of the
pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   It would probably make most longtime Southern Californians weep.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, as we well know, is not an enchanting land of movie
and TV magic. It is rundown, noisy and filthy, a jumble of ghastly
souvenir shops, strip malls and dilapidated buildings, all choked
with cross-town traffic of commuters trying to get someplace
better.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of a three-hour tour, a glassy-eyed Marvin
Bovenkerk of the Netherlands stepped from the bus and said,
haltingly, ``Hollywood, it looks ... past glory? Is that the
word?''
</P>
<P>
   Yep. On the nose. He'd learned English well.

50 NOBEL LAUREATES URGE CLINTON TO REJECT ANTI-MISSILE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of 50 Nobel laureates has signed an open letter to
President Clinton urging him to reject a proposed $60 billion
missile defense system. The group said the plan would be wasteful
and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system would offer little protection and would do grave
harm to this nation's core security interests,'' the laureates
wrote before the system's ground-based interceptor is tested on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   All the signers are U.S. citizens or have worked much of their
lives in the United States,
</P>
<P>
   The letter, to be sent Thursday to the White House, was
organized by the Federation of American Scientists, a group in
Washington that opposes the missile plan. Its president, Henry C.
Kelly, is a former Clinton administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Although laureates occasionally band together in informal groups
to address issues, it is unusual for so many to do so. Federation
officials said the assembly might be the largest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Hans A. Bethe, a Nobel winner in physics who was a main
architect of the atom bomb, helped write the letter and was the
first to sign. The others include 21 who won in physics, 11 in
chemistry, 14 in biology or medicine and 4 in economics,
representing about half of all living American science Nobel
winners.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page letter said scientists independent of the Pentagon
have long argued that foes could outwit or overwhelm any such
attempt at defense. The letter also noted that North Korea, whose
missile program is a main reason that the Pentagon wants to build
its system, had recently taken steps toward reconciliation with
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other dangerous states will arise,'' the letter said. ``But
what would such a state gain by attacking the United States except
its own destruction?''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also said introducing such a system could itself
prove dangerous. Russia or China, the letter said, might think that
a more expansive missile defense was imminent and respond by
building more nuclear weapons and readying missiles for ``launch on
warning,'' a hair-trigger strategy widely viewed as raising the
risk of accidental nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the next planned test of the proposed anti-ballistic
missile system works,'' the group wrote, ``any movement toward
deployment would be premature, wasteful and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Pentagon said the group, although
prestigious, had no access to secret information about the proposed
system's feasibility or to intelligence on global missile threats.

 &HT;    Sports' largest broadcast network spreads Braves, Atlanta
countrywide
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - It is a broadcast signal that covers Dixie like the
dew and extends outside the South like a shadow across the nation.
Its affiliates range from West Virginia to Louisiana to the U.S.
Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   From any open window, it seems, one can hear Pete Van Wieren's
Diamond Notes, Skip Caray's acerbic wit and unique single-syllable
play-by-play work _ ``no runs, no hits, no ears'' _ and the
been-there-done-that wisdom of ex-players Don Sutton and Joe
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves' radio signal emanates from the 50,000-watt,
clear-channel voice of WSB-AM (750) that reaches up to 38 states at
night _ stretching out of the Georgia capital to the Midwestern
plains and the New England coast; from the 1,000-watt daytime
signal of WRNX in Tupelo, Miss., where Elvis' relatives might be
listening; and from the modest 35-watt nighttime signal of WEIS in
Centre, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the power, it all sounds the same, except perhaps for
the occasional crackle of summer-storm interference.
</P>
<P>
   The 174 affiliates form the connection that brings Braves
baseball _ and Atlanta _ into the homes and offices and barber
shops on the largest network for any team in any sport, according
to Charles Youngs, WSB Radio director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   What radio misses, television gets. When it comes to exposure,
the Braves are without peer in baseball. The 90 telecasts on TBS
reaches 79.5 million homes in 50 states. Not even the Cubs and
White Sox on Chicago superstation WGN come close; they reach 47
million homes in 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Braves' Wednesday telecasts on Fox Sports Net play to
the largest regional network, because 7.95 million subscribers to
Fox Sports Net South is tops among regional networks.
</P>
<P>
   The saturation has made the Braves broadcasting team celebrities
with its own trading card; you can get one through TBS. Van Wieren
first learned in the late 1970s on a road trip to San Francisco
that he had become a familiar name
</P>
<P>
   ``TBS used to broadcast the games live and then replay them at 1
o'clock in the morning,'' Van Wieren said. ``Ernie Johnson, Skip
and myself were out to dinner one night in San Francisco, and
somebody sent us over a drink. We couldn't understand where it was
coming from. It was from a fan that had begun watching the Braves
on cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first inkling we had that we were going to get
that kind of attention outside of the Southeast.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a million more tune in to each Braves game on the radio.
(The only exact figure made available by WSB, flagship station of
the radio network, is an average of 735,000 in the 18-to-54 age
group.)
</P>
<P>
   Skyler Hoschall is a 13-year-old Braves fan living on St. Simons
Island who listens on a Brunswick station. She has become addicted
to Braves broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was about four or five years ago,'' Skyler said.
``My dad was watching, and I just kind of started watching it along
with him. I just started loving it.''
</P>
<P>
   She has even asked her teachers if they'd put the games on radio
or TV during classtime. ``They said no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a catch-as-catch-can issue with Skyler and myself,''
her father, Len, said. ``When we go out to dinner, we'll certainly
pay attention to the game on the radio on the way to the
restaurant. If the restaurant has a TV, we'll ask them to change
the channel to the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   To Maj. Randy Rowe, stationed at Maxwell Air Force Base in
Montgomery, Ala., listening to the games on radio takes him back to
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barber shop on base is still that Andy Griffith type of
setting, the place to talk baseball,'' he said. ``I think baseball
is a sport best listened to. A good radio announcer paints the
picture for you. The Braves have a pretty darn good announcing
crew. I'm a big Skip Caray fan, and I know a lot of people can't
stand him. I like his humor. I'll seldom watch the Braves on TV. I
almost always have them on the radio, maybe 90 percent of the
games, whether it's at work, at home or while I'm driving.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the banter in the barber shop lately has been about
pitcher John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``But quite honestly, the biggest topic of conversation down
here is Bobby Cox,'' Rowe said. ``Most people down here think Cox
should have won five world titles by now and that he can't manage.
That's always the topic of conversation: Did you hear what Cox did
last night?''
</P>
<P>
   If Rowe thinks radio broadcasts take him back to a simpler time,
then Jodi Allison of St. Simons represents the new-age fan. She
listens to WSB every day at work on the Internet from her computer
speakers. ``All nine hours that I'm at work,'' she said. ``I got
addicted when I was a freshman at Georgia Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   She wears a radio headset to other sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a better experience than watching on TV,'' Allison said.
``It's neat to listen to it on the radio because you have to
imagine it more than you can just see it on TV. Your mind has to
work a little bit harder. You are dependent upon their voices to
really highlight the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Rudy Seanez hurt his arm, their voices dropped really
low, and when they said, `Oh, no,' you realized that this is really
serious. On the radio, you're so much more dependent on the
broadcasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she's younger, at 24, than Caray's 25-year career as a
Braves broadcaster, Allison said she has memories as a child of
listening to Skip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought he was so funny in an insulting kind of
way,'' she said. ``He insults people a lot. Even (on) the Skip
Caray Show now sometimes, I really get upset. I'm like, he is being
rude for a sports show. It's different if you're listening to Neil
Boortz; you automatically know that something like that's going to
happen. But not Skip Caray.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves broadcast has become a way of life for the elderly
and shut-ins. ``The whole bunch of us here await your coming
Braves' broadcasts like children await Christmas morning,'' John W.
Dennis wrote Larry Bevins of WVOW in Logan, W. Va., before the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis is an inmate at Wallens Ridge State Prison, a
penitentiary for hardened criminals in Big Stone Gap, Va. Warden
Stan Young said he could not comment on Dennis' stay, his crime or
his cell block. ``They can have their individual radios,'' the
warden said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis wrote, ``It is the most miserable of existences and
devoid of anything to break the mind-devouring scourge of monotony.
I know now how Private Prewitt felt in the stockade in the novel
`From Here to Eternity.' . . . The one thing that can't be stopped
is the signal from your station to our radios.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Small of Ringgold, who as a child would lie in bed with a
transistor radio listening to Vin Scully doing Dodgers games in Los
Angeles, now listens to day games as he services the 200 pay
telephones he owns within a 75-mile radius of Ringgold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day goes by quicker when there's a Braves game on,'' Small
said. ``They need to have the day game of the week. Better yet, the
day game of the day.''

 &HT;    CLINTON TO HOST CRUCIAL MIDEAST PEACE SUMMIT NEXT WEEK
 &HT;    650&AMP;Add
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS and LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a final high-stakes bid to broker an end to half
a century of enmity and war in the Middle East, President Clinton
said Wednesday he will host Israeli and Palestinian leaders next
week for a peace summit at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for both sides are scheduled to arrive in Washington
this weekend, with formal talks to open next Tuesday at the
historic presidential retreat among Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that there was ``no guarantee of success,'' Clinton said
face-to-face talks between Barak and Arafat offered the only hope
of rescuing a peace process that has ground to a dangerous
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To delay this gathering, to remain stalled, is simply no
longer an option,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House. ``If
the parties do not seize this moment, if they cannot make progress
now, there will be more hostility and more bitterness, perhaps even
more violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimming prospects for a quick breakthrough, though, were Barak's
political weakness and a hard line taken by Palestinians in
pre-summit remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Already battling dissent within his narrow coalition government,
Barak suffered yet another blow on Wednesday when two factions said
they would pull their support rather than be party to further
concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who has vowed to take any peace accord to a direct
referendum, voiced confidence that he could deliver a peace accord
the Israeli people would accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be able to seize the opportunity, exploit it and
try to put an end to the conflict, if it's possible, in a way that
keeps the dignity and respect of both sides,'' Barak said in Paris,
where he met briefly with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia, meanwhile, said the
two sides remained worlds apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have common ground on any of the issues,'' said
Qureia, according to the Associated Press. ``There are big gaps on
all the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of turning the tide, Clinton will host Arafat and Barak
at Camp David, the isolated presidential compound where President
Carter brokered the historic Israeli-Egyptian peace accords in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Like the summit Clinton oversaw two years ago between Israelis
and Palestinians at the Wye River Plantation in Maryland and the
failed Israeli-Syrian peace talks he hosted last January
</P>
<P>
   in Shepardstown, W. Va., next week's peace talks will be close
enough to the White House for Clinton to be on hand as needed, but
far from the glare of media scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I hope that the setting will help to inspire them
and to inspire us,'' Clinton said. ``It gives us a reasonable
chance to work in quiet and without interruption, and to observe
the necessary discretion that, without which, we won't be able to
move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Carter in 1978, Clinton is heading to Camp David with no
assurance of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lie the most profound
questions, about beliefs, political identity, collective fate,''
said Clinton. ``There is clearly no guarantee of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Barak are working against a self-imposed Sept. 13
deadline for resolving the most difficult issues outstanding
between them. Those include the question of Palestinian statehood,
permanent borders, the future of who controls Jerusalem and the
matter of whether Palestinian refugees may return to their former
homes in Israeli-controlled lands.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for both sides have been haggling over those issues
in earnest for several months. The talks have bogged down in recent
weeks, and Arafat has threatened to unilaterally declare
Palestinian statehood by Sept. 13 if an agreement is not reached, a
move that could trigger fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aim is to produce a working blueprint for a permanent
status agreement, or comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace
accord, to be inked by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTION ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to reach agreement on all the core issues of
permanent status,'' said State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher. ``That's the intention at this summit and that's what we
would hope to do here and now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been angling for a summit for weeks, but has said
repeatedly that Barak and Arafat were too sharply divided to sit
down for face-to-face talks.
</P>
<P>
   After being briefed on the situation by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who returned from the region last week after
several days of meetings with both leaders, Clinton decided that
the atmosphere was souring between Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've hit a wall,'' said a senior White House official who
briefed reporters Wednesday on background. ``The logic of stalemate
was beginning to reflect the way the negotiators were dealing with
each other. They were beginning to produce more bitterness than
results.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Clinton stressed that both sides must be
prepared for painful compromises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace under circumstances like these is never cost-free,''
said Clinton. ``Neither side can achieve 100 percent of its
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton immediately began scrubbing planned events, clearing his
schedule for what promises to be a difficult summit likely to last
a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be there a lot and I'll work as hard as I need to
work,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would not predict how long the summit would last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we work hard we can get it done in several days,''
Clinton said. ``But I will give it whatever time is required, as
long as we're still moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior aides said no deadline has been imposed on the summit,
though Clinton is scheduled to leave for Japan on July 19 to attend
the annual meeting of heads of state from the so-called Group of
Eight industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process has been complicated in recent weeks by
Barak's political problems. Barak's Interior Minister, Natan
Sharansky, announced Wednesday that he planned to resign from the
government next week, as did the National Religious Party, also
part of Barak's thin ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Sharansky's Immigrants Party and the National
Religious Party would leave Barak's coalition with only 59 seats in
the 120-member Knesset. Barak could still manage to govern,
however, as he can rely on the support of a handful of Arab
legislators not formally part of his coalition.

MUSEUM TO EXHIBIT RARE BLUE WHALE SKELETON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMAL E. WATSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. _ The scene was remarkable, as hundreds of
camera-toting spectators and scientists gathered on Second Beach in
Middletown, R.I. to watch history unfold.
</P>
<P>
   A giant blue whale sat impaled across the bow of a ship, its
eyes bulging and skin torn away. The 66-foot whale _ so rare that
one like it hadn't been seen on the East Coast for 100 years _ had
been struck by a tanker in a wild ocean storm and dragged hundreds,
if not thousands, of miles across the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Even as gawkers approached the carcass, officials at the New
Bedford Whaling Museum began an intense battle to claim the bones.
Under pressure from US Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and US Rep. Barney
Frank, the National Marine Fisheries Service awarded care of the
whale's skeleton to the museum, over other institutions including
the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were extremely excited,'' said Anne Brengle, executive
director of the Museum. ``New Bedford is a major whaling center so
it makes sense that the whale is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a painstaking two years spent piecing the bones back
together, the mammal's skeletal remains will be on display at the
museum beginning Friday _ making it one of only three locations in
the country where the public can view a complete blue whale.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-ton species, which scientists believe was between four
and six years old when it was killed, was towed to a Middletown
beach by bulldozers in March, 1998. Its ribs, vertebrae and
shoulder on the left side were broken, apparently from the impact
with the tanker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many people at the beach it was incredible,''
said Lee Heald, director of programs at the Whaling Museum who
first pitched the idea to Museum officials about requesting the
skeleton. ``I took my children. It was something that was important
for them to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven scientists huddled around the animal to take
samples of blood, skin, organs and other tissues for future study.
</P>
<P>
   The whale's carcass was then taken to a New Bedford landfill
where volunteers and city crews guarded the skeleton throughout the
night until the flesh and blubber could be stripped from the bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was amazing. Everyone came together to make sure this
would happen here in New Bedford,'' said New Bedford's Mayor
Frederick M. Kalisz, Jr. ``It was a fantastic feeling.'' The whale
- which has been named KOBO - King of the Blue Ocean - by sixth
grader Katie Hallett, has rallied the city, which has seen some
hard financial times over the past few decades. ``The city is
really undergoing a renassiance,'' Kalisz said. ``This exhibit was
a public-private partnership. It was a phenomenal achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   The skeleton's debut comes just as museum officials are
celebrating an $11 million renovation and expansion project of its
current facility, and as 50,000 tourists stream through the city
for the annual Summerfest weekend.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second whale that adorns the two-and-a-half story
gallery of the museum. Next to the blue whale skeleton, which is
suspended from the ceiling, is a 33-foot humpback whale skeleton
which has been housed at the facility since the mid-1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Konnerth, a biologist and expert in the field of mammal
skeleton rearticulation, worked with his wife Jean to reassembled
the blue whale skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   The process, somewhat akin to constructing the world's largest
jigsaw puzzle, took more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the eighth whale that I've done,'' said Konnerth, who
was commissioned by the museum from his home in Texas. ``What was
important, was that we had to make sure that we kept everything
intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists estimate that there are only about 300 blue whales in
the North Atlantic and 4,000 in the whole world. They can swim as
fast as 22 mph. But they don't reproduce very often _ every two to
three years at most.
</P>
<P>
   The heart alone weighs three-quarters of a ton.
</P>

   Museum officials estimate that the entire display cost about
$350,000. That investment is worth it, they say, because of the
thousands of new visitors they expect to lure into the facility.

   GAS-PRICES (Los Angeles) _ Los Angeles-area motorists may soon
be paying more than $2 a gallon for gas, even as the rest of the
nation sees relief. That's because the state's refineries are maxed
out making environmentally friendlier gas for California, and the
price of Alaskan crude - which is used to make one-third of the
state's gas - has risen dramatically in the last few weeks. By Erik
Nelson and Brent Hopkins. (Will move in the ``a'' national and
``n'' California news files.)
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLICS-LATINOS (Los Angeles) _ Catholic parishes need huge
numbers of Latino lay leaders and youth ministers immediately,
particularly in Los Angeles, which ranks No. 1 for Latino
congregants, a nationwide study has found. The National Conference
of Catholic Bishops commissioned the study, called ``Hispanic
Ministry at the Turn of the New Millennium,'' to help them prepare
for a four-day gathering that begins Thursday in Los Angeles. By
Steve Carney. (Will move in the ``a'' national and the ``n''

<P>
   JUROR-PAYHIKE (Los Angeles) _ For years, California residents
have griped about the $5-a-day they are paid for jury duty.
Starting this month, that rate is changing, but not as much as
expected. And even that rate begins on the second day of jury
service; the first day is still just $5. And with the new one-day
jury requirement, most folks will be out of luck. By Jason Kandel.

</P>
<P>
   EMT-SHORTAGE _ (Los Angeles) _ The number of paramedics in Los
Angeles has fallen sharply by 150, leaving some parts of the city
uncovered and jeopardizing emergency response, firefighters said.
Union members say the plan to split paramedics with ambulances and
engines is a wrong-headed effort to make do with the shortage of
paramedics, rather than pressing the city to hire more. By Jordan
Smith. (Will move in the ``n'' California news file.)

WESTERN BUSINESSES RESUMING CAUTIOUS ATTITUDE TOWARD NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Foreign business optimism over the thaw
between North and South Korea has waned considerably in the few
weeks since their leaders met and a symbolic truckload of Coca-Cola
crossed into the North, one of orthodox communism's last redoubts.
</P>
<P>
   The precedent-setting discussions in Pyongyang, the northern
capital, between President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea and his
communist counterpart, Kim Jong Il, generated a kind of euphoria,
and talk was heard of an opening of North Korea, a reclusive nation
of 22 million.
</P>
<P>
   But now, major U.S. and European businesses are again expressing
deep caution. And Coca-Cola Co., often seen as an icon of Western
capitalism that helped lead the way into communist countries like
China and Vietnam, is vague about what it envisions doing in North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our intention to continue supplying our product to the
North Korean market,'' said John Gustaveson, a spokesman for
Coca-Cola in South Korea. ``But at this point of time, we don't
know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   While it will continue to watch the situation in the North, Coke
said, it currently has no plans to build a bottling plant there.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola would not comment on the identity of its customers in
North Korea, the people who were presumably able to taste that
first batch of Coke, and this raised suspicions as to whether the
drinks had reached ordinary North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola acknowledged that it was paid for its products.
``It was a business transaction and not just a good-will gesture,''
Gustaveson said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of recent overtures by Seoul and Washington,
officials in Pyongyang may still consider the eagerness of Western
companies to do business there as a threat. As a result, some South
Korean experts said, North Korea might limit the pace of change,
remaining highly selective and uncompromising about the investments
it accepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They perceive any hint of economic integration as a Trojan
horse,'' said Cho Sung-Ryoul, a researcher at the Institute for
National Security Policy in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after Washington partly lifted trade sanctions
against the North, the American Chamber of Commerce in South Korea
sought to send a delegation of American business representatives to
Pyongyang. A year later, despite the lifting of more sanctions by
Washington, the business group is still waiting for permission to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plenty of companies that are interested,'' said
Jeffrey Jones, the chamber's president. ``But it all depends on the
government there.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said it would take more than tempting products or
alluring business plans to get the Pyongyang authorities to grant
access to foreign businesses. Hungry for cash to rebuild its
battered economy, North Korean officials are still impressed most
by hard currency up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to believe that when you want to start a business,
you come with a bag full of cash,'' said Jean-Jacques Grauhar, head
of the North Korea business committee at the European Union Chamber
of Commerce in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle to investment in the North is that foreigners
do not know whom to deal with. Groups from the North seeking deals
with foreign investors include companies that are fronts for the
Communist Party, the commerce ministry and the North Korean army.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no single controlling entity,'' Grauhar said. ``It's
so confusing for foreign companies that the business becomes more
limited.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a representative of a French trading company, Grauhar lived
in Pyongyang for seven years, where he also consulted with foreign
companies wanting to enter the North Korean market. He cautioned
that even those companies that gain access to Northern business
representatives will face surprises. Some business practices common
in North Korea are likely to bedevil foreign executives.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the North Koreans prefer to meet in hotels and not
in their offices, making it difficult to gauge the size of the
companies they say they represent. The background and the role of
these representatives may also be hard to ascertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to cross-check everything, that you speak
to the right person who has the decision-making powers that he says
he has,'' Grauhar said. ``It takes time, and you have to meet them
again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoon Sang-Ryul, a deputy manager at Hyundai Asan Co., which
oversees the North Korean business interests of Hyundai Group,
South Korea's largest conglomerate, said decision-making in the
North is cumbersome and often difficult for outsiders to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything progresses from bottom to top by reaching a
consensus at each level,'' he said, ``and outsiders are not allowed
into the consensus-forming group. Initially, it is important to
build relationships rather than focusing on profit-driven models.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho at the Institute for National Security Policy said foreign
businesses considering investments in North Korea would do well to
remember what South Korea was like in the late 1960s, when its
relatively backward economy was being developed under the military
dictatorship of Gen. Park Chung- hee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North Koreans seem to have studied Park Chung-hee's
economic plan very carefully,'' Cho said. ``The core of his
leadership was introducing a market-based economy while maintaining
an authoritarian rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Park used his powers to ensure that concentrating investment in
a handful of industries and companies most likely to encourage fast
economic growth did not lead to social and political unrest. And
Cho said that foreigners looking to do business in the North should
expect to operate within the parameters established by a
totalitarian government.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those considerations, the North _ while it has a large,
well-trained work force _ has none of the infrastructure that
modern business relies on. The South Korean central bank estimates
that it will cost more than $50 billion over the next decade to
create the modern manufacturing base, telecommunications and other
infrastructure needed to make foreign investment a success.

FIX YOUR DISHES WITH A SAUCY NEW TWIST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you'll be grilling often this summer _ whether it's succulent
chicken breasts, huge tender steaks or fresh salmon steaks _
consider embellishing your grillworks with tantalizing toppers.
</P>
<P>
   Chic trendy salsas, cold sauces, relishes and even tapenades
require no cooking, can be put together in minutes and offer a
range of different taste sensations.
</P>
<P>
   When you tire of just plain barbecue and want to bump your
dining pleasure upward a notch or two, try a fruity or savory or
piquant creation to fancy things up. You'll find mixtures of
fruits, vegetables, herbs, seasonings and the like _ and many will
even make good dips with chips or crudites. Another plus _ you can
also toss these versatile mixtures on steamed vegetables, rice,
beans or tossed salads for interest and dynamic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that sauces and salsas know no ethnic bounds and you
can customize them to suit personal tastes. Try sprucing them up
with ginger, soy sauce, a variety of chiles, special vinegars and
even oils. You can make Southwestern-style, Asian, Mediterranean
and other interpretations with ingredients as chunky or saucy as
you like. Some recipes contain less, some have more moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit and vegetable possibilities run the gamut from peaches,
nectarines and mangos to papaya, strawberries, raspberries, jicama,
corn, tomatillos, black beans, tomatoes and beyond. It's even
feasible to make a delicious avocado salsa like one once sampled
with the crab cakes at Fog City Diner in San Francisco. Simply mix
together cut-up avocado pieces (don't mash), chopped onions,
chopped green chiles, lots of lemon juice and salt. Another time,
add some garlic pepper and finely chopped tomatoes or cooked corn
kernels. Or spread herb grilled chicken breasts with a tapenade
like they do at Lucques restaurant in Los Angeles and surround with
a ragout of onion wedges and roasted red pepper pieces sauteed in
olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   When time is really short, whip up a combination of sour cream,
prepared horseradish and Dijon-mustard to serve with beef or
chicken. Or try grilled chicken topped with a mixture of Dijon
mustard and apricot jam zapped a minute or two in the microwave
oven. Interesting mustards are another way to go when mixed with
some snipped fresh tarragon or basil and a little whipping cream. I
also favor cucumber-yogurt or sour cream sauces as well as
pineapple salsas, which can be tossed together with canned
pineapple pieces, chopped red pepper and onions, herbs and
seasonings, and a drizzle of wine vinegar and oil.
</P>
<P>
   If you keep a well-stocked pantry and fresh produce bin in your
fridge, you should have no trouble turning out a medley of
creations on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   There really are no preparation secrets or tricks, but for best
results (except in the case of tapenades) be sure to hand chop the
ingredients rather than using the food processor. Although these
sauces can be prepared just before serving (and they should be made
fresh on the day of serving), in most cases, they're at their best
if the flavors are allowed to mellow for at least an hour or two
prior to using.
</P>
<P>
   For those in a time crunch, don't be embarrassed to rely on some
of the delicious ready-made options. Trader Joe's, supermarkets and
specialty food stores stock a variety of fruits salsas, different
relishes, tapenades and sauces. Peruse the aisles _ you'll be
amazed at the variety of interesting items available.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you call these embellishments, they're bound to add
zest and new dimensions to meals. Now the only problem is deciding
which of the following recipes to make first. &QL;

BUSH VOWS TO IMPROVE 
SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000, Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ In his third recent address to a major Hispanic
organization, Gov. George W. Bush on Wednesday portrayed the
Immigration and Naturalization Service as inefficient and vowed to
change the culture at INS to improve services for new immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would spend $500 million over five years to add
personnel and provide incentives to INS workers who process
applications quickly. He also vowed to set a goal of six months for
evaluating initial applications _ a process that now can take
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with his previously announced proposal to divide INS
into two agencies, Bush said, the U.S. government can do a much
better job of helping and respecting immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes the stance will help him with Hispanic voters in
California and other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current INS is too bureaucratic, it's too stuck in the
past,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what party you're from. You've got to admit
that when it takes three to five years to process paperwork in the
INS, that's too long. It's time to reform the INS,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on his fifth campaign trip since March to this vote-rich
state, laid out his latest proposal before the annual meeting of
the National Council of La Raza, a Washington, D.C.-based Hispanic
advocacy group that serves as a watchdog on employment,
immigration, health care, education, housing and other federal
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the same group last week, Vice President Al Gore
drew strong support when he touted his plans to create Medicare
benefits for prescription drugs. He also belittled Bush's efforts
at helping indigent Hispanics in Texas, an attack that Bush said
was baseless.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said as governor he has worked to improve conditions in
impoverished subdivisions known as ``colonias'' and widen access to
health insurance. He also took credit for helping Hispanics by
pushing for lower taxes, small business incentives and education
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typical of Vice President Gore . . . I'm going to remind
him that under this current administration, the number of uninsured
has increased,'' Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew respectable applause during his speech, but delegates
said it was mild compared to the enthusiastic reception Gore got.
One of the conventioneers, Victor Morales of Mesquite, Texas, said
Gore ``does have a problem with expressing himself in a charismatic
way, but at least the record is there of helping the Hispanic
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the National League of United Latin American Citizens
last month that he wants to separate two key INS functions _ law
enforcement and immigrant services such as application processing _
into new entities. He also addressed the influential National
Association of Hispanic Journalists in Houston, promising to
respect immigrants, to oppose the ``English only'' movement and to
promote strong economic ties with Latin America.

ON GUN CONTROL, GORE HAS GONE FROM OPPONENT TO ADVOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During his first campaign for the Senate, Al Gore
was asked by the Nashville Banner in 1984 whether he could support
``stiff controls'' on firearm sales and ownership. His answer was a
resolute ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that such measures would keep handguns out of
the hands of criminals,'' said Gore, then a four-term congressman
from a rural Tennessee district who earned an ``A'' rating from the
National Rifle Association that year.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1987, when Gore was running his first campaign for
president, he gave a very different answer to gun control advocates
seeking his support on Senate legislation to ban plastic guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to do whatever it took to reduce gun violence,''
said Sarah Brady, the president of Handgun Control Inc. From that
time, she has viewed Gore as one of her movement's staunchest
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Gore has placed gun control at the center of his
campaign for president. He has attacked his Republican opponent,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, as a pawn of the NRA and proposed an
array of tough laws, including licensing new handgun buyers,
limiting gun sales to one a month and banning inexpensive and
easily concealed handguns.
</P>
<P>
   But in promoting his own gun agenda, Gore's campaign has largely
airbrushed away his early record in Congress of fighting
gun-control legislation. To Gore's critics, his stark evolution
from NRA ally to enemy provides clear evidence that on contentious
issues like gun control, abortion and smoking, Gore has molded his
views to fit political needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was positioning himself for national office,'' said Sen.
Larry Craig, R-Idaho, an NRA board member. ``I've watched him make
very calculated decisions on issues to build a national base. Gun
control was one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his supporters argue that his embrace of gun control
was a heartfelt response to a rising tide of gun violence in the
late 1980s. Gore himself credits Sarah Brady _ whose husband,
James, was partly paralyzed in 1981 by a bullet meant for President
Reagan _ with helping to change his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``The views of many people, not just elected officials, have
evolved on this issue as gun violence has become more prevalent,''
said Mark Fabiani, Gore's deputy campaign manager for
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been more consistent on the issue than Gore, and for
years has been seen as a reliable ally of the NRA. As governor of
Texas, he has signed into law several major bills the association
supported, including one allowing people with handgun licenses to
carry concealed weapons and another prohibiting municipalities from
suing gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   NRA officials said it was virtually certain that the group would
endorse Bush this fall and throw millions of dollars behind his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his opposition to stringent gun control, Bush
often asserts that a well-armed populace is an effective deterrent
to crime. ``I believe this legislation is helping make Texas a
safer place to live,'' he wrote in a letter to a voter this year
that defended letting more people carry concealed firearms.
</P>
<P>
   A review of Gore's record over 24 years suggests that his
journey through the gun-control wars has been more complicated than
either his supporters or critics imagine. Indeed, many people
suspect that Gore, a one-time divinity school student, actually
supported gun controls before he entered office. But cautious and
pragmatic to the bone, he behaved like most other Tennessee
Democrats when he became a politician, expressing opposition to gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's first campaign for Congress in 1976, for instance, he
indicated to the Nashville Banner, the more conservative of the
city's two daily newspapers, that he would not support new gun
control laws. When the paper endorsed him, Gore reprinted and
distributed the editorial, which included a glowing reference to
his opposition to gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore also muddied his position with mixed messages. In an
interview that same year with the city's more liberal newspaper,
The Tennessean, where Gore had earlier worked as a reporter and
editorial writer, he claimed that the Banner had oversimplified his
positions. Instead of opposing gun control wholesale, he told the
paper, he was open to certain restrictions, including one he
advocates today: a ban on the cheap handguns known as Saturday
Night Specials.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues say they think that Gore stifled or
concealed those pro-gun control sentiments during the 1976
campaign, fearing that he would anger voters in the 4th
Congressional District, a staunchly Democratic but socially
conservative swathe of hamlets, rolling forests and tobacco farms
in middle Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thinking is that he wavered on gun control,'' said Lloyd
Armour, who was Gore's boss on the Tennessean's editorial page.
``But you had to recall that he was from a very conservative, I
mean very conservative, district. He could not have survived if he
had been as forthright as he is now.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gore was conflicted on the issue during the 1976 campaign,
his early voting record in Washington was not. During his first
decade in Congress, Gore steadfastly opposed gun restrictions,
winning ``A'' or ``A-'' ratings from the NRA in three of his first
five campaigns. And though it appears that he did not receive
campaign contributions from the NRA, the group says it mailed
literature praising his record to its members in his district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was a stand up, rah-rah, pro-gun congressman
or senator,'' said James Jay Baker, the NRA's chief lobbyist. ``But
he was a solid vote for us, which those grades indicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his key votes in the House, Gore supported efforts to stop
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms from creating a system
of serial numbers to be used to trace weapons. The NRA argued that
the system was a first step toward national gun registration. Gore
agreed, and voted to cut the bureau's budget by $4.2 million,
killing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   After winning election to the Senate in 1984, Gore continued to
be a reliable vote for the NRA. In his first year, he supported the
gun lobby's most prized goal of the decade: a sweeping repeal of
federal gun laws that had been enacted after the murders of Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King in 1968. Gore's
father, Albert, had voted for those restrictions in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The repeal measure called for ending federal restrictions on the
interstate sale and transport of guns, restricting the government's
ability to seize weapons and significantly limiting the
government's ability to inspect firearms dealers.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore and most other southern Democrats voting for it, the
Firearm Owners Protection Act, as it was known, sailed through the
Senate by a 79-15 vote. To this day, Gore contends that the measure
contained positive provisions that made it worth supporting,
including tougher penalties for crimes committed with guns.
</P>
<P>
   But gun control advocates view the law as one of their worst
setbacks in decades, even though some of its most far-reaching
provisions were removed during negotiations with the House.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Following enactment of the repeal measure, Gore continued to
express deep skepticism about gun control, telling the Washington
Monthly magazine in 1986 that ``gun laws haven't been an effective
solution to the underlying problem of violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1987, as crack fueled a surge in gun violence, public
sentiment began to shift in favor of stricter gun laws. Congress
began to feel the pressure, and police organizations joined the
ranks of gun control advocates, giving lawmakers political cover to
oppose the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   When Sarah Brady called Gore that year to solicit his support
for the ban on plastic guns, he readily agreed. Though he was
absent for the vote, when the measure failed, he co-sponsored
similar legislation the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponents and other critics say Gore had an
additional motivation for switching sides just then: In the spring
of 1987, he had jumped into the presidential campaign. Two leading
Democratic candidates, Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, were
strong proponents of gun control, and, his critics assert, Gore was
trolling for votes in New York and New England, places where
regulating guns was popular. Gore denies that.
</P>
<P>
   Though his presidential campaign collapsed in early 1988, Gore's
advocacy for gun control grew stronger. In 1990, he helped
negotiate a bill banning certain semiautomatic weapons, and urged
his fellow Tennessee Democrat, Sen. Jim Sasser, to support it.
</P>
<P>
   His critics say Gore tried to have it both ways on the assault
weapons ban, voting against an amendment to extend the ban to more
weapons, then voting for the final bill. But gun-control advocates
say the amendment was a ``poison-pill'' that could have killed the
overall bill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Gore co-sponsored legislation named after James Brady
that required a five-day waiting period for handgun buyers. Six
years before, Gore had voted against similar legislation. This
time, he rose to give one of his only floor speeches on gun control
during 16 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence in this country and violence with guns is a problem
that must be addressed not next month, not next year, but now,''
Gore said, in a losing cause.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Gore was working for passage of the Brady Bill in
Washington, his staff was telling reporters in Tennessee that Gore
was undecided about the measure, according to news accounts in
Nashville papers.
</P>
<P>
   Both the assault weapons ban and the Brady bill were defeated in
Congress those years. But during the Clinton administration,
Congress passed both bills and they were signed into law. And last
year, Gore cast the tie-breaking vote on legislation to require
background checks for gun buyers at gun shows. The gun show bill is
now stalled in negotiations between the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say Gore's shifting views on gun control have raised
new questions about his candidness and credibility. But gun control
advocates say what matters most is that Gore is staunchly in their
camp today.
</P>
<P>
   ``His constituents may have influenced his early votes,'' Sarah
Brady said. ``But once he gave it some thought, he supported gun
control, for the right reasons.''

sides and corners of foil to shape it to pan. Remove foil. Turn pan
right side up. Place foil in pan and carefully press it into place
in pan. Now, to butter foil, place a piece of butter (additional to
that in ingredients) in pan and put pan in preheated 425-degree
oven. When butter is melted, use a pastry brush or piece of
crumbled plastic wrap to spread butter all over foil. Set prepared
pan aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place chocolate and butter in top of a large double boiler over
hot water on moderate heat or in a 4- to 6-cup heavy saucepan over
low heat. Stir occasionally, until chocolate and butter are melted.
Stir to mix. Remove from heat and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Break walnuts into larger pieces; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In large bowl of an electric mixer, beat eggs with vanilla and
almond extracts, salt, espresso powder and sugar at high speed 10
minutes. On low speed add chocolate mixture (which may still be
warm) and beat only until mixed. Then add flour and again beat on
low speed only until mixed. Remove bowl from mixer.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 1/2 of mixture (about 3 1/2 cups) into prepared pan and
smooth top.
</P>
<P>
   Place a layer of mints, touching each other and edges of pan,
all over chocolate layer. Cut some mints to fill in large spaces on
edges. (You will not use all the mints. There will be some left
over.)
</P>
<P>
   Pour remaining chocolate mixture into pan and smooth all over.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 425 degrees F 35 minutes, reversing pan front to back
once during baking to insure even baking. After 35 minutes, cake
will have a firm crust on top, but if you insert toothpick in
middle it will come out wet and covered with chocolate. It's done.
Do not bake any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Remove pan from oven; let stand until cool. Cover pan with a
cookie sheet and invert pan and sheet. Remove pan and foil lining.
Cover cake with a length of wax paper and another cookie sheet and
invert again, leaving cake right side up.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate a few hours or overnight before cutting into bars.

SEARCH FOR THE ULTIMATE SCRATCH BROWNIES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people opt for making their brownies from a mix while
others wouldn't dream of it. For those who prefer the scratch route
(including me), you not only eliminate the chemical taste of the
boxed product, but if you have a good recipe and you use good
quality chocolate and butter, you can end up with an excellent
textured and flavored result in short order.
</P>
<P>
   Now's it's time for a follow-up to the search for the ultimate
brownie. When I asked readers to share their BEST brownie recipes a
while back, two sent along recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Bassman of Sherman Oaks sent along versions from
Katharine Hepburn and Maida Heatter. The Hepburn brownie recipe _
which is a snap to make _ has made the rounds over the years, and
readers continue to enjoy it. According to notes accompanying the
Heatter recipe, which contains peppermint patties, Heatter found
the original in a Palm Beach, Fla., newspaper. It came from a local
deli, but of course she tinkered with it and added the
chocolate-covered mints, which don't melt but form a middle layer.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lapham of North Hills wrote that he has been experimenting
with brownie recipes for years, trying to come up with the perfect
recipe. The one he's sharing is, in his opinion, the best.
</P>
<P>
   With all my brownie travels and tastings through the years, I'm
sharing two of my current favorites. The first recipe, Fudgy,
Chewy, Cakey Brownies, is one I've made often. It's fabulous, and
the brownies have lots of height (more than an inch thick). The
other recipe for Triple-Chocolate Fudge Brownies is one a friend of
my daughter's recently tried and shared from the Food Network,
courtesy of Sara Moulton of Gourmet magazine. The brownies are rich
and yummy!
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to you to judge for yourself if any of the recipes
here can pass as the ultimate brownie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FUDGY, CHEWY, CAKEY BROWNIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knowing when to pull a pan of brownies from the oven is the only
difficult part of baking them. If you wait until a toothpick
inserted comes clean, they're overcooked. Check your brownies even
before the suggested minimum baking time. If a toothpick inserted
in the middle comes up with really fudgy crumbs, it's time to take
the brownies out and put them on a wire rack for cooling. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2/3 cup all-purpose flour &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon baking powder &QL; 
Vegetable cooking spray &QL; 
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate &QL; 
4 ounces bittersweet OR semisweet chocolate &QL; 
10 tablespoons (1 stick plus 2 tablespoons) unsalted butter &QL; 
1 1/4 cups sugar &QL; 
2 teaspoons vanilla &QL; 
3 large eggs &QL; 
3/4 cup toasted walnuts, pecans, macadamia nuts OR peanuts
(optional) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk flour, salt and baking powder in a small bowl; set aside.
Spray an 8-inch baking pan with vegetable cooking spray. Fit a
16x8-inch sheet of foil in pan and up 2 sides, so you can use foil
overhang as a handle to pull cooked brownies from pan. Spray sheet
of foil with vegetable cooking spray.
</P>
<P>
   Melt chocolates and butter in a medium bowl over a pan of
simmering water. Remove from heat; whisk in sugar and vanilla.
Whisk in eggs, one at a time, fully incorporating each one before
adding next. Continue to whisk until mixture is completely smooth
and glossy. Add dry ingredients; whisk until just incorporated.
Stir in nuts, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated 325-degree oven
35 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted into
center comes out with wet crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Cool brownies in pan on a wire rack 5 minutes. Use foil handles
to pull brownies from pan. Completely cool brownies on rack, at
least 3 hours. Cut into squares and serve. If not serving
immediately, do not cut brownies. (Whole brownie cake can be
wrapped in plastic wrap, then foil and refrigerated for up to 5
days.) Makes 16 brownies.

 &HT;    Re-energized Armstrong maintains pace in Tour de France
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VITRE, France _ Lance Armstrong, the defending Tour de France
champion, was so drained Tuesday after pulling his U.S. Postal
Service squad through the team time trial that he talked only to
his teammates and team director before heading straight to bed.
</P>
<P>
   After his early evening, Armstrong seemed energized Wednesday
afternoon. That's because he didn't have to expend that much energy
in the fifth stage, a 124.6-mile ride from Vannes to Vitre through
the heart of Brittany.
</P>
<P>
   The stage, won by German sprinter Marcel Wust of Team Festina,
hardly made a difference in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   France's Laurent Jalabert earned the right to wear the yellow
jersey for a second straight day by riding conservatively and back
in the pack of riders. He finished 59th and has gone through the
first five stages and 403.85 miles in 14 hours, 28 minutes, 25
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Spaniard David Canada also remained status quo by finishing 36th
to stay in second place. He is 12 seconds behind Jalabert.
</P>
<P>
   The only blip on the scoreboard among the overall leaders
involved Armstrong. He finished 25th, but because he was with the
leading group, he was assigned the same winning time as Wust's
4:19.05. His performance allowed him to pick up 10 seconds to
Jalabert and Canada, leaving him 14 seconds out of first and only
two seconds from second place.
</P>
<P>
   His gain in time, Armstrong said Wednesday, ``was nothing.
That's not a big advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got so worked up over (Monday) when we lost nine
seconds. When the peloton (group of riders) splits when someone
crashes, that's what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to never say never, but nine seconds here, 10
seconds there, it doesn't matter until the third week.''
</P>
<P>
   The only cyclists who seem to be enjoying the first few days of
the Tour are the sprinting stars who likely will never make it past
the Pyrenees in southern France next week.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the 177 riders are trying to maintain their skill
and conditioning for another 17 days. Seconds don't count much when
a race is counted in weeks and overall times by the hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here in the overall just despises the first week,''
Armstrong said. ``You can lose the first week, but you can't win
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stressful. In the flats, the sprinters shine. At the same
time, the guys riding for the overall have to really watch it. You
never know what can happen. I was behind a crash today.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams with legitimate contenders for the overall title don't
like having to defend the yellow jersey too soon.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, only two of Jalabert's Once teammates seemed to be
working to help him stay stabilized in the peloton. And one of the
cyclists running down the breakaway sprinters for Jalabert was his
younger brother, Nicolas.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Jalabert had hinted at that strategy Tuesday evening
after his Once squad won the team trial, which allowed him to
inherit the yellow jersey from Scotland's David Millar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually better in the long run for Lance winning the
Tour that Jalabert's team Once won the time trial on Tuesday,''
said Chris Carmichael, Armstrong's longtime coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to start defending the yellow until you get to
the mountains. I don't think Jalabert or Abraham Olano are
contenders. They may think they are, but they're not in my opinion.
Going through the mountains is a completely different world.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, however, is enjoying a rare Tour moment, with eight riders
among the top 10 in the overall standings. Armstrong and his USPS
teammate Vjatceslav Ekimov (fifth, 43 seconds behind) are the only
two non-Once riders in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   USPS rider Tyler Hamilton fell from 10th to 11th Wednesday and
was 55 seconds behind Jalabert. Kevin Livingston, Armstrong's
teammate, was 13th, 1:18 out of first.
</P>
<P>
   Chann McRae, who lives in Austin and rides for the Italian team
Mapei, was 51st.
</P>
<P>
   Today's stage six goes from Vitre to Tours .

GORE CRITICIZES 
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Al Gore charged Wednesday that the pharmaceutical
industry was ``polluting the public airwaves'' with a deceptive
media campaign aimed at defeating a Democratic plan to have the
government subsidize prescription drug coverage for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a teachers union, the vice president suggested the
drug industry was bankrolling the group Citizens for a Better
Medicare, which has been airing television spots criticizing plans
by Democrats to have Medicare subsidize prescription drug bills.
</P>
<P>
   Gore challenged the group to reveal the source of its funding
and said that while drug companies reap huge profits they are using
the income not for research but for expensive advertising
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, millions of dollars are going into a phony coalition
called Citizens for Better Medicare _ which is polluting the public
airwaves with special interest TV ads designed to deceive the
American people about a prescription drug benefit,'' Gore told
members of the American Federation of Teachers, holding its
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate suggested that if Citizens
for a Better Medicare were to reveal the funding source for its
current media campaign, it would show the group is not supported by
average workers but ``powerful interests lined up against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also wrote a letter to the executive director of the
Medicare group, Timothy Ryan, asking him to reveal the group's past
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law recently approved by Congress, independent groups
engaged in political activities would have to divulge the source of
their funding for political effort.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Zielinski, a spokesman for Citizens for a Better Medicare,
said his group has always been open about the fact that most of its
financial support comes from the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new about that,'' said Zielinski.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said the group's lawyers are still studying the
new disclosure law before deciding what contributions to make
public.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the group rejects prescription drug proposals
offered by Gore and other Democrats as ``government-administered,
one-size-fits-all'' plans.
</P>
<P>
   The industry prefers a public-private partnership, closer to a
recently approved House Republican plan that would have the
government provide subsidies to the insurance industry to encourage
them to offer drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Zielinski said his group has remained neutral on the GOP plan,
however, because it only addresses drug benefits and is not part of
overall Medicare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's attack is part of a multiweek campaign to portray himself
as allied with the average voter against powerful interests such as
the oil and drug companies, which his campaign has suggested have
been supporting Republican rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 30, Bush has received $380,915 in contributions from
pharmaceutical industry and its executives, compared to $84,350 to
Gore, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

`SUNNYVALE': THE APOCALYPTIC FAMILY WITH NERD IN THE GENES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his perceptive memoir of growing up in a household that was
postnuclear with a vengeance, Jeff Goodell refers to ``my train
wreck of a family'' and illustrates why that is, if anything, an
understatement. Goodell begins this account with his mother's
decision to walk out on his father, a choice she explained years
later by saying, ``I wanted to dance.'' Then he describes the way
he, his brother, sister and their parents went into free fall from
there. Years later he took his future wife to a party at which
everyone seemed to have had serial spouses, and she exclaimed,
``They're so decadent!'' He replied, ``Welcome to California.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just any part of California: The Goodells lived in the town
of the title, with a name that becomes unavoidably mocking as
``Sunnyvale'' progresses, not only for its cheery sound but also
for its Silicon Valley geography. It happens that the author's
paternal grandfather, Leonard, worked with Enrico Fermi, held a
distinguished position with Westinghouse and was never seen by his
grandson in anything other than dark slacks, white shirt and a
thin, dark tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, the old man looked like the primal nerd, which was
exactly what he was,'' writes Goodell, though he comes to regard
his remote grandfather with surprising affection by the time this
sad, enveloping book is over. With more empathy than anger, he
points out that when one of Leonard's sons died, Leonard needed to
call directory assistance to find the phone numbers of his other
children. This was pretty much par for the course within a family
heavily rooted in Silicon Valley, to the point where the author's
father suffered professional humiliation when his wife left him. At
the same time, she was also starting a promising career with an
up-and-coming computer company called Apple.
</P>
<P>
   On an all too typical morning, visiting his mother at her new
home, Goodell notices the knickknacks: ``Like many other objects in
her condo _ Christmas ornaments, key chain, T-shirts, sweatshirts,
her plastic ID badge _ the coffee mug was emblazoned with the
rainbow-colored Apple Computer logo. On mornings such as this, the
logo contrasted mightily with the decidedly unrainbow-like
expression on her face.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the bad news has to do with Jill, the author's
teen-age sister, who has begun to act out her resentment of her
mother's boyfriends and soon gets into trouble at school, even
landing in the Santa Clara County Jail one Halloween. When Jill was
growing up, Goodell writes, she found more of a family atmosphere
within the Apple corporate culture, hanging around at her mother's
office, than she did at home.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear-eyed account of what might beset an unraveling
American family anywhere but was certainly made worse by Silicon
Valley's brand of success-driven self-absorption, Goodell explains
how he became more straitlaced in response to the problems of his
younger brother, Jerry. In an increasingly hellish account of
Jerry's downward spiral, he tells how difficult it was for Jerry to
fit in, even from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sons and daughters of aerospace engineers were all lousy
baseball players and lame free-throw shooters, too,'' he writes.
``They were interested in chemistry sets and ham radios and other
hand-me-down garage gizmos. But whatever gene makes a kid seek
transcendence through wires and circuits, Jerry didn't have. He was
even more allergic to technology than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while the author quit an early job at Apple because he
found the place ``just IBM with long hair'' and later gravitated
toward journalism, Jerry felt the need for real defiance. He
became, among other things, a most unlikely gigolo, claiming to
specialize in the neglected wives of Silicon Valley high-tech
types. He drifted into drugs, alcohol and scary volatility, which
Goodell captures here with chilling precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta help me, man,'' a phone call from Jerry might go.
``I haven't eaten anything but a bag of hamburger buns in a week.''
Or: ``I'm standing next to an overpass. How would you like it if I
jumped?''
</P>
<P>
   Without the can-you-top-this braggadocio of too many
dysfunctional family stories, Goodell looks back at his brother's
unhappiness and fury and summons them forcefully. ``Someday, I want
to understand what happened to him,'' said the author's father
about Jerry. But by that point it was much too late for both of
them.
</P>
<P>
   In a book that vividly characterizes a new, fumbling, casually
disconnected style of family life and ponders its ultimate price
(when he sees a relative after a long absence, that relative has
usually undergone some dramatic transformation), the author's
once-scorned father emerges as an unlikely hero. Only in the course
of telling this story does Goodell seem to add up his father's
accomplishments, realizing that the foremost one was simply
sticking around. Having initially shared his mother's disdain for a
man who seemed boring and, by Silicon Valley standards,
unsuccessful, he comes to respect and even celebrate his father's
quiet devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every turn, he had chosen family over work,'' he writes.
``It was a choice that might have worked out fine in Portland,
Ore., but in Silicon Valley it was like choosing to breathe water
rather than air.''

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: Reward teachers who achieve most
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger Woods played 72 holes of golf at the 2000 U.S. Open and
finished first. Robert Damron played 72 holes of golf, but finished
63rd. If professional golfers were paid like teachers _ if every
golfer got the same paycheck, regardless of performance _ Woods and
Damron would both have won $10,862.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, because the game of golf rewards excellence, Tiger
banked $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   While schools will never be able to pay a teacher $800,000 for
four days of work, they should be able to reward those teachers who
perform better than their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Merit pay, as the approach is called, will move closer to
acceptance this week if the nation's largest teachers' union, the
National Education Association, ends its long-standing opposition
to pay-for-performance. The NEA is considering advising its
membership to accept plans that reward top-notch teachers who take
on tougher challenges, teach more creatively or serve as mentors.
Until now, unions have demonized merit pay and signing bonuses as
unfair to teachers on the frontlines. They've argued that bonuses
based on student performance would favor the staffs at affluent
suburban districts, where the children arrive in kindergarten
already reading, at the expense of teachers in poor rural and
inner-city schools. Fortunately, that inequity can be avoided by
linking bonus programs to student improvement, rather than to
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, teachers ought to be judged on multiple criteria,
including peer review. And teachers across the board ought to earn
higher salaries for their efforts. A survey released Wednesday by
the American Federation of Teachers, a rival of the NEA, showed
that teacher salaries lag far behind other college-educated
workers. The average annual paycheck for first-year teachers in
1998-99 was $26,639.
</P>
<P>
   That's another difference between teachers and golfers. Even
Robert Damron, the last-place finisher in the U.S. Open, has won
$649,183 so far this year on the PGA Tour.

CLINTON ANNOUNCES PLANS 
FOR MIDEAST SUMMIT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a bold bid to overcome the final obstacles to an
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, President Clinton announced
Wednesday that the two sides would join him in a summit next week
at his Camp David retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had concluded a summit held at the site that
produced the Camp David peace accords between Egypt and Israel in
1978 ``is the only way to move forward'' in the stalled
negotiations between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   But hours after Clinton's announcement, leaders of two parties
in Barak's governing coalition declared they would pull out of his
government, leaving him in a weakened position as he enters the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a top Palestinian negotiator predicted the talks
would fail, because, he said, neither side seemed willing to change
their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Saying there is ``no guarantee of success,'' Clinton told
reporters that the summit would at least help crystallize the
issues and define the gaps that have kept Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators from reaching agreement on a framework for a final
peace deal. Noting that the deadline of Sept. 13 originally set by
the two sides for finalizing that agreement is approaching, he said
it would now be up to Arafat and Barak to break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movement now depends on historic decisions that only the two
leaders can make,'' Clinton said, promising to do all he can to
help before he leaves office on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his aides had advised Clinton not to hold a high-profile
summit that could, as one White House official put it, ``fall way
short of what the president is hoping for.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton told reporters that the progress made thus far by
the Israelis and Palestinians in negotiations that began with a
White House handshake in 1993 could ``slide back into turmoil'' if
real peace is not achieved soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the parties do not seize this moment, if they cannot make
progress now, there will be more hostility and more bitterness,
perhaps even more violence,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action does have its perils, but so too does inaction,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who was in Paris meeting with French President Jacques
Chirac when Clinton made the announcement, said he would approach
the summit with ``a heavy feeling of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be able to seize the opportunity,'' Barak told
reporters, adding that he hoped to work out the remaining
differences with Arafat by their self-imposed deadline of Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Arafat said the Palestinian leader is eager as
well to meet with Clinton and Barak, even though he expressed
reservations recently about whether a summit would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The summit is scheduled to begin Tuesday with the arrival there
of the leaders. But U.S. officials plan to meet this weekend with
negotiators for both sides to define the major differences that
still separate them and set the agenda that will guide the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Those differences are big ones. Arafat, for example, has
threatened to declare a separate Palestinian state with Arab East
Jerusalem as its capital if final disputes over borders, refugees,
Jewish settlers and the status of Jerusalem, which Israel now
considers its own capital, are not resolved by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues have proven to be the most sensitive since Arafat
shook hands with the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin at
the White House in 1993. They began a peace process that has led to
the return of some of the territory in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
that Israel seized from the Palestinians in the 1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's Palestinian Authority now controls a large portion of
the West Bank and Gaza, but negotiators have been unable to resolve
disputes over where the final territorial boundaries will be drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged the difficulty ahead in dealing with the
touchy issues of boundaries and final status of Jerusalem. But he
appealed to both sides to do whatever is necessary to achieve a
true and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace under circumstances like these is never cost-free.
Neither side can achieve 100 percent of its goals,'' he said,
calling on the two leaders to work towards an outcome that meets
their ``fundamental objectives'' but guarantees ``more opportunity
and less fear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That, of course, is the ultimate prize of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how long the summit will go on at the presidential
retreat near Thurmont, Md. But Clinton said he hopes that the
historic and symbolic role Camp David has played in the pursuit of
a comprehensive Middle East peace will help create ``a positive
environment'' for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the setting will help to inspire them and to
inspire us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he chose Camp David because ``it gives a reasonable
chance to work in quiet and without interruption, and to observe
the necessary discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President Carter gave a similar answer when he was asked
in 1978 why he had chosen Camp David to host a summit between the
late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and former Israeli President
Menachem Begin.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's task then of bringing the two leaders together on an
agreement was formidable, despite Sadat's famous trip to Israel
that broke the ice with Begin and set the stage for Camp David. But
after 10 days of meeting separately with the two leaders _ while
each stayed in a different cabin on the grounds of the presidential
retreat _ Carter finally helped produce a proposal they could
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has said in interviews that without the peaceful
atmosphere created by Camp David, the breakthrough that eventually
led to Israel's return of the Sinai could not have been achieved. &QL;

 &HT;    Down-home dishes of `Mama' Lois are music to the ears of
entertainers who play Forsyth county's Lanierland
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mama'' Lois Heard doesn't look like a five-star chef.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a purple knit jumpsuit hand-painted with acrylic
tropical fish, she prattles about her sunny Forsyth County kitchen
like the 83-year-old grandmother she is, serving up sweaty glasses
of sweet tea, straightening the pillows on her overstuffed sofa,
passing around a tray piled with fat slices of coconut poundcake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, try some of this,'' she prods. ``I made it just this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you want to curl up in her lap and have her
read you a story.
</P>
<P>
   For country music's biggest stars, however, ``Mama'' Lois'
cooking is the equivalent of any listing you'll find in Zagat's
guide to fine dining in Georgia. For 25 years, this silver-haired
lady has earned a reputation as the best cook on the Nashville tour
circuit as the head chef/hostess for the stars at the homey
Lanierland Country Music Park just outside Cumming, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anybody in the business who doesn't remember that
food,'' muses hitmaker Trisha Yearwood. ``You travel all the time,
and eat all that catering, which is often pretty good. But when you
play Lanierland, you can't wait to hop off the bus and taste her
cookin'. It's like going to your grandmother's house.''
</P>
<P>
   While other music venues offer velvet-rope backstage spreads of
pesto pasta or canapes peppered with sun-dried tomatoes, Lanierland
treats its performing artists to a homemade meal prepared on the
stove by ``Mama'' Lois, who happens to be the mother of the park's
owner, Brenda Jones, and her husband, Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Each Saturday, just as the sun is setting over the
cricket-chirping fields that surround the North Georgia outdoor
concert hall, ``Mama'' Lois and her assistant, Rebecca Milford,
pull up to the backstage area with their cars loaded with
Tupperware containers full of food _ fried chicken, meatloaf
drizzled in brown sugar and ketchup, heaping bowls of black-eyed
peas and green beans dotted with salt pork seasoning, squash
casserole with crackers toasted brown on top.
</P>
<P>
   Like devoted Sunday school teachers, ``Mama'' Lois and Rebecca
lay the spread out on a flowered tablecloth like dinner on the
ground, where band members and stars walk down the line piling
their plates full of Mexican corn bread, meats, garden vegetables,
deviled eggs (with a pinch of paprika sprinkled on the top),
leaving just enough room to heap on a squiggly square of Jell-O or
banana pudding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as good as it gets,'' says Redd Volkaert, burly
guitarist for Merle Haggard, who drove his twin Sante Fe buses all
night from Pennsylvania to a recent gig at Lanierland. ``This makes
it worth the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama'' Lois has been cooking for the stars since around 1975,
when Haggard's road manager, Frank Mull, asked if she could make a
cake for the singing star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, they didn't have food backstage like they do now.
It was mostly just fruit and soft drinks,'' ``Mama'' Lois recalls.
``So I made him an Italian cream cake. And that started it.''
</P>
<P>
   From Haggard's sweet tooth evolved an elaborate backstage spread
that became famous in Nashville music circles.
</P>
<P>
   To modestly underscore her reputation, ``Mama'' Lois pulls out a
scrapbook of glossy, autographed pictures of her clients: the
Judds, Neal McCoy, Randy Travis, Alabama, Kenny Rogers, Charlie
Daniels, Lorrie Morgan, the Oak Ridge Boys, Conway Twitty.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best cook in country music _ `Mama' Lois,'' Rogers
writes, scrawled across his photo in black Sharpie ink.
</P>
<P>
   These star-studded reviews are a long way from the cookstove she
stood over during the Depression, feeding six hungry brothers and
sisters on her family's cotton farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama'' Lois learned to cook when she was just 11. Her mother,
with a houseful of hungry children to feed, became too ill to
prepare meals for her brood. In a pinch, she taught her oldest
daughter how to get up with the sun, put breakfast on the stove,
wring a chicken's neck, pick peas from the garden and make sure
dinner was on the table when her father came home from the fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always worked,'' she says, sitting not 100 yards away
from the spot where she was born. ``We mostly ate vegetables. We
seldom had meat. I pretty much cook the same way I did back then.''
</P>
<P>
   An elementary school teacher since the age of 17, ``Mama'' Lois
continued cooking for her family throughout the '50s and '60s until
daughter Brenda became part owner of Lanierland. After the Haggard
request made it clear that the road-weary stars needed some
backstage nourishment before their shows, she began preparing her
famous buffet.
</P>
<P>
   For years, her principal would let her off work early each
Friday to buy groceries. She would then hit the local market
looking for her ingredients _ young fryers, half-runner pole beans,
fresh squash (if you could find it), ripe bananas. She would get up
at dawn on Saturday, fire up the stove and begin her ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than sending in private plates to the buses parked out
back, ``Mama'' Lois and the Lanierland management offered their
meals family style, on a long table in the kitchen tucked behind
the stage. Stars and their entourage filled their plates, taking
seats at long, picnic-bench tables on a porch out back. No private
booths here _ just the squeak of a screen door.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rich and famous have enticed her for years, ``Mama''
Lois scoffs at the idea of opening her own restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seldom follow a recipe,'' she says. ``I've always used any
old thing that was around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jalapenos,'' her daughter, Brenda, reveals. ``She puts
jalapenos in everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for instructions on how she prepares her dishes,
``Mama'' Lois seems genuinely puzzled. Take her famous creamed
corn, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's really nothing to it. I think the main thing is
to have a heavy pot,`` she says, pulling a huge aluminum deep
cooker out of her kitchen cabinet. ``You don't want the corn to
stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it comes out. She tells it this way: Take two large
containers of frozen corn, preferably Copes' brand white. Put them
in the pot, and let partially thaw. Add a little water. ``Not
enough to cover the corn where it floats, but just enough to keep
it from sticking.'' Boil it for about five minutes, stirring
constantly. Then add ``thickening.'' That turns out to be about 3
heaping tablespoons of flour.
</P>
<P>
   The secret for getting out the lumps: Mix the flour with enough
hot water to make a paste. Then add it to the pot. Put in two
sticks of margarine, a teaspoon of sugar and salt and pepper to
taste. Enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Mama'' Lois makes only three or four of the dishes
these days (Rebecca prepares the rest), her reputation spills over
the Forsyth County line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If `Mama' Lois' food was a national monument, it would be the
White House,'' says country music DJ Rhubarb Jones of Y-106.7.
``Her meatloaf is a Lamborghini.'' Country star Kenny Chesney says
it's the best ``'nanner puddin''' he's ever put in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the folks who come here are Southerners,'' ``Mama''
Lois says sweetly. ``I think it makes them feel at home.''

 &HT;    Savannah's moss, mystery and memories
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH _ Every garden needs a touch of mystery, a little
surprise. A craggy rock, for example, that peeks, then leaps out as
you turn a bend after viewing a stately row of soft, fuzzy
perennials _ reminding you that contrast can be as interesting as
complement.
</P>
<P>
   Such unexpected pleasure is always what I feel when I visit this
old seaport town and see the ancient-looking Spanish moss growing
amid Savannah's New South hustle.
</P>
<P>
   I always expect the moss to be here, but I still am surprised at
how much it pleases, and evokes memories. It is the visual
equivalent of sweet smells of youth: magnolia, honeysuckle,
jasmine, gardenia. And, on my recent trip, I was amazed at how much
more profuse moss seems to have grown in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, much is always changing in Savannah, which
ironically prides itself on its unchangingness; this town has grown
quite full of itself since I began visiting as a boy soldier almost
40 years ago, long, long before ``the book'' helped make it a mecca
for the leisure people who bring so many cameras, dollars and good
vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how big Savannah's head swells, no matter how many
new hotels, restaurants and tour buses it gets, no matter how many
elegant old buildings are renovated and restored and recycled, one
fact remains unchanged: Most of us still come and go with Spanish
moss on our minds.
</P>
<P>
   That quickly became apparent during my June visit, when I
chatted with people around the historic district so flush with
oleander and energy.
</P>
<P>
   At Paddy's Gift Shop, on East Liberty at Abercorn, owner Pat
Whitlock described how deeply tourists love the gray, beardlike
strands that hang from trees, fences, telephone wires. He pointed
to a dogwood tree growing in the median, calling its low limbs a
popular moss source.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get it and drape it around their heads for photographs,''
he said. ``And they ask, `How do I look with gray hair'''?
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, at Charlotte's Corner on West Liberty at Bull,
Charlotte Parrott described similar scenes, adding that she warns
tourists that the moss contains red bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Most love the stuff too much to be intimidated by the prospect
of private itches from biting chiggers. So, Parrott asks them to
leave their booty at the door. ``Some even remember to take it
away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Red bugs are not her only objection to Spanish moss. Parrott is
among those who believe it kills garden plants, despite experts'
insistence that the plant is no parasite, pointing out that it gets
its nourishment and moisture from the air, not from host plants.
Unconvinced, Parrott said she goes around picking it off her shrubs
and trees. ``I do believe it's a parasite, yesiree.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, these days, it seems Parrott's got her work strung out for
her; I haven't seen this much moss in years. Pollution, hurricanes
and chemicals used in mosquito spray all have been blamed as
killers of the moss. Now, either the environment is more hospitable
or Spanish moss has adapted to bad conditions. Or it looked like
more to me because it had been too long since I'd seen it.
Whichever, it provided what so many of us seek on the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging from a crape myrtle or a live oak, Spanish moss evokes
both carefree days filled with something cool and scary night
passages along swamp-lined roads. It is the life of luxurious
languor and a visit to the graveyard at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Remnants of clumps I collected years ago still drip from the
Japanese maple and ligustrum growing many miles north of the moss
line near Macon, bringing a touch of Savannah to my tiny plot in
Atlanta. A touch of mystery. Surprise.

 &HT;    How sprinklers have the lawn covered
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you don't have an irrigation system, you know the drill: Set
out the sprinkler, turn on the water, adjust the sprinkler, get
wet, move the sprinkler, get wet, forget about the sprinkler, flood
the yard ...
</P>
<P>
   To make that drill less of a chore, sprinkler manufacturers have
flooded the market with gadgets and gizmos _ some effective, some
just novelties.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you choose a sprinkler?
</P>
<P>
   The most important factor is how quickly the sprinkler delivers
the proper amount of water to an area in a uniform manner, said
Walter Reeves, the University of Georgia's horticulture educator.
</P>
<P>
   During droughts, lawns typically require an inch of water per
week, or about 600 gallons per 1,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   In an unscientific experiment, Reeves tested a half-dozen
sprinklers, which sell for about $5 to $12, to determine how
efficiently they delivered a 100-gallon sample of water. He placed
plastic cups around the sprinklers for collecting water in an
effort to gauge how evenly it was distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some put out water really rapidly, while others were
relatively slow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The results: The whirling sprinkler delivered 100 gallons of
water the fastest, at 20.5 minutes. But it wasn't the most uniform;
that honor went to the fan sprinkler, which took 24.5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Here are Reeves' observations:
</P>
<P>
   GEAR DRIVEN SPRINKLER ``It's quiet, seems to be uniform, puts
out a circular spray pattern and has a diffuser screw for adjusting
the arc.'' (Distribution time: 31.5 minutes)
</P>
<P>
   FAN SPRINKLER ``It's extremely uniform, quiet and adjustable but
requires a very long application covering a rectangular area.''
(Distribution time: 24.5 minutes)
</P>
<P>
   RATCHET SPRINKLER ``It's very adjustable, from a small arc to
360 degrees, but the pattern can create a doughnut in your lawn so
it may not distribute water as uniformly as you like.''
(Distribution time: 30 minutes)
</P>
<P>
   WHIRLING SPRINKLER ``It has a fast delivery and a very uniform
distribution, but you don't get a huge coverage (about a
12-foot-by-12-foot area).'' (Distribution time: 20.5 minutes)
</P>
<P>
   LADY BUG SPRINKLER ``Not very uniform with its circular 12-foot
spread but lends a festive atmosphere to irrigation!''
(Distribution time: 26 minutes)
</P>
<P>
   BUSY BEE SPRINKLER ``It distributes in a very amusing manner (it
slaps its head around haphazardly), but it's a favorite for July
Fourth backyard parties and lots of laughs.'' (Distribution time:
47 minutes)

   GORE-GUNS (Washington) _ This year, Al Gore has placed gun

including licensing new handgun buyers, limiting gun sales to one a
month and banning inexpensive and easily concealed handguns. But in
promoting his own gun agenda, Gore's campaign has largely
air-brushed away an early record in Congress of fighting
gun-control legislation. Gore and his supporters argue that his
embrace of gun control was a heart-felt response to a rising tide
of gun violence in the late 1980s. Gore himself credits Mrs. Brady
_ whose husband, James, was partially paralyzed by a bullet meant
for President Reagan _ with helping to change his views. A review
of Gore's record over 24 years suggests that his journey through

 &HT;    Frozen custard makes a stand
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ First came ice cream. Then the soft-serve cones
many of us call Dairy Queen, followed by frozen yogurt and its more
healthy image.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes frozen custard. It's so new to this area that
plenty of people don't know exactly what it is.
</P>
<P>
   But frozen custard isn't new. It's been served in other parts of
the country for decades. Depending on whose legend you believe,
frozen custard dates to the 1920s or '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Dan Gress for starting the local frozen custard
phenomenon. He operates a carwash in Englewood, Ohio, and while
attending a carwash convention in St. Louis three years ago,
colleagues told him he had to go to Ted Drewes' Frozen Custard,
billed as the No. 3 tourist attraction in that city.
</P>
<P>
   He went and saw a place with five walk-up windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must have been 200 people in line,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right across the street there was a Baskin-Robbins, and there
were three people in the dining room,'' says Gress' wife, Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   The business possibilities were obvious. But it was the taste of
frozen custard that sent him on a cross-country search, visiting
frozen custard operations all over the country. He came back to St.
Louis, where he tasted the first and, for him, the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me six months to find out where Drewes gets its mix,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   He convinced his wife and another couple to open JD's Frozen
Custard in Englewood. The business took off slowly, because people
didn't know what frozen custard was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first ad was `First Scoop's on Us','' he says. They gave
away cones to draw customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once they tasted it, they were hooked,'' he says. Last
year the couples joined with Tonya and Michael Rutherford to open
McCoy's Old Fashioned Frozen Custard. This year, Ritter's Frozen
Custard, an Indiana-based chain, opened a large stand in
Beavercreek, Ohio. It looks like a throwback to the 1950s, when
drive-ins had car hops. Both JD's and McCoy's also have a '50s
motif with collections of memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Dayton area has three locations specializing in
frozen custard, it's time to look at its attractions.
</P>
<P>
   How is frozen custard different from ice cream or the more
familiar soft-serve desserts?
</P>
<P>
   Frozen custard is soft, like Dairy Queen, but much more dense.
It is scooped into the cup or cone, rather than squirted from a
machine.
</P>
<P>
   It is smooth and velvety, with none of the ice crystals that can
bedevil ice cream, particularly when it's been sitting in a
half-full container for too long. Frozen custard feels creamy on
the tongue, though maybe not as rich as super premium high
butterfat ice creams such as Haagen Dazs.
</P>
<P>
   Under government regulations, frozen custard (like any product
labeled ice cream) must contain 10 percent milkfat, more commonly
referred to as butterfat. It may contain as much as 15 percent.
Cindy Gress says the frozen custard sold at JD's and McCoy's has 10
percent butterfat, with 200 calories and 9 grams fat in a single
scoop.
</P>
<P>
   Churning any ice cream product whips air into the mixture. In
the industry that aeration is called overrun. Federal standards
regulate how much air can be whipped into the ice cream mix, but
one difference between super premium and cheap ice creams is the
amount of overrun. Gress says the machines designed for frozen
custard force most of the air out of the mixture to achieve a
creamy texture.
</P>
<P>
   People who make their own ice cream will understand the term
``custard '' for this frozen dessert. Many, but not all, ice cream
recipes start with a cooked custard made with eggs as well as cream
and sugar. By government definition, frozen custard must contain
eggs _ at least 1.4 percent egg yolk solids _ or it can't be called
custard.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference from most ice cream is that frozen custard is
made fresh on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll fire up that machine 10 to 15 times a day,'' says Gress.
``Whenever you eat frozen custard it's only a few hours old.'' At
McCoy's, manager Tonya Rutherford says she sometimes runs out late
in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the waffle cones are handmade, one at a time, every
morning.
</P>
<P>
   In all three area shops ,frozen custard is served like ice
cream, in sundaes and shakes as well as waffle cones. Thick
Concretes or Glaciers _ with everything from Heath Bar pieces to
Oreo cookies stirred in _ are popular as well.
</P>
<P>
   Operators also like to create their own specialties. At JD's,
the big seller is the Buckeye Delight, with scoops of vanilla and
chocolate custard, chocolate and peanut butter topping with a
homemade ``Buckeye Ball'' on top.
</P>
<P>
   The newest addition to the lineup is Strawberry Sensation _
vanilla custard topped with fresh strawberries, hot fudge, whipped
cream and a house-dipped chocolate-covered strawberry.

HOT TRIO ALWAYS EN VOGUE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Style and grace have always been the calling cards of female r&AMP;b
group En Vogue, but nobody looked to the trio for a kind of
homespun wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the elegant ensemble has created a 13-song opus with
classical underpinnings that tells a dramatic story of love's ups
and downs. The album, ``Masterpiece Theatre'' (EastWest/EEG),
peaked at No. 67 in the charts while a single, ``Riddle,'' lingered
in the Billboard 100 last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the album is a love suite,'' explains En Vogue's Cindy
Herron. ``The whole thing is about the theme of love. Each song
tells a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Formed in Oakland in 1988, En Vogue was conceived by the
production team of Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy, both former
members of the chart-topping Club Nouveau (``Lean on Me''). Looking
for a trio that could exude sultriness, style and wit in addition
to vocal talent, the producers also wanted material that could fuse
r&AMP;b and girl-group traditions with hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Auditions for a modern-day Supremes with a hip-hop attitude
settled on former Miss Black California Herron, Maxine Jones, Dawn
Robinson and Terry Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   En Vogue's debut album, ``Born to Sing,'' appeared in 1990 and
launched the pop crossover smash, ``Hold On,'' featuring an a
cappella intro lifted from Brenda &AMP; the Tabulations' minor hit
``Who's Lovin' You,'' which peaked at No. 2 and helped the album
sell several million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, ``Hold On'' wasn't the only En Vogue song to stall at
No. 2. Two other singles did the same thing: 1992's ``My Lovin'
(You're Never Gonna Get It)'' and 1997's ``Don't Let Go (Love).''
</P>
<P>
   Says En Vogue's Ellis: ``There were unbeatable songs that
stopped us from getting the top in pop each time. But we went to
No. 1 in the r&AMP;b charts.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``Masterpiece Theatre'' saw so little chart action because
the group hadn't released an album since the gold-selling third
effort, ``EV3,'' in 1997. And the group, which lost founding member
Robinson when she quit to pursue a solo career the same year, has
become a trio. En Vogue hasn't toured in ages and there are no
plans to start anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The times are changing in music,'' says Jones. ``I can see r&AMP;b
starting to get back in the mix. Rap was dominant for a long time,
but I'm glad to see r&AMP;b come back strong.''
</P>
<P>
   En Vogue's 1992 sophomore album, ``Funky Divas,'' is now
considered a pop-r&AMP;b classic and spawned the hits, ``My Lovin'
(You're Never Gonna Get It)'' and ``Free Your Mind.'' The disc was
nominated for five Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Family obligations saw the group take a break in 1995 (both
Herron and Jones have kids), but their 1997 contribution to the
``Set It Off'' soundtrack, ``Don't Let Go (Love),'' kept En Vogue
on radio playlists across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the group released a greatest-hits collection.
</P>
<P>
   Now in 2000, ``Masterpiece Theatre'' is En Vogue's most
ambitious effort to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we went back home on this record,'' Jones said.
``It is ambitious, but we were happy to still be doing this,
especially with what we have learned under our belts.'' Adds
Herron: ``I'm at a place in my life where my priorities are my
family and my career. There's a lot more to sing about now.''
</P>
<P>
   The current disc includes splashy r&AMP;b numbers like ``Riddle''
and ``No No No (Can't Come Back),'' along with the heart-wrenching
ballad ``Sad but True,'' based on Beethoven's ``Moonlight Sonata.''
</P>
<P>
   With its Carmen-meets-urban-love twist of ``Those Dogs'' (based
on ``Vizet'' from ``Carmen'') you begin to realize ``Masterpiece
Theatre'' is a complex pop album.
</P>

   ``We've all gone through every phase of love one can go through,
good and bad,'' Ellis said. ``Every experience is reflected in
these songs. And we have a good time turning them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones recalls the sessions including multiple vocal takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really sticklers about vocals,'' she said. ``We'll do
them over and over again. You can't get them too right. It was
tough coming up with the harmonies. We heard a lot of different
music and recorded more material than we used but we wanted to make
sure we loved everything. It took a while. But we were having a
great time in the studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said having the producing team of Foster and McElroy on
board for the entire disc relieved some of the stress that usually
comes with recording.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to take more time on this album,'' she said.
``Also, it wasn't like we had to sit around and think, 'What are we
going to sound like?' They know us through and through. It freed us
to do what we do best.''

   Eds: RUNS WITH FROZEN-CUSTARD
</P>
<P>
   The historic scoop
</P>
<P>
   By Ann hellerc. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Just after the start of the 20th century, America went mad for
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cream in a waffle cone became synonymous with the St. Louis
World's Fair. Cones, shakes, sundaes and banana splits were sold in
elaborate soda fountains, as they were called. These palaces seated
hundreds and had gilded mirrors, long marble counters, tiled flours
and bent metal chairs (now collectible). By 1908, more than 75,000
soda fountains served the country. Virtually all the grand ones
have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, a Youngstown ice cream parlor operator began selling
his chocolate-covered ice cream bars from a white truck whose bells
alerted kids in the neighborhood to the arrival of the Good Humor
man.
</P>
<P>
   Some sources say frozen custard originated in Coney Island,
N.Y., and became popular in East Coast resorts, but the first name
attached to the specialty is Ted Drewes, who had been selling
frozen custard from a wagon at Midwest carnivals. In 1929, he
opened a frozen custard stand in St. Louis. In 1934, a Greek
immigrant named Thomas Carvelas in Yonkers bought a battered old
truck and started selling frozen custard. Carvel ice cream stores
sprouted throughout the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, Dairy Queen was opened in Joliet, Ill., with the slogan
``All You Can Eat for 10 Cents.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple ice cream stands proliferated throughout the countryside,
but in the 1960s and '70s, they began to disappear as customers
switched to buying packaged ice cream in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, frozen yogurt was introduced and gained popularity
through the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The late '90s saw the rebirth of the ice cream stand as an
American icon. At the turn of 21st century, Americans have renewed
their affection for high-fat ice cream. Sales of light, reduced-fat
and low-fat ice creams continue to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen custard is a part of the shift in tastes. Ritter's Frozen
Yogurt, which opened this spring in Beavercreek, is part of an
Indiana-based chain that operates in six states.

 &HT;    AirTran names new customer service exec
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AirTran Airways has replaced its top customer service
executive and begun offering curbside check-in to cut down on lines
inside airports as it grapples with record passenger loads.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the discount carrier said Marilyn Rogers, senior
vice president for customer service, stepped down last month and is
``pursuing other interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has been replaced by Thomas Kalil, a longtime executive
at the carrier who had gone to part-time status last year but is
now back in charge of customer service full time. Kalil is one of
AirTran's longest-tenured executives, having joined the company in
1995 when it still operated as ValuJet Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a renewed focus on the basics of on-time performance
and serving the customer well,'' said Tad Hutcheson, AirTran
marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike major airlines, AirTran isn't required by the government
to publicly disclose rates for on-time performance, lost luggage or
involuntary bumping.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clearly dealing with more passengers than in the past,
as demand for air travel continues to soar. AirTran on Wednesday
reported that it filled 77.9 percent of its seats in June, up from
69.6 percent a year earlier. Revenue passenger miles, a standard
measure of ridership, grew 19 percent in the month on only a 6
percent rise in seat capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Hutcheson said AirTran is now offering full passenger check-in
service at six SkyCap stations at Hartsfield International Airport
in Atlanta in an effort to streamline passenger processing and
reduce lines at ticket counters and gates. Until now, AirTran only
offered baggage check at the curbside stations.
</P>
<P>
   Full curbside check-in, a service now offered by most major
airlines, enables travelers with electronic reservations to bypass
ticket counters and gates altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers joined AirTran in early 1999 after a career at Eastern
and Northwest airlines. She was among the first top executives
recruited by AirTran Chairman and CEO Joseph Leonard, a one-time
Eastern executive who has led a profit rebound at the carrier since
he was hired in January 1999.

COMMENTARY: THE DANGER POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people who grew up in the second half of the 20th century
believed that climate change was such a gradual process that it was
almost imperceptible during the course of an ordinary lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   There may have been times when that was true, but it is not the
case now. The Earth has recently warmed so much, and the rate of
warming is now so fast, that the effects have become increasingly
obvious to the scientist and the layman alike.
</P>
<P>
   The decade of the 1990s was very likely the hottest of the last
millennium. And 1998 _ which had temperatures spiked by a large El
Nino phenomenon _ appears to have been the hottest year ever
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The oceans are rising, mountain glaciers are shrinking,
low-lying coastal areas are eroding, and the very timing of the
seasons is changing, with spring coming as much as a week earlier
in parts of the Northern Hemisphere. And all indications are that
the warming of the Earth in the 21st century will be significantly
greater than it was in the 20th.
</P>
<P>
   If there were such a thing as a global alarm bell, now would be
an excellent time to ring it.
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to the climate, we live in a different world than
people lived in even 25 years ago,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer,
chief scientist of Environmental Defense, a national environmental
research and advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last 1,000 years the Earth's temperature varied
only modestly, moving slowly up or down by less than one degree
Fahrenheit. But that changed with the coming of the industrial era
in the 19th century. At that point the Earth started getting
steadily warmer.
</P>
<P>
   As Oppenheimer put it, ``About 1860 we entered a period of about
140 years in which the rate of climate change kicked up, and most
of the changes were in the positive direction. Between the late
19th century and now, the total warming has been about 0.7 to 1.4
degrees Fahrenheit _ a little more than a degree Fahrenheit if you
take the average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, in the last 25 years, the rate of warming further
accelerated, to about three times that rate of increase. The actual
number is approximately 0.35 degrees Fahrenheit per decade. And if
you look forward over the coming decades, the rate of increase
could double again.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects are myriad. ``There is a pervasive retraction of
mountain glaciers worldwide,'' said Oppenheimer. ``The glaciers in
Glacier National Park are shrinking. And the projection is that if
the trend continues, by the end of this century many of the
glaciers will have simply disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another place where we see significant change is on the
Antarctic Peninsula, the northernmost part of Antarctica where
there's been a very large warming of 4{ degrees Fahrenheit in the
last 50 years alone. Ice shelves _ floating ice that's attached to
the continent _ are starting to disintegrate, and huge chunks of
ice shelf in recent years have simply and rapidly cracked apart and
floated off into the ocean. The whole ecosystem around the
peninsula is changing, and eventually this will have a significant
effect on the wildlife. If the ice starts to disappear, the
wildlife loses its habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another inevitable aspect of global warming is already well
under way _ the swelling of the oceans. Sea level has been rising
for the last century, and it's thought to be somewhere between four
and eight inches higher globally than it was about 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal erosion has already taken a terrible toll on beaches in
the United States. And Oppenheimer offered another dramatic example
of the price to be paid for global warming _ the potential damage
to Everglades National Park in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spending billions to preserve the ecosystem within which
that park exists,'' he said. ``But sometime later in this century,
using median projections, not even the worst projections, a third
of that park would be gone _ drowned, under water _ if we don't act
to stem the buildup of the greenhouse gases.''
</P>
<P>
   What ultimately will happen if our heads remain in the sand is
anybody's guess. Said Oppenheimer: ``The last time it was as warm
as it probably will be by the end of this century, globally
speaking, was several million years ago. There is no way we can
know for sure that that's a world we can safely cope with.''

PENTAGON PREPARES FOR THIRD TEST OF MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With ceiling-to-floor slide projections and glossy
press packets, the Pentagon described for reporters Wednesday how a
mock warhead will thunder aloft Friday night and a $30 million
rocket will try to destroy it in a high-altitude collision.
</P>
<P>
   The entire exercise, the third and most demanding to date in a
series of 19 tests for the Pentagon's national missile defense
system, will last only 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If that exercise succeeds, unlike the earlier two, President
Clinton may order the building of the first phase of a $60 billion
national missile defense system to combat potential threats from
countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq. But if the mock warhead
proceeds on course untouched, it will contribute to mounting
criticism from scientists, arms control and foreign policy experts,
and even some administration officials who doubt the wisdom and
effectiveness of trying to building a system to protect U.S. soil
from missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon briefing was held not in the Pentagon press room
but in the Rossyln, Va., office of Boeing. With its three-year,
$2.4 billion contract, Boeing is the primary contractor in the
missile defense program.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to the Pentagon plan, sometime between
10:01 p.m. Friday and 2:01 a.m. Saturday eastern time, the Pentagon
will fire a 63-foot rocket containing a mock warhead and a deflated
Mylar balloon to serve as a decoy from Vandenberg Air Force Base,
125 miles north of Los Angeles. Five minutes later, officials said,
the rocket will release its fake warhead and the balloon decoy will
inflate to a diameter of more than six-feet.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes after that, a 54-inch, 130-pound
``exoatmospheric kill vehicle'' will be launched from Kwajalein
Atoll about 4,300 miles away in the Pacific Ocean and guide itself
to a collision with the incoming mock warhead. If the kill vehicle
finds and destroys the warhead, the sky will then fill ``with a big
flash,'' said one Pentagon briefer.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Pentagon hailed its first test as a complete
success, but later acknowledged that the kill vehicle initially
drifted off course and picked out the decoy balloon instead of the
mock warhead. In a second, more complicated, test in January, the
kill vehicle missed the mock warhead by 300 to 400 feet after a
cooling line clogged and shut down its heat-seeking sensors.
</P>
<P>
   This time a communications system has been added that will
transmit information directly to the kill vehicle about the
location of the target after it has lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that Friday's test is grossly misleading because
it is taking place under conditions that do not reflect those of a
real attack. They also say that the so-called ``decoy'' is not
really a decoy, but more like a lure that will attract the kill
vehicle to the real target, and that an adversary would use not one
but many decoys. An adversary might even hide the warhead in a
decoy-like balloon, they say.
</P>
<P>
   There is one technical area that the Pentagon has not worked out
in advance of Friday's test. Reporters who want to watch a
televised satellite feed of the ``hit'' or ``miss'' will have to do
so in Boeing's auditorium. ``The Pentagon just doesn't have the
necessary equipment,'' a Pentagon official said.

 &HT;    Employers need to be watchful of teens' work limits
 &HT;    By Nushin Huq
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - He's only 16, but Shoab Makani has already
worked at five different stores, including a beauty salon and
Dollar Tree. This summer he is spending 36 hours a week selling
modems and memory chips at CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like working part time, not only for the money, but because
it keeps me busy,'' said Makani, who lives in Cedar Park and will
be a junior in high school this fall. ``I also like the
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas employers have long depended on teens like Makani to fill
their summer jobs. That need is critical in Central Texas now
because the unemployment rate in some areas is below 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the labor market is tight and there aren't enough
bodies to fill jobs, employers must still abide by teen labor laws,
state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that violations are fairly common,'' said Jerry
Ramos, head of the Child Labor Law Section at the Texas Workforce
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal laws, designed to protect teens from
potentially dangerous tasks, restrict working hours and jobs open
to teen-agers younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 teens nationwide are killed on the job every year,
according to the U.S. Department of Labor. An additional 210,000
teens are injured on the job, according to the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, more than 450 employer violations were issued last
year, according to the Texas Workforce Commission.
</P>
<P>
   If an employer violates the law, the state may assess up to a
$10,000 penalty and may seek to file misdemeanor charges.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the commission assessed $43,040 in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem area is not usually with established firms but
usually with transitory businesses,'' said Larry Jones, a
commission spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The commission finds out about workforce violations through
complaints and routine inspections by commission investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Employers, not teen-agers, carry the burden of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work requirements differ from state to state,'' said
Kellie Leonard, a Gap Inc. spokeswoman. ``Each state has different
requirements for teen workers and we just have to make sure that we
follow those laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens should also know the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage teens to enter the workforce, where they gain
values, knowledge and experience,'' said Ron Lehman, the
commissioner who represents employers. ``But at the same time, we
want to ensure that employers understand the law and provide teens
with a safe working environment.''
</P>
<P>
   For many teen-agers, its simply a matter of finding the right
job.
</P>
<P>
   Shade Kemp, 15, likes her desk in Austin Mayor Kirk Watson's air
-conditioned office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what I want to do after college,'' said Kemp, who
is working through the Summer Youth Program. ``Maybe I'll run for
mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Summer Youth Program, the city of Austin hires
teen-agers, trains them and places them in jobs with the city.
Older teens who have gone through the program may be placed in jobs
in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Even for teen-agers who are working outdoors, the experience is
worth the heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't working right now, I'd be inside just watching TV
or something,'' said Marco Carlos,14, who goes to Travis High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos works 20 hours a week at the Hornsby Bend Water Treatment
Center as part of the program. ``Now, I'm outside working on
clearing trails and monitoring birds. I've learned a lot. Before if
I saw a bird, I wouldn't know anything about it, but now I can tell
you what type of bird it is.''

 &HT;    Atlanta's unhealthy air continues
 &HT;    By Kelly Simmons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ These are summer's dog days, and in Atlanta that means
more heat and more smog _ both are looming today.
</P>
<P>
   With high temperatures predicted in the 90s, state air officials
also have issued a smog alert for today, the sixth straight day
when officials have warned of potential conditions to produce
unhealthy levels of lung-scarring ozone.
</P>
<P>
   So far this summer metro Atlanta has recorded 16 official days
of ozone violations, when levels of the gas exceeded guidelines set
by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. And with the real
heat of the season still to come, officials predict a long smoggy
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've historically had ozone events beginning in mid-July and
ending in late August,'' said Rafael Ballagas, program manager for
the state's air quality monitoring program. ``There's no reason for
us to expect anything different this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Monitors throughout the 13-county metro region record ozone
levels by measuring the air over an eight-hour period. Under that
standard, which is being challenged in a lawsuit now before the
U.S. Supreme Court, air that exceeds 0.08 parts per million of
ozone registers as a violation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the 16th day this year that a monitor in the metro
Atlanta region has recorded an unhealthy level of ozone. It was the
fifth consecutive day this summer. Officials won't know about ozone
levels for Wednesday until later today. As of this time last year,
there were 12 days of violations recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of violations in 1999 was 70 _ 56 after July
15. Violations were recorded every day from July 18 through Aug.
22.

BITTER FEUDING IMPERILS MARTHA GRAHAM'S LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Things looked bleak for the Martha Graham dance
company six weeks ago when it canceled its scheduled performances
for the year, suspended operations of its school and acknowledged
that it was virtually bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Now they look even bleaker.
</P>
<P>
   The company board has changed the locks on the warehouse where
it keeps its costumes and scenery out of fear that its former
artistic director would take them. That artistic director, Ron
Protas, whom Graham herself chose to carry on her work, operates by
cell phone from a location he refuses to reveal and is working to
prevent the company from performing any of Graham's dances.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the troupe's 17 members have been discussing whether to
organize a boycott of the modern dances they have worked so hard to
master and perform, to choke off Protas' ability to license them to
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   And Protas is talking of establishing a new company to supplant
the one that Martha Graham left him in charge of.
</P>
<P>
   The undancerly wrestling match at times takes on aspects of an
opera bouffe, but for many in the dance world too much is at stake
for any laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging in the balance, they say, is the legacy of America's
great master of modern dance, which, without a school to teach her
particular technique or a permanent company to display her oeuvre,
could become the stuff of textbooks for dance history courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an end of an era,'' said Chrystelle Bond, a dance
historian at Goucher College in Maryland. ``It's a very sad
commentary when people destroy the art in the process of trying to
save it. Dance is a living tradition, and once you kill the school,
there's a danger that the repertory could be lost in just a few
years.'' The school has 500 students.
</P>
<P>
   In her autobiography, published at the end of her long life,
Graham left no doubt about whom she would place in control of her
choreography, her company and her extraordinary legacy, which
spanned most of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   It would be Protas, she wrote, the untiring acolyte who for
nearly 25 years shadowed her on rehearsals and tours with a yellow
legal pad and dark, oversize glasses, scribbling down her dance
commentary and absorbing her technique. He was the devoted aide who
nursed her back from serious illness and bouts of alcohol-induced
isolation and depression, enabling her to create and produce more
dances when the prospects for this seemed dim. It was this man, she
wrote, to whom she ``entrusted the future of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly 10 years later, the Martha Graham Center of
Contemporary Dance, encompassing the Graham dance company, school
and junior troupe, is struggling to survive the internecine
warfare. Protas, who was ousted as artistic director and as a board
member, still owns the rights to Graham's works and controls the
Martha Graham Trust, which licenses the Graham dances. both to the
center and to others.
</P>
<P>
   All of this puts Protasat the center of the storm. His scornful
critics say that his mercurial personality makes him the most
reviled man in dance. That is a tough label for a person with the
charm to joke that he doesn't dance a step except for the merengue
he mastered decades ago at a Fred Astaire school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a saint, but they seem to blame everything but the
Crucifixion on me,'' he observed dryly.
</P>
<P>
   At 59 he is zealous and sometimes prickly in seeking to guard
Graham's image and the more than 180 dances that established her as
a revolutionary modern dancer and choreographer. Graham, who died
at 96 in 1991, started what is now the nation's oldest dance
company in 1926 and created stark dances and highly dramatic ones
that used her movement vocabulary, the Graham technique.
</P>
<P>
   Protas, a restless man with tight tousled curls and a voice that
dips into a slow whisper to punctuate points, took over full
control as artistic director of the company after Graham's death.
That meant he made critical decisions about casting, selection of
the season's ballets and appointment of the rehearsal directors who
coach dancers. The company long had an international artistic
reputation, but it also had a checkered financial history and a
touring schedule that was declining in the last years of Graham's
life.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a New York businessman and a housewife with a passion
for theater, Protas met Graham in the late 1960s when he was a
freelance photographer and was intermittently attending law school,
which he never finished.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship, he said, grew as he tended her while she was
hospitalized in her 70s for diverticulitis. It was a dark period in
her life when, she wrote, she stopped dancing and started brooding
alone, drinking too much and eating too little.
</P>
<P>
   Today even Protas' fiercest critics give him credit for helping
to revive Graham's interest in her career. But Protas said he knew
that company members mocked the relationship by calling him and
Graham the Harold and Maude of dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her act of choosing me created jealousy and animosity because
all the other dancers felt that they should have been chosen by
her, and that is a big part of it,'' Protas said.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents portray the dispute in other ways. ``Ron thinks
that because Martha was treated as an icon that he would get the
same treatment as her heir,'' said Judith G. Schlosser, a Graham
Center board member for more than 20 years. ``It took us several
years to figure out how to pass on the torch.'' She said that the
board's goal was to make the company more businesslike to appeal to
previously reluctant donors.
</P>
<P>
   Encoded in the word ``businesslike'' is a sharp critique, by
Schlosser and many others, of Protas' perceived way of doing
business and dealing with dancers. He has alienated some potential
contributors and theater presenters, who complain that in his
zealousness to preserve the Graham legacy he became erratic and
difficult and constantly sought to renegotiate matters that had
already been decided.

   ``I cannot work with Ron Protas again,'' said Ken Fischer,
president of the University Musical Society at the University of
Michigan, which organized a Martha Graham festival in 1994. ``I
have another major project that I want to do with a Martha Graham
dance in 2001. I've got the space reserved and the support
identified. But I don't feel I can do it if I have to work with
Ron. It's just too much dealing with him. He's always changing his
mind.''

</P>

</P>
<P>
   Protas has also faced an undercurrent of derision because he
does not dance himself. Critics say that resentment increased
because of his brusque treatment of dancers, who were frequently
reduced to tears by his critiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can he be coaching about movement if he has never done
it?'' said Camille Brown, who quit the company in 1994. ``It's like
talking about the ocean if you have never seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Brown quit the company soon after filing a complaint with the
American Guild of Musical Artists, the dancers' union, in
connection with a rehearsal incident involving Protas. She did not
pursue the complaint after the filing.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was preparing for a role when Protas tied her hands
loosely with rope because, he told her, the piece was about being
bound and trapped. And, she said, he added that he would be back
with duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so humiliating,'' Brown said. ``And there was no one in
the building who would say, `You can't do these things.'''
</P>
<P>
   Protas said that this rehearsal method was used by Graham
herself for the piece, ``Errand Into the Maze,'' as a way to
connect with the experience of being restrained, which he said he
told Brown.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Critics say as many as 30 dancers, administrators and support
staff have left over the years because of Protas' management style.
Protas maintains that turnover is natural in any arts organization
and that it had been heightened by the company's financial turmoil.
Those who have left include a former managing director, Todd
Dellinger.
</P>
<P>
   He left this year and broke into choking sobs recently when he
recalled a ``sick environment'' in which ``a bunch of addictive,
high-strung personalities were living in a very dysfunctional
office.'' At the top of the heap, he said, was Protas.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the strains between Protas and the board
created warring camps and an atmosphere of deep suspicion, with
differing accounts about who was responsible for the growing
budgetary problems.
</P>
<P>
   Protas maintained that in the last two years he had disengaged
himself from the administrative management of the company to
concentrate on artistic matters. ``They kept saying if you would
just go away, everything will be fine,'' he said. ``And I turn over
management to them, and look what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dellinger said that Protas had a hand in major transactions
and decisions as small as selecting the company's postcards.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The feuding ranges beyond the deficit that brought the
suspension of operations in May, to issues as serious as Protas'
maneuvers to replace the board's chairman and as small as his
irritation with a consultant's penchant for open-toed sandals and
napping on the office floor.
</P>
<P>
   (``He was a very good organizer and helped the board like never
before,'' Francis Mason, the acting chairman, said of the
consultant. But, he conceded, ``Maybe he was sleeping under the
desk.'')
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the board feared that donations would dry up if
Protas continued in any management role. The Harkness Foundation
for Dance had already withdrawn its support.
</P>
<P>
   And so, last month, with the school and company shut down,
another crucial showdown was set over what is perhaps Protas' most
powerful hold on the Graham legacy: his control over the licensing
of her dances.
</P>
<P>
   The board tried to negotiate a new agreement that would allow
the company to perform the dances for 10 years with minimal
involvement from Protas in return for an annual fee about equal to
his $100,000 salary as artistic director. But when his lawyer
insisted that Protas keep some form of artistic control, the
trustees countered with his removal from the board.
</P>
<P>
   After that vote, four of Protas' supporters on the board
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they make Ron the bete noire, the
scapegoat,'' said one of them, Princess Moune Souvanna Phouma of
Laos. ``I have no idea.'' She added that at every meeting she
attended it appeared the board was more intent on destroying Protas
than on confronting its own financial shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Some Graham dancers and teachers appealed to Protas to
renegotiate despite the turmoil. When they got no response, they
said, the dancers began to discuss the plan to boycott Graham's
dances by other companies as long as they were licensed through
Protas.
</P>
<P>
   New battles may be brewing. No one is quite sure what will
happen to the Joffrey Ballet's plans to rent costumes for a
scheduled performance of Graham's ``Appalachian Spring'' in
October. Protas said the costumes were his to rent, but the Martha
Graham Center pays for storage in a warehouse that it has outfitted
with new locks. Protas does not have the keys.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The company does not have enough money to move into its planned
quarters in the vast basement of a new building rising on East 63rd
Street on the former site of the company's school, which was sold
to reduce debt.
</P>
<P>
   The center began trying to organize classes at an alternative
studio after plans for classes at the 92nd Street Y fell through
for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't open a school without a dollar for teachers or the
accompanist,'' said Pearl Lang, a former company dancer and noted
choreographer. ``It just makes me sick. If I work with one group,
it seems as if I'm at war with the other.''
</P>
<P>
   From his office, Protas holds out the possibility that he might
open a new school.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have watched the warfare and sometimes been caught
up in it, there is nothing less at stake than a language of dance.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Eilber, whom the company hopes _ money permitting _ to
name as Protas' successor, contends that the mess has to be fixed
before the Graham technique becomes a memory. ``Martha could be
consigned to a history class in 10 years unless there are new
talent and new disciples,'' she said. ``It will happen incredibly
fast. In fact, it's already been happening.''

   KANUNGU, Uganda _ Round the clock, two guards patrol the empty
cult compound here, but they are not very busy: Few people are
brave enough to see the place that spawned one of the largest cult
killings in history.
</P>
<P>
   It looks the same as it did nearly four months ago when 330
bodies, the first of 780 bodies that have now been counted, were
found incinerated here. The stench from the pit latrine is still
fresh and terrible, so much so that people believe there are many
more bodies down there.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows,'' said Edison Byamukama, 34, who watches the
compound with an automatic rifle. ``But there is still bad
smelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan police said they had looked again in the latrine, where
six corpses were found in March, but it was empty. The smell
remains a mystery, like nearly everything about the Movement for
the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, which promised the
end of the world but delivered it only for its 780 victims.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mystery that has been particularly difficult for the
people of Kanungu, a rough seven-hour drive southwest of the
capital, Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the dead were from here, mostly because the cult's high
priestess, Credonia Mwerinde, was a local girl known better in her
youth as a prostitute and banana-beer brewer than a confidant of
the Virgin Mary, as she later said she was.
</P>
<P>
   Almost four months after the first bodies were found, shaking
this nation still scarred from a past bloody from wars and
dictators, hard facts are few. No one knows for certain how so many
could die, apparently over several weeks, without the slightest
suspicion. No one knows if the group's leaders are dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few certainties is that this was not the largest cult
killing ever, as was widely reported a few months ago. As new
graves were being discovered every few days, police and government
officials said the death toll was over 1,000, and thus more than
the 913 who died in Jonestown, Guyana, in 1978. The final toll of
780 _ in six graves in southwestern Uganda and one in the capital _
is still huge. But it is based on an actual body count.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The confusion at the time grew from estimates of how many bodies
had been burned in the old church here, with the reports as high as
530. The actual number is 330, said Assuman Mugenyi, a Uganda
police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Mugenyi said the police now believed that the leader of the
cult, Joseph Kibwetere, a defrocked Roman Catholic priest, was in
fact dead, and perhaps his was one of the six bodies pulled from
the latrine.
</P>
<P>
   Mugenyi said their suspicion was based on a few survivors who
said Kibwetere was nowhere to be found in the days before the fire
here, on March 17. He said the police also believed that two other
cult leaders, Mwerinde and another defrocked priest, Dominic
Kataribabo, might be alive and out of the country. International
warrants have been issued for their arrests.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that some went to their deaths
willingly. Few of the bodies showed signs of struggle, and some
have argued that it strains belief that so many people could have
been murdered in these tiny villages without someone knowing. But
Mugenyi said police were still treating the deaths as murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although they understood that they were going to heaven, they
did not know they would be murdered,'' he said. ``They thought they
would get on a bus and go to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was possible that the victims had been poisoned,
although he said the lab reports from quick autopsies on some
victims had not been released. One of the few people from Kanungu
who was related to someone who died in the fire said he could not
believe that anyone had gone along willingly.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Turyakyira, 36, said his father, Yonathani Kalmasi, 60, had
often walked from their hut across a field to study religion or eat
at the compound. On May 16 the father went to a feast to celebrate
the opening of a new church building there and said nothing about
suicide or even about the end being near.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one suspected,'' the son said. Then his father returned the
next day and died along with the others in the church fire.
Turyakyira went there when the bodies were heaved into a mass grave
but, though he lives a few minutes' walk away, he has stayed away
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't feel good then,'' he said, ``and I didn't want to go
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders are beginning to say the town, a pleasant place of
green hills and vistas, is haunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are afraid, because the spirits talk through the night,''
said Warren Mugabe, 35, a teacher in a village a half-hour's drive
south of here. His brother-in-law, Jonnes Mugabe, 36, added, ``Some
people say they do walk at night and make singing and other
things.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of talk angers people from Kanungu, who say it is bad
enough that their town is now synonymous with mass murder. ``That's
a lie,'' said Matthew Kanyangira, 53, a trader here.
</P>
<P>
   Byamukama, the guard, said he had never seen or heard anything
unearthly.
</P>
<P>
   He should know, because he sleeps in the compound at night.
</P>
<P>
   But still, he considered it. ``Some people say the spirits fear
this gun,'' he said. ``I don't know if that is so.''

TABOO TALK ABOUT THE MEN (AND WOMAN) WHO COULD BE KING 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ It is the forbidden subject in Cambodia,
but people cannot stop talking about it: who will eventually
succeed King Norodom Sihanouk, the ailing and increasingly
reclusive man who is the soul of his country?
</P>
<P>
   Seeming to grow tinier and tinier with every public appearance,
constantly complaining about his ill health and general
discouragement but still bowing and smiling with the dazzling charm
of old, the king is the living symbol of a nation that has survived
generations of anguish.
</P>
<P>
   To many, he seems irreplaceable. His fortunes and his antics run
through the past half-century of Cambodia like the sharp red line
on a graph, jiggering up and down but continuing, unbroken, as the
country's historical constant.
</P>
<P>
   But as he constantly warns his countrymen, the king is 77 and
weakened by an array of ailments, from strokes to cataracts to
diabetes to prostate cancer. His life, he said last year, has
reached ``a period that is similar to the setting of the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, behind the scenes, the maneuvering is well under way,
masked by a political taboo on public talk of succession. When one
politician, Sam Rainsy, called for clarification earlier this year,
he was angrily shushed by people who have a stake in the outcome
and in keeping the maneuvering quiet.
</P>
<P>
   For onlookers, it has become almost a national sport to riffle
through the apparent heirs like a pack of cards filled with jacks
and jokers as well as potential kings. There is even _ if the
constitution is amended to allow it _ a potential queen.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia's 1993 constitution is not much help in this game.
Thousands of people are theoretically eligible, as male descendants
of King Ang Eng, who died in 1797. Among these, half a dozen are in
serious contention: the sons and half-brothers of King Sihanouk.
And the king's wife is another contender.
</P>
<P>
   The choice is to be made after he dies by a nine-member Crown
Council whose makeup, it is widely noted, is dominated by
supporters of the man who would be kingmaker, Prime Minister Hun
Sen.
</P>
<P>
   And it is widely believed that Hun Sen's chief priority _ like
that of the badly mistaken French colonial rulers who selected the
current king in 1941 _ is to find someone who will not offer a
political challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional monarch of today's Cambodia is mostly a
figurehead with little real power. King Sihanouk's influence comes
from the force of his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sihanouk is already part of history, so when he disappears it
will represent not only an important event but will create a kind
of vacuum,'' said Raul M. Jennar, a Belgian expert on Cambodia.
``And I don't think any successor will be able to take his place.''

<P>
   A dramatist not only in his films and songs but in his life, he
managed to keep his country intact and at peace while breaking from
the French in 1953.He abdicated and took the title prince in 1955
to become directly involved in politics. He maintained Cambodia's
neutrality as the Indochina war grew. When he was ousted in a
U.S.-sponsored coup in 1970, he backed the communist Khmer Rouge,
to disastrous effect, becoming their prisoner when they took power
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   After the election of 1993 he resumed the title king and
supported an awkward coalition government, apparently hoping to
wield decisive influence as the throne behind the power.
</P>
<P>
   But as Hun Sen bludgeoned his way to undisputed leadership, the
king seemed to give up, making statements like, ``If the ones who
have power in their hands do not listen to me, I cannot achieve
anything useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in 1997: ``I also want to abdicate. But after weighing the
pros and cons several nights, I've decided to remain king awhile
yet.''

</P>
<P>
   For most Cambodians, particularly those who remember what they
think of as a ``golden age'' before the 1970s, King Sihanouk is the
embodiment of a lost grandeur, perhaps the last of the great
``god-kings.''
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, quirky and colorful, he has risen above
his title to a place as one of the great personalities of his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is unique _ one of the most intelligent men I have met in
the country, but it is all by instinct, unstructured and astute,''
said Olivier de Bernon, a French historian with the Ecole Francaise
d'Extreme-Orient. ``He is a king, like Louis XIV. There is no way
to understand him except by being a king yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   And those clamoring to succeed him, it seems, are mere mortals.

<P>
   Most prominent is Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 56, a man with an
unnerving physical resemblance to his father but with a political
haplessness that seems to exasperate the king.
</P>
<P>
   Ousted by Hun Sen as his co-prime minister in a coup three years
ago, he has retreated to the pomp and sinecure of speaker of the
National Assembly and head of the defeated royalist party. So
people ask, what else was he promised for his tameness, the future
kingship? And if so, what is the value of a promise?
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts who consider themselves to be cannier point
to Prince Norodom Sihamoni, 47, a former ballet dancer who lives in
Paris, is a cultural representative for the United Nations and
plays little public role in Cambodia. Unlike the other contenders,
he is the son of the king's current, and fifth, wife, and is said
to enjoy his parents' support.
</P>
<P>
   A close adviser to Hun Sen, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the question of succession would be the prime minister's next
``top priority'' and suggested that Prince Sihamoni was the most
likely heir. But it is the prime minister's style to divide and
confuse; the question seems far from decided.
</P>
<P>
   The king's half-brother, Prince Norodom Sirivudh, 49, a former
foreign minister, is also in contention, although he too has
crossed swords with Hun Sen. In 1995 the prime minister accused
Sirivudh of plotting to kill him, and the prince spent four years
in exile before returning last year.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from King Sihanouk, the only other personality whose
portrait can be found in every corner of the country is his wife,
Queen Monineath, who is half-French and has Cambodianized her name
in recent years from Monique.
</P>
<P>
   The king has spoken of her as a potential successor and has
elevated her title to royal supreme wife, from royal wife. But
there have been no moves to amend the constitution to allow a woman
to reign.
</P>
<P>
   As the king lives out what seems a rather lonely sunset, she is
his closest companion as he travels between his Phnom Penh palace _
no longer the social and diplomatic center it once was _ and a
guest house in Beijing, where he retreats for much of the year to
rest and receive medical care.
</P>
<P>
   His increasing absences do seem to trouble his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am old now, 68 years old, so I am very familiar with our
dear king,'' said a human rights worker who refused to allow his
name to be used. ``I feel he has become not the king of Cambodia
but the king of a Chinese city.''
</P>
<P>
   More plaintively, Mom Muong, who works in a photocopy shop,
said: ``We feel he is our father, and when our father is away, we
feel very sad. We feel small, small, small, small.''
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes like this only seem to feed the discouragement that
appears to have infused the final chapter in King Sihanouk's reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continue to believe that I am a god-king, like the kings
of Angkor,'' he said after handing out tiny gifts to a throng of
poor villagers three years ago. ``Unfortunately I am not a god. I
am a human being.''

HARRY POTTER AND THE WORLDWIDE MEDIA CIRCUS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his books, wizard-in-training Harry Potter manages all manner
of magical feats, from dashing about on his broom (a high-tech
Nimbus model) during a Quidditch match to inflating his horrid aunt
to rotund, ceiling-bumping proportions (just don't ask him to
conjure up a decent potion). His most amazing feat, of course, has
been instilling in millions of children the joy of reading, an
enthusiasm that challenges the levels of rabidity that some kids
have for Pokemon or ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider: There are currently 20.9 million copies of Harry's
adventures in print in America alone (that many movie tickets would
translate into well over a $100 million gross). Add the rest of the
world, and the number breezes past 30 million, in 29 different
languages. And it's not just kids who are wild about Harry: In
Canada, for example, Potter books come in colorful children's
versions as well as with moody chiaroscuro covers for adult
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Come Saturday, that number will soar even higher: Scholastic
Press, publishers of author J.K. Rowling's Potter series, will
release an unprecedented initial press run of 3.8 million copies of
``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' the fourth installment in
the projected seven-book series. Bookstores nationwide will remain
open past midnight Friday to give pajama-clad readers a jump on
their peers, filling the late hours with parties, games and other
magic-themed events. Some 9,000 Fed Ex trucks have been readied to
deliver Potter books to fans who have preordered the book on the
Internet (Amazon.com presold more than a quarter of a million
copies alone) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   All the more amazing: ``Goblet of Fire'' weighs in at a whopping
750 pages, a tome most adults would rarely wade through. On Aug.
15, ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' will come out in
paperback, after spending more than a year and a half at the top of
the best-seller lists. The first book, ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone,'' has remained on hardback best-seller lists even
though the book has been available in paperback for nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Horsley, the Community Relations Coordinator for the
Canoga Park Borders bookstore, says, ``I've never seen this type of
phenomenon. I've spent this month's promotions budget, as well as
next month's and the month after that.'' Even last year's ``Star
Wars: Episode 1'' hoopla pales in comparison, he says, since that
was a multimedia event splashed all over TV, while Harry resolutely
remains a literary sensation and little else. (Warner Bros. is
preparing a film version of ``Harry'' expected in theaters in late
2001; no one associated with the film wished to comment on Harry's
latest literary venture, preferring to keep their promotional
comments to their own products).
</P>
<P>
   Horsley's store, which is receiving an initial order of 450
books, will feature magicians performing both Friday night and
Saturday, as well as a special story time at 11 p.m. in which the
first chapter will be read (the reader will not be allowed to show
the book's cover until after midnight, however). There will be
assorted contests and a jelly-bean taste test, and, on Saturday,
adults buying the book will be granted a free tarot-card reading.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Moran, spokeswoman for Scholastic Press, says, ``We've
created an activity kit and an event kit for bookstores with
suggestions on how to throw a Harry Potter party. It comes with
stickers and Quidditch patches. We're in close contact with
everybody who's having a party.'' Which would seem to be most
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Even that's modest compared to the hype machine in England,
where Harry first rose to prominence: A special train tricked up to
look like the Hogwarts Express, the train that takes witches and
wizards in training to their special school, will tour the country,
with Rowling (pronounced ``Rolling'') aboard and signing as many
books as her soon-to-be-cramped hand will allow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' has been produced under
a veil of secrecy that would do the CIA proud. The title was
finally leaked only 10 days before the book's release. All that
Rowling would initially acknowledge was that a major character
would die (prompting many fans to fear for poor Ron, Harry's best
friend, though Rowling, a master of surprising plot twists, notes
that killing off the buddy is an old movie convention).
</P>
<P>
   She also allowed that Harry's hormones would kick in in a major
way (asked in an America Online chat whether Harry and his gal pal
Hermione would get together, she responded, ``D'you really think
they're suited?''). The Financial Times of London reported that
Emma Matthewson, who edited the book for Bloomsbury, the book's
British publisher, was mugged once and had her car broken into
twice while she was editing the book by zealous Potterites anxious
to get an early peak at the book.
</P>
<P>
   A stunning 1 million copies will initially be released in
England _ translations in German, Italian and French will appear
six months later, because the publishers, fearing leaks, wouldn't
give the book to translators until this Saturday. Rowling _ who
famously wrote the first book when newly divorced with a young
daughter and on the dole (she's now the third-richest woman in
England, and, eliminating the country's welfare support of
monarchy, would likely be !ital!the richest) _ reportedly turned in
the book just a couple of months back, necessitating an
acceleration of the editing process (most books usually take a year
to finely vet).
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the first three books in four days,'' says Borders'
Horsley. ``I thought, `Who is this woman?' I had never seen a
character written so realistically. He's not always a good guy, but
everyone identifies with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harry's rise to prominence has not always been as easy as
waving a wand. Religious groups in America _ though, pointedly,
nowhere else on the planet _ have objected to his dabbling in the
black arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hidden in the slickly written and so-called `rollicking good
reading' pages of the Harry Potter books is a very dangerous main
theme,'' grumbles a tract from one such organization. ``The
underlying theme that reoccurs throughout all three books is that
the occult world is perfectly acceptable and harmless for children.
... It is in fact a world of fear, suspicion, competition (for self
gain) and disrespect for authority _ an agenda contrary to every
moral Judeo-Christian fiber that built this nation and should not
be OK'd reading in our schools.'' Such groups apparently think
obviously fantasy-based books encouraging enriched literacy
represent a danger to the country; their complaints have largely
fallen on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Some wonder, however, if Rowling isn't being too ambitious with
her upcoming 750-page opus. ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban'' tallied a hefty 435 pages, and though it garnered some of
the series' best reviews, hasn't sold as spectacularly as its
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   But such naysayers haven't encountered my 7-year-old
stepdaughter, Alison, who has read the second and third books by
herself. She says she enjoys them ``because they're very exciting
and have big words and they teach me how to use big words.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some, Alison understands that Harry must be a flawed
hero. ``If in the book he didn't make any mistakes, he would seem
like an imaginary person,'' she explains. ``But since he makes
mistakes, he feels like a real person, because everybody makes
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the imposing page count? Alison says: Bring it on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to read that many pages,'' she says. I think it'll
be good, maybe even better than the other ones.'' &QL;

GOOD CLEAN FUN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
``Shower'' could just as easily have been called ``A Pleasant Visit
to a Chinese Bathhouse.'' Although the film tackles such weighty
subjects as intergenerational conflict, care for the mentally
challenged and even a death, it's primarily the cinematic
equivalent of a good warm soak.
</P>
<P>
   Nicely acted and, in spite of its sentimental excesses, an
interesting glimpse into everyday life in contemporary China,
``Shower'' is thoroughly easy to take. Its most demanding aspect is
reading the subtitles; its most startling elements are brief
glimpses of old guys naked. It's definitely the kind of film that
people who don't like their foreign films too, well, foreign will
like. Nothing here that requires toweling off.
</P>
<P>
   The opening scene is the best. Ming Da (Pu Cun Xin), a hotshot
businessman in China's prosperous South, begins a visit to his
family back in Beijing by freshening up in an automated shower
stall outside the train station. A virtual car wash for people, the
ultramodern convenience is meant to soullessly contrast the homely
traditional bathhouse Da's father, Master Liu (Zhu Xu, the
accomplished star of last year's impressive ``King of Masks''), and
his developmentally disabled younger son, Ming Er (Jiang Wu),
operate in an older, ramshackle part of town.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the high-tech people wash looks like pretty good
fun. But never mind; Da, who has reluctantly come home in the
mistaken belief that his father has died, is set up from the get-go
for renewed appreciation of the older, more personalized ways of
doing things.
</P>
<P>
   Liu's place is a haven for the neighborhood guys, where they can
have their cricket-fighting matches and practice singing Italian
love songs with various degrees of acceptance and encouragement.
The friendly staff is also prone to helping solve life's bigger
problems when they come up, like one guy's troubles with his wife
and another's debt to loan sharks.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, sophisticated Da's fate is sealed, especially as
a convenient series of crises strike his own loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Director Zhang Yang (``Spicy Love Soup'') takes a genially
low-key approach to the modern-vs.-venerable dialectic that runs
rampant through ``Shower.'' He clearly prefers the past to the
future, but accepts the inevitability of change with good grace.
Zhang is also a shrewd entertainer masquerading as a serious
filmmaker _ which, of course, makes him more of a modernist than he
would probably like to believe. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The film: ``Shower'' (PG-13; language, nudity). &QL; 
The stars: Pu Cun Xin, Zhu Xu, Jiang Wu. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Zhang Yang. Written by Liu Fen Dou,
Zhang Yang, Huo Xin, Diao Yi Nan and Cai Xiang Jun. Produced by

<P>
   Tucked away in the program of ``The Square'' is a telling little
note that d from different angles, in one with a near fatal
accident and probable loss of an unborn baby, in two stories the
effect of a mother's death, on a young man and on a child.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation, alienation, fear and death - they are not very
cheerful aspects of life but like nature and the weather, snow,
winds, dry rain and the heat of the sun, which also feature
prominently in this work, they permeate life as it is if we can
bear to face it. Peter Fromm is a master of this medium, he can
evoke a lot with few words and he brings us in touch with a side of
life rarely viewed and an America largely forgotten. It's well
worth a read.

THE MAO GAME By JOSHUA MILLER Published by HarperCollins 215 pp.,
$21
</P>
<P>
   The Mao Game is a first novel and a book for the nineties. It
conveys a real flavor of these uncertain times, with a youthful
slant. Set in Los Angeles, it captures the essence of that troubled
city. The author is young, twenty-two years old, and it is a
tribute to his writing ability that he can produce such a
penetrating and succinct piece of work for his first book. Perhaps
it is a mark of the times that his talent should flower so early.
The hero, Jordan, is also young, but as an
</P>
<P>
   Brought up in a world of unreality, he has no way to view his
life except through many mirrors of himself. An only child, the
product of celebrity parents and a broken home and imprisoned in
the glass bubble of stardom, he has no peers to relate to, no
bedrock of ordinary life and routine to give him a sense of
stability. Sexually abused by his football star father from the age
of five and largely ignored by his mother in favor of her own
acting career, he turns to his eccentric grandmother for love and
wisdom and to a young stripper for companionship, drugs and sex.
</P>
<P>
   The Mao Game of the title refers to a game of life and death
played in Chinese POW camps. The rules are secret, reinvented by
the dealer each time. This game provides the framework for the
novel. Jordan's mother plays it religiously. It is her passion. In
the first chapter she and his grandmother play Mao. Jordan is the
prize. He is fifteen.
</P>
<P>
   Grandmother wins and Jordan goes to live with her. As their
relationship grows they are able to provide some solace for each
other, homemade apple pie symbolizing food for deeply damaged
souls. Grandmother is Jewish, a survivor of the Nazi occupation of
France and subsequently a famous Hollywood photographer in the
fifties. Now in her seventies, she is dying of cancer. Jordan is
her last subject and her chance of redemption, a way to atone for
the guilt she bears for neglecting her own daughter as a child. She
tries to give him something from herself, from her own experience
of life. For Jordan it is a welcome relief from the family life he
has known, an opportunity to heal the history of neglect and abuse.
Simultaneously he forms a relationship with Grace, a teenage
stripper. They talk and do drugs together and Jordan experiments
with sex.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and his grandmother take a trip to the desert in a camper
van. They play out their fantasies, based on Grandma's past. They
dress grandly for dinner and go to Denny's, pretending they're in
Paris. They dance the tango into the small hours. The next day
Grandma has her last photo session, deep in the desert. Seduced by
her skill with the camera and reassured by their growing closeness,
Jordan is finally able to tell about his father's abuse, to share
his bewilderment and pain. Together they are able to expu

 &HT;    Suitors dance a courtship around Sprint
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom is considering a $110 billion offer to buy
Sprint, but if the German company hesitates, BellSouth may consider
a renewed bid.
</P>
<P>
   After accepting WorldCom's victory in a brief October bidding
war, BellSouth moved in a variety of ways to hone a Sprint-less
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But with last week's Justice Department suit to block the
WorldCom-Sprint deal, and the emergence of Deutsche Telekom as an
all-but-official suitor for Sprint, BellSouth is now taking another
look.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth officials declined comment Wednesday, as the company
routinely does on merger speculation.
</P>
<P>
   But if Deutsche Telekom's willingness to pay $110 billion for
Sprint is no guarantee a formal bid will follow, silence from
BellSouth's Campanile Building headquarters is no proof it will
remain a wallflower. The company is not planning a decision until
it sees what happens with Deutsche Telekom, which already owns 10
percent of Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the stony quiet from Clinton, Miss., does not mean
WorldCom has given up on its $129 billion purchase of Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   But the music is growing louder, the hall is busy with flirting
suitors and it won't be long until someone decides to dance. What
does seem sure is there will soon be dramatic deals. Too many big
players are ready for partners:
</P>
<P>
   _ Deutsche Telekom has vowed to grab a U.S. presence as it
builds a global business. Sprint is just one of many companies
mentioned as targets for the ambitious firm. At times, BellSouth
has been seen as one of them. Besides Sprint, Cable &AMP; Wireless is
also seen as a potentially imminent acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   _ WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers is tough, ambitious
and bold. Yet he may be boxed in. Fighting the Justice Department
would be time-consuming, costly and uncertain. Bidding for a
different wireless provider, especially Voicestream or Nextel,
would be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts now think WorldCom will shed consumer markets
altogether, selling its long-distance business _ something that
would likely boost its stock price. If the company cannot boost
that languishing value, WorldCom is itself a potential takeover
target. WorldCom has not yet withdrawn from the Sprint deal. Until
that happens, Sprint cannot formally bargain with another partner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sprint has made it clear that collapse of the WorldCom deal is
not the end of its availability.
</P>
<P>
   Or its desirability. The company is the nation's third-largest
long-distance company, the fourth-largest wireless company and has
the world's second-largest Internet ``backbone'' network and local
service.
</P>
<P>
   _ Qwest is angling to be seen as a takeover candidate. Qwest CEO
Joe Nacchio was criticized for overreaching in his purchase of U S
West _ and then failing in his later efforts to avoid the merger
when he tried to negotiate a sale of just Qwest. Deutsche Telekom
backed out when U S West threatened to sue to make Qwest comply
with their merger agreement.
</P>
<P>
   _ BellSouth is flush with cash yet nervous about its future,
concerned that the industry's merger frenzy could leave it too big
to be a niche player, too small to be dominant.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth in October offered $100 billion to buy Sprint _ half
in cash. Yet that offer fell short when WorldCom reached deeper
into its pockets. Since then, BellSouth has made a series of
big-ticket moves. Although none involved outright mergers,
BellSouth treated its interest in Sprint as old news and an
outdated need.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint would be a regulatory hassle, since BellSouth has not yet
won the right to offer long-distance. Moreover, BellSouth recently
forged an alliance with SBC to meld wireless units in a new joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
   So why is BellSouth mulling the sale outright of its wireless
unit to SBC as part of a bid for Sprint?
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's wireless business includes approximately 6 million
subscribers, but Sprint has more. And even combined with SBC,
BellSouth will not have complete national coverage. Besides, SBC
will own the lion's share of the venture, even if _ at least on
paper _ the two companies are equals in management.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a pretty gutsy call,'' said Perry Walter,
analyst at Robinson Humphrey. ```It would involve two fairly
complex transactions. Is BellSouth up to that?''
</P>
<P>
   But the business proposition is attractive, Walter said: Sprint
is an all-digital network that is expected to reach the break-even
point in this year's third fiscal quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, BellSouth has local service only in its nine-state
region. Sprint not only has its own land-line local service
business, it holds wireless licenses that could be used in many
cities to deliver local phone and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Would BellSouth bid against Deutsche Telekom?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, thinks Carol Levenson, analyst for Gimme Credit, a research
service for institutional investors. ``We believe the chances of a
bidding war erupting are high given the perceived rarity and
desirability of Sprint's assets,'' she wrote Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth recently had its bonds slightly downgraded, a change
that makes further debt less painful, she wrote. ``It's probably up
for anything these days, the first step down the proverbial
slippery rating slope is the most difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts think not, and the company seems inclined to
shy from a confrontation. BellSouth hated losing to WorldCom, and
hasn't forgotten the bashing it took on Wall Street afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Deutsche Telekom won't make a hostile bid, not with
nearly one-third of the U.S. Senate already on record opposing the
acquisition. In fact, Deutsche Telekom may not make a bid at all.
It has suffered through several failed deals, including the attempt
this spring to buy Qwest before Qwest's $44 billion merger with U S
West was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom CEO Ron Sommer is anxious to make the next one
work. So he could turn again to Qwest, which would provide
high-speed networks on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as the
foothold of local service in U S West territory.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty U.S. senators sent a letter to federal regulators
opposing a Deutsche Telekom merger with Sprint, raising the specter
of an unpleasant political battle. But Bob House, London-based vice
president of Renaissance Strategy, said he thinks Deutsche Telekom
has too much at stake to be cowed by potential public relations
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sommer's game plan will undeniably be to forge ahead,
even in the face of political opposition. I think Deutsche Telekom
is at the point where they really have to do a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of mergers has left Deutsche Telekom with only about a
half-dozen big takeover options, House said. ``Sprint is not
necessarily the best of those deals, but it is the most likely.''
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom might be the best acquisition, even at a cost of far
more than $100 billion, he said. ``But I think it is the least
doable. It is a matter of management style, personalities and
corporate ambition rather than pure price.''
</P>
<P>
   But Deutsche Telekom could still be stymied by law.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) has introduced a bill that would
ban purchase of U.S. telecom companies by suitors in which foreign
governments own more than 25 percent. Deutsche Telekom, the former
national carrier, is still majority-owned by the German government.
</P>
<P>
   ``In promoting competition here at home, we may be facilitating
the ease by which foreign protected players may emerge with key
U.S. assets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   For a fact box
</P>
<P>
   The players: Deutsche Telekom, Sprint, WorldCom, Qwest
Communications and BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   _ What's happening now: Behind-the-scenes maneuvering while
everyone waits for WorldCom to decide whether to give up its $129
billion bid for Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rumors: Deutsche Telekom is ready to bid for Sprint or for
Cable &AMP; Wireless _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   _ How BellSouth figures in: BellSouth could renew its bid for
Sprint, try to buy Qwest, draw closer to SBC Communications or just
sit tight.
</P>
<P>

WE ALL SCREAM FOR PARODY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with the prospect of spoofing the current generation of
teen horror movies, director Keenen Ivory Wayans knew he had one
hurdle parody filmmakers usually don't face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream,'' the series that revived the genre and epitomizes the
current trend's approach, is satiric in itself. Wes Craven's first,
1996 entry, especially, was widely praised for its savvy
self-acknowledgement of the genre's ample, idiotic conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Scream' films are satires, absolutely,'' notes Keenen,
who lampooned the 1970s blaxploitation genre in ``I'm Gonna Get
You, Sucka'' and often relied on pop-culture gags for his ``In
Living Color'' television show. ``And parodying that was the
challenge. We went through 10 script drafts because I'd look at
something and say, ` ``Scream'' already did this joke. We can't.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, in our film, the classic horror parody only happens
in the first scene,'' he continues, referring to a travesty of the
``Scream'' prologue in which a flatulent Carmen Electra is
substituted for the original's stalkee Drew Barrymore. ``After
that, it becomes a character comedy with a horror backdrop. That's
how you get out of that trap; all of the cliches are hit in that
first scene, so you can't rely on them anymore. Now you have to
create funny characters and situations to put them in, go into pop
culture, being a teen-ager ... all those other things are what you
have to explore, and that's what the movie does.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ``Scary Movie'' was conceived by Wayans' younger
brothers, Shawn and Marlon Wayans, who wrote those 10 script drafts
with previous collaborators Buddy Johnson (executive story editor
of their ``Wayans Brothers'' WB sitcom) and Phil Beauman (co-writer
of the younger Wayanses' gangsta movie satire ``Don't Be a Menace
to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood''). Not that
it was the most eclectic brainstorm or anything; the teen horror
revival was so ripe for parody that a rival project, written by
Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (``Spy Hard''), was bought by
``Scary'' producer Miramax Films to prevent competition.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, despite the wised-up attitude the current horror
cycle exhibits, its ridiculous aspects are also, well, obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never the first one,'' notes Marlon, who also plays
``Scary's'' expert on horror movie conventions, Shorty, whose
advice for staying alive is somewhat compromised by a pot-smoked
memory. ``The first `Scream' was cool; `I Know What You Did Last
Summer' was all right.'' ``But then, when they do the sequels, it's
like `Who Cares What You Did Last Summer'; that's when it's ripe
for parody,'' adds Shawn, who plays ``Scary's'' sexually confused
football player, Ray _ a character whose movie theater toilet stall
encounter, though much less dire than Omar Epps' in ``Scream 2,''
is one of numerous, graphically disgusting sight gags that have
some Hollywood observers complaining that ``Scary'' should have
gotten an NC-17 rather than an R rating.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Wayanses, gross outrageousness is another key
to movie parody in the post-``Something About Mary'' comedy
climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Scream' movies made commentary; we show, we have a lot of
visual humor, and that's what parody is,'' Marlon explains. ``It's
satire pumped full of steroids.''
</P>
<P>
   As are some of the characters in ``Scary Movie,'' like Miss
Mann, a female gym teacher (played by bodybuilder Jayne Trcka)
whose short skirt exposes a prosthetic effect that is anything but
feminine (all three Wayans brothers think this is the funniest
thing in the movie).
</P>
<P>
   Others, of course, are merely surgically enhanced. The pneumatic
Carmen Electra was a good sport about a bit where the masked killer
plunges a knife into her chest, then removes it to find a breast
implant stuck on the blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing about this movie is that I'm making fun of
myself and we're making fun of everything,'' the much made-fun-of
actress, whose former companions Prince and Dennis Rodman also come
in for ``Scary Movie'' ridicule, cheerfully notes. ``You know, it's
lighthearted, it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   And for some, the trauma is purely psychological. Take, for
example, Hollywood innocent Anna Faris, an actress from a
conservative Seattle family who makes her very first big-screen
appearance as ``Scary's'' virginal leading lady, Cindy Campbell. Of
course, according to the current rules of teen movies as filtered
through the inimitable Wayans sensibility, Cindy does not survive
the film with her virtue _ nor anything remotely approaching
dignity _ intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the sex scene is sexy; it's supposed to be
gross,'' the demure young Faris points out. ``But I don't think we
really understood how, sort of, cutting-edge the film was when we
were making it. But I've tried to prepare my parents as much as
possible. I've told them, 'You can't see the movie without me,
because there are going to be a couple of times when we have to go
get popcorn.'''
</P>
<P>
   Keenen defends his movie's raw humor _ indeed, he views it as a
kind of antidote to the social dysfunction more serious movie
horrors have been accused of inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this is a release from the 'End of Days'
syndrome,'' he says. ``When we see on the news, every other night,
that somebody else walked into their job and shot up 10 people,
that's the real obscenity. If you're gonna push the limits, at
least let it make you laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   But does ``Scary Movie'' accomplish that goal? The film seems to
polarize viewers, sending one bunch into paroxysms of laughter
while leaving the other group stone-faced. The movie industry trade
papers, which are supposed to judge a movie's audience potential,
split over the film precisely in this manner. The Hollywood
Reporter's reviewer declared, ``This is a scary movie. It's scary
that it took six people to write a movie this bad.'' But Variety's
critic felt that ``unlike most spoofs of this helter-skelter sort,
'Scary Movie' manages an impressively huge score in the hit-or-miss
gag ratio.''
</P>
<P>
   Keenen has no illusions about the parameters of his target
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely think that anybody between the ages of 14 and 24
is going to die for this movie,'' he says. ``And then, I think,
guys over 25 will still dig it. Women over 25 will probably look at
it like they do the Three Stooges, just go, 'What do you guys see
in this?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Keenen also believes the style of humor in a spoof film like
``Scary'' is not necessarily the most crucial component for it to
succeed. Even more so than in other kinds of comedy, timing may be
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, the 'Airplane!' guys knew that the disaster genre
had been beaten to death when they made their parody,'' Keenen
observes. ``The real trick is that you've got to find a genre; you
can't just pick a movie. You have to have a series of films that
have played the genre to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Like, maybe, grossout comedies? ``Scary Movie'' seems less
consciously aware of tricking out that overmined contemporary field
than the already waning teen horror cycle, even as it employs
up-to-the-minute outhouse humor to lampoon other kinds of films
(``The Matrix,'' ``The Sixth Sense,'' ``The Usual Suspects'' and
even early summer's ``Big Momma's House'' are among the non-slasher
items goofed upon).
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the ultimate spoof of genres that Hollywood exploits
into self-parody at increasingly rapid rates would be, of all
things, a comedy that doesn't depend on broad humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing, pushing the envelope with the comedy like
that, is making a parody statement in itself,'' Marlon reckons.
``It's saying, look at all the crazy things that people are doing
nowadays, and teens love it. But I think what will happen is that,
eventually, it's going to become more subtle; you'll have to pull
back comedy again, make it more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then, 20 years from now, it'll be back here again.''
</P>
<P>
   Which might be the scariest prospect of all. &QL;

LIFE OF `JAWS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) describes the shark
terrorizing the water around Amityville to the town's mayor as ``a
perfect machine'' in ``Jaws,'' he may as well have been talking
about the film itself.
</P>
<P>
   There is not an ounce of fat in Steven Spielberg's film; it is a
perfect summer blockbuster. Actually, there weren't summer
blockbusters before ``Jaws.'' Prior to that, studios didn't take
the summer movie season seriously. The success of ``Jaws,'' which
became the all-time grossing picture at the time, changed all that,
and summer has been a studio feeding frenzy ever since.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Universal releases a special 25th anniversary
edition of ``Jaws,'' on DVD and VHS with a number of extra
features. Like many special editions this one includes deleted
scenes. What makes these interesting is to see Spielberg's
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the scenes center around the family of police chief
Martin Brody (Roy Scheider). While offering some insight into his
character (why he left New York City, why he felt like a fish out
of water in Amityville, for instance), none of this made a bit of
difference to the film. Even the scene where the bounty hunters go
out and kill the wrong shark was dumped. While it was comic enough,
Spielberg more than likely weighed it against another comic-terror
scene of two fishermen using a holiday roast to try to capture the
shark.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Jaws'' is, is a straight-ahead terror ride, and Spielberg
never lost sight of that. First, he wisely excised the soap-opera
aspects of Peter Benchley's source novel _ such as Hooper having
had an affair with Brody's wife. Benchley had first shot at writing
the script, which then went through rewrites from Carl Gottlieb and
an uncredited Howard Sacker, but the vision is pure Spielberg. The
ultimate film student, Spielberg brilliantly borrowed from
Hitchcock in amping up the suspense in ``Jaws.'' Some of this may
have been by necessity, since the they had so much trouble getting
the mechanical shark known as Bruce to work. (Actually, there were
three of them _ one to go straight, one left, one right).
Nevertheless, showing the shark's point of view (underwater views
of swimmers or, more accurately, potential meals) and showing
little of the maneater through most of the first part of the
picture helped create an air of dread.
</P>
<P>
   This was enhanced by John Williams' score. In an interview
that's part of a ``making of'' documentary in the new package,
Spielberg said that he thought Williams was joking when he first
played the shark theme for him using a few bass notes on the piano.
But Williams' escalating riff turned out to be one of the most
cinematic themes ever written. Like the shrieking violins in
``Psycho'' by Bernard Herrmann, the ``Jaws'' theme puts the terror
in your head as well as anything seen on screen. And Spielberg used
it brilliantly. Within a short time the audience was like Pavlov
dogs, ready to be shocked whenever those few notes appeared.
Sometimes the theme was played so low it was almost subliminal,
allowing Spielberg to create tension before the audience even
realized it.
</P>
<P>
   And as stripped down as the theme was, so was the story, which
ultimately became that of three men against an unseen menace _ each
representing a different male stereotype: Quint (Robert Shaw), the
shark hunter is the macho man who is going to solve the problem
with muscle; Hooper is the marine biologist who expects science to
overcome the shark; and Brody is Everyman, being pulled along by
these slightly mad men. In Spielberg's world, we know who
succeeds. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
The ``Jaws Anniversary Collector's Edition'' is $19.98 for the
two-cassette VHS version and $26.98 for the DVD. Both versions
include a ``making of'' documentary with new interviews with
Spielberg and other key members of the cast and crew, outtakes and
deleted scenes and a trivia game. &QL;

   Bruce Willis gets much too in touch with his inner brat in
``Disney's The Kid.'' So much so, in fact, that the high-powered
image consultant Willis plays is confronted by his makeover-needy,
8-year-old self in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is trying to sell this latest pairing of Bruce and a
child as a family film, but it's really a midlife crisis fantasy, a
kind of self-centered variation on all of those body switch movies
that were popular in the late 1980s (and some called that one the
Me Decade!). The movie wishes to impart life lessons, but all it
really ends up saying that, if you're lucky, some magic
something-or-other might come along and make you feel better about
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   However, the actually pleasant surprise about ``Kid'' is that,
for the most part, it's eminently adequate entertainment. Not high
praise, that, but certainly an unexpected positive for a film
that's clearly a desperate attempt to capitalize on Willis' success
with ``The Sixth Sense,'' was directed by the studio's uninspired
pablum expert Jon Turteltaub (``Phenomenon,'' ``Instinct,'' ``3
Ninjas,'' ``While You Were Sleeping'') and rips off the title of a
beloved Chaplin classic to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The film's modest but consistent gratification is due in great
measure to its star, who can play a jerk like few other box office
giants and does so quite despicably for a good portion of ``Kid's''
running time. It's fun to watch Willis' sleek, health-food obsessed
Russ Duritz display just how rotten he is on the inside. He
criticizes and berates people with evident relish _ and make a
fabulous living at it. As a personal spin doctor to crooked
politicians and corporate weasels, he gets to put down the powerful
and make 'em come back, checkbook in hand, for more. Forget about
the inner child fantasy; he's already living the dream many of our
own inner louts nurture.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, of course, that Russ doesn't know when to turn it
off. He has a winsome English assistant, Amy (Emily Mortimer), who
would love to get in touch with his good side if she could ever
really find it (a second assistant, Janet, is played by Lily
Tomlin, who actually makes something of that stereotype, the
sarcastic secretary who has her boss from hell's number). So, by
some mystical happenstance that's never explained, his chubby,
emotionally frail 8-year-old self, Rusty (Spencer Breslin), shows
up on Russ' Hollywood Hills doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Russ is mortified by his wimpy, prepubescent self. For his part,
the kid is appalled that, at 40, he has no dog, wife or pilot's
license. The two Duritzes then set about de-loserizing their other
half.
</P>
<P>
   As you may have guessed, this all gets pretty schmaltzy by the
end. But up until then, Audrey Wells' script maintains just enough
of a nasty edge _ and enough sound psychology _ to keep the
lightweight goings-on intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing great here. But nothing greatly mismanaged, either,
which is something that can't be said about most of this summer's
movies. &QL;

`SCARY' FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS

<P>
   How do you spoof Kevin Williamson's ``Scream'' and ``I Know What
You Did Last Summer'' movies, which were, essentially, send-ups of
horror franchises like ``Halloween'' and ``Friday the 13th''? If
you're the Wayans brothers, apparently you don't.
</P>
<P>
   Although their lamebrained new raunchfest, ``Scary Movie,'' is
being advertised as a parody of the recent horror movie craze, it's
really a collection of sight gags and simple-minded jokes revolving
around oral sex, homosexual stereotypes and large objects hitting
(mostly old) people in the head.
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps the most vulgar movie in film history, with
something to offend practically everyone, except for the teen-age
boys who are its target audience. And even that group might be a
little distressed during the scene in which an erect penis spears a
character through the ears.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, it's that kind of movie. You know what you're in for after
watching the first scene, a takeoff on ``Scream's'' opening
phone-call bit. Here Carmen Electra, playing the victim, picks up
the phone, says hello and breaks wind.
</P>
<P>
   It goes downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons'' has been smartly spoofing horror conventions in
its ``Treehouse of Horror'' Halloween episodes for the past decade.
So it can be done; it simply requires a little thought, effort and
intelligence. ``Scary Movie,'' directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans and
written by his brothers Shawn and Marlon (along with a host of
other unaccomplished hacks), possesses none of those qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Like all spoofs, ``Scary Movie'' doesn't tell a story so much as
it offers an assembly line of jokes. And like all spoofs, the
success of ``Scary Movie'' depends on the ratio of funny jokes to
failures. For those keeping score at home, this film bats around
.100.
</P>
<P>
   Are there a few laughs? Absolutely. One character, when asked to
choose a favorite scary movie, picks ``Kazaam.'' A loud moviegoer
(Regina Hall) gets her comeuppance for talking on her cell phone
during ``Shakespeare in Love.'' A girls gym teacher, Miss Mann
(Jayne Trcka), has a rather disturbing and not-too-subtle secret.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, this is uninspired potty humor that's fixated on
genitalia and homophobia. The jokes are predominantly tired,
unimaginative and poorly delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie''? You bet. &QL;

ROCKET'S TEST CLEARS WAY

<P>
   The successful flight of a Proton rocket has cleared the way for
Russia to launch the long delayed crew module of the U.S.-led
international space station, NASA said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The one-of-a-kind crew module is to lift off from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Tuesday at 11:56 p.m. CDT. The
43-foot-long spacecraft is also known as the service module or
``Zvezda,'' the Russian word for ``star.''
</P>
<P>
   The normally reliable Proton exploded twice last year. Those
explosions and Russia's economic ills have delayed the crew
module's launching by 27 months. Once the module is added to the
two uninhabited modules lofted in late 1998, the outpost will be
ready to accept resident astronauts and cosmonauts late this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Proton explosions in July and October 1999, the
U.S. and Russian space agencies agreed to upgrade the rocket's
propulsion systems before proceeding with the crew module
launching.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, the modified Proton was to be
successfully test launched twice before a third rocket was fitted
with the crew module. The Proton launched a military communications
satellite late Tuesday. The previous successful flight was June 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went off great,'' NASA spokesman Dwayne Brown said of
Tuesday's test. ``Now the Russians are getting ready to take the
service module to the (launch) pad.''
</P>
<P>
   The station's 16-nation partnership envisions an orbital outpost
for cooperative research in physics, biology and medicine. When
fully assembled, the outpost will sprawl to the size of two
football fields side-by-side and house a crew of seven. &QL;

<P>
   Trying a little too hard to earn belly laughs the play doesn't
necessarily need, the touring production of Shakespeare
Festival/LA's ``Much Ado About Nothing'' is more effective when its
characters get serious.
</P>
<P>
   When the meant-for-each pair Beatrice and Benedick are bickering
and posturing, they're a tad buffoonish, but once matters turn to
duels and family disgrace, Stephanie Erb and Geoffrey Lower are
more than up to snuff.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the play's hidden tripwire. As the title suggests,
``Much Ado'' is a fairly frothy comedy that contains, at its
center, a hero and heroine whose barbs mask feelings of longing. A
director can work the play's darker elements or he can play the
broad strokes, keeping everything nice and frisky. Combining the
two elements is often a risky proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Here, director Brendon Fox is trying hard to have things both
ways. He's peppered the action with more than a few hi-jinks (you
just know someone in hiding is going to fall into that Jacuzzi),
but, at the same time, he seems to demonstrate that love really
comes with a price tag. Not many productions of ``Much Ado'' will
devote this kind of attention to the plight of Margaret, the
serving-woman who enables the play's central deception to take
place.
</P>
<P>
   What we're left with, then, is a decidedly mixed bag _ a
production that is occasionally funny, more often poignant, but
doesn't always handle its shifts in tone with terrific smoothness.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have never seen the play (or the 1993 Kenneth
Branagh movie), ``Much Ado'' has two parallel plots. While sparring
partners Beatrice and Benedick are trying to figure out whether
they despise or love each other, Benedick's comrade-in-arms,
Claudio (played by Darin Singleton) seeks to marry Hero (Terrilynn
Towns), the daughter of a wealthy landowner, Leonato (James
Sutorius). Claudio gets help in his endeavor from Don Pedro (Chris
Butler), captain of the regiment while Pedro's bastard brother, Don
John (Rob Nagle), schemes to break up the union.
</P>
<P>
   The Beatrice-Benedick doings are aided by various comrades and
servants, all of whom work to ensure that strategically aimed
gossip is overheard at the right moment by the right person. Out of
these situations come, you guessed it, comic pratfalls and
unanticipated Jacuzzi baths.
</P>
<P>
   Fox sets the action in present day, meaning Pedro, Claudio and
Benedick are on shore leave from the U.S. Navy. They arrive at
Leonato's estate not in military dress whites (although those weeds
come out for revels) but in Hawaiian shirts and khakis. The women
wear gowns and tankinis, and occasionally carry tennis rackets.
Yael Pardess's cheery yellow palazzo estate accommodates all the
action easily.
</P>
<P>
   The first snipes Beatrice lobs in Benedick's direction suggest
we're in for a long evening. Erb speaks with an over-emphasized
forcefulness, as though she's looking either to win an insult
contest or to seriously hurt someone's feelings. Lower parries with
a less aggressive grace, but the chemistry between the two actors
is slow to develop. Later on, once the two have been duped and are
both working toward clearing Hero's name, things smooth out
considerably. By then, Erb is in full rage mode. She should almost
be playing Katherine in ``Taming of the Shrew.'' Or Medea.
</P>
<P>
   Where comic timing is concerned, the entire cast could steal a
page from David Manis, the rug-wearing, Red Vines-chewing Constable
Dogberry. Strangely built and a vocal dead ringer for Nick Nolte,
Manis' befuddled security guard is a major doofus. And he's the
production's brightest light. Sutorius also does fine, steady work
with Leonato.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a pleasant evening, though not particularly
memorable. Fortunately, ``Much Ado'' is ubiquitous enough that if
you don't like this production, another one figures to be along in
five minutes. I'm particularly anxious to see what ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel's'' Douglas Sills will do with the role of Benedick next
year at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa. &QL;

`RAGE' AGAINST THE DIRECTOR

(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 1 star

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's the Rage'' is a dark comedy without the laughs, a message
movie without anything to say, a film that's intended as an actors'
showcase that winds up being the movie most likely to be deleted
from a resume.
</P>
<P>
   The film debuted last fall at the Toronto Film Festival under
the title ``All the Rage'' and promptly disappeared from sight. For
the sake of the principals' careers, it should have remained
hidden. Chicago playwright Keith Reddin adapted his own play for
the screen, and while his work might have achieved some edgy
immediacy on the stage, it arrives on the screen as a painful
example of stilted amateurism.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Gary Sinise, Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels, Andre
Braugher, Robert Forster, Giovanni Ribisi, Anna Paquin and David
Schwimmer sign up for this travesty? Obviously, the film's anti-gun
message and theatrical pedigree acted as a draw. But in the hands
of Broadway producer James D. Stern, making his feature directorial
debut, the movie's themes are obvious, botched or completely
indiscernible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Rage'' means to both imitate and satirize ``Pulp
Fiction,'' with several interweaving stories leading up to a
climactic bloodbath. (Oneof the film's characters even returns a
tape of ``Pulp Fiction'' to a video store, remarking that he wasn't
impressed.) But the movie's individuals, meant to represent a
cross-section of Main Street USA, are nothing more than
stereotypes. Men are homicidal maniacs; women are victims. Vive la
difference!
</P>
<P>
   Among the cast of characters: Warren Harding (Daniels), a smug
businessman who shoots his partner of 11 years in his living room.
His explanation: ``I heard a noise.'' His wife, Helen (Allen),
doesn't buy it. She wants a divorce; he threatens to hunt her down.
So Helen takes refuge as the personal assistant to a reclusive
computer mogul (Sinise),whose chief aim in life is to ``keep the
input out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Warren's lawyer, Tim Sullivan (Braugher), is toying
with having an affair with an underage street urchin (Paquin). This
doesn't sit well either with Sullivan's jealous lover (Schwimmer)
or the urchin's homicidal brother (Ribisi). The inevitable
denouement follows.
</P>
<P>
   Stern does an unbelievably poor job in conveying the
screenplay's intended themes of isolation and disconnection, and
the film's stories only merge in the most superficial and
improbable of ways. The movie has nothing new to say about guns or
violence. If anything, the message that it unintentionally delivers
_ guns don't kill people, lunatics kill people _ ends up being a
promotional vehicle for the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere Charlton Heston must be laughing his head off. &QL;

   SONY WILL PUMP UP PALM OPERATING SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   The personal digital assistant market got a little confusing
last week as Sony unveiled an ultra slim, lithium-ion powered PDA
that uses the operating system licensed from Palm Inc. Sony
executives say the device pushes Palm capabilities to a higher
level of ease of use and flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to emphasize that Sony understands that
useability is the most important factor in the PDA,'' said Keiji
Kimura, president of the information technology company for the
Sony Corp. ``We place it at the top of the priorities when
designing our product.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimura said the new device, which had not been named, was a work
in progress. It mimics many of the most popular features found in
Palms, including electronic address books, calendars and simple
synchronization with a personal computer. Although the device does
not include onboard wireless Internet connection, like the Palm
VII, the Sony palm-sized computer features a slot for its Memory
Sticks, portable flash memory modules about the size of a stick of
chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   Memory Sticks, said Takashi Sugiyama, general manager of Sony's
network Service Business Center, will not only add memory to the
device (just how much is yet to be announced), but the memory
modules can also add applications.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's new handheld devices are expected to be introduced in
Japan this month and be available in the United States by late
summer or early fall, Kimura said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony would not say how much the device would cost, but Sugiyama
said it would be ``competitive'' with similar devices.
</P>
<P>
   The devices, he said, will include color and black-and-white
models, each with a push-button dial called a JogDial that allows
users to access information with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   PALM WILL SUPPORT COMPETITORS' MODULES
</P>
<P>
   Palm Inc., maker of the leading brand of handheld computers,
announced last week at PC Expo in New York that it would begin
software support for its competitors' expansion modules.
</P>
<P>
   A number of hardware manufacturers, including most recently
Sony, license the Palm operating system. The company also announced
that it would add an expansion module for its own portable
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Palm will use a Secure Digital card to expand the capability of
the next round of Palm devices. The SD card is the size of a
postage stamp and can store as much as 128 megabytes of data.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the SD card, Palm will support the Memory Stick
from Sony, the Springboard module from Handspring and a Compact
Flash slot.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Connell, vice president for Palm's Consumer Markets Group,
said the upgrade of the software would allow the company ``to build
lighter and thinner Palm devices which will support a range of
options that consumers want.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Palm has sold its software to companies that have made
significant modifications to the devices.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable competitor is the Handspring Visor, which was
developed by Palm inventor, Jeff Hawkins. The Visor has an
expansion slot that can accommodate a range of add-ons like MP3
players and a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, since the Visor has become available in retail
stores, it has outsold all other handheld devices except Palm
brands and, even there, has been chipping away at Palm's market
share.
</P>
<P>
   According to NPD Intelect, a company that tracks market data,
sales of the Visor in May were up to 25 percent of retail sales
versus Palm's 67 percent. The previous month Palm had nearly 72
percent of retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   David Pogue, author of ``Palm Pilot: The Ultimate Guide''
(O'Reilly, 1999), thinks that Palm response to competitive pressure
will work to the benefit of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every choice you make,'' he said, ``the software will work.''
</P>
<P>
   A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT U.S. DECLARATION
</P>
<P>
   With a new imaging technology called ImagePump, developed by
Xippix of Larkspur, Calif., American history buffs can get an
up-close look at one of the first printed copies of the Declaration
of Independence, only 25 of which are known to survive, according
to Sotheby's online auction site (www.sothebys.com), where the copy
was sold last week for $8.14 million.
</P>
<P>
   The ImagePump magnifier at Sotheby's.com allows the viewer to
click and drag a mouse across different areas of the page, and zoom
in to see the full size print. The actual document measures 19}
inches by 15} inches, but the viewable area on most computer
screens is limited to a 3-inch by 3-inch box, which means only a
few segments can be viewed at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Although it takes a few seconds for the images to load on a 56k
connection, each time the mouse is moved, the ImagePump gives the
viewer a clear rendering of the age spots, crease marks, print
gradations across the page, and the typography peculiar to the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Minner, who developed the ImagePump technology, said it
was being marketed to e-commerce and auction like Amazon and eBay.
ImagePump also has pan, animate and spin features that can be used
to display products at e-commerce sites, Minner said.

   NEW PROTECTION SOFTWARE FOR SAFE WEB SURFING
</P>
<P>
   With the love-letter e-mail virus and intruders stealing the
passwords of America Online staff members, nasty code and naughty
hackers have plagued the computer world frequently this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Although the makers of anti-virus software have been kept busy
stopping the spread of digital plague, two major companies in the
field recently released software to help home users protect their
computers _ and children _ from many types of security threats.
</P>
<P>
   GuardDog Pro, from McAfee Retail Software, helps take a bite out
of computer crime by giving users a variety of software tools. It
offers a built-in firewall to keep hackers out of your house, and
can prevent personal information like credit card numbers from
being sent over the Web without permission. The program also allows
parents to control the sites their children see and can even scan
and block chat messages for inappropriate content.
</P>
<P>
   GuardDog Pro also contains McAfee's anti-virus program, which
offers protection against hackers using password-pilfering Trojan
horse programs, malicious Java applets and ActiveX controls to gain
access to a computer. GuardDog Pro, which costs about $50 and runs
on Windows 95 and 98, can be purchased in stores or on the Web at
software.mcafee.com.
</P>
<P>
   Norton Internet Security Family Edition 2.0, newly updated by
the Symantec Corp., offers many of the same defensive tools and
virus remedies for home users, and can work with Windows 95 and 98,
Windows 2000 and Windows NT. The Norton suite can also be found in
retail stores or on the Web at www.symantec.com for around $80.
</P>
<P>
   Norton and GuardDog can both prevent Web sites from tracking
your surfing habits as you cruise the Internet and both feature
settings that can be configured for each user in the household.
</P>
<P>
   A PLACE TO PUT PHOTOGRAPHS INSTEAD OF IN A SHOE BOX
</P>
<P>
   Although it is possible to send digital photos to relatives via
e-mail, the gesture may not be appreciated if the recipient does
not have a high-speed Internet connection for downloading the image
files.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a photo album Web site (www.cartogra.com) operated by
Hewlett-Packard offers a way to share pictures and minimize the
frustration generated by endless downloading.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site (the name is a combination of cartography and
photography) allows users to upload digital images, either scanned
or made with a digital camera, to create up to five online photo
albums that will hold a total of about 100 photographs. Users may
choose to open their albums to all visitors to the site, limit
viewing by assigning a password or keep the albums private.
</P>
<P>
   To let Granny see pictures of Johnny's birthday, you click on a
navigation button that forwards an e-mail message containing a
password-encoded link. At the site, Granny sees thumbnail pictures,
which download fairly quickly. Clicking on the thumbnails produces
a larger image. Viewers of the pictures can print their photos
themselves, but by late summer they will be able to order prints
from the site, the company said. The company said the prints would
cost 50 cents for a 4-by-6-inch print and $3 for an 8-by-10.
</P>
<P>
   The system does not eliminate all waiting. Users can upload only
three images at a time when creating albums. Cartogra's marketing
manager, Blake Miller, said that each upload should take ``a couple
of minutes'' for dial-up modem users who took their pictures with a
medium-priced digital camera. Higher-quality images, like photo CDs
created from scanned photographic film, upload at a glacial pace
with a dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that Hewlett-Packard intended to keep the basic
album service free, apparently as a way to spur printer and scanner
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Additional services may become available for fees. One idea is
the long-term archival storage of images to replace, as Miller put
it, ``that shoe box most people have in the back of a closet that's
full of photos they never get around to organizing.''

CLINTON CALLS FOR NEW MIDEAST SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With little time left to broker a Middle East peace
deal, President Clinton Wednesday called a high-risk, high-level
Palestinian-Israeli summit at Camp David next Tuesday meant to
prevent the peace process from wasting away from lack of use.
</P>
<P>
   ``To delay this gathering, to remain stalled, is simply no
longer an option,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House after
announcing that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat had accepted his invitation to a summit at the
presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The decades-old conflict ``can move forward toward real peace,
or it can slide back into turmoil. It will not stand still,'' the
president said. ``If the parties do not seize this moment, if they
cannot make progress now, there will be more hostility and more
bitterness, perhaps even more violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for major advancement in the peace talks appeared dim,
with the chief Palestinian negotiator, Ahmed Korei, predicting the
summit would fail. ``The Israeli position is known and will not
change, and the Palestinian position is clear and it, too, will not
change,'' Korei said.
</P>
<P>
   While Barak welcomed the invitation, he was met with defiance at
home. Two parties in Barak's ruling coalition said Wednesday they
would leave his government ahead of the summit, a move that could
seriously undermine the prime minister as he seeks necessary
support for a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also seemed unusually subdued in announcing what he may
have hoped to present as a breakthrough. Camp David was the site of
the historic 1978 talks, headed by President Jimmy Carter, that
resulted in a watershed agreement between Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no easy answers, and certainly no painless ones,''
Clinton said. ``And therefore, there is clearly no guarantee of
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials downplayed the significance of
the disruption in Israeli politics after the summit announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone here is denying that it will occupy some
of his attention prior to the meeting,'' a diplomatic source said,
referring to Barak. But the Israeli leader ``has the mandate of the
people,'' which is more important, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a constituency here, or a constituency there,
wants to pull out (of the government) doesn't interfere with what
he wants,'' said Jonathan S. Paris, a fellow with the Middle East
Project of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. ``If he
comes back with a peace agreeement, the people will really rally
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators will arrive this weekend for preliminary meetings,
and Barak and Arafat will get together on Tuesday, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Clinton will cancel or postpone some
planned events, but he is not completely clearing his schedule for
the summit, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no time frame for the meetings, but both diplomatic
officials and analysts predicted the summit would go for several
days. Clinton is committed to attending the G-8 economic conference
in Japan the week after the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he called the summit for next week because he was
convinced that no further progress could be made unless Barak and
Arafat were personally involved. ``While Israeli and Palestinaian
negotiators have made real progress . . . the truth is they can
take the talks no further at their level,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action does have its perils, but so too does inaction,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official likened the peace process to a
bicycle: If it stops completely, it will fall down, and it will be
much more difficult to get it up and running again. But if it is
moved continuously, however slowly, there is a better chance of
making it to the desired destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a tough go. That's the reality,'' said the
official, who asked to remain anonymous. But ``if we don't go to a
summit, the process will stay where it is,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians have been negotiating for nearly seven
years to settle an array of differences on issues including
borders, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Palestinian
refugees and Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered peace process is running up against critical
deadlines. Arafat has warned that unless the two sides meet a
self-imposed Sept. 13 deadline for an agreement, Palestinians will
unilaterally declare their own state. That would almost certainly
prompt a dramatic reaction from Israel, including the annexation of
some West Bank lands, and raise the possibility of clashes between
Israeli and Palestinian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has his own deadline as well. With barely six months
left in office, the president has little time to broker an
agreement, and then convince Congress to approve the huge aid
packages that are expect to accompany such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is not successful, the next president _ whoever it is
_ starts at a disadvantage. Clinton has spent a great deal of time
and personal effort in attempting to bring peace to the Middle
East, and has won the confidence of many of the players in the
region. The new US president would have to build his own
relationships, likely delaying the process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would also benefit from the positive element a peace
deal would add to his legacy as president, although his aides
insist he is not motivated by ensuring his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   The president has had successes in the process, including
bringing Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to the
White House, where the two longtime foes shook hands in 1993. Rabin
was assassinated in 1995, and the peace agreement unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Palestinian summit may well not produce a hard
agreement, but may keep the process alive and thus avoid a
potentially disastrous confrontation in September, said Anthony H.
Cordesman, a former senior Pentagon official now with the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the conference fails, it is likely that a slower,
lower-profile process would have failed as well,'' Cordesman said.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE MOST FAMOUS SPORTSWRITER 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a sportswriter plans to write his autobiography, and believes
he needs a little help, then it would seem natural for him to seek
out another sportswriter. That, apparently, was what Walter Matthau
did. Oddly enough, Matthau, the Tony Award and Academy Award
winning actor, might be the most famous sportswriter of his time,
Red Smith, Jimmy Cannon, Jim Murray and Dave Anderson
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the role of Oscar Madison _ ``the poker-playing
sportswriter and all-around slob,'' as Matthau described him _
created by Matthau in both the Broadway play and the Hollywood film
version of ``The Odd Couple'' in the mid-to-late '60s, remains by
virtue of his acting brilliance the quintessential sportswriter.
</P>
<P>
   One day some 15 years ago Matthau invited me to lunch at the
Beverly Hills Tennis Club. We sat at a table outdoors and under an
umbrella. He was, in many ways, the Matthau I had come to know from
the screen: intelligent, witty in an understated manner, with
sympathetic eyes that took the measure of a man without piercing
him, but, unlike Oscar, neatly dressed in a sport jacket and he
knew which fork to use without making a show of it.
</P>
<P>
   We talked generally about sports, about acting, about language _
he loved words and recalled reading Shakespeare as a boy and not
understanding it fully but being mesmerized by ``the rhythm of the
language'' _ and then Matthau, in that familiar gravelly voice,
said to me: ``Swifty Lazar, the literary agent, tells me that if I
write my autobiography, I could make 2 million dollars. If you
write it with me, I'll give you half.'' I was eating a bowl of
borscht at that moment and nearly choked on the sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   Though we did work on it, we never completed the book. What we
did establish, however, what we shared, was a friendship. We talked
often over the years, we met, we corresponded. Then Walter took ill
with pneumonia and assorted ailments and was in an induced coma for
38 weeks last year. He was released from the hospital and in the
last few months rallied, fell back, rallied. Then last Saturday at
about 4 a.m. Los Angeles time, I received a heart-wrenching phone
call from his wife. I was out of town but she left a message:
``It's Carol. It's what you think. Please call.'' Walter was dead,
at age 79.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau once told me that ``The Odd Couple'' made him a star.
``I think without that part,'' he said, ``without doing Oscar, I'd
still be doing character roles on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau had, by the time the show opened on March 10, 1965, been
in more than 30 films, but primarily in supporting roles. He
accepted an offer to play Whiplash Willie, the unscrupulous lawyer,
in ``The Fortune Cookie,'' opposite Jack Lemmon, and won an Academy
Award for his performance.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau was a great sports fan, but, beyond that, he was
addicted to gambling on sports. He admitted to being a compulsive
gambler. He said that he lost $5 million in his life betting, but
he earned more than $40 million. As a young stage actor he lost
$185,000 on baseball games to bookies, was threatened by mobsters,
and for the next six years paid them back with, he said, ``Almost
every cent I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau would sometimes have 15 television sets going in his
home, each with a game on, each with a $5,000 bet on it. He'd
scream at the referees, or umpires, when his bet was going South:
``You're blind! You're a crook! You're robbing me!''
</P>
<P>
   And then when they called a play his way: ``Oh, maybe these guys
are honest.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that perhaps he worked so hard, and gambled so hard,
because he never lost the desperation of trying to overcome poverty
from growing up on the Lower East Side. (He recalled conversations
with friends at the time: ``You think the rats are bad in my house,
you should see the rats in that guy's house. You could put a saddle
on them.'')
</P>
<P>
   Despite gambling, he could enjoy the artistry of an athletic
performance, of the drama of the event. He marveled at Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and Willie Mays, among others, but his favorite
player, he said, was Chubby Sherman, a classmate of his at Seward
Park High School, and the school's basketball ace. ``Chubby was a
dead shot,'' Matthau once told me. ``And he was blind.'' Blind? I
said. ``He could hardly see. He wore glasses, but only off the
court. He just got an idea of where the basket was and threw it up
and it went in. Uncanny.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau also played sports. He was a center fielder in the
Broadway Show League for a play he was in. Henry Fonda, a friend
whom he admired and with whom he had spent hours talking about
acting, was a spectator at one game. Matthau came running in, as he
recalls, ``to make a Willie Mays catch,'' and the ball ``hit me
right between the legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down,'' Matthau added. ``I was writhing in pain,
screaming, `Help me, oh God, help me!' A big crowd gathered and
Fonda nudged me with his foot. He said, `Walter, bring it down a
little.'''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau laughed when telling the story. We've all laughed for
years with him. Now we shed a tear.

RESENDING TO CORRECT PHANTOM COPY 
HIP TO SEE `SQUARE'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tucked away in the program of ``The Square'' is a telling little
note that demonstrates the luxury of producing a play within a
workshop format: ``Plays and order,'' the program reads, ``are
subject to change.''
</P>
<P>
   This line might otherwise be by-passed were it not for the fact
``The Square'' _ the ambitious and quite intriguing second entry in
the Center Theatre Group's experimental program, Taper, Too _ is
actually a bunch of short plays grouped around a single location.
With 16 plays by 16 playwrights presented in a work-in-progress
structure, could things still change? Well, duh! Should they?
Unquestionably.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for those fortunate to catch ``The Square'' (which
runs only through July 16 at the Actor's Gang in Hollywood) is that
it contains more wheat than chaff. This is, after all, 16 of the
country's most significant contemporary playwrights all working
toward a common theme and goal.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate kudos, then, to co-creators Lisa Peterson (the piece's
director) and Chay Yew (director of the Taper's Asian Theatre
Workshop, and one of the 16 playwrights) for what must have been a
highly difficult endeavor. Dramatically, ``The Square'' may not
possess the neat symmetry of its metaphor, but then again 120 years
of Asian-American history shouldn't fit neatly into a four-sided
box.
</P>
<P>
   The location is the same town square in Manhattan's Chinatown
during four decades (1880s, 1920s, 1960s and 2000s). Using white
powder, the 12 members of the cast _ all playing multiple roles _
line out a square on Rachel Hauck's largely bare stage. Then the
space gets busy. In this park and its environs, people of all ages
and races meet for auditions, peace rallies, assignations, trysts
and haircuts. Servants will learn English. Masters will drown their
cares in opium dens. A representative from Amazon.com will even go
to extreme lengths to expose the author of a dubious Asian-American
memoir.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about shifts in tone. David Henry Hwang's ``Jade Flowerpots
and Bound Feet'' (Amazon.com rep vs. poseur) is an exercise in dark
comic cynicism while Yew's ``Scissors,'' three segments later, is a
painful character study of a Caucasian high roller in the 1920s
(played by Arye Gross) and the blind Chinese barber (Soon-Tek Oh)
he sees every week. Contrast these with ``The Spot,'' Robert
O'Hara's hilarious mixed-race double cross in which two women are
staking out a piece of the park for a speech by Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   What common strands connect these works? Sometimes several,
other times, practically none. The servant who learns the words
``lonely, lonely, lonely'' in Han Ong's untitled play is echoed by
the servant looking to lop off his braid in Diana Son's
``Handsome.'' The young gay doctor in Craig Lucas' ``Examination''
also knows how it feels to be ``lonely, lonely, lonely.'' So many
of the characters who pass through the square feel isolated,
threatened or abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rules of four that Yew and Peterson appear to be
following (four playwrights writing for each of the four decades)
``The Square'' could use some judicious pruning. A few of the
segments feel like wayward musings rather than parts of the whole,
and the play used as a framing device, Mac Wellman's ``My Old Habit
of Returning to Places'' is just plain bizarre, and a poor choice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``The Square'' has much to offer. The ensemble is
excellent and Peterson's staging is fluid. I don't know what shape
the play will ultimately take, but one day in the not too distant
future, I expect the Center Theatre Group will have occasion to
boast that ``The Square'' began its life here in L.A. &QL;

 &HT;    2,500 Delta workers taking enhanced early retirement
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - About 2,500 Delta Air Lines workers are leaving the
carrier to take advantage of an enhanced early retirement offer.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said Wednesday the employees opted for a special
plan exempting eligible early retirees from certain medical benefit
premiums, a benefit typically worth around $500 a month for a
couple.
</P>
<P>
   Delta had estimated as many as 10,000 workers were eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, which was extended last winter and is closed, wasn't
aimed at paring the work force, said Jackie Pate, a spokeswoman.
The intent was to respond to persistent employee complaints about
the cost of medical benefit premiums for early retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Delta began requiring early retirees to pay medical premiums
when the airline was in financial distress in the mid-1990s. Some
older workers complained the move derailed early retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an issue employees continued to tell us about,'' Pate
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no plan to repeat the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Pate said most of the positions being vacated will be refilled.
Delta has about 73,000 employees, nearly 30,000 of them based at
its Atlanta headquarters and flight hub.
</P>
<P>
   Delta will take a one-time charge of $86 million for the early
retirement program in the quarter that ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Delta also made three other financial announcements:
</P>
<P>
   1. It will record a non-cash gain of $228 million in the quarter
for the conversion of 6 million shares of common stock in
Priceline.com to preferred stock paying an 8 percent annual
dividend. Delta has previously taken cash gains totaling $785
million from the sale of stock it holds in the Internet
seat-seller.
</P>
<P>
   Delta got stock holdings in return for being the first major
carrier to sell seats at the site, a deal that turned out to be
lucrative. Delta, which still has warrants for 5.5 million shares,
also negotiated a clause that prevents rivals from selling seats
through the site out of Delta hubs such as Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   2. Delta will take a $66 million one-time charge for an
accounting change related to the sale of SkyMiles to partners.
</P>
<P>
   3. The carrier is switching to a calendar fiscal year, ending
its use of a June 30 fiscal year. That practice apparently stemmed
from its origins as a crop-dusting service in Louisiana, with the
financial reporting cycle timed to coincide with the seasons. The
switch takes effect this year, and Delta will issue two annual
reports for 2000 _ one for the fiscal year ended June 30 and
another for the calendar year ending Dec. 31.

PEDRO ON AGAIN, OFF AGAIN ALL-STAR VISITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Pedro Martinez is an American League All-Star. Who
doesn't know that?
</P>
<P>
   But he will not be participating in Tuesday night's game for a
couple of reasons, starting with the fact that he is not really an
official All-Star but, rather, a rare special invitee who is being
asked to come because, well, because he is Pedro, The Best Pitcher
in Baseball. And then there's the fact that the Red Sox would
prefer he not pitch, even if he were healthy enough to do so by
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And Pedro? No offense, but he has changed his story twice, and
the week isn't even over yet.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion reigned supreme Wednesday on this whole business of
Pedro and the All-Star Game. Major League Baseball put out a
release saying that Boston's nonpareil righthander has received
``special permission from the National League and Major League
Baseball to include Martinez in the All-Star festivities and
introductions in recognition of his first-half performance and
career excellence.'' The release added, ``Martinez is permitted on
the AL bench for the game, but is unavailable to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   This was all news to Pedro, who was holding court at his locker
and telling the assembled scribes that the decision whether to
pitch would basically be up to him and the Red Sox. ``It's up to me
whether I want to go,'' he said. ``But if I do go, I would want to
start because if I go to relieve I won't be able to do my proper
preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   And should Pedro start?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no. David Wells has earned it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for going to Atlanta in a non-playing capacity, Pedro was
busy reversing his Tuesday declaration that he would be honored to
do so. Now he was saying, ``I'm not very interested in going if I'm
not going to pitch. I never go to any of the parties, anyway. I
stay in my room and sleep. I do the signings and I go to my room.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams made it clear he didn't want to
see Pedro relieving. ``Look at this realistically,'' Williams said.
``He has a specific preparation, and if he is going to relieve he
won't have that preparation. Selfishly, I want him to be able to
start that first game against the Mets on Thursday. But I think he
should go to Atlanta. This is a tremendous honor. He's not on the
active roster. He's a special invitee, and I think that's
unprecedented, at least for a pitcher. It's an honor, and
deservedly so.''
</P>
<P>
   When all the smoke has cleared, be assured that Martinez won't
be pitching Tuesday night. But will he be there?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Pedro,'' said the skipper.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro doesn't know. It's only Thursday. What's the rush?

CLINTON CALLS FOR NEW MIDEAST SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With little time left to broker a Middle East peace
deal, President Clinton Wednesday called a high-risk, high-level
Palestinian-Israeli summit at Camp David next Tuesday meant to
prevent the peace process from wasting away from lack of use.
</P>
<P>
   ``To delay this gathering, to remain stalled, is simply no
longer an option,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House after
announcing that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat had accepted his invitation to a summit at the
presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The decades-old conflict ``can move forward toward real peace,
or it can slide back into turmoil. It will not stand still,'' the
president said. ``If the parties do not seize this moment, if they
cannot make progress now, there will be more hostility and more
bitterness, perhaps even more violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for major advancement in the peace talks appeared dim,
with the chief Palestinian negotiator, Ahmed Korei, predicting the
summit would fail. ``The Israeli position is known and will not
change, and the Palestinian position is clear and it, too, will not
change,'' Korei said.
</P>
<P>
   While Barak welcomed the invitation, he was met with defiance at
home. Two parties in Barak's ruling coalition said Wednesday they
would leave his government ahead of the summit, a move that could
seriously undermine the prime minister as he seeks necessary
support for a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also seemed unusually subdued in announcing what he may
have hoped to present as a breakthrough. Camp David was the site of
the historic 1978 talks, headed by President Jimmy Carter, that
resulted in a watershed agreement between Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no easy answers, and certainly no painless ones,''
Clinton said. ``And therefore, there is clearly no guarantee of
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials downplayed the significance of
the disruption in Israeli politics after the summit announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone here is denying that it will occupy some
of his attention prior to the meeting,'' a diplomatic source said,
referring to Barak. But the Israeli leader ``has the mandate of the
people,'' which is more important, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a constituency here, or a constituency there,
wants to pull out (of the government) doesn't interfere with what
he wants,'' said Jonathan S. Paris, a fellow with the Middle East
Project of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. ``If he
comes back with a peace agreeement, the people will really rally
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators will arrive this weekend for preliminary meetings,
and Barak and Arafat will get together on Tuesday, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Clinton will cancel or postpone some
planned events, but he is not completely clearing his schedule for
the summit, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no time frame for the meetings, but both diplomatic
officials and analysts predicted the summit would go for several
days. Clinton is committed to attending the G-8 economic conference
in Japan the week after the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he called the summit for next week because he was
convinced that no further progress could be made unless Barak and
Arafat were personally involved. ``While Israeli and Palestinaian
negotiators have made real progress . . . the truth is they can
take the talks no further at their level,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action does have its perils, but so too does inaction,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official likened the peace process to a
bicycle: If it stops completely, it will fall down, and it will be
much more difficult to get it up and running again. But if it is
moved continuously, however slowly, there is a better chance of
making it to the desired destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a tough go. That's the reality,'' said the
official, who asked to remain anonymous. But ``if we don't go to a
summit, the process will stay where it is,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians have been negotiating for nearly seven
years to settle an array of differences on issues including
borders, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Palestinian
refugees and Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered peace process is running up against critical
deadlines. Arafat has warned that unless the two sides meet a
self-imposed Sept. 13 deadline for an agreement, Palestinians will
unilaterally declare their own state. That would almost certainly
prompt a dramatic reaction from Israel, including the annexation of
some West Bank lands, and raise the possibility of clashes between
Israeli and Palestinian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has his own deadline as well. With barely six months
left in office, the president has little time to broker an
agreement, and then convince Congress to approve the huge aid
packages that are expect to accompany such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is not successful, the next president _ whoever it is
_ starts at a disadvantage. Clinton has spent a great deal of time
and personal effort in attempting to bring peace to the Middle
East, and has won the confidence of many of the players in the
region. The new US president would have to build his own
relationships, likely delaying the process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would also benefit from the positive element a peace
deal would add to his legacy as president, although his aides
insist he is not motivated by ensuring his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   The president has had successes in the process, including
bringing Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to the
White House, where the two longtime foes shook hands in 1993. Rabin
was assassinated in 1995, and the peace agreement unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Palestinian summit may well not produce a hard
agreement, but may keep the process alive and thus avoid a
potentially disastrous confrontation in September, said Anthony H.
Cordesman, a former senior Pentagon official now with the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the conference fails, it is likely that a slower,
lower-profile process would have failed as well,'' Cordesman said.

TO RUN AWAY AND CREATE A CIRCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLE, France _ You can't just run away and join the circus
in France these days. First you have to go to school, one of some
500 circus schools of varying degrees of excellence that have
sprung up across the land to serve the nouveau cirque, or new
circus, movement. Then, with whatever skills you have honed, you go
looking for a job in one of 300 circuses currently operating here.
Finally, after a few years of touring as an employee, yes, you may
run away _ to create your own troupe.
</P>
<P>
   So it was for Antoine Rigot and Agathe Olivier. The French
husband-and-wife team met at Annie Fratellini's National Circus
School in Paris in 1979 and spent long years performing their
high-wire act for other companies, including the renowned Cirque du
Soleil of Montreal during a three-year American tour in the
mid-1980s. By 1996, when they formed Les Colporteurs (meaning
peddlers or hawkers), they, too, wanted to do something different.
</P>
<P>
   A result was ``Filao,'' a one-ring spectacle of acrobatics,
humor and music, performed by four women and three men. Well
received when it had its premiere in 1997, ``Filao'' _ the name of
a tropical hardwood as well as a pun on fil-a-haut, or high wire _
has since been presented more than 200 times in France and
neighboring countries. Now, after performances at the Spoleto
Festival in Charleston, S.C., and in Raleigh, N.C., the show is
opening this week in New York as part of Lincoln Center Festival
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The piece was inspired by Italo Calvino's short novel ``The
Baron in the Trees,'' which tells of a young aristocrat who,
disgusted with the world, climbs a tree on the family estate and
never comes down. But for all the moments of absurdity or
philosophical insight, ``Filao'' is still circus; it must, in the
absence of elephants and tigers, provide moments of danger for the
big-top crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Here the trapeze artists do not disappoint, flying, twisting,
spinning and catching with immaculate timing that underlines their
years of practice. This being nouveau cirque, though, they execute
their feats to music and with considerable theatricality,
``debating and challenging each other between earth and sky,'' as
the French daily Liberation put it.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, for Rigot, who is the troupe's artistic director,
what is most appealing about nouveau cirque is just that: the
mixing of art forms that can turn a circus into a theater or a
concert hall or a street corner. Like Les Arts Sauts, the French
nouveau cirque troupe that performed at last year's festival, Les
Colporteurs are turning Lincoln Center into a circus, setting up
their 49-foot-high big top, with bleacher seats for 550. The
performance on July 26 will be the very last one of ``Filao.'' Once
they return to France, Les Colporteurs will begin working on a new
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filao,'' though, has served them well, not only earning them a
solid reputation in France but also enabling them to create a
tightly knit team of acrobats and musicians. Rigot, 38, and
Olivier, 43, who have two children, remain the tightrope artists,
doing both perilous and funny turns in the air and on the ground.
Kathleen Reynolds, a native New Yorker, is described as a dancer,
although she does far more, while four others are aerialists and
trapeze artists. Carl Schlosser, one of the show's three musicians,
also composed the score.
</P>
<P>
   A key figure for ``Filao,'' though, was Laszlo Hudi, a Hungarian
experimental theater director who had helped Rigot and Olivier
create a work called ``Amore Captus,'' which they toured for two
years before founding Les Colporteurs. When they decided to use
``The Baron in the Trees,'' they again turned to Hudi for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laszlo doesn't come up with ideas, he helps others develop
their ideas,'' Rigot said one recent evening in his wood caravan
after a performance of ``Filao'' in Marseille. ``Laszlo's talent is
to bring stories to life. So in this case, we did a sort of
storyboard, picking out key words and images. We then asked
everyone to write poems around them. And from these poems, we began
to improvise. At first, it didn't produce much, but slowly, day by
day, things emerged. Eventually, everything belonged to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In its final version, ``Filao'' is divided into 12
``movements,'' each inspired by one of the poems and accompanied by
music that was also created through improvisation. By now,
Calvino's novel is present only in a poetic sense. There are
branches, trees and forests, there are struggles to overcome
gravity, there are tables and chairs floating in the ether, as if
life in the air were as natural as life on the ground. Why
shouldn't a young woman take to the sky wearing a frilly evening
dress and red high heels? It is just her misfortune that her arms
and legs are attached to ropes that others pull on to turn her into
a marionette.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is a mosaic of images evoking the same thing,'' Hudi
explained, ``life on many levels, the horizontal, the vertical,
emphasizing each performer's solitude and dependence on others.''
</P>
<P>
   For the future, having embraced the circus as metaphor, Rigot
sees no limit to what can inspire him. For instance, imagine
Dante's ``Divine Comedy'' adapted to the circus _ Inferno,
Purgatory and Paradise all under the big top.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said the stocky, good-natured tightrope artist, ``is
our next idea.''

BUSH WANTS TO SPEND $100 MILLION ON SPEEDING IMMIGRANT
APPLICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Gov. George W. Bush told members of one of the
nation's largest and most influential Hispanic groups Wednesday
that he was on a mission to topple any stereotypes that Republicans
were insensitive to minorities and new immigrants. And he sought to
prove his own compassion by proposing to spend an additional $100
million in federal money every year to expedite foreigners'
applications for immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what party you're from,'' said Bush,
striking a studiously bipartisan note, as he stood before more than
1,000 people at the annual convention of the National Council of La
Raza. ``You've got to admit: When it takes three to five years to
process paperwork, that's too long. It's time to reform the INS.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor first called for an overhaul of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service in an address last week to a
meeting of the League of United Latin American Citizens in
Washington. At that time, he proposed splitting the immigration
agency into two operations, one dedicated to law enforcement and
the other to providing services to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, he also proposed a modest infusion of additional
federal money for those services, saying the agency should hire
more workers and institute performance incentives so that no
immigration application languishes for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush mentioned that plan only in passing, in the context of
a fairly general assertion of his belief that his agenda,
priorities and attitude of compassion should appeal to minority
voters who had perhaps been suspicious of Republicans in the past.
</P>
<P>
   He made that claim in a state where many Hispanic voters still
feel profound resentment over the harsh tone of Republicans'
successful quest several years ago to pass Proposition 187, which
sought to deny public services to the children of illegal
immigrants. Court challenges subsequently blocked implementation of
parts of that policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has repeatedly acknowledged that he faces a formidable
challenge in courting Hispanic voters in California. But he asked
them Wednesday to judge him not by the past actions of members of
his party but by the amount of time he was spending in densely
Hispanic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to be seen in neighborhoods where sometimes Republicans
aren't seen,'' he said. ``I like to fight that stereotype that
sometimes we don't have the `corazon' necessary to hear the voices
of people from all political parties and all walks of life.''
(Corazon is Spanish for heart.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush repeatedly announced his appreciation of diversity
and his concern for minorities, he did not offer much detail about
the specific policies he wanted to implement, or how they would
help Hispanic people or other minorities. He offered a slightly
altered version of his usual stump speech, framing some of his
positions in terms of how they would benefit foreigners and recent
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   He said that tax cut proposals would help Hispanic
entrepreneurs, that free trade would improve economic conditions in
Mexico, and that his push for educational accountability would lead
to better test scores for minority children. He spoke for 19
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's appearance at the La Raza convention on
Monday night lasted about an hour, half of which was devoted to
answering questions from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not open the door to a similar exchange with the
audience, although he did hold a brief news conference with
reporters after he spoke. His speech was his only public event of
the day, and it came on a week when he planned to spend every other
day at home in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance Wednesday reflected not only his effort to
demonstrate concern for minorities and to project a sensitive,
moderate image, but also his desire to compete seriously for
California's 54 electoral votes _ 21 more than any other state _ or
at least make the appearance of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush does not win the state, his campaign would like to
give Gore a scare and a good reason to spend campaign cash on
advertising in California's expensive media markets.
</P>
<P>
   Making inroads with Hispanic voters, who represented about 13
percent of the Californians who voted in the 1998 elections, is a
key part of Bush's strategy in the state, which he has visited six
times, including Wednesday, since the Republican primaries
essentially ended.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done on many of his previous appearances, Bush
introduced his nephew George P. Bush, the oldest son of his brother
Jeb and Jeb's wife, Columba, and noted that Columba's Mexican
ancestry makes his nephew half-Hispanic. He told the members of La
Raza how proud he was to have Hispanic blood in his family.
</P>
<P>
   In calling for improvements at the INS, Bush was joining voices
in both major political parties and staking ground that was
anything but controversial. Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the
Gore campaign, also said that Bush was defining a problem that was
already on its way to being solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, Bush is playing follow the leader,'' Hattaway
said. ``Al Gore has long believed that we should streamline the
INS, and under the leadership of this administration, the INS has
already cut the application time significantly and expects to
achieve a six-month period by next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said that
Hattaway was referring to applications for naturalization, filed by
immigrants who had already been here for five years, and not
applications for immigration, which he said still entail much
longer delays.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bush left the stage at the La Raza conference, he was
presented with a birthday cake decorated to look like an American
flag. Bush, who turns 54 on Thursday, said he did not have any
special celebration planned.

WORLDCOM AND SPRINT PLAN TO ABANDON MERGER

 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Facing resistance from regulators in the United
States and Europe to their proposed $115 billion merger, WorldCom
Inc. and the Sprint Corp. are planning to announce within days that
they will abandon the deal, executives close to both companies
acknowledged on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The move could immediately turn the companies into takeover
targets for both U.S. companies and foreign companies that have
been seeking a foothold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, which is considered particularly attractive because it
owns a wireless telephone network in addition to its traditional
fixed-line business, has received informal overtures from both
Deutsche Telekom of Germany and from BellSouth, said executives
close to those discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest phone company, is mentioned
as the most likely suitor despite resistance from U.S. legislators
over concern that the German government owns more than 25 percent
of the company. The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., the
largest communications company in Asia, is also seen as a potential
suitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that without a deal WorldCom would have
to go shopping or be shopped, and Sprint or another company like
Qwest might become targets,'' said Andrew Hamerling, a
telecommunications analyst with Banc of America Securities. ``But
it is hard to say what the response from regulators will be if the
suitor is foreign.''
</P>
<P>
   To measure that response, executives for WorldCom and Sprint
have spent time this week talking to regulators in Europe and the
United States about the issues that scuttled their merger and the
implications they raise for any future deals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the time being, both Sprint and WorldCom are
prevented from entering into merger talks with other companies
until they call off their merger, according to provisions of the
initial agreement. Otherwise, if one company unilaterally withdraws
from the accord, it could face a $2.5 billion breakup fee. As long
as neither Sprint nor WorldCom respond substantively to overtures
from other companies, they are not violating the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom, for one, is in no hurry. Although Ron Sommer,
the company's chief executive, has more than $100 billion and has
expressed a desire to enter the U.S. market, executives close to
the company cautioned that no bid for Sprint was imminent. Sommer
has been badly embarrassed before _ attempts to buy Telecom Italia
SpA and Qwest Communications International collapsed _ so he is
expected to be particularly careful, the executives said,
especially with such intense media attention.
</P>
<P>
   And Sprint is not Deutsche Telekom's only option. Among the
companies it is considering is Cable &AMP; Wireless of Britain,
executives close to the company said, though they stressed no offer
is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   If Deutsche Telekom cannot buy Sprint, which would complement
the company's wireless business in Europe, it could build on
overtures it has made with Qwest of Denver. Qwest, which completed
its takeover of U S West over the weekend, would provide the
company with about 29 million customers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that transaction could face resistance from European
regulators because of Qwest's stake in KPNQwest Telecom, a European
telecommunications venture formed with Royal KPN Telecom of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Sprint purchase would fit in well with the EU's concerns
while a Qwest purchase might mean that Qwest would have to divest
its interest in KPNQwest,'' said Tony Ferrugia, a
telecommunications analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and WorldCom had hoped to announce their withdrawal from
their merger on Thursday, but executives said the announcement
would most likely come early next week. Because of the Fourth of
July holiday, some executives and lawyers are on vacation, which
has made it difficult to complete the withdrawal agreement, the
executives said. They said that while both companies had worked in
earnest to save the deal, it became apparent by last weekend that
the deal was unsalvageable.
</P>
<P>
   After European regulators in Brussels, Belgium, moved to block
the transaction because it would create a giant with a stranglehold
over Internet traffic, the Department of Justice sued last week to
block the deal, citing the effect it would have on long-distance
and Internet costs.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie J. Ebbers, WorldCom's chief executive, then became
increasingly resolved that the deal was not worth pursuing if he
was forced to make the kinds of divestitures required by regulators
to get approval for deal, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's chairman and chief executive, William Esrey, had worked
through the weekend trying to revive the deal, but his hopes were
also dashed by the beginning of the week, executives said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ I did have a favorite Beatle (Paul, strictly for his
looks). If pressed, I would name a favorite character on
``Friends'' (Phoebe, for her self-esteem). But choosing a favorite
Satellite Sister is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   I identify with Liz because she quit her big, important
corporate job on her 40th birthday and went out in search of
something new. With Julie because she's an adventurer, living in
Bangkok now and signing up for all kinds of projects even though,
as she says, ``I know eight words in Thai.'' With Monica because
she's single and devoted to her ``small but needy'' dog. With
Sheila because she lives in Greenwich Village, the center of my
emotional universe, and once let herself get into a teeny bit of
trouble with credit card debt. And with Lian because she's
completely overcommitted but, when she grabs a free hour, spends it
having an all-Lancome beauty makeover.
</P>
<P>
   These are actually the Dolan sisters, originally from a big
middle-class family in Fairfield, Conn. But once they grew up they
moved to various parts of the country, and since April they have
been WNYC Radio's rising stars. Their taped hourlong talk show is
so highly thought of that it was given the celebrity time slot on
WNYC-FM: 11 a.m. on Saturdays in New York, right after ``Car
Talk,'' public radio's ratings champion. (On WNYC-AM, the show goes
on at 1 p.m.) ``Satellite Sisters'' has included segments on breast
self-examination, home ownership and a troublesome gravy boat. It
sometimes tests guests' compatibility with their hosts based on the
answers to the questions ``Do you lie to your doctor?'' (perhaps
about how many glasses of wine you have daily) and ``Do you
remember where you were when you heard about the death of Princess
Diana?'' Last month the show went national.
</P>
<P>
   Let me take back the ``talk show'' part. The Dolans, ages 35 to
44 (Julie turns 45 this month), have been saying for months now
that what they do instead is conversation radio. Which must mean
that the sisters don't think very highly of talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frequently primarily structured around confrontation, and
kind of staged,'' says Liz. ``Real life and real conversation don't
actually unfold that way.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Satellite Sisters do on the air is get together for a
big sisterly conference call. Liz is usually in New York (although
she divides her time between Manhattan and Portland, Ore.), Lian is
in Pasadena, Calif., and Julie comes in via satellite from Bangkok
(thus the show's name). The other two sisters _ Monica in Portland
and Sheila in New York _ are sometimes also on the line, depending
on their schedules. The show does have guests (an expert on home
ownership and credit from Fannie Mae in Washington, a sympathetic
dermatologist, a friend suffering from post-partum everything), but
the exchanges are often among the siblings themselves. There is a
lot of laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's original, a real breath of fresh air,'' says their
executive producer, Marjorie Kalins. ``It was probably a gutsy move
on our part to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's conceit, she explains, is that it's the Dolans'
Saturday morning catch-up-on-things telephone call. ``What the
sisters try to do is to bring a certain approach to life,'' she
continues. ``It's about the support that you get through life
with.'' Which means that when Julie is talking about transporting
the gravy boat _ which she uses only once a year, at Thanksgiving _
during the move to Thailand, she's really talking about all the
angst involved in making such a huge change. As the sisters and
their fans point out, this is the way most people talk with their
friends and families about the difficult chapters in their lives.
They tell the funny version.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are connecting with our listeners in very powerful and
strong ways,'' says Laura Walker, WNYC's president. ``They talk
about what's really important _ choices and transitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the show, she says: ``It sounds different. It is different.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something Walker recognized right away when she first got
a call about the idea two years ago. That was not long after Liz
had given up her job as vice president for global marketing at Nike
and was looking for something new and interesting (but less
life-engulfing) to do. Her siblings shared that point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all wanted to still live our own lives,'' says Julie, who
had just made a job change as well, one that gave her more free
time. ``I had two requirements. I didn't want to have to travel and
I didn't want to get dressed up.''
</P>
<P>
   During a weekend together at a mud-bath spa in California, the
sisters started talking about their goals. At some point Julie's
husband suggested they come up with something they could do as a
group, since the women clearly loved spending time together. Pretty
soon they had a single sheet of paper outlining the idea. Then Liz
picked up the phone and called Walker, who had been working at
Children's Television Workshop when Liz was handling a Nike tie-in
there. (``I think I was the only person she knew in radio,'' Walker
says. Absolutely true, say the Dolans.)
</P>
<P>
   Liz's ``Remember me?'' call turned into what the sisters
imagined would be a 15-minute meeting. Liz, Julie and Lian sat down
with Walker in the lobby bar of the Hilton in San Francisco. When
they got up two hours later, they'd been invited to do a pilot.
Their timing was good, because WNYC was re-evaluating its weekend
schedule and Walker was particularly interested in getting more
women's voices on radio. The next thing you know, ``Satellite
Sisters'' had producers. They taped the first segments in August
and September 1998 and spent the next year-and-a-half doing ``a lot
of massaging'' to the concept. (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   At one point they wondered if this idea of having every sister
in a different city was such a great one. But when they did test
segments in which they were together in one room, the sisters found
they relied too much on body language. The physical separation made
for better radio.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago they were all together for the first time in a
year, in New York for a ``creative summit,'' a development meeting
about future shows. Seated around a table in a 24th-floor
conference room, they talked and laughed in much the same way they
do on the air. Lian referred to ``trying to squeeze in this radio
show around preschool.'' Sheila mentioned that her 17-year-old
daughter had seen ``The Vagina Monologues'' three times. The group
declared themselves major radio fans, with particular affection for
Don Imus, contemporary music and public radio of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged to characterize one another in the most
oversimplified ways possible, they described Julie as ``the
conservative, classic one'' (she's also the oldest, a former
academic, married, with two teen-age sons); Liz, ``the bossy one''
and ``the successful one'' (she's the second oldest and single);
Monica, the nurturer (she is, in fact, a nurse and single); Sheila,
``the renegade'' and ``the independent one'' (she started and still
runs a public elementary school on Hudson Street, is divorced but
romantically attached and has a teen-age daughter); and Lian as
``sassy, the smart one'' (she's the youngest, a writer, married,
with two boys).
</P>
<P>
   Listeners, however, are more likely to think of each sister in
terms of particular segments or passing comments. After recent
shows, Lian may be remembered as the one who was having her house
remodeled, Sheila as the dermaholic (the one who owns entirely too
many skin care products), Liz as the one who announced ``I have an
animal in my attic'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   While they were in town they planned to do some quintessentially
New York things together but had not decided what. Julie was hoping
to reacquaint herself with American culture; having been in Bangkok
for a while now, she drew a complete blank when people made
references to ``The Sopranos'' and ``Who Wants to Marry a
Millionaire.'' They planned to go to Liz's Upper West Side
apartment on Saturday morning to listen to their radio show all
together for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's back to what is now their regular routine of e-mail
and telephone communication, including the real (off the air)
weekly conference call. The call is now regularly scheduled when
it's 6 a.m. for Julie, 4 p.m. for Lian and 7 p.m. for Liz. ``We had
tried it originally with Julie on the midnight shift,'' says Liz.
But there was some question as to whether Julie was awake during
the call.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kalins feels confident that all of America is ready
for ``Satellite Sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hitting a nerve or a pulse point or whatever, and about
25 percent of our responses come from men,'' she says. The show is
``about life _ in the same way that `Car Talk' is not just about
cars.''

AGASSI, SAMPRAS ADVANCE TO SEMIFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TEN-WILLIAMS) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Across the net from the hulking Mark
Philippoussis, the knee-high Andre Agassi stood at the crash site
for a barrage of serves that seemed to be ticking as they landed in
the grass before him.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Agassi emerged unscathed Wednesday. With
flashbulb-quick reflexes, Agassi deflected the incoming danger with
his sleight-of-hand returns and nimble footwork, using his
trademark qualities to usher him through his quarterfinal match 7-6
(4), 6-3, 6-4. But just after match point, as Agassi bowed and blew
kisses to each side of Center Court, there was an emanating sense
of disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   The end came so quickly. Although the Wimbledon crowds have come
to crave the style of the slick-headed American, most thought the
10th-seeded Philippoussis, equipped with a 130 mph serve, would
pose much more of a challenge for Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   It was Pete Sampras who had the easy draw, not Agassi. But faced
with the unseeded Jan-Michael Gambill _ the 23-year old American
with a shiny two-handed forehand and six polished Jaguars in his
garage _ Sampras was briefly rattled by his opponents' ability to
counter his slick serves and crafty drop shots with whip-snap
passes.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a temporary scare, though. Sampras regained control
of his match, used 26 aces to dismiss Gambill, 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-4,
6-4, and kept the American dream for a Sampras-Agassi final alive.
To reach that point, Agassi will have to find an escape hatch
against the 12th-seeded Patrick Rafter in the semifinals. And with
nothing but recent film to go on, Sampras will have to prepare for
an unseeded 22-year-old known only in some parts of Belarus and in
a tiny pocket of Brooklyn. As a teen-ager, Vladamir Voltchkov spent
three years training at the Brooklyn Racket Club before going back
to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In a different kind of miracle voyage, Voltchkov defeated Byron
Black, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (2), 6-4, Wednesday to become the first male
qualifier to reach the semifinals at Wimbledon since John McEnroe
did it in 1977. Voltchkov never expected to last this long. When he
walked into the interview room Wednesday, he was wearing shorts he
borrowed from Marat Safin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here without any clothes,'' said Voltchkov, who does
not have a clothing contract, a shoe deal or much money in his
pocket. ``I'm sure after winning a qualifier, you can afford to go
to a restaurant, if you want. My dad is a really good cook, so we
stay at home. We usually just go out for a walk, but I went to see
Gladiator four time already. I prefer to spent my money there.''
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose in the semifinals, Voltchkov is guaranteed at least
$193,000 in prize money. When asked if he would supply his
wardrobe-thin next opponent with some footwear, Sampras was
generous with his sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give him some hard-court shoes,'' Sampras said with a
smile. ``I won't give him any grass-court shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving unhampered on his tender shin, Sampras ran through a pair
or two of his Nikes Wednesday. Gambill had him chasing his shots
several times but could not deliver the pivotal points on cue like
Sampras. To put himself in position to serve for the match, Sampras
ripped a forehand passing shot for a winner to crush the resolve of
an aching Gambill. Often stopping to rub his various pains, Gambill
endured an aching hip and an odd abrasion on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bleeding from the shirt rubbing against my chest,'' said
Gambill who countered Sampras' big serve with 23 aces of his own.
``It was weird. It's not something you want to happen to you on
Center Court.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, Gambill may get another chance on Center Court. By
advancing to the quarterfinals, he rekindled the faith many once
had in him as the next great U.s. player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went through a little sophomore jinx,'' Sampras said.
``He's got a big serve. Whenever you look at a young guy coming up,
you look at a weapon. He's got it.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one on Tour can rival Philippoussis. In his previous two
matches, Philippoussis had launched a total of 77 aces. But Agassi
is a master of the return. As the match drew out, Agassi started to
lock in on Philippoussis' serve. Agassi went from returning 29
percent of his serves in the opening set to 46 percent by the
third. Although Philippoussis pounded 22 aces, he also served up
six untimely double faults, including one on a break point in the
eighth game of the second set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get distracted by people acing me,'' Agassi said. ``I
try to just make sure I do well with the opportunities I get.
That's assuming I'm taking care of my own serve.''
</P>
<P>
   He paid attention to the details of his serve, and mixed up the
looks he gave Philippoussis when he planned his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're standing at the plate, he's a big guy who can blow a
serve by you at 130-plus,'' Agassi said. ``I felt like if I backed
up, he's going to have to take a little bit off of that, and I'll
try to get in tight behind it. If he hits it 130, I'm on it. I'm
going to return it at his feet. It was about giving him a different
look.''
</P>
<P>
   The ever evolving Agassi is a genius of disguise. He came into
this tournament under a cloak of uncertainty. For three months,
Agassi had been on a minor slide that seemed in danger of growing
worse after he tweaked his back at Queen's Club the week before
Wimbledon. But after scrambling past an unnerved Todd Martin in a
five-set comeback to get by the second round, he has played crisp
and clean. Rafter knows what he's up against. He lost to Agassi in
the semifinals here last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre is playing well, but hopefully the outcome can be a
little different for me,'' said Rafter who advanced to the
semifinals after beating Alexander Popp, 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (1). ``I've
played Andre a few times when he's had really bad days. I just hope
he has one again.''

   Sampras, Agassi advance at Wimbledon
</P>
<P>
   By Elizabeth Clarke
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Three masters of grass-court tennis and one
qualifier making history in mismatched and borrowed clothes
advanced into the men's semifinals at Wimbledon on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Six-time champion Pete Sampras, 1999 runner-up Andre Agassi and
two-time semifinalist Patrick Rafter are the masters. Vladimir
Voltchkov of Belarus is the qualifier, who becomes the first
qualifier since John McEnroe in 1977 to reach the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Voltchkov plays top seed Sampras in one semifinal while second
seed Agassi and 12th seed Rafter will meet in the other. Both
matches are Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras survived another round on his injured left leg, beating
fellow American Jan-Michael Gambill 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-4 in a
competitive match on Centre Court. Gambill played with a hip injury
but impressed Sampras with his serving and all-around improved
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was giving me a lot of problems with his second serve,
especially, moving it around, got a big kick,'' Sampras said. ``But
you're looking at the future of American tennis. I think he's a
standout, a young guy with a lot of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Gambill's first Grand Slam quarterfinal, and he hopes it
will be a breakthrough. His ranking will certainly jump from No. 56
in the world and he's been invited to play Davis Cup in two weeks
in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just take away from this match that I played mentally tough
this whole tournament, had a great event,'' Gambill said. ``I'm
going to be confident for the rest of the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' next opponent as he seeks a record 13th Grand Slam is
ranked No. 237 in the world and after five matches is allowing
himself to think about what has happened to him this fortnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play Pete in the semifinals of Wimbledon, what else do you
wish for?'' Voltchkov said after defeating 52nd-ranked Byron Black
7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-2), 6-4. ``It's like a dream come true now. Now I
can say it. Now you enjoy every minute of being on Centre Court.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't think about the fact that his Nike shorts are borrowed
from Marat Safin and that they don't match his adidas shirt. His
adidas shoes last week treated him well and the ones Nike gave him
for the quarterfinals did fine, too, so he won't worry about the
shoes either against Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a clothing company,'' said the 22-year-old former
junior champion here. ``I had some stuff left from last year (but)
I came here without any new clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most players have clothing endorsements that provide new clothes
and shoes for each match. On grass, the shoes are particularly
important because they need to be almost cleats to prevent
slipping.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras joked about helping Voltchkov.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give him some hard-court shoes,'' he said. ``I won't give
him any grass-court shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Voltchkov has been sharing a flat in Wimbledon with his father,
fellow player Max Mirnyi and Mirnyi's father and another player.
They saved money by cooking meals at home and then walking around
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to see Gladiator four times,'' he said. ``I prefer to
spend my money there.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi might feel like a gladiator if he can survive his side of
the draw while Sampras gets a seed-less path to the final. He
played near-perfect tennis in defeating big-serving 10th seed Mark
Philippoussis 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis seemed to lose steam after the first set and
admitted two straight five-setters left him a little sore.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter waits next for Agassi after the Australian defeated
unseeded Alexander Popp 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (7-1). The serve-and-volleyer
has understated his hopes for this tournament, given his recent
comeback from shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope Andre has one of his bad days,'' Rafter said,
smiling. ``The No. 1 thing is you've got to serve well, and you've
got to do it well all day. If you do that, you've got a chance.''

MARKET PLACE: CONFUSION OVER SAUDI'S OIL PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The price of crude oil dropped sharply on Wednesday
after Saudi Arabia's statement on Monday that it was ready to pump
500,000 more barrels a day, but the price did not fall below $30 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and oil industry analysts said confusion remained in the
market. Statements from other members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, some of whom object to Saudi Arabia
acting alone, raised questions about exactly how much more oil the
Saudi pledge would produce.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts contend that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest
producer, wants to push the price of crude oil below $30 a barrel
and will do what is necessary to accomplish that goal _ no matter
the OPEC politics. The 11 OPEC nations have been remarkably
effective of late. Their decision to restrict production beginning
in March 1999 sent the price of crude oil from its 12-year low of
$10.72 a barrel in December 1998 to a high of $32.72 on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Oil's surge has led to higher gasoline prices, and the Saudi
pledge is unlikely to bring rapid relief. The price of unleaded
gasoline futures for August fell 4.74 cents a gallon, or 4.5
percent, to 99.605 cents in trading Wednesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. But analysts considered it too soon to declare
a shift. One analyst even suggested that drivers might respond to
falling prices by deciding to take trips they had postponed, adding
to demand. ``If anything, it could have a reverse effect and lead
to higher gasoline prices,'' said Gary N. Ross, chief executive
office of PIRA Energy Group, an international energy consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Given the attention to the $30 threshold, it was notable that
crude did not fall below that level. On the first day of trading
since the Saudi announcement, the price of oil for August delivery
on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped $1.83, or 5.6 percent,
to $30.67. After the close of futures trading on Wednesday, the
American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil inventories
for the week ended June 30 fell 136,000 barrels, to 293 million
barrels, down 34.3 million barrels from the comparable period a
year ago. Gasoline inventories rose by 2.21 million barrels to
207.7 million barrels, down 7 million barrels from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch, said
the Saudi statement was ``something aimed at just capping the
rally.'' The pledge did not mean the Saudis would immediately begin
pumping 500,000 more barrels of oil a day, which is less than 2
percent of OPEC production.
</P>
<P>
   Irene King, senior oil markets analyst at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.,
said that ``the next few days are critical'' for determining OPEC
production.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possibilities she described was an OPEC-approved
increase of 500,000 barrels a day, apportioned to all the
producers. But because only Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates have excess capacity, the actual increase would be
closer to 250,000 barrels a day, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Or OPEC could approve an increase of 500,000 barrels a day by
allowing countries with excess capacity to pump that much more. Or
Saudi Arabia could produce 500,000 more barrels a day, and the UAE
and Kuwait could add 250,000 barrels a day. ``In the end, it is up
to Saudi Arabia,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If the increase reaches 750,000 barrels a day, she predicted
that crude would fall below $30. ``We don't collapse,'' she said,
``but it will need a special event to go over $30 again.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason that analysts expect some production increase is
because of what has been called a gentlemen's agreement reached by
OPEC members at their last meeting in June. At that meeting, the
group announced it would increase daily production by 708,000
barrels, or just under 3 percent, to 25.4 million barrels. The pact
excludes Iraq, which is still producing under U.N. sanctions.
Because the increase was smaller than the million barrels that had
been expected, the price of oil actually rose on news of the
increased supply.
</P>
<P>
   Under a separate gentlemen's agreement, which was not announced
but has been described to oil traders and analysts, OPEC would
consider increasing production if the price of OPEC's basket of
seven different crude oils remained above $28 for 20 days. Analysts
said the big surprise was that the Saudis proposed an increase
before the price had been that high for that long. The gentlemen's
agreement also calls for production to be cut if the basket price
falls below $22 for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, according to some analysts, is uncomfortable with
oil prices being an issue in the U.S. presidential election. For
that reason, a production increase has been expected as political
pressure in the United States has increased.

   VITRE, France - Lance Armstrong, the defending Tour de France
champion, is missing his 9-month-old son, Luke. Armstrong's wife,
Kristin, and Luke journeyed to Saturday's prologue. Mother and
child will be back Monday for the start of the Tour's mountain
stages. The family lives in the south of France in the spring and
summer and in Austin in the fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Armstrong wanted to be kept abreast of his favorite
college football team, the Texas Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said UT Coach Mack Brown, the ace recruiter, already
has offered Luke Armstrong a football scholarship. It also helps
that until Armstrong sold his house in April, the Browns were their
neighbors in West Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mack put all these crazy requirements on the scholarship,''
Armstrong said. ``He said he had to be 6-9, 275 pounds and run a
4.2 40. But he'll be a Longhorn.''
</P>
<P>
   French in yellow
</P>
<P>
   The rabid French cycling fans finally have a reason to get even
more into the Tour, now that country favorite Laurent Jalabert is
wearing the yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   With Armstrong dominating last year's Tour, no French rider
claimed yellow. Before Jalabert donned the yellow Tuesday
afternoon, the last Frenchmen to do so was Laurent Desbiens two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In all, French riders owned the yellow jersey 12 times in the
1990s, with Jalabert claiming ownership of it for part of the 1995
Tour. Frenchmen Cedric Vasseur, a member of the U.S. Postal Service
team, wore it in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Travelogue
</P>
<P>
   The riders Wednesday got a treat when they passed a looming
castle near the finish line in Vitre. The oldest cities in Brittany
have these type of fortresses that have weathered the years quite
well. This one was started in the 10th century and completed in
1315. Another nearby castle is the Chateau des Rochers-Swigne,
which was the part-time home of French writer Marquise de Sevigne.

SPRINT EXECUTIVES PONDER SELLING STOCK OPTION AND LEAVING  
 (WITH SPRINT-WORLDCOM)
</HEADLINE>
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the merger between Sprint and WorldCom all but
called off, the question is whether Sprint executives are going to
stay and, if so, for how long.
</P>
<P>
   When Sprint shareholders approved the $115 billion deal in
April, the merger agreement specified that most of Sprint's stock
options outstanding _ including those given for shares in the
common stock and the wireless operations _ would become fully
vested and exercisable. What does that mean? It means that Sprint
executives who were given stock options as an incentive to stay can
cash them in and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Already Sprint has seen some high-level executives depart. In
May, Kevin Brauer, who was president of Sprint's National
Integrated Services division, left after 17 years. Two weeks ago,
Sprint said that Andrew Sukawaty, the former president of the
Sprint PCS Group, would leave the company to join Callahan
Associates International, a firm that invests in communications and
entertainment ventures. And more defections are rumored.
</P>
<P>
   Typically at Sprint, said an executive there, options vest over
four years. But with Sprint's future now uncertain, competitors
view this as an opportunity to swoop in and lure away key talent,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly you always want to give people not only an incentive
for staying, but for staying enthusiastically,'' said Richard
Klugman, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``When people become vested it becomes that much tougher
because they can see the pot of gold.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Sprint wanted to ensure that their top team did not
bolt. Integrating two different cultures during a merger can be
tricky. So, some top ranking executives, including William T.
Esrey, Sprint's chief executive, signed agreements to defer
exercising shares early in exchange for Sprint offering them even
more options, said E.J. Holland, Sprint's vice president of
compensation benefits and labor relations. In his case, Esrey was
given an additional option on 216,000 shares of Sprint common stock
and 216,000 shares of the cellular operations, according to merger
documents.
</P>
<P>
   But if the deal between Sprint and WorldCom falls apart, those
options are also fully vested and exercisable, Holland confirmed.
As a result, their effectiveness becomes moot, analysts said. But
Holland warned that getting options is not a bonanza. For example,
the exercise price of $61.94 for the deferred options is higher
than Sprint's current stock price of $53.50. For most executives
granted options in 1997, 1998 and 1999 that is not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum to clients, the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen
&AMP; Katz suggested that corporate executives review rules on their
stock option plans. While it may be appropriate for some
corporations to vest options early, wrote a lawyer at the firm,
Michael S. Katzke, ``for many situations where there are
significant regulatory or other issues that may delay closing, such
provisions may not be suitable.'' Further, he added, ``the Sprint
situation highlights the need for careful scrutiny.''

   ATLANTA _ At this time last year, Andres Galarraga was just
completing chemotherapy treatments for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's an All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   The first baseman will be one of five Atlanta Braves on the
National League team for the 71st All-Star Game on Tuesday at
Turner Field. Also picked Wednesday by manager Bobby Cox were
pitchers Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine and outfielder Andruw Jones.
Chipper Jones was voted onto the team by the fans as the starting
third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   No other NL team has more than three representatives. The most
Braves ever on an All-Star team was seven in 1997. Last year,
pitcher Kevin Millwood and outfielder Brian Jordan were the only
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Because the game will be at Turner Field, being picked was
special to all of the Braves' players on the All-Star roster. But
making this All-Star Game was almost beyond Galarraga's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come back from cancer and make the team is really
special,'' Galarraga said. ``It's a comeback story. If I can do it,
a lot of people can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the fifth All-Star Game for Galarraga, 39. Cox named
a second backup to Mark McGwire at first base. Colorado's Todd
Helton, the National League's leading hitter, also made the team.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux made the All-Star Game for the eighth time and Glavine
for the seventh. Maddux has started three times, without a
decision. Glavine started and lost the 1992 All-Star Game in San
Diego, where he was knocked out in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time is the most special,'' Maddux said about the
All-Star Game. ``But it's like trying to decide which Christmas is
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones will make his third All-Star start and fourth
appearance. ``To be starting in an All-Star game here in my home
park before the hometown fans, it doesn't get any better than
that,'' Jones said. ``It's probably the one year I wouldn't have
minded having the three days off, to get acquainted with my new
son, but I'll gladly trade a day.''
</P>
<P>
   For Andruw Jones, it will be the first of what should be many
All-Star Games. ``I think he's the best center fielder in
baseball,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   The only other time the All-Star Game was in Atlanta, in 1972,
Hank Aaron was the Braves' sole representative. Aaron homered, and
the National League won 4-3 in 10 innings, with Joe Morgan driving
in the winning run.

COLUMBUS CENTER: THE CONTEXT ISN'T LIMITED TO THE VISIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ The new design for Columbus Center raises an important
issue for the future of the New York skyline. What is consensus? Is
consensus essential for good architecture or does architecture do
best without it? Who should speak for the public if not the
architect, who is hired for his professional and artistic capacity
to interpret a time and place?
</P>
<P>
   Columbus Center's architect is David Childs, of the New York
office of Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, a firm that has long
represented the center of gravity in American architecture. Childs'
new design differs substantially from one prepared by him for the
same site 12 years ago. There is more than one way to interpret
this difference: public opinion could be changing; Childs could be
changing his aesthetic; or the difference could mean less than
meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 design was a more or less literal homage to Irwin
Chanin, architect of the Century and the Majestic apartment
buildings on Central Park West. From these twin-towered Art Deco
landmarks, Childs adapted horizontal fins, cubical geometry,
masonry walls, symmetrical massing and other identifiable Deco
motifs, but enlarged them in a composition three times the scale.
</P>
<P>
   In the new version, the Deco references are largely confined to
the crowns of the two towers: three-story, illuminated lanterns
trimmed with rows of vertical steel blades. At the base, a broken
colonnade of stone veneer also weighs down the design. In general,
however, the new plan advances the concept of abstracted classicism
that informed Chanin's design. Period details have given way to
crisp geometric solids. The towers have been tweaked into
trapezoids. Pearlescent glass has replaced unconvincing cast stone.
Setbacks are composed in an assymmetrical, crystalline silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   I find the new version vastly superior, judged not by some
abstract set of values, but by the terms that the 1988 version set
forth. Fidelity to history, sensitivity to context: this is roughly
how those terms can be summarized. The old version expressed them
by mimicking the Century, the Majestic and other twin-towered
apartment buildings along Central Park West. The new design gets
closer to the ideas beneath their skins. The trapezoidal shape of
the towers is more contextual. Instead of simply reproducing the
external appearance of buildings located some blocks away, the
building now extrudes the geometry of its location into three
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Childs intended to take the concept of geometric abstraction
even further and prepared a set of models, drawings and computer
renderings to that end. He was overruled in November by Joseph B.
Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission, who had
convened a small advisory group to review the design. In what has
to be regarded as a preview of the design review panel Rose has
proposed to set up under his management, Childs was subjected to a
costly procedure that ended only when he threatened to take his
name off the project. Eventually, much of his design was restored.
The Deco hats, alas, remain.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the revisions supervised by Rose were intended to
make the design acceptable to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. He is
considered a traditionalist, and it could be that his brand of
traditionalism is shared by most New Yorkers. But what about those
of us who believe that tradition goes deeper than period motif?
</P>
<P>
   Context is a matter of time as well as place, and history deals
with the present as well as the past. In the 1980s, postmodern
architecture was making its mark on the skyline. The AT&AMP;T
headquarters, designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, was
completed in 1983. A movement that had begun two decades earlier
with the work of Robert Venturi entered the phase of large-scale
commercial building. Childs' 1988 design was thus a polemical
statement. It announced that architects would no longer respect the
modernist taboo against the use of period styles. It also stated
that corporate clients were eager to support this determination.
</P>
<P>
   The polemic argued for the value of popular appeal. The public,
it was said, was tired of tall glass boxes. It was tired of seeing
familiar streetscapes blown away to make room for them. Modern
architecture, it was said, had been unconscionably indifferent to
popular taste. Postmodern architecture offered to redress these
grievances. It would accommodate the public's desire for the
familiar and restore the traditions that prevailed before the tall
glass boxes came stalking into town. This was the context in which
the 1988 design materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, however, the context began to change. Many New
Yorkers woke up to the fact that the level of the city's
architecture had declined catastrophically in the last 30 years.
They saw for themselves that modern architecture cannot be reduced
to tall glass boxes and bleak housing projects. It also includes
work by Wright, van der Rohe, Saarinen, Roche, Bunshaft, Harrison
and others that established New York as the world's most
architecturally progressive city. With reason, they began to
suspect a correlation between the lack of comparable work today and
the postmodern hokum about tradition, context and popular appeal.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, for example, that the public likes to be wowed.
This is what some people have taken to calling the Bilbao effect,
after the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, designed by Frank
Gehry. People enjoy the unfamiliar as much in architecture as they
do in movies, painting, music, photography, literature and other
art forms. Consensus be damned before the fact. Let the applause
come later. Or let the brickbats fly, if you prefer.
</P>
<P>
   The new design for Columbus Center is not Bilbao, needless to
say. I doubt even Frank Gehry would want to wrap Columbus Circle in
titanium ribbons. But Bilbao is part of the context in which the
new design has taken shape. So are the LVMH Tower, the Rose Space
Center and the Austrian Cultural Institute now nearing completion
on East 52nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   These three buildings, strikingly different in appearance, share
some common features. They are glass. The transparency makes the
floors as prominent as the walls. They are formally abstract. They
enrich their immediate surroundings by playing off them. They
reveal urban relationships that had not yet been articulated. They
embody what Eliot meant when he said that historical awareness
depends on knowing not just the presence but also the pastness of
the past.
</P>
<P>
   We should conclude from this that postmodern architects stated
good goals for architecture but were unable to achieve them.
Without those Deco hats, Columbus Center would attain its
ambitions, too. Even in its compromised state, the new design moves
toward a deeper grasp of history. And it will remain a useful focus
for the public debate through which history unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Debate would be welcome now over the metal and glass screen that
will veil the Jazz at Lincoln Center complex to be located in the
upper floors of Columbus Center's arc-shaped base. Designed by the
artist Jamie Carpenter, the screen would diminish the public
presence of the complex _ the most civic-spirited of Columbus
Center's six tenants. It would also flatten the extension of the
axis from Central Park South. As Joyce Purnick observed in her
Metro Matters column in The New York Times a few weeks ago,
Columbus Center offers an opportunity to create the effect of
opening up 59th Street. Eliminating the screen would enhance that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   This is apparently an issue on which Childs and Rafael Vinoly,
the jazz complex's architect, have not seen eye to eye. Others have
seen racial implications in the screening of a space dedicated to
this prototypical African-American art form behind a reflective
facade. This is not, in any case, an issue that ought to be
resolved by the intervention of so-called public art like
Carpenter's. Must we have yet another case in which public art
provides a fig leaf to cover failures of the social and
architectural imaginations? Debate on the value of public art is
also long overdue.

NEW YORK: long overdue.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the lack of that debate _ the fear of conflict _ that has
been so crippling for New York architecture. There was far more
contention when architecture was going up in the postwar decades
and the lines weren't drawn between high-brow and popular taste.
Some smart people hated the Guggenheim. Some uncultivated people
loved it. Ditto the TWA Pavilion, the U.N. headquarters and Lever
House. There wasn't this horror of being disliked, this philistine
appeal to the public's fear of change. The consensus that
architecture enjoyed in the 1950s and '60s was this: it was healthy
for people to disagree about it. The real cause for worry arrived
when ideas got drowned out by the baby chatter of postmodern public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of consensus is turning out to be far more complex
than the postmodernists ever imagined. It has shifted the terms of
architecture from the objective to the subjective realm. The
consequences have barely begun to make themselves felt. Its rupture
with historical precedent is scarcely appreciated. Authority in
architecture has now passed in part from its traditional external
sources _ religion, social hierarchy, history or technology _
toward the psychological landscape where moods, tastes, memories
and atmospheres are formed.
</P>
<P>
   We're long accustomed to locating literature, music, painting
and movies in this interior realm. Even architecture is not a
stranger to it. Domestic architecture _ Frank Lloyd Wright, Arts
and Crafts, the Aesthetic Movement _ took up residence there in the
late 19th century. Venturi placed civic buildings there, even if
his postmodern followers couldn't figure out how he did it. But
until we get our architecture through neural implants, the outer
world will not abandon its claims on this public art form.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the implants, neural architecture has entered into
the way buildings are perceived. This was the idea explored by Tod
Williams and Billie Tsien in their design for the Neurosciences
Institute in La Jolla, Calif., completed in 1995. Built for the
neuroscientist Gerald Edelman, the institute was partly inspired by
Edelman's theory that the brain's architecture is shaped by our
experiences. Tell me what you like, and I will tell you how you're
wired. One neural structure does not fit all. We do not attach the
same meanings, values and associations to the same images and
shapes. It's not hard wiring we're talking about. Art can recombine
the circuits.
</P>
<P>
   The new design for Columbus Center will bring more than a
physical change in the cityscape, in other words. It signifies a
restructuring of perception. Context includes the psyche. It is not
limited to what's ``out there.'' This porosity of the line between
subjective and objective is the beauty part of architecture today.
Interiority has got hold of an art form long governed by externals.
What we call consensus amounts to a continual testing of the
interior and its claims. &QR;

A SHOWCASE COMES INTO ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ T.S. Eliot was right when he said that art does not
improve. (Is Rembrandt worse than Picasso?) But artists, including
choreographers, can develop _ as New York City Ballet's Diamond
Project confirmed recently.
</P>
<P>
   Learn by doing: that is the premise of the project, named after
its principal donor, Irene Diamond. Peter Martins, City Ballet's
artistic director, initiated this showcase for new choreography in
1992, repeated it in 1994 and 1997 and hit pay dirt with this
spring's series.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the eight choreographers responsible for the nine
premieres had participated in the Diamond Project in the past and
the repeated opportunities proved justified. Christopher Wheeldon,
still a relative novice in 1997, now looked like a young master.
</P>
<P>
   The level of accomplishment was also matched by the seriousness
of musical choices: Shostakovich, Beethoven, Mozart, Bartok,
balanced by a star of contemporary music, John Adams, and
classically trained crossover composers (Edgar Meyer, Mark
O'Connor, John King). This is not the range of music you will hear
in other ballet companies.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest entries came from Martins, Helgi Tomasson and
Wheeldon. One might ask why the second-tier works are worth doing.
The fact is that City Ballet rarely restages works from other
companies. Even George Balanchine encouraged new works, however
bad, from his disciples. At the least, fresh choreography is a
novelty for dancers and audiences, although the choreographers
conduct their education in public _ for better or for worse.
</P>
<P>
   This year was for the better. Just when it seemed time to
suggest once more that the choreographers could widen their vision
by moving away from a strictly plotless genre, the pure-dance
ballet justified itself again.
</P>
<P>
   Plotless does not mean an absence of emotion. Tomasson's
``Prism'' has the same formalist elements as its score, Beethoven's
First Piano Concerto. Yet for all its nod to Balanchine's
neo-classicism, its underlying verve, especially in the male
dances, is distinctly felt. It is a big ballet, opening with
swiftly paced contrasting trios amid the ensemble. The slow second
section is visualized in the quiet eddies of a duet for Maria
Kowroski and Charles Askegard, eerily backed up by seven couples in
the shadows. The exuberant third movement opens with a bravura
solo, danced by Benjamin Millepied with effective if free-form
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like to see the steps of the academic idiom
recombined in novel ways, then the Diamond Project and the City
Ballet are not for you. Even in Martins' ``Todo Buenos Aires'' (to
music by Astor Piazzolla, arranged by Adams), a tango is absorbed
into the classical vocabulary. Wendy Whelan's fierce toe work went
smoothly along with the tango's leg flicks; Albert Evans and Philip
Neal vied for her affections. In a second trio, Nikolaj Hubbe and
Robert Tewsley had the right snap as two posturing macho characters
in joint possession of Darci Kistler, the local coquette. Another
dancer, Damian Woetzel, was similarly in his element as the
airborne leader of a second Martins-Adams piece, ``Slonimsky's
Earbox.'' It sent brightly clad dancers scattering across the stage
like colored marbles.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking ballet was Martins' ``Harmonielehre,''
inspired by Adams' sly tribute to Arnold Schoenberg and his
treatise on musical harmony. Adam's liner notes served as a subtext
for both the choreography and Alain Vaes' decor, depicting earth
and sky. The first section's energetic circling was part of the
creation-of-the-world aura, firmly rooted in the classical
technique used overtly in a lyrical duet for Janie Taylor and Jared
Angle. In contrast to the initial ebullience, an entangled trio for
Kistler, Jock Soto and Askegard symbolized a fall from grace.
</P>
<P>
   A childlike view of heaven, with clouds of blue chiffon
suspended above a female ensemble in the same chiffon, ushered in a
startling passage. James Fayette arrived with Ashlee Knapp, a
14-year-old student from the School of American Ballet, on his
shoulder ( Adams had dreamed that his young daughter was carried by
Meister Eckhardt, a medieval mystic). The purity of the image,
extended into off-balance contours, was magnificently rendered by
the two dancers. With its celebratory finale and a hint of
salvation, the ballet became a treatise on harmony in the widest
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeldon gave energy a geometric edge in tune with
Shostakovich's First Piano Concerto. He avoided regimentation, but
his dazzling and shifting ensembles had the epigrammatic wit of a
jubilant parade. ``Mercurial Manoeuvres'' was the right title.
</P>
<P>
   Robert La Fosse and Robert Garland choreographed ``Tributary,''
a pretty and charming Mozart ballet. It was a piece d'occasion,
honoring Arthur Mitchell, the City Ballet star who founded and now
directs Dance Theater of Harlem. Dancers in both companies were
ingeniously mixed in the ensemble, with Kyra Nichols as the
gracious ballerina.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher d'Amboise's masterful deployment of dancers in
``Triptych'' and his use of odd shapes (arms in jarlike formation)
were tantalizing. Set to Bartok, his ballet impressed itself
strongly on the eye, but did not leave an equally strong
after-image. O'Day found less support in King's jagged score for
``Swerve Poems,'' which had some cheeky dancing and too many non
sequiturs. Miriam Mahdaviani was happier in her inspiration for
``Appalachia Waltz.'' She matched Meyer and O'Connor in their gloss
on American folk music. Her ruling conceit was a square dance for
classical dancers. It had its fine moments, like the Diamond
Project as a whole. &QL;

Agassi's ever-changing arsenal delivers big blow
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Andre Agassi's clever and methodical
dissection of Mark Philippoussis in the Wimbledon quarterfinals on
Wednesday was comforting to anybody who believes grass-court tennis
can resemble real tennis, that it isn't doomed to become the
exclusive domain of hulking Neanderthals whose only ``skill'' is to
bludgeon their opponents into meek submission.
</P>
<P>
   Branding Philippoussis, 23, a strictly one-dimensional brute may
be a tad unfair, because his all-around game has developed a
measure of maturity and finesse, particularly from the baseline.
Nonetheless, it's not for nothing that we still refer to the
hulking 6-4 Australian, whose second serve rarely dips under 120
mph, as ``Scud.''
</P>
<P>
   But when confronted with the subtle genius that Agassi, in his
latest incarnation as his sport's thinking man's superstar,
delivers when he's of a mind to, even this consummate rocket
launcher becomes just another dud on Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   It's a relief to report that all the raw power in the world
can't trump a player with Andre's varied weapons and strategies.
While brawn will forever remain a necessary ingredient here in an
age of titanium rackets and pumping iron, brainpower isn't yet
obsolete. Agassi, the erstwhile punk-turned-semi-hunk himself, used
his frontal lobe, not his pecs, to torpedo Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   The latter hammered 10 aces in the first set, the former one.
But that one came at set point.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis smacked nine more in the second set. But Agassi's
second ace gave him another set point. And Andre's last of seven
aces (his opponent would futilely hammer 22, giving him 154 in the
tournament) provided triple match point.
</P>
<P>
   It was Agassi, whose hardest first serves rarely equaled the
velocity of Philippoussis' weakest second ones, who never suffered
a break. To say it succinctly, the counterpuncher gave no quarter
to the puncher. In this cat-and-mouse game, the mouse ate the cat.
</P>
<P>
   Ironic how the one-time flaky, image-is-everything brat has
reshaped himself into an artist, sans all trappings of pretension
and fluff. Agassi used to change his hair color weekly. Now, he
shaves his head. He once swore he'd never feel comfortable at
Wimbledon because of the all-white dress code. Now, it's hard to
picture him in anything except white, so pure of purpose is his
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Shields, a child of Hollywood, was formerly on his arm.
Now, his best girl and perhaps next wife is Steffi Graf, the finest
female player in tennis history.
</P>
<P>
   It all fits together, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Early on a gloomy afternoon, Agassi was boldly taking
Philippoussis' howitzer serve a step inside the baseline. But after
his screaming forehand return forced a mini-break for a 5-3 lead in
the first-set tiebreaker, Andre suddenly retreated 10 feet behind
the baseline on a second serve, which he returned hard and low to
Philippoussis' backhand, producing an errant volley and double set
point. On the second, he got that first ace.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis ripped three aces in a row for 3-all in the second
set. But Andre, unblinking, held easily himself, then immediately
took the first point of the next game, setting himself up for the
kill with a screaming return at Philippoussis' ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Although an ace followed, so did a pair of double faults, and
Agassi secured the only break he needed to take a two-set lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get distracted by people acing me,'' Agassi explained.
``I just try to make sure I do well with the opportunities I will
get, knowing they will eventually come _ that's assuming I take
care of my own serve. There's a lot going out there that helps you
get around one guy's particular weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in the third game of the third set that Andre fully
snuffed out the Aussie's spirit. Again, deftly picking his spot, he
took a 122-mph second serve on the rise and, moving forward,
creamed the return for a clean winner. The break ensued, and that
was that, 7-6, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew exactly what was going to happen today,'' Philippoussis
said. ``I was ready. But Andre is such a great front-runner. When
he's got confidence, it's going to be tough to come back. And
everybody knows he's the best returner in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The best overall player, too, when everything is clicking.
Wednesday, everything was. The process was fascinating to observe.
Reassuring, too, because it was tennis, not mindless bashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt I was missing anything,'' Agassi said of his
spotty record since winning the Australian Open for a sixth Grand
Slam title. ``I said all along, if I can get through the first
week, I can start bringing out different parts of my game on this
court. I just needed to go out there and win some matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Five down, two to go. Despite Patrick Rafter and presumably Pete
Sampras looming, you must love Andre's chances. Amazingly, he knows
how to make grass the great equalizer.

   ``It's fun to play on,'' he admitted, smiling. ``It gives my
serve a little something extra.''

SISTERS SLEDGEHAMMER DOUBLE TROUBLE FOR NAVRATILOVA, DE   SWARDT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON _ Can't get enough of Venus and Serena.
</P>
<P>
   Doubling the pleasure, their hit show moved off-Broadway
Wednesday for a matinee in a Wimbledon closet called Court 2, while
Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi took over the palacial stage, Centre
Court. But a crowd followed. That will happen wherever, whenever
Venus and Serena perform for the rest of their tennis lives.
Crammed into the small grandstands on three sides were 2,990
patrons, 770 of them in the standing-room pen atop the west
rampart, delighted in gawking at Venus and Serena side by side.
Allies, not adversaries as today.
</P>
<P>
   Not that everybody showed up to watch the hottest sister act in
England since Queen Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots were at one
another's throats in the 16th century, perhaps models for Venus and
Serena this afternoon. The survivor gets to do an encore in the big
room for the title Saturday, probably against her highest highness,
6-foot-3-inch Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wednesday these two phenoms acted as close and tight
as, well, sisters because they were a team, a doubles combo looking
to make a little more history as collaborators rather than
combatants. No sisterly syndicate has won the Wimbledon doubles,
but they are two wins away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing for the first time, and we want to get that
title,'' says Serena. ``Only one Williams can win the singles, but
we both can win this.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was another queen in the house: Martina, Empress
Emeritus of Grassblades. Her faithful were cheering, too, as
bespectacled ``Granny'' (so-called by colleagues when she pretty
much retired in 1994) strode in, accompanied by 29-year-old South
African Mariaan de Swardt.
</P>
<P>
   When Martina Navratilova was running the joint, neither Venus
nor Serena was. Venus Williams hit the earth, presumably sprinting,
in 1980. By then Martina had won two of her record nine Wimbledon
singles titles. Serena Williams arrived in 1981, the year Martina
notched a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw her win her ninth title in 1990. On tape,'' says
Serena. ``Martina was my favorite player.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice. But the Williams kids did not drop by as an admiration
society. They were instead a farewell committee, 4-6, 6-2, 6-1.
Despite being raised to respect their elders, 43-year-old Martina,
exceeding their combined ages by 5, did not qualify for social or
any other kind of security with Venus and Serena on the prowl.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Martina seemed a specter beneath the coal dust sky,
maybe on loan from Madame Tussaud's wax museum, she was not acting
her age. Especially in the first set. After all, this was a
quarterfinal of an event she had won seven times. One more title
and she'd tie Billie Jean King's Wimbledon record of 20 overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came out playing better than what we ever expected,'' says
Venus. ``Her hands were quick as ever, probably quicker than Serena
and I. Our power didn't seem to get to her.''
</P>
<P>
   For a half-hour it was time-warp time. Bygone generations _
Navratilova from a distant day and de Swardt somewhat more recent _
were roughing up the Sisters Sledgehammer. Nobody ever worked a
doubles rectangle better than Navratilova. De Swardt was a worthy
accomplice, having won the recent French mixed with compatriot
David Adams.
</P>
<P>
   They made Venus and Serena pay attention all the way. ``It was a
blast, really great fun,'' says Martina. She also caught two
overhead blasts _ one from each sister _ on the body that will be
momentary black-and-blue mementos of her last (if it was) of 25
Wimbledons.
</P>
<P>
   While that was going on, somebody to whom nobody was paying
attention _ 22-year-old Vladimir Voltchkov from Minsk, Belarus _
was making believe he had the lead in his favorite movie,
``Gladiator.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the closet courts, he says, ``For first time I was in big
arena, like a gladiator.'' Voltchkov beat Byron Black on Court 1,
7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-2), 6-4, to become only the second male qualifier
ever to crash the semifinals. The other was John McEnroe 23 years
ago. ``I can't believe this dream. I am so happy, so lucky to play
Pete Sampras now. I will try to bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   Voltchkov is the odd man in: ranked a lowly No. 273 he is the
longest of hotshots-for-a-fortnight to get this far, alongside
Sampras, Agassi, and Patrick Rafter. Almost broke when he arrived,
he's an appreciative, congenial grab bag guy who should be
sponsored by the Salvation Army. He borrowed voluminous shorts from
huge Marat Safin, is wearing a variety of labels courtesy of
whoever took pity, and couldn't afford restaurants until this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is cooking for both of us in a flat a friend let us
use. Four times while I'm here I saw `Gladiator.' It inspired me.
I've been playing challenger tournaments (the minor leagues), and
that's real pressure. Everybody trying to get up here. But when I
qualified, I relaxed and had fun.'' And made Minsk-meat of eight
foes, giving them the gladitorial thumbs-down.
</P>
<P>
   His daddy won't be cooking humble pie for a while. Vladimir has
earned $193,000 in prize money, about $13,000 more than his total
for four previous years as a pro.
</P>
<P>
   Today the smile of Vladimir Voltchkov, who has spent his life
off-Broadway, is bigger than Venus's serve, Martina's trophy
collection, and Centre Court.

FINDING A CALLING IN FLAMENCO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Mass., Va., Spain)   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Day and night, the plaintive sound of flamenco
echoes in the narrow streets of Lavapies, the Gypsy quarter of
Madrid. Behind heavy wood doors and in smoky bars, the flamencos,
as the Spanish call those who revel in the ancient Andalusian music
and dance, prepare for performances or simply indulge in their art
form. In a sense, this is their district, a working-class
neighborhood where students of flamenco from all over the world
have long come to learn from the masters.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Santangelo, 38, a born and bred New Yorker, became one of
them when he arrived here in 1987 to study flamenco. But he went
further than most. In 1993, he established Noche Flamenca, his own
company, and married the dancer Soledad Barrio, who became its star
attraction. Blossoming, the troupe has gone on to win avid fans in
Japan and Egypt and in cities all over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're brilliant,'' says George C. Wolfe, the artistic
director of the Joseph Papp Public Theater, who presented the
company at his theater twice last year. ``Soledad is a
once-in-a-lifetime performer who combines overwhelming physicality
and spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Santangelo and Barrio have a 5-year-old daughter,
Gabriela, she travels with them, often appearing onstage at the end
of performances. Before anything else, the troupe is a family.
</P>
<P>
   Late in May, in the same studios in Lavapies where he first
studied flamenco, Santangelo rehearsed his six dancers and five
musicians in preparation for their American tour, which began with
three weeks in California and continues at the 180-seat Cornelia
Connelly Theater in New York City from Wednesday through Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The company will present three new works by Santangelo, ``A
Nuestro Son,'' ``La Plaza'' and a joyful alegrias, plus a full
complement of classic flamenco. After the New York engagement, it
will be at Wolf Trap in Vienna, Va., Jacob's Pillow in Becket,
Mass. and the Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, Ill. until the end
of August.
</P>
<P>
   From the time it developed in southern Spain in the 15th
century, flamenco has cast its spell on foreigners with its
celebration of nature, the emotions and the erotic. Santangelo was
not immune. ``Oddly enough,'' he says, ``I grew up with flamenco.
Flamenco artists regularly stayed with my family in Greenwich
Village.'' They went to visit his Argentine mother, Luly
Santangelo, a dancer with Alwin Nikolais who now produces Noche
Flamenca, and his father, Ed Goldin, a sculptor and scientist.
</P>
<P>
   After studying acting at New York University, Santangelo moved
to San Francisco to join the theater group El Teatro Campesino. One
night, an actor scheduled to dance flamenco failed to show.
Santangelo filled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that's all I really wanted to do,'' he says. He set
off for Madrid and a rigorous apprenticeship. If he hadn't suffered
a severe back injury in 1996 while performing in Julie Taymor's
``Juan Darien'' at Lincoln Center, he'd still be dancing. ``My
theatrical experience makes me a better director,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There's no air conditioning in the windowless studio where Noche
Flamenca rehearses this hot afternoon, but no one expects bright,
modern dance studios in Madrid. Lighted by a dull fluorescent
ceiling lamp, the one large room is quite sufficient. Flamenco
comes across best in intimate situations. Above the wall-length
mirror someone has hung two big black and red fans so that they
frame a reproduction of ``Las Meninas,'' Velazquez's painting
depicting the court of Philip IV. Near the changing area, set off
by a pink flowered curtain, a small photo display shows pictures of
famous flamenco dancers _ the most dashing, Joaquin Cortes, early
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   In these photographs, Cortes bears little resemblance to his
picture on the posters, currently plastered on street corners all
over town, hyping his show ``Soul'' at the Coliseum Theater. The
posters show him glowering, his long hair in disarray and
ostentatiously sexy; he looks like a cross between Michael Jackson
and Antonio Banderas. Cortes, now 30, transforms the flamenco
artist into a pop star. His style, called ``flamenco fusion,''
often incorporates rock music, strobe lights, pounding percussion
and contemporary dance styles. Nothing could be further from
Santangelo's aesthetic. ``We don't use tricks,'' he says. ``You can
borrow elements from other artistic languages, but you shouldn't
try to speak in those languages.''
</P>
<P>
   Still a lithe dancer, Santangelo, his Yankees cap askew, starts
rehearsal by clapping his hands in a fast rhythm picked up by the
dancers Eva Martin and Alejandra Ramirez. Barrio, dressed in a
plain navy blue sweatshirt and long black shirt, sits absolutely
still in a folding chair in the center of the studio, ready for the
dramatic dance of loneliness called ``Solea.'' The percussionist
Jose Antonio Galicia beats softly on the cajon, a wooden box with
the range of a complete drum set.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, the two guitarists, Arcadio Marin and Jose Valle
``Chuscales'' join in. Tension builds slowly, erupting only when
the singer, Silverio Heredia, gray-haired and bearded, suddenly
lets out a long anguished cry. Barrio rises like a flame, summoned
to her feet by his words.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia sings of the mysterious nature of love _ its glorious,
unexpected arrival and devastating, unexpected departure. Like an
animal preparing to fight, she draws up her small compact torso
while coiling and uncoiling her hands sinuously at her sides. Then,
as if struck by lightning, she stamps her feet once, twice, three
times before surging into a wild frenzy of movement, her skirt
twirling around her hips, her hair whipping across her tormented
face. The strumming accelerates; the singer's voice grows husky,
until, as suddenly as she began, Barrio stops and gazes steadily
outward.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians put down their instruments. ``That's good,''
Santangelo reassures Barrio, who looks displeased. Unconvinced, she
returns to her original position. They take it again from the
beginning. For months, every day, for more than eight hours, he
rehearses his company before it goes on tour, which usually means
out of the country. Today, flamenco companies do much better abroad
than at home. ``Spain is notorious for underrating its own artists
until they make a name somewhere else,'' Santangelo says.
</P>
<P>
   To him, this is just another fact of life. ``Good flamenco
survives,'' he says. ``Its heritage is boundless. When I want
something new, I go back. Recently I discovered some beautiful
medieval songs. Everyone thought they were new compositions. Others
dream of Broadway; I'd like to do an even smaller show, something
more austere.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to watch Barrio, he says, ``Flamenco doesn't need extras
to blow your mind.''

CHECKING OUT OTHER SHOPPERS IS FAIR GAME, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATELLA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, I was looking through a camera lens at a glass-topped
coffee table sitting in a Houston store called Gallery Furniture.
The table did not interest me.
</P>
<P>
   But then, a few seconds later, I saw a couple stop in the aisle
near the table. He wore a baseball cap. She had blond hair. I
trained the camera on their faces. As they leaned down to examine
the price tag, I wondered if they had noticed something about the
curvy-legged piece that I had overlooked. I zoomed in to read over
their shoulders: ``Red Hot Value.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they moved on. So did I.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest twist on how the Internet is shrinking the zone of
anonymity, a growing number of retailers, including the toy seller
FAO Schwarz and the Canal Jean Co. in Manhattan, have installed
cameras to beam images from their stores over the Internet. The
idea behind these Webcams is that shoppers will use the cameras to
examine merchandise, not other customers. The result, depending on
how you look at it, is either a new level of consumer empowerment
or an appalling intrusion on people's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The company that created the system, Perceptual Robotics in
Evanston, Ill., has considered both sides of the question. ``It is
an interesting debate,'' said Paul Cooper, the company's chief
executive. ``But ultimately I think the value you create by giving
people the ability to know what's going on through their own eyes
outweighs the drawbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Perceptual Robotics has been installing Webcams since 1996 to
beam images from sporting and entertainment events over the
Internet. Last year, the company began installing cameras in stores
so real-world inventory could be displayed online. More than half a
dozen stores have set up Webcams that can be pointed at
merchandise, or whatever, by online viewers. The cameras take
snapshots, then send those photos to the viewers who asked to see
them. (Perceptual Robotics' store-based Webcams can be found on the
company's Web site at
pri7.perceptualrobotics.com/live/livecameras.jsp.).
</P>
<P>
   One of Perpetual Robotics' customers is Gallery Furniture, which
has 48 cameras throughout its 90,000-square-foot showroom to send
live images over the Internet. Gallery Furniture's owner, Jim
McIngvale, said the cameras had been a boon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the furniture business, the normal procedure is for either
the husband or wife to come in first and see something they like,
but both parties have to have a look before they decide to buy,''
said McIngvale, who earned the nickname Mattress Mac by wearing a
mattress strapped to his back during a television ad. ``Yesterday
we had a man in here who was buying a home office desk. So we had
the husband call his wife at work and tell her to go take a look at
our Internet site. She saw her husband sitting at the desk. They
bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many shoppers, I suspect, I was more intrigued by other
shoppers' preferences than in gaining insight into what I might
want to buy. But I am also the kind of person who will not order a
meal off a menu until after I have surreptitiously eyed diners at
the tables to see which entrees they have chosen. In retail, as in
restaurants, another consumer's interest adds value to any purchase
I am considering.
</P>
<P>
   When I described my reaction to Cooper, he explained that
shoppers were supposed to use the Zoom In and See From a New Angle
features at www.galleryfurniture.com to examine the tufting on the
upholstery of the leather sofas, not to see if the blonde who was
considering the coffee table had dark roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny you brought that up, though,'' Cooper said. ``We
are getting a lot of interest from retailers who want to use this
as a tool to help understand how buyers buy. We track the traffic
on these cameras and know where people are looking.''
</P>
<P>
   That assuaged my guilt. So did the knowledge that my instinct to
snoop was not unusual. ``Your reaction is a very common one,'' said
Paco Underhill, managing director of the consulting firm Envirosell
and author of ``Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 1999). ``Whether we're watching `Survivor' on TV or
catching a live glimpse of people shopping, there's a certain
voyeuristic attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   By watching shoppers' behavior over the years (very often with
hidden cameras), Underhill has discovered many interesting things:
that men are more likely than women to buy jeans after they try
them on, that a woman shopping with a man will spend less time in a
store than she would if she were alone or with a child and that
products aimed at older shoppers should not be placed on
hard-to-reach lower shelves. He has even figured out that shoppers
tend to avoid narrow aisles where they might be bumped from behind.
</P>
<P>
   I had hoped to gather similarly interesting data during the
course of several visits to www.furnituregallery.com. To watch the
action unfold, I clicked repeatedly so the images would refresh on
the screen as fast as possible. Using a cable modem, it took about
10 seconds to get each new image. ``Right now, a signal is
traveling to Houston,'' the site informed me. ``Now a video camera
is moving, and now the picture is coming to you.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The camera is capable of handling simultaneous requests from as
many as 100 Internet viewers. While the viewers are actually taking
turns as they ask the camera to turn this way or zoom in on that,
they do not realize it because the camera movements are very quick
and Internet surfers are accustomed to short delays in interacting
with a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my notes, which I scrawled in Harriet-the-Spy fashion
in a notebook on my desk: (1) the blonde definitely dyes her hair;
(2) the salesclerks like to sit behind a potted palm by the plate
glass windows and chat; (3) the older the shopper, the more likely
he or she is to sit down for a rest in a recliner before heading
out to the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other surveillance sites I visited were as useful
for spying on people, perhaps because only Gallery Furniture had a
Store Map feature that showed me exactly where each camera was
mounted. At FAO Schwarz, the cameras seemed gimmicky; I found it
difficult to identify the murky items I was viewing in the dark
``Star Wars'' boutique. (To find the Webcam, use the pull-down menu
at www.fao.com to choose Shop by Brand, then click on Star Wars
New. The Canal Jeans Webcam is new and has not yet been added to
that store's Web site, www.canaljean.com.)
</P>
<P>
   When I described my experiences to Underhill, he seemed
troubled. ``The concept of having live cameras that are accessible
to everyone may end up being an invasion of privacy issue,'' he
said. ``Someone could conceptually go online and zoom in and see
somebody necking in the store. If that picture is taken and placed
somewhere, it opens up a whole can of worms.''
</P>
<P>
   That made me wonder. What if I had witnessed a crime, just as
Jimmy Stewart did in ``Rear Window?''
</P>
<P>
   Underhill said that in fact, every once in a while, his research
team reviewed a videotape and caught somebody shoplifting. But that
is rare. More often, he said, ``it's very poignant, watching very
intimate moments in the aisle, like someone getting a hug or
scratching their nose.''
</P>
<P>
   It is legal to monitor customers with a surveillance camera.
``It would be illegal if they captured the audio portion of the
signal _ if you could hear what people were saying _ because that
would be eavesdropping,'' said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy
Rights Clearinghouse, an advocacy group in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have generally ruled that it is legal to videotape
people in places where they should not expect privacy. For example,
you could train a video camera on your neighbor's front lawn, but
not on your neighbor's bedroom window.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I appreciate it when people tell me I am being
videotaped,'' Givens said, ``like when I go into the convenience
store and see a prominent sign that says I am being videotaped for
safety. Ethically, these stores should be notifying their
customers. Otherwise, it feels like the eye of Big Brother
following these people invisibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said his company required its clients to post signs
informing their customers of the cameras. Besides, he added, ``if
you're in a 100,000-square-foot showroom with 100 other people,
none of whom you know, there's not much expectation of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The stores themselves are less interested in privacy than in
commerce. The question for them is whether Webcams increase sales?
</P>
<P>
   Underhill said the merchandise might be upstaged by the people
in Webcam shots. ``If you look at architectural magazines, they
almost never have people in them,'' Underhill said. ``When people
and merchandise compete for attention, the people always win.''
</P>
<P>
   The retailers disagree. Walt Dunnigan, an information technology
manager with Gallery Furniture, said that many customers did their
shopping on the Web site before going to the store. ``They walk in
holding picture of what they would like to purchase, walk right
over to the item and do the seat test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Danier, a Canadian leather-goods retailer, installed Webcams in
its factory store in December. ``It's really all about marketing
and providing customer service,'' said Jeffrey Wortsman, Danier's
president and chief executive. ``If you send an e-mail, the
customer service department can demonstrate a product, even come
out on the floor to model it for you. The cameras create a lot of
word-of-mouth. We hope to install cameras in all our stores
eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   At Danier.com, I discovered another use for the storecam. After
I snapped a photo of a pair of red leather gloves and sent it via
e-mail to a customer service representative to ask the price, I got
a response in less than an hour: ``The red gloves are $35 U.S. and
the Style No. 3135 0113 and they come in sizes small, medium,
large. Best Regards, Paula.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't buy the gloves. But I wondered who Paula was.

   WorldCom and Sprint Plan to End Merger Agreement
</P>
<P>
   Facing resistance from regulators in the United States and
Europe to their proposed $115 billion merger, WorldCom and Sprint
are planning to announce by early next week that they will abandon
the deal, executives close to both companies said. The move could
immediately turn the companies into takeover targets for both
American companies and foreign companies that have been seeking a
foothold in the United States. Sprint has already received informal
overtures from both Deutsche Telekom of Germany and from BellSouth.
Shares of Sprint fell 93.75 cents, to $53.50, while WorldCom rose
37.5 cents, to $45.50.
</P>
<P>
   With the merger between Sprint and WorldCom all but called off,
Sprint executives who were given stock options as an incentive to
stay can cash them in now and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks Plunge on Profit Warnings
</P>
<P>
   Stocks tumbled after earnings warnings from software makers sent
investors scrambling to sell technology shares. The Nasdaq
composite index dropped 128.83 points, or 3.2 percent, to 3,863.10.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 77.07 points, or 0.7 percent,
to 10,483.60, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index slid 23.09
points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,446.23.

<P>
   New Share Sale for Goldman Sachs
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs Group said that it would let its former partners
sell as many as 18 million shares of stock in an offering that
could be bigger than the firm's $3.66 billion initial public
offering last year.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Indicators Down Slightly
</P>
<P>
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators, an important measure
of future economic activity, fell 0.1 percent in May, the latest
indication that a string of interest rate increases has slowed the
economy.

   Optimism Wanes Over North Korea
</P>
<P>
   Foreign business optimism over the thaw between North and South
Korea has waned considerably in the few weeks since their leaders
met and a symbolic truckload of Coca-Cola crossed into the North.
The discussions between President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea and
his Communist counterpart, Kim Jong Il, generated a kind of
euphoria, and talk was heard of an opening of North Korea. But now,
major American and European businesses are again expressing deep
caution. And Coca-Cola, often seen as an icon of Western capitalism
that helped lead the way into Communist countries like China and
Vietnam, is vague about what it envisions doing in North Korea.

   Euro Debate Intensifies in Britain
</P>
<P>
   A British debate over whether to join the euro grew more intense
when the government published data that showed overseas investment
in Britain has soared to a record despite the strength of the
British pound. The data undercut complaints by foreign companies
that the pound's strength is damaging them by making Britain an
expensive place to manufacture goods for export.
</P>
<P>
   Have Car, Will Travel for Cheap Gas
</P>
<P>
   Europe's motorists, wedded to their cars, have long been the
target of governments that seek revenue by cranking up taxes on
gasoline. Consequently, drivers are willing to cross international
borders in search of cheap gas, driven by taxes that vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   New Economy, With an Old Twist
</P>
<P>
   While many business gurus, and even some well-trained
economists, say that we now live in a ``network society'' in which
profits and economic growth can reach heights not yet seen, it is
the old-economy idea of economies of scale that is making the
difference.

AN EVOLUTION FROM BRICKS TO SUBTLETIES OF THE MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Belgi um )   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ruling images in the works that the Belgian
choreographer Wim Vandekeybus presented in New York from 1987 to
1991 were surprising. Dancers ducked as others threw bricks at them
(the power of instinct); women in swinging hammocks swiped at men
carrying eggs on trays (the fragility of male-female relations).
The norm consisted of flying bodies, hairsbreadth timing,
confrontational games and erotic aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I don't need to throw a brick to show how intense
instinct can be,'' the 37-year-old choreographer said. ``I'm more
involved with text, with psychological intuition. What has changed
in my work is that I'm more interested in the inner state of
something.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lincoln Center Festival 2000 presents his company, Ultima
Vez, on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday at La Guardia High School,
Vandekeybus suggests, his New York premiere, a collaboration with
the American art-rock composer David Byrne, will differ from the
pieces seen nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The title, ``In Spite of Wishing and Wanting,'' invites as many
meanings as ever. ``My titles are never closed,'' Vandekeybus
(pronounced van-de-KAY-bus) said in an interview. ``They are like a
harbor for different fish to come in.'' If the same high energy is
present in Ultima Vez, there is a new interest in the fantastic. A
film within the piece is inspired by the magic realism of the
Argentine writer Julio Cortazar, who died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The all-male cast includes a blind performer, Said Gharbi, a
Moroccan who lives in Belgium. ``He is not portrayed as a blind
person,'' Vandekeybus said. ``But his movement is different from
the others, and he is an incredibly strong character. I started
working with blind people because my movement language was getting
so physical that I needed to work with the senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the explosion of experimental dance and theater in Belgium
in the 1980s, Vandekeybus' work stood apart for its raw quality.
But like Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker and Jan Fabre, he used
repetition within form that generated content about social
alienation.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the small Flemish town of Herenthout, 20 miles from
Antwerp, Vandekeybus accompanied his father, a veterinarian, on his
rounds: ``I saw dramatic things, especially with farmers who were
in a state of urgency, facing a problem they could not solve.''
While studying psychology at the University of Leuven for two
years, he became involved in experimental theater. A mentor, Paul
Peyskens (``A very interesting person, undervalued'') cast him in
``Don Carlos.'' The choreographer recalled: ``We had to know the
text but we could do it out of order. I liked to open with the last
act. Then the others had to react.''
</P>
<P>
   His current impulses are similar. ``Texts and actors that
everybody knows often paralyze me,'' he wrote in a program note.
``It is as if they are overflowing with meaning and I cannot add
anything to them.''
</P>
<P>
   After touring in an eight-hour production with Fabre,
Vandekeybus turned to what he calls research into the reality of
movement. The brick-throwing episode of ``What the Body Does Not
Remember,'' his first piece, exemplified this exploration of ``the
necessity for movement,'' as he termed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest influences on that piece,'' he said, ``was
the workshop I did with a 5-year-old boy.'' Vandekeybus had the
child move in with him for three weeks, an experience that he
connected to the themes of ``What the Body Does Not Remember.''
These were ``instinct, purity and complexity of free imagination,''
qualities he found in the boy, who is now a pilot. The boy's
parents (the father is a psychiatrist) agreed to the experiment.
``I recall all this now that I have a 5-year-old child,''
Vandekeybus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Spite of Wishing and Wanting'' has a different springboard.
``The whole piece is about how it is impossible to explain your
deepest wish or desire,'' he said. ``It is dangerous to explain it
_ it becomes an intellectual statement. But in dreams and sleep,
your deepest wishes and fears can be expressed.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the dancers often assume sleeping positions, even
when they are standing up (head resting on elbow). ``They sleep in
the air and wake up as they hit the floor,'' he said. ``This idea
created a great deal of movement material.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a series of precise thrusts and parries resulted in a
``talking hands'' section through which partners attempt to
communicate ``from one body to another,'' as the choreographer put
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you really wish?'' Vandekeybus added rhetorically.
``It's beautiful to have this passion of wanting something. I don't
like people without passion, who don't believe in things and have
only scientific explanations. I believe in magic things, in
energy.''

EUROPE'S MOTORISTS OFTEN FIND LOWER GASOLINE PRICES BY CROSSING
BORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Paul Cheringou, a Frenchman, buys his in Spain. In
London, Ken Reddy, a Briton, prefers to pop over _ or rather under
_ the Channel to France for his. In Berlin, Monika Brauer, a
German, finds Poland a favored venue for hers.
</P>
<P>
   What these border hoppers have in common is the quest for
(relatively) cheap gasoline. And what drives them to cross
international frontiers just to fill the tank is an often wide
difference in gasoline taxes _ one of Europe's most pervasive, yet
surreptitious, taxes _ that provides some Europeans an offer they
can't seem to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries that share a border, a bridge or a tunnel, the
difference in the price of gas can be as much as $1.80 a gallon as
in the case of Britain, where fuel can cost $5.50 a gallon, and
France _ or more than 75 cents a gallon in the case of Poland vs.
Germany where a gallon goes for $3.70. And taxes explain the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Wedded to their cars, the Continent's motorists have long been
the target of governments that seek revenues by cranking up levies
on gasoline rather than confront the political repercussions of
higher sales and income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people now pay more duty on petrol than they do income
tax,'' said Britain's conservative tabloid The Daily Mail.``This is
stealth tax with a vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Couple those taxes with the same oil price increases that have
helped push U.S. gasoline prices past the $2 mark, though, and
Europeans face a double whammy from both taxes and the oil
companies. The result: gasoline prices in many parts of the
Continent are at levels that stagger even Europeans, and would
incense Americans.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone in the United States were told to pay the prices we
pay here, there'd be rioting in the streets,'' said Michael
Johnson, a spokesman for Britain's Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   The prices offer some insight into a yawning chasm in
trans-Atlantic perceptions of the little guy's relationships with
the big guys. While Americans protest vocally at gasoline prices
climbing past $1.50 a gallon, Britons sigh in grumpy resignation at
gas costing more than three times as much.
</P>
<P>
   While the perceived rapacity of Big Oil has become a campaign
issue in the United States, Europeans exhale a despairing rage at
what seems to be a conspiracy between political parties whose
rivalries give way to a consensus on the beauty of gasoline taxes
and the riches they produce for those in power.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For every gallon sold at the pumps in French francs or German
marks or British pounds, European governments rake in an average 70
percent to 80 percent of the price, compared with 25 percent in
America.
</P>
<P>
   So, at a time when the European Union is ballyhooing its single
market and single currency, the discrepancies between tax regimes,
both within the European Union and beyond, are providing the little
guy one of the very few chances to profit from Europe's deep-rooted
national distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Even though France and Spain share the euro, for instance,
Cheringou, a hotel receptionist in the French resort of
St.-Jean-de-Luz, likes to head south over the France-Spain border
in his Peugeot 106 subcompact every 10 days on a mission to buy
gas, cigarettes, fresh fruit and fish.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-minute drive from the Hotel Prado where he works, he said,
Spanish entrepreneurs have thoughtfully erected a gigantic
supermarket, the Alcampo, to cater to him and thousands of other
French shoppers, with prices both in French francs and Spanish
pesetas. Because of an agreement between some European countries
removing border formalities, there is no need to slow down or show
his passport as he crosses the border.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is well worth his drive. He figures that with the $80
he spends on a 10-gallon tank of gas, a few cartons of Winfield
cigarettes and a grocery cart of produce, he saves about $30 from
what he would otherwise pay in France _ the equivalent of more than
$1,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he said, is that while gas costs seven French francs
per liter _ roughly $3.70 per gallon _ in France, the cost in Spain
is significantly less because taxes are lower. Indeed, according to
the International Energy Agency in Paris, French taxes account for
roughly 70 percent of the cost of a gallon of gas in France, while
Spanish taxes total about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctions exist not just within the 11 countries that
have adopted the euro to underpin their national coin. In non-euro
England, for instance, where taxes consume about 75 percent of gas
prices, Reddy, a 45-year-old security consultant, figures he will
save more than $3,000 a year simply by doing monthly shopping not
at his local stores in East London but in France.
</P>
<P>
   Taking his Alfa Romeo 164 sports sedan to France, he says, costs
him little more than the $37.50 day ticket to use the Channel
Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   But, because French taxes on gasoline, tobacco, liquor and food
are so much lower, his savings far outstrip the price of the
ticket. ``I go because of the ludicrous high taxes on everything we
do, buy, eat or sleep in Britain,'' he said. ``If we didn't have
these ludicrous, high taxes, I wouldn't go over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said, up until three years ago French gasoline prices
were higher than British prices. But since then _ coinciding with
Tony Blair's New Labor government _ gas prices have risen by more
than a third in Britain. ``I'd say that, in the last three years,
99 per cent of my fuel has been French,'' Reddy said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, Brauer, a 55-year-old hospital administrator, has
gone one further. For many years, she said, she has kept a weekend
home in a trailer park on the German-Polish border at Frankfurt an
der Oder, 50 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, gasoline, laden with ecological and sales taxes,
costs $3.59 per gallon. In Poland, she said, it costs 20 percent
less. So, during her weekend at the trailer, Brauer does some of
her shopping by fueling her Opel Vectra compact _ and buying a
carton of cheaper cigarettes _ in Poland, for a savings of about
$500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I pay more taxes in Germany?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every European lives close to a border, so the
economic impact of those shopping for cheaper gas is minor. But the
crossborder odysseys play into a much bigger debate over the
environment, the economy and, increasingly, the Continent's
politics just at a time when summer vacationers take to the
Autobahns.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, this is a time of debates and migrations, when
Germans head to Italy, and French vacationers swarm the Riviera and
Britons drive across the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   It is a time when European environmentalists fret about auto
pollution and, this year, some politicians have begun to see the
risk to their constituencies presented by ever-higher gasoline
prices.
</P>
<P>
   In big economic terms, the case for high gasoline taxes is not
easy to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Higher gas prices spread increased costs across Europe's
economies, pushing up delivery and supply charges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, according to Fatih Birol, the head of economic analysis at
the International Energy Agency, the high proportion of taxes in
the pump price of Europe's gasoline effectively fixes so much of
the price of gasoline that consumers are cushioned from the wild
price swings Americans have seen this year.
</P>
<P>
   And governments argue that motorists should pay for the damage
they cause to the environment. ``It's sort of enshrined in
environmental policy to persuade people to use alternative means of
transport,'' said Vicky Sheriff, a spokeswoman for the British
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   For all those high-minded protestations, the reality is that gas
taxes produce significant income for governments that is difficult
to find elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, gasoline taxes and license fees net more than $55
billion a year, roughly the same as Germany's gas tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the high price of crude oil and the strength of the
dollar _ the currency of the oil industry _ have also pushed up
prices. Significantly, though, the latest increases have finally
nudged prices toward psychological barriers _ 2 German marks per
liter or $3.70 per gallon, and 1 pound per liter or $5.50 a gallon)
in Britain _ that may breach European apathy about gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Europeans sense that their love affair with their
cars leaves them vulnerable to ever higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In France people will sacrifice even on food rather than do
without their car,'' said Cheringou in St.-Jean-de-Luz.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep slapping on the tax and all we do is sit at home and
moan about it,'' said Reddy in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do anything you want with the Germans because they
won't leave their car at home,'' said Brauer in Berlin. ``The car
is their favorite child.''

 &HT;    Tour de lunch
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ride, Lance, ride.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's favorite cyclist is over in France biking his heart
out, hoping to be the world's No. 1 pedal pusher again.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Central Texans watch
enthusiastically as Armstrong tackles the 2,000-plus-mile course,
mentally riding with him, up the hills and down, around the curves
and all out on the straight lanes. Pedal, pedal, pedal.
</P>
<P>
   But who says the support has to be mental? What about physical?
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like a hero to inspire you to dust off the old
bike, pump up the tires and hit the trails and streets. Even if you
don't have a team or sleek colorful attire, you can bike like Lance
on Lone Star soil. Forget that competition stuff, though. Stop and
have a little picnic, wave an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   We'll cheer for you, too, and tell you what to take along to
keep those spirits and energy levels up.
</P>
<P>
   Three Austin chefs/restaurant owners have come up with menus for
French, Italian and Austin bike picnics. Check out the common
denominators: All three flaunt the season's peaches, albeit in
different ways. They stress the importance of water. They serve up
plenty of carbs.
</P>
<P>
   So pedal on, Lance, but we're pausing for lunch. We'll catch up
later.
</P>
<P>
   Tips for the Italian menu
</P>
<P>
   _ At the picnic site, slice the peach thinly and place in a wine
glass. Pour wine over the slices and let them macerate during
lunch. Then you can dip the biscotti in the wine and eat with the
peaches for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boil the potato gnocchi with a pinch of salt until tender but
firm. Saute pesto sauce in a pan, add the gnocchi, and toss well.
Remove from the heat, sprinkle on Reggiano Parmigiano cheese and
refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Melt 2 tablespoons butter in an 8-inch ovenproof saute pan.
Thinly slice 1 small boiled, skinless potato. Place in pan and
saute until golden. Beat 3 eggs with 1/2 cup minced mint, 3 ounces
freshly grated pecorino romano cheese, 1/2 cup diced portobello or
other fresh mushrooms, salt and pepper to taste and 2 tablespoons
milk. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to saute pan and pour egg mixture
over potatoes. Cook until bottom of frittata is golden brown. Place
under broiler until top is brown. Cool and refrigerate. Cut into
wedges for easy packing. Serves 6.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take small containers of salt, pepper, olive oil for dipping
or to drizzle on the cold cuts, utensils, napkins.
</P>
<P>
   Chill out
</P>
<P>
   No matter where you picnic, it's essential to keep perishable
foods cold.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider soft-sided insulated, waterproof coolers or
backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wine sleeves can be frozen and used as ice packs en route and
chillers on site.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cheap ice pack: Fill a zippered plastic bag with water,
allowing expanding room, and freeze. At the site, melted water can
be used for washing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use frozen plastic water bottles for ice packs during travel
and drink them upon arrival. Don't try to freeze glass bottles of
water.

 &HT;    Winery fire has Ohio link
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I admit i scanned the first reports of the June 15 wine
warehouse fire in the Napa Valley with only casual interest. The
wineries listed in the wire-service stories as having lost some of
their already-bottled wines weren't on any of my must-have lists,
so the losses didn't resonate all that strongly.
</P>
<P>
   But a Father's Day news release in the form of a letter from Bob
and Diana Foley brought a slightly more personal perspective on the
fire and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   You may remember Bob Foley for his Pride Vineyard wines, which
he pours at the Cincinnati International Wine Festival, or for his
stint before that as winemaker at Markham Vineyards. He also has
Miami Valley roots: He lived in Kettering and Oakwood between the
ages of 5 and 9. Foley's father, who worked in the aerospace
business, came to Dayton to work on a project at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base. Upon their return to California, the Foley family
bought an acre east of San Francisco and planted some cabernet
sauvignon vines. Foley hasn't strayed far from the vineyards since.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's launching his own label, Robert Foley Vineyards, and
had stored most all of his 1998 vintage wines, already bottled, in
the doomed warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Foley's wife wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob arrived at (the warehouse) prepared for a normal day of
work. After learning of the fire, he called me immediately. Our
5-year-old son Jack and I arrived soon to join him and many others
in what was a desperately helpless situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack and I sat on the grass on an ironically beautiful morning
and watched the flames shoot up from the roof of the warehouse. As
tears streamed down my face, Jack held me and said, `I can make you
feel better, Mommy.' It's moments like those that help you put your
losses into perspective. We sat and listened to the glass explode
like fireworks. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``As the fire raged on, it was clear that the bottled wines in
the concrete warehouse could not be saved ... As we reflect on
this, I for one am hit with the memory of handling each and every
bottle; my efforts at mastering the hand corker was something akin
to the old I Love Lucy shows. Bob, who filled each bottle by hand,
his assistant Romel and I touched those bottles many times before
the final phase which involved polishing each bottle so no wine
residue remained. Certainly a labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it stands, all is not lost. ... What perished in the fire
was only wine, not our dream. We'll keep moving forward no matter
what obstacle we encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   So now you know a little part of the story behind the story. And
I've learned not to be so blase about what I read.
</P>
<P>
   WINE NOTES
</P>
<P>
   When a wine-obsessed friend suggested a few years ago that a
wine's aromas and flavors can change depending on the type of glass
it's served in, I dismissed the notion disdainfully as just another
hallucination from a geek who was too tightly wound in wine's pomp
and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Then he demonstrated the difference. Fisher was wrong again. The
size and shape of the glass had a noticeable effect on the smells
and, to a lesser but still detectable degree, on the taste of wine.
I was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fairfield Wine, 2418 Esquire Drive, has invited a
representative of Riedel _ the Austrian crystal producer _ to help
lead a wine tasting seminar at 7 p.m. July 20 at the store off of
North Fairfield Road just south of the mall in Beavercreek. Tasters
will try different glass styles and compare them with regular home
and restaurant-style glasses. Each participant will take home the
four-glass Riedel Vinum tasting set. The cost of the seminar is
$70. Call 427-1007 for details.

IN BRITAIN, DEBATE OVER ADOPTING EURO GAINS IN INTENSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ An British debate over adopting the euro grew more
intense on Wednesday when the government published data that showed
overseas investment in Britain has soared to a record despite the
strength of the British pound.
</P>
<P>
   The data undercut complaints by foreign companies that the
pound's strength is damaging them by making Britain an expensive
place to manufacture goods for export.
</P>
<P>
   Further fanning the debate, Prime Minister Tony Blair
acknowledged that there are some economic benefits from euro
membership. But he insisted that Britain should maintain its
``prepare-and-decide'' policy on signing up for the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, adopted by 11 of the European Union's 15 members, has
fallen sharply against the pound and the dollar since its
introduction 18 months ago. That weakness has made British exports
to Europe, in particular, more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The statements from politicians and business leaders have
followed weeks of dispute within the British government over how to
present its policy on the single currency _ either bullish or
bearish _ as foreign manufacturers like Nissan Motor, Toyota Motor
and Mitsubishi insist that the pound's strength against the euro is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   These companies, along with Nestle and others, have called for
Britain to commit itself to joining the euro. Such a move would
lock the pound into an immutable relationship with the euro-zone
and remove the risk of exchange rate swings from manufacturers'
calculations and export sales.
</P>
<P>
   In figures announced on Wednesday, David Wright, head of the
Department of Trade and Industry's Invest in Britain Bureau, said
foreign investment in Britain rose to a record $382 billion in the
fiscal year _ almost half of it from the United States _ 25 percent
higher than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing which suggests that the attitude of foreign
companies is being significantly affected by the policy with which
we are all familiar in respect to the single currency,'' Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain prides itself as the favored location among outside
investors seeking a beachhead for sales into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But there is evidence that the pound's strength against the euro
is eroding the readiness of manufacturers to risk the extra
currency-driven costs of doing business in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, the Ford Motor Co. and BMW AG have pulled out
of British automotive plants, and Nissan has hinted it might move
production of a new subcompact elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to pressures to commit to the euro, Blair faces a
competitive challenge from the strengthening economies of France
and Germany _ the twin motors of European integration _ which could
leave Britain on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair faces a domestic political challenge pulling in the
opposite direction. With his popularity at its lowest in three
years, a new opinion survey suggested that more than 70 percent of
Britons oppose abandoning the pound.
</P>
<P>
   In Parliament on Wednesday, Blair insisted that Britain stick to
its present view, known as the prepare-and-decide policy, that it
would join a successful European currency if the euro zone's
performance met British economic criteria and if Britons voted for
it in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Membership of a successful single currency would be good for
British jobs, mortgages and industry but it must be dependent on
the economic tests,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   But, in remarks typifying British ambivalence, he said, ``What
would be disastrous for British jobs and inward investment, what
would mean the immediate loss of jobs and investment in this
country, is to rule out the euro altogether.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is 8 o'clock on a summery June morning _ early for
most people. But not for Joan Hamburg. Awake since 5:30, she's
already scoured the day's newspapers and magazines for interesting
tidbits to use on her daily WOR Radio talk show; she's made the
trip from her Upper East Side apartment to the station's quaintly
retro studio near Times Square; and now she's busy taping a feature
about head injuries for use on today's two-hour broadcast, which
begins at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, some water,'' she pleads, in tones more likely to be
heard in a Brooklyn neighborhood than in a broadcast booth. ``The
studio is so dry!'' She does need lubrication: she's going to be
talking all morning _ about shows and shops and restaurants as well
as the items she's culled from the day's reading _ in the warm,
confidential manner women use when chatting with their friends. She
will dispense tips on city living, interview an entertainer or the
author of a book and then take calls for an hour, moving quickly
from one topic to the next and keeping a million and a half people
_ mostly women over 30 _ listening. Her audience, nearly twice the
size of those for competing talk shows, earns the station nearly $1
million a year in revenue, a remarkable figure for a daytime show.
</P>
<P>
   In her dark blue pants suit, bright flowered scarf and simple
gold jewelry, Hamburg, who is in her late 50s, looks like an
up-to-the-minute, high-powered business executive, but her folksy
hodgepodge of a show belongs to the cozy, old-time tradition of
Martha Dean and Arlene Francis, and it has won her a unique place
in male-dominated commercial radio.
</P>
<P>
   What has made ``The Joan Hamburg Show'' successful? ``I think I
have a feeling for what people want,'' Hamburg says, ``and for what
works and doesn't work. I can talk about everything from the
mundane _ how to get money back from a caterer who rips you off _
to thoughtful issues like the woman who called and said, `What
happened, suddenly I woke up and my mother's old and needs care and
I've got a teen-ager and a business to run.'''
</P>
<P>
   David Bernstein, WOR's program director, says: ``There's no one
like her in radio. She went from being simply a consumer adviser to
being someone people personally care about.'' Bob Bruno, the
station's general manager, calls her ``everywoman,'' although he
might be closer to the mark if he called her ``everywoman's mom.''
Along with John Gambling, whose popular show ``Rambling With
Gambling'' precedes hers, she is a gold mine for the station.
Advertisers line up to be on her programs, which include
``Weekend,'' on Saturday mornings with the food critic Arthur
Schwartz, and ``Medical Minutes With Joan Hamburg,'' broadcast
daily during Dr. Joy Brown's psychological advice show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day someone comes here,'' says Sallee Bijou, owner of
the Yellow Door gift shop in Brooklyn, ``and says, `Joan sent me.'
It's like a cult.'' Bill Muller, owner of Muller's Toyotas in
Clifton, N.J., has advertised on the show for six years. ``I'd be a
fool not to,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The first Wednesday of every month, Hamburg broadcasts live from
Sardi's restaurant, where she interviews theater personalities,
surrounded by listeners who come to see her. ``She sells out
theater matinees,'' says Richard Kornberg, a publicist for Broadway
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Hamburg traces her success to the proverbial
happy childhood. ``I've been lucky,'' she says. ``I grew up in
Lawrence, N.Y., surrounded by a big, caring family. My mother told
me I could do anything I wanted _ of course, with the expectation
that I'd also get married and have kids.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Barnard College, she married Morton
Hamburg, a lawyer who recently became a photographer. ``I really
wanted to be an actress,'' she says, ``but I started writing for
New York Magazine, and it was fun. Nothing was planned. My
generation of women never thought we'd have careers.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first 11 years of their marriage, the Hamburgs lived in
Vermont, before moving to New York with their two children, John,
now a filmmaker, and Elizabeth, now an Internet entrepreneur.
Hamburg had made something of a name for herself as a supplier of
useful information while still in college, when she wrote ``New
York on $5 a Day'' for the Arthur Frommer guidebook series. At
least 20 books and hundreds of articles for magazines like Woman's
Day and Ladies Home Journal followed, all geared to helping people
live better. (Her most recent book, ``City Wedding,'' a guide to
having one, came out last month.)
</P>
<P>
   She got her first radio job at WMCA doing consumer reports;
after trying television, she proceeded to WOR, working for $15 a
story because she'd been told it was the best radio station, with
the strongest signal (it is heard as far as Massachusetts and
Delaware).
</P>
<P>
   That was 21 years ago, and now she sits in the studio adjusting
the headphones so they don't disturb her blonde coiffure. Her
producer, Heather Cohen, delivers a big bottle of water, as well as
some briefing papers. Cohen and Muriel Sohmer, her researcher for
20 years, are Hamburg's only staff. ``I'm obsessed with
information,'' she says, explaining the crammed bookshelves behind
her desk. ``You can't stay on the air two hours without a lot in
your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking up, Hamburg checks the clock, signals the engineer and
is off and running with ``Medical Minutes.'' This morning's topics
are cancer, head injuries and teeth. A listener who had phoned her
to complain of a botched crown job is told, ``Go to another
dentist.'' Sounding like a combination kindergarten teacher and
social worker, she advises, ``Get him to describe what happened and
then send the report to the Dental Association. Always create a
paper trail.'' Two hours later, she's interviewing the singer
Leslie Uggams on her own show, empathizing and eliciting helpful
hints on comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   When the show is over, Cohen questions Hamburg about the
previous night's outing, to Guastavino, a new restaurant under the
59th Street Bridge. ``Great,'' says Hamburg. When an intern,
Jessica Marshall, arrives, the talk in the studio turns personal.
When Marshall mentions an upcoming date, Hamburg, a perpetual
advice machine, issues a warning: ``Now remember, he's 15 years
older than you are. Just be careful.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Hamburg's afternoons are a flurry of phone conversations with
listeners and advertisers and visits to stores and restaurants that
keep her well-stocked with suggestions for her listeners. But this
afternoon Hamburg must also begin taping several shows to cover the
two weeks when she will be touring Europe with 500 fans. For the
past eight years, WOR has offered trips for 350 to 700 listeners,
who pay from $6,000 to $9,000 for the privilege of traveling with
Hamburg and several guides. ``We've seen the world together,'' she
says. ``But they only want adventure with me, no lolling about on
Caribbean islands. I've walked up to the Great Wall of China in
100-degree heat and ridden elephants with them.'' This year, they
will balloon in Stockholm, water bike in Amsterdam and hike in
Estonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the outdoors,'' says Hamburg, settling down in her
small office to eat a salmon salad, although she goes on to admit
that her endless pursuit of information to share with her listeners
often keeps her checking out local businesses and events even at
her weekend house in the Hamptons. On her wall, she's put up a
poetic photograph of a hammock taken by her husband, and a couple
others of her white poodle Sadie. There are several plaques: one
from Brandeis University names her woman of the year for her
contribution to New York life; another, from the National Mother's
Day Committee, calls her ``the MC with the mostest.'' An
encyclopedia of antiques and another on North American Indian
jewelry lie side by side on the bookshelves, next to ``How to Know
God'' by Deepak Chopra and Maida Heatter's ``Book of Great
Desserts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see,'' Hamburg says, ignoring the ringing phone,
``I don't have much down time.'' Would she like more? ``I don't
know,'' she says. ``I'm probably too restless.'' What's been best?
``Seeing my children grow up to be successful, responsible, caring
adults,'' she says, to the last word the homespun figure her
listeners love. &QL;

 &HT;    Counting calories? Pick frozen yogurt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:How much do I save in calories and fat by choosing frozen
yogurt instead of hard ice cream or soft serve?
</P>
<P>
   A: Calories and fat content of all these products vary among
brands, but frozen yogurt usually contains about 215 calories in
each cup. Most store brands of hard ice cream haveabout 50 calories
more. Compared with rich and extra-rich ``gourmet'' ice creams
(which may contain more than 500 calories in each cup), frozen
yogurt is considerably less caloric.
</P>
<P>
   Soft serve that is ice milk (often labeled ``95% fat free'') is
similar to frozen yogurt in calories, but rich, frozen,
custard-type soft serve is like rich ice cream in fat and calories.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen yogurt is usually the lowest-fat choice of all these
frozen treats, with 0 to 2 grams of fat per cup, but soft serve ice
milk is not far off with only 5 to 7 grams. The big difference is
between these products and hard or soft ice cream, which can
contain anywhere from 14 to almost 50 grams of fat per serving.
None of these products is truly low-calorie, so regardless of your
choice, keep portion sizes reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Does soy cheese provide calcium?
</P>
<P>
   A: Soy cheese is not naturally a good source of calcium. Unless
it is fortified with calcium, you'll need to include other sources
in your diet. Soy cheese is, however, a good source of protein. For
those who avoid dairy products, it is a very appropriate substitute
as long as other steps are taken to meet calcium needs.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Is it true that spirulina is a concentrated source of protein?
</P>
<P>
   A: That depends how you define concentration. Based on weight,
dried spirulina (seaweed) is about twice as concentrated in protein
as meat. Almost 60 percent of spirulina tablets' weight is made up
of protein.
</P>
<P>
   If you define concentration based on how much of a nutrient you
get from a typical serving size, however, spirulina would not meet
the legal requirements to be considered a source of protein at all.
Six spirulina tablets generally contain less than 2 grams of
protein, compared with about 21 grams of protein in a moderate
(deck-of-cards-size) portion of meat, poultry or seafood.
</P>
<P>
   If you eat a balanced, mostly plant-based diet of vegetables,
fruits, whole grains, beans and nuts, you will get plenty of
protein, vitamins, fiber and phytochemicals without spirulina.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Does the manner by which powdered infant formula is prepared
affect its safety?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. A survey reported in the Journal of the American
Dietetic Association found that mothers commonly made several
errors in preparing their babies' formula that could pose safety
hazards. One-third of mothers routinely mixed formula using warm
tap water, which can contain lead that leaches out of plumbing
pipes. This could result in lead toxicity, which affects brain
development.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of mothers in the survey left prepared baby
bottles standing at room temperature for more than two hours. This
encourages growth of bacteria that can cause diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   About 48 percent of mothers heated bottles in a microwave oven.
This is discouraged because microwaves heat food unevenly,
potentially causing hot spots that you don't detect when you test
the temperature. To protect babies' mouths from burns, experts
advise putting the bottle of formula in a pan of warm water until
it achieves the right temperature.

A BEVY OF EXPERTS WITH SOAPBOXES, AND SITES TO FILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By BONNIE ROTHMAN MORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So, an economist, a magician and a man with
attention deficit disorder are sitting in a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the setup for a joke, it's simply one of the many
encounters that took place here in June at a weekend meeting of
about 70 people with diverse professions, hobbies and afflictions
who attended a two-day conference to commune, confess and complain
about the one thing they had in common: their roles as the remote
work force of the Web site About.com.
</P>
<P>
   A microcosm of the Web itself, About.com is a linked network of
700 Web sites. The conference was a regional one in a series of
intimate gatherings sponsored by the company and designed to focus
on the basics of the Web business. Taken together, the topic array
was dizzying _ space, social work, TV for Teens, composite
materials (the stuff used to make rocket ships). The content on
each site is created by people, who may or may not be professionals
in the fields they cover and who are not employees of About.com.
</P>
<P>
   Called guides by the company, the Webmasters are independent
contractors who have set up their soapboxes under the company
umbrella. They are there because About.com offers something other
sites do not: the chance for the so-called experts, professionals
and hobbyists to make money pursuing their passions. Sometimes, a
great deal of money.
</P>
<P>
   For their efforts, Webmasters earn a minimum of $500 a month as
a fee against advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a continuum, guides who don't care about the money, and
guides, like our stocks guide, for who it's all about the money,''
said Scott Kurnit, the chief executive who founded the company in
1996 as The Mining Co., changing the name shortly after it went
public. ``It's a continuum of passion to greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Burton, the casino gambling guide, simply loves what he
calls, ``the game.'' He says he funnels every cent he makes from
his Web work back into buying books and videos about gambling, or
he uses it as travel fare to the casinos he visits once a week.
Gambling money comes out of a separate for-gambling bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, 48, of New Britain, Conn., who holds a day job as a
printer, spent the weekend handing out little rubber brains. ``This
is the true secret of winning at the casino, your brains,'' he
said, pulling one of the brains out of his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had planned to build his own Web site, ``The Casino
College of Knowledge,'' then he heard about About.com and set up
shop with them. He echoed the sentiments of many other guides who
believe they are making more money with About.com than they would
be if they were floating alone on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Like Burton, most guides run their Web sites as a sideline,
working an average of 10 to 15 hours a week. They write original
articles, scour the Web for the best links to their topic, are
hosts to live chats, manage forums and publish their own
newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   Along with knowledge about their topics, guides must be
dexterous in the use of HTML, adept at self-promotion and must
possess a stick-to-itiveness that keeps their sites going. Most
guides said they had started just because they wanted to share what
they knew with others. Many admitted they always had a secret
desire to write.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants usually come in over the Internet transom by clicking
on the ``be a guide'' button on About.com's home page. Only 20
percent of people who go through the selection process get the job,
Kurnit said. To make the grade, a prospective guide must write an
article, create a list of links to a topic and send in a resume.
</P>
<P>
   Once approved, an applicant enters a training program. The first
step is to build a Web site on speculation within 10 days. The site
must include another article and at least 60 links to other sites
on their topic on the Web. Then the prospective guides spend
another 12 weeks working with About.com editors to flesh out their
sites.
</P>
<P>
   What becomes clear during the 16-week evaluation, said Jim
Scollins, vice president for guide operations, is whether
applicants really know what they are talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluations depend on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's credible and what's an expert depends on the topic,''
Scollins said. ``If you're talking about heart disease, we need to
have a doctor. With talk television, it's going to be more of a fan
site. We're not going to let someone who's had a couple of nose
jobs run the plastic surgery site.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all Webmasters for health-related topics are doctors.
Some, like the thyroid site Webmaster, have written books on the
topic. Others, like the lupus site Webmaster, may suffer from an
affliction and then build an online community around it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Having non-professionals run some of the sites is what makes
About.com accessible to its users, say the professionals who have
their own Web sites. ``We would not be as strong a site if we were
all professionals,'' said Leonard Holmes, a clinical psychologist
who runs the mental health site. An anesthesiologist and an
orthopedic surgery resident work as guides, and the economist
guide, John Irons, is a professor of economics at Amherst College,
but there is also Rachel Thomas who runs the TV for Teens site.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a homemaker from Marshalls Creek, Pa., with two young
children and two teen-age stepchildren, says she watches a lot of
television. But TV for Teens was not her first choice. She said she
wanted to be the guide for the soap opera, ``One Life to Live,''
but another woman got the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``When her site went live,'' Thomas said, ``I realized they
really did choose the right person for this topic, and I realized
that she was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Thomas says, she works 35 hours a week on her site, and has
netted $500 to $1,200 a month. ``It's worth it,'' she said. ``I get
to work in my pajamas and raise my children, which is the most
important part of this job.''
</P>
<P>
   And although making extra cash for watching television is a neat
trick, a few Webmasters are successful enough to have given up
their day jobs for a full-time career as a guide. The pregnancy
site Webmaster, Robin Elise Weiss _ a childbirth educator, a doula
trained to assist women after childbirth, and a mother of three who
is pregnant with her fourth child _ earns $15,000 a month from her
Web work. She is being touted as a poster child for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to her success? ``Well,'' she said, ``a lot of people
get pregnant.'' Weiss, who lives in Louisville, Ky., also said that
the human touch was important. She answers all her e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a mom who's been writing to me for four years,'' Weiss
said. ``She's on her 11th baby, and she told me you've kept
pregnancy interesting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss admits that she has a type A personality. And a driven
personality is common among the guides, whose earnings are based on
the number of unique hits each site receives.
</P>
<P>
   About.com had 19 million users last month, said Mark Josephson,
a company vice president. According to Media Metrix, a company that
tracks Web site popularity, the site is the seventh largest on the
Internet. Ninety-five percent of visitors enter the site through
search engines that send them directly to topic-specific sites,
bypassing the home page. The guides are responsible for getting
their sites listed on search engines.
</P>
<P>
   The company provides the business overlay: Web page templates,
marketing, public relations, advertising sales and a 30 person
editorial staff. It also picks up the tab for regional conferences
for the guides like the one in Washington. The conferences make
these disparate people feel like they belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get paranoid when you're working 2,000 miles from
headquarters and you've never met the guy you're working for,''
said Kurnit, describing the typical guide-to-company relationship.
``We own the sites,'' he said. ``We control the intellectual
property in perpetuity. That requires a tremendous amount of trust
from the guides.''
</P>
<P>
   Though overwhelmingly white, the guides are a disparate group
with seemingly little to bind them. ``I look around and think, `I
wouldn't be your friend if I had met you on the street,''' Weiss
said of her fellow conference attendees. She reflected that they
had found a common bond through the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Deep into breakout sessions, the guides were speaking their
weird universal language, which includes words like ``sprinks''
(sponsored links), ``mbodies'' (their home pages) and ``blindexes''
(a list of links to more links). Finally, they got into it. ``We
need an obsessive compulsive site,'' said Bob Seay, the attention
deficit disorder guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our sites are,'' said the senior editor, Osborne, causing
a burst of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   The sites are also geared to the average person, which, it
seems, is what About.com is all about: getting to ``the average
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Dean, a magician from Valley Forge, Pa., who runs the
magic and illusion site, confessed that when he started out, he
wanted to be ``the magician's magician.'' But after attending a
guide conference in Tarrytown, N.Y., and hearing about an
enduringly popular quilting site that used a very basic approach,
he had an epiphany: he decided to dumb down his magic site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from advanced to beginner and intermediate,'' Dean
said. ``The numbers went through the roof. They doubled almost
overnight.''
</P>

   David Dunbar, an attorney from Ottawa who runs the chess site,
had a similar experience. After his site had been online for a
year, it finally occurred to him to post the rules of the game. His
numbers surged.
</P>
<P>
   ``What took me so long?'' he said, and reflected that his Web
site was like the ``chocolate bar'' of chess. Unlike the
grandmaster sites, filled with page after page of chess analysis,
his site is easier to consume, and not too heavy.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I knew I was going to be either an artist or a
criminal,'' says Martha Rosler, the multimedia artist, critic,
theorist, teacher and art-world provocateur. In a career spanning
35 years, Rosler, whose disdain for the normal rites of passage
from galleries to collectors to museums struck many as criminal,
has clung tenaciously to a very personal art that refuses to
separate aesthetics from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Declining to be represented by a gallery until 1993, Rosler
relented when Simon Watson, who then owned a gallery in SoHo,
approached her with an offer to preserve her work for history. ``He
made sense,'' she says, holding fast to a glass of cold water at
the Housing Works Used Books Cafe not far from Watson's old
gallery. ``So much of my work involved the Vietnam War that it
would have been obscene to show it in a gallery. But now, it's
different; it's important to remember and to enable the young to
discover what to some of us is still so present.''
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable affirmation from a museum world that she so
often criticized, Rosler is now receiving a major retrospective
organized by Elizabeth Ann Macgregor of the Ikon Gallery in
Birmingham, England, and Sabine Breitwieser of the Generali
Foundation in Vienna. After stops in England, France, Austria and
Spain, ``Martha Rosler: Positions in the Life World'' makes its
only United States appearance in a joint presentation by the New
Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo from Saturday through Oct. 8 and
the International Center of Photography on Fifth Avenue from July
29 through Oct. 1. ``Martha Rosler is one of the most important
artists of the last 25 years,'' says Brian Wallis, chief curator at
ICP, which will be focusing on Rosler's photography.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum, where a broad survey
of Rosler's large installations, photos, videos and sculptures can
be seen, adds, ``She is a pioneering artist whose influence is
widely recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   While this burst of affection from institutions may seem at odds
with her reputed iconoclasm, Rosler has actually been represented
in about 10 nonprofit group and solo shows in Europe and America
since the early 70's. ``I was never against museum audiences,'' she
says. ``Only the nexus of cash that saw art principally as a
commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming of age in the late '50s and '60s (she graduated from
Brooklyn College in 1965), she was immersed in a culture of
protests from her early teens. ``I was a beatnik in high school,''
she says, ``always going to hear Allen Ginsberg and Thelonius Monk.
I also went to a lot of theater from Broadway to the Living
Theater, where I was exposed to Brecht, Pirandello and Beckett.
They showed me how you could dispense with excessive amusement in
favor of language and gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosler's mother was a New York City school teacher and her
father had ``a one-man law office.'' She credits her yeshiva
education (which she hated at the time) with her strong sensitivity
to the ``public and the political.'' If her broad range of work can
be characterized briefly, it involves bringing a critical eye to
public struggles, in unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   In one of her most celebrated works, ``The Bowery in Two
Inadequate Descriptive Systems'' from 1974, Rosler challenges the
sentimentalism of postwar photography as represented by Robert
Capa. Instead of photographing the familiar ``Bowery bums,'' the
alcoholics and drug addicts who could be found lying in doorways
and on streets in lower Manhattan, Rosler took shots of shop
windows and disintegrating storefronts, void of people but
representing the life that is lived there by the neighborhood's
many diverse inhabitants. She placed the photos in a grid along
with texts containing synonyms for inebriation (loopy, groggy,
potted, pickled, etc.). The combination of photos and texts, placed
in a minimalist grid, forced a critique of assumptions about the
Bowery without offering any concrete alternatives. ``I wanted to
strip away any ornament,'' she says, ``and return power to the
viewer,'' something she felt had been contaminated by the overt
humanism of Capa and Walker Evans.
</P>
<P>
   This spareness of approach, often joined with a biting sense of
humor, was inspired partly by the films of Jean-Luc Godard, the
Swiss experimentalist who came to prominence in the early '60s.
Rosler met Godard a few times during her graduate studies at the
University of California in San Diego, where she also met the
filmmaker Roberto Rossellini and influential intellectuals like
Herbert Marcuse, Jean-Francois Lyotard and Fredric Jameson. In
Godard, the young Rosler found a model artist who resisted the
commercialization of ideas even as he dazzled with his command of
striking images, sounds and texts.
</P>
<P>
   Rosler spent a dozen years in southern California from the late
'60s to the early '80s, a time she says was immensely important to
her. ``I lost my New York provinciality,'' she says, ``and was let
loose from the strictures of being a middle-class Brooklyn Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   During this time she married, had a son, Joshua (now a
32-year-old comics artist and writer), and divorced after seven
years. After graduate school she taught art and began her lifelong
avocation of gardening. ``But I started dreaming of sidewalks,''
she says, ``so I knew it was time to go back East.'' She was
offered a job at Rutgers, where she is a professor of art.
</P>
<P>
   It was during her time in California that Rosler created some of
her most enduring work in performance, video and photography.
``Bringing the War Home,'' 1967-1972, is a series of 20
photomontages that places images of Vietnam War victims (girls with
missing limbs, mothers holding their dead children, wounded
soldiers) in the midst of tranquil suburban American interiors cut
from the pages of Life magazine. As the art historian Alexander
Alberro says of this series, ``She was, in effect, making concrete
`the war abroad, the war at home,' produced by the mass media,
which imported images of death from Vietnam into U.S. homes every
evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Domesticity also played a role in ``Semiotics of the Kitchen,''
a 1975 video, in which a deadpan Rosler, dressed in an apron, sends
up culinary shows and the woman's place in the kitchen, performing
mannered gestures with a variety of cooking utensils. Like so much
of her early work, ``Semiotics'' is striking both for its innocence
as well as its sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Rosler's photographs and videos were fully formed from the
start, it seems, displaying a strong grasp of technique peppered
with youthful exuberance. In her 1977 performance and, later, video
``Vital Statistics of a Citizen, Simply Obtained,'' the artist
submits to having every inch of her nude body measured and recorded
by two white-coated men as a ``chorus'' of women stand to the side
watching silently. ``This is a work about how to think about
yourself,'' Rosler says in a voice-over on the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Rosler has taken her cameras (moving and still)
to airports (producing stunning shots of architectural details in
empty terminals) and housing projects (a video study of Corbusier's
last development in Firminy, France), while maintaining her
commitment to the plight of the homeless (``Housing Is a Human
Right,'' a billboard display in Times Square) and politically
oppressed (``Chile on the Road to Nafta,'' a video made in Chile 25
years after the coup that deposed Salvador Allende).
</P>
<P>
   ``My art is a communicative act,'' Rosler says, ``a form of an
utterance, a way to open a conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Completing a conversation with her, during which topics have
flown from Aristotle to Marx, Nicaragua to Kosovo, is like coming
to the end of a roller coaster ride. You're relieved, but you want
to go at it again. Her enduring vision linking art and public
purpose can be exhausting as well as exhilarating. As the New
Museum's chief curator, Dan Cameron, says of Rosler: ``She's the
purest artist there is.''

WILLIAMS SISTERS' POWER THE PRODUCT OF A FATHER'S PLANNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TEN-WIMBLEDON) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON _ To trace the infancy of the Williams sisters'
powerful revolution, you would have to start with the Yellow Pages.
And put your faith in tall tales.
</P>
<P>
   To discover how Venus and Serena Williams first developed the
strength to begin a surreal journey that has led them to Thursday's
semifinal match against each other at Wimbledon, you would have to
go back to the inner-city of Los Angeles. And believe in the
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were around 2 years old, I wanted them to work; and
my wife said, `That's not going to happen,''' said the sisters'
beaming father, Richard Williams, as he stood in a morning drizzle
Wednesday outside the gates of the All England Club. ``How could
they work? Well, they could deliver phone books.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at Venus and Serena today and say, `Heck, they
must lift weights.' They don't lift weights. They just end up that
way when you develop their muscles early. It just followed them all
through life. Now, my wife says, `You did it the right way.'''
</P>
<P>
   The method of Richard Williams _ together, with all of its
madness _ has produced an unimaginable result. In front of a Center
Court crowd of curiosity seekers and tennis connoisseurs, his
daughters will part the applause together as they take their places
on a grass stage. Somewhere in the background of this fascination,
the modest Lindsay Davenport will face the 17-year-old prodigy,
Jelena Dokic, in the other match.
</P>
<P>
   The day will belong to the Williams sisters. Beyond the social
impact of their accomplishment _ with the two making a
cinematic-like leap from the projects to the pristine grounds of
the All England Club _ they will represent the simple pride of a
family. Perhaps as the only family members in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Oracene, told her family Tuesday night that she
was too exhausted to make the trip from Florida in time for the
match. Richard Williams also has other plans, but they do not
include attending the funeral of a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That funeral is today; I thought it was tomorrow,'' said
Williams, who planned to use the funeral as an escape from the
tension of his daughters' match. ``I might find something else to
do. I might go spend some pounds. If my daughters don't insist, I
won't be here.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment they walk on the court, their every move and
mood will be inspected. And as they exit, the outcome will
determine much more than which sister will advance to the final.
</P>
<P>
   Some wonder if Venus Williams' psyche could take a loss to a
little sister who is up to her ponytail in talent, charisma and
confidence. In September, Venus Williams stoically looked on from
the friends' box as Serena became the first of the sisters to
capture a Grand Slam tournament with a title at the U.S. Open. Had
Serena passed Venus so soon?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally speaking, I think Serena is a better player than
Venus,'' said Andre Agassi, who has taken note of the Williams
sisters' metamorphosis. ``You've got to favor certainly one of them
to win the tournament. I don't know which one. It's always a
psychological match-up. I can't even imagine what it's like to play
your sibling.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, neither sister wanted to discuss it. Just after they
ended Martina Navratilova's uplifting Wimbledon return with a
doubles victory in the quarterfinals, Venus Williams entered the
interview room, trailed by Serena. In a sign that the tension of
the moment has started to wear on them, Venus abruptly ended any
questions regarding their semifinal by saying, ``We feel like we
answered enough of those questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The more serious of the two, Venus asserted her big-sister
authority while Serena sat silently. In Venus' presence, the
usually effusive Serena was subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, Venus is Serena's hero and best friend,'' Richard
Williams said. ``But Venus definitely set the stage for Serena.''
</P>
<P>
   Both are striking stars. With the lean and angular Venus
Williams standing across the net from the compact and sculpted
Serena, with both sisters unleashing such uninhibited power, their
appearance in a semifinal appears to represent another step in the
evolution of tennis. But the sage who met them face to face
Wednesday isn't ready to proclaim their arrival just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' said Navratilova, who changed the way players on
the women's tour approached fitness. ``I mean, they have the
capability of taking it another step. They just haven't gotten
there, yet. With their size, they're just so big. I thought I was
big, but I'm like pipsqueak next to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they put it together technically, we could see them in the
finals for a lot of years to come. If they commit themselves, and
if they want to stay around. They definitely have the potential.
For them, they have to make fewer unforced errors. They still miss
too much. You know, just harness it a little bit. You're still on
your heels expecting a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   They are an intimidating pair. But Richard Williams did not
venture a guess as to which daughter would have better control of
their power and emotion when match-time arrives. As father and
coach, he was out of the loop. He did not practice with them
Wednesday, and will not hit with them on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say nothing, either,'' he said. ``Yesterday, when
Serena played her match and got through so quick, she came to the
court to watch Venus, I said, `Serena, Venus is not running up to
take the balls, and that's what I told her to do. Tonight, would
you please tell her to do it.' And she looked at me and said, `Dad,
no way. I'm playing her next.' So I will have no advice for either
one of them.''

 &HT;    Made for the Shade
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 81, George McLefresh is a guy who has learned how to relax.
</P>
<P>
   And one of his favorite places to kick back is under a new
awning at the back of his Trotwood home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have cookouts back here. We play cards and dominos on the
picnic table,'' McLefresh said. ``I love it on the patio. It's
shady and cool, and there always seems to be a breeze blowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Our decks and patios give us spaces for relaxing and
entertaining outdoors, but sometimes they can be too outdoors. An
awning protects occupants from sun and rain while leaving them
exposed to the natural sights, sounds and breezes around them.
</P>
<P>
   Window awnings also have practical uses. They block harsh direct
sunlight, making rooms cooler and more comfortable and they protect
furniture and fabrics from fading.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most important functions of patio and window
awnings is to look good; they dress up a house, giving it style and
personality.
</P>
<P>
   McLefresh has lived on the same property off Salem Avenue since
1940. He originally lived in a trailer on the lot and built his
house in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   He's modified the house extensively over the years, and he used
to have two different styles of aluminum awning over his
35-foot-wide patio. This year McLefresh said he and his wife,
Marlene, had Zephyr Home Improvement of Dayton replace the
mismatched awnings with a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Zephyr owner Richard Schell said the McLefreshes chose a
``Marquis'' style aluminum awning, the most popular style.
</P>
<P>
   The roof of the awning is made up of 8-inch-wide U-shaped
channels running from the house to a gutter at the front edge. The
channels are placed snugly side by side and are held together at
the top with connectors shaped like I-beams.
</P>
<P>
   Schell said the style creates a watertight roof that looks good
from the underside, the angle the owners will see most often. He
also said its white color reflects light so the area under the
awning is shady but not dark.
</P>
<P>
   Schell said aluminum awnings are guaranteed for the life of the
house. ``Unless you have a tornado or something, they stand up to
the weather,'' he said. Schell said aluminum awnings can be
weakened, though, by extremely heavy loads of ice and snow.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum awnings require very little maintenance. Schell said
hosing them down once a year generally keeps them looking new.
</P>
<P>
   If you regularly use a grill under an aluminum awning, Schell
said you may need to use a mild grease-cutting spray cleaner to
remove any smoke smudges that develop.
</P>
<P>
   Schell said an awning to cover a patio deck area of 10 feet by
20 feet probably will cost $2,500 to $3,000 or more if options like
decorated support posts are added.
</P>
<P>
   Also more expensive are insulated roofs, but Schell said some
customers install insulated roofs with the idea of creating an
enclosed patio room later.
</P>
<P>
   Schell said anyone building an awning with support posts resting
on the ground must get a building permit prior to construction.
Awnings that are supported by brackets attached to the house
generally do not require permits.
</P>
<P>
   Fabric awning prices are more varied than aluminum awning
prices, according to Kevin Tatman, owner of Merit Awnings in
Dayton. Merit, in business since 1979, has always sold aluminum
awnings and started selling Sunbrela brand fabric awnings about
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tatman said an entry-level fabric awning with a standard
stationary frame might cost about $10 per square foot, which would
add up to about $2,000 for an awning 10 by 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A custom-made fabric awning might cost from $11 to $17 per
square foot, he said. That would make an 10-by-20-foot awning cost
between about $2,200 and $3,400.
</P>
<P>
   Retractable awnings, which are rolled up when not in use, range
from $13 to $20 per square foot, Tatman said. The price varies
based on where the awning is mounted _ under the eaves, on a blank
wall or on the roof _ and whether the retraction mechanism is
motorized.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Hussong of Kettering is thrilled with the retractable
awning Merit installed over her backyard deck this year.
</P>
<P>
   She said her house with its huge yard and above-ground swimming
pool has become the gathering place for her close-knit family, and
the awning makes the deck much more versatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deck faces east, and the deck gets so hot when the sun
comes up that people have a hard time walking across it
barefooted,'' Hussong said. ``Without the awning, my mother
couldn't even sit out here sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussong uses a hand crank to extend her awning from its stored
position to its full length of about 10 feet in less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or I can put food out on a table against the house and extend
the awning just a couple feet to shade the food,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The angle of retractable awnings also can be adjusted, Tatman
said. They can be flat to provide maximum headroom or lowered to
block the sun when it is close to the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   It's fairly common to see frames for stationary fabric awnings
on houses built before 1950, but aluminum was the dominant awning
choice through the 1960s and 1970s. More aluminum than fabric
awnings still are being installed today, but fabric is making a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons for the resurgence is improved fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Old fabric awnings were made of cotton canvas with colors or
patterns printed on them. They faded quickly in the sun and tended
to rot and tear after a few years in the weather even though they
were taken down in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Tatman said today's awnings are made with acrylic fibers milled
to look like cotton canvas. The fibers are colored throughout so
they're less likely to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Most fabric awnings are warranted for five years, but if cared
for properly they should stay in good shape for eight to 10 years,
according to the trade group the Industrial Fabrics Association
International.
</P>
<P>
   The frames that hold the awnings last indefinitely, so when the
fabrics wear out they can be replaced without the expense of a new
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Fabric awnings do require some care and maintenance to keep them
clean and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Most people take their fabric awnings down in the winter to
bring more light into their rooms and to protect the awnings.
Companies that install awnings also will take awnings down in late
fall and replace them in the spring for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Retractable awnings are left in place during cold months. But
the awnings must be retracted during harsh weather. High winds can
damage the framework, so retractable awnings must be folded away
during summer storms.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum awnings are installed much more often than fabric
awnings, but Tatman said his business is split about evenly between
the two. And he said retractable awnings, which once were fairly
rare, are catching up to stationary fabric awnings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main advantage fabric awnings have over aluminum is
that they are available in hundreds of colors and patterns. Hussong
choose lively stripes in green, blue, red and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Black went with forest green for the stationary awning over
the deck behind his house in Springboro. The awning ties the deck
visually to the grove of trees that lines his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting out here watching the rain in the trees is one of the
most peaceful things you can do,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Black's home was built 10 years ago, and the southern portion of
the deck outside his kitchen was rarely used because the only door
to reach the deck led out from the family room at the north end of
the deck.
</P>
<P>
   This year Black added a door from the kitchen and the awning,
and the south end of the deck has become a favored gathering place.
</P>
<P>
   Black, a divorced father with two teens at home, said the deck
is indispensable for entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``During football season we have eight to 10 kids out here for a
pregame meal,'' he said. ``Under the awning is perfect for that.
I've never been a big sun person, so I just love it.''

FOCUS GROUPS GO ONLINE TO MEASURE THE APPEAL OF WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Texas, Minn.)   By CATHERINE COLLINS   (Circuits)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For George Paap, the manager for e-business intelligence and
research at Motorola Semiconductor Products, one of the most
interesting moments in an online focus group occurs as soon as
participants enter the virtual waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chat, they talk about movies, someone might mention that
he is opening a beer,'' said Paap, whose office is in Austin, Texas
``The classic was the guy who got in there and said, `I assume
you're all here because you said that Motorola's Web site stinks.'
We were trying to get people who weren't satisfied with our Web
site to tell us how to improve it. It worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Focus groups have long been a staple of marketers and business
planners. Now marketing research companies are creating online
focus groups to examine things like the effectiveness of Web site
designs and the appeal of new product names. The technique offers
potential advantages over traditional focus groups _ speed being
the most obvious. But the newfangled focus groups have
disadvantages, including the absence of personal interaction when
people communicate online.
</P>
<P>
   Focus groups are usually held in small rooms that have been
designed for conversation among the participants and moderators,
and researchers and clients usually observe behind one-way mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Online focus groups are surprisingly similar. Small groups of
consumers, usually six to 10, are brought together to answer
questions posed by a moderator in a special Internet chat room. The
sessions last about 90 minutes, and participants are paid $45 to
$250, with the top scale going to hard-to-find professionals.
Recruiting methods are tightly held trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   While sitting at their own computers in any location or time
zone, participants arrive in a virtual waiting area, where they are
often asked simple questions to determine their ability to
contribute to the discussion. Watching an online focus group come
together is a bit like watching strangers in the early stages of a
cocktail party. (But online participants cannot make snap judgments
about age and haircuts; they see only name tags and writing
styles.) In other words, there is much introductory conversation
about the weather. When the participants are approved, they are
invited into the chat room, and the session begins.
</P>
<P>
   There is a subtle difference in how the questions are asked and
answered in person and online, said David Bradford, a vice
president and director of The Virtual Research Room, a marketing
research firm, also known as Vrroom, that is based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a different interface,'' Bradford said. ``In a
traditional focus group, one person speaks at a time, and sometimes
one person tends to dominate. Online, because everyone is composing
his answer to the moderator's questions simultaneously, everyone
has a chance to speak equally, and they are influenced less by
those around them.''
</P>
<P>
   The participants see responses from other people in the focus
group, just as in a chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than watching through a one-way mirror, clients observe
from their computer terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Participants see what appears to be a typical chat room on their
computer screens. Moderators and clients see specially designed
screens that allow them to read the conversation as it unfolds and
communicate privately with one another. That lets the client
suggest new questions or even dismiss a participant who is not
contributing.
</P>
<P>
   While the method of conducting focus groups remains the same,
the technology is changing the research in subtle and major ways.
Not surprisingly, speed, efficiency and lower costs are most
frequently cited as the major benefit of online focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest advantage of online focus groups is that travel
expenses are eliminated for everyone,'' said Jeff Walkowski, the
president of Qualcore.com, an online research company in
Minneapolis. ``Because all it requires is Internet access, you can
have more people, clients, observing. In addition, online focus
groups can have a very fast turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics of online focus groups say that a lot of the
nuances are lost when discussions move onto the Internet. Nick
Nyhan, the chairman and chief executive of Dynamic Logic in New
York, said that his company did market research for online
companies but did not conduct focus groups on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most valuable parts of a focus group is to see
someone's eyes roll in response to a question, to see the tension
rise in a room, to get as close as possible and to get it all on
videotape,'' Nyhan said. ``You lose all nonverbal communication
online.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that some things work better on the Internet while
others do not. Taste testing obviously does not work online, and
the tactile nature of fashion is difficult to convey as well. But
discussions about workplace relations or sensitive medical issues
can be easier to talk about if people think that they will not be
identified. Web-related subjects are a natural for online focus
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Can Web focus groups provide answers that are applicable to more
general audiences? Can the people who use the Internet, which not
long ago was a place largely for young white men who were educated
and technologically adept, men, speak for everyone?
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, there was more bias in a group of Internet
respondents,'' said Susan Roth, the director of qualitative
research at Greenfield Online, a marketing research company in
Wilton, Conn., ``but that's changing. As more and more people use
the Internet, that group is getting closer and closer to the
demographics of the general population.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Roth said, the Internet has allowed researchers to
reach more people who have trouble leaving their homes, like those
who have disabilities or are elderly and people who have young
children at home. ``We have been able to open up our doors to
people who wouldn't do research otherwise,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Sabena, a professional focus group moderator who is the
president of Pat Sabena Qualitative Research Services in Westport,
Conn., said she doubted that online focus groups would replace
face-to-face sessions. ``It simply adds a dimension,'' she said.

AN ONLINE MAGICIAN WITH A SENSE OF DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Robinson is an outspoken, smooth-talking
ex-Yale man _ Yale was ``an aberration,'' he said, and will add
nothing more _ with a polished delivery and sharp, coolly presented
opinions on his love: magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite magicians are 90 years old and baldheaded,''
Robinson said in a telephone interview. ``The older you get, the
better you fit the role.'' His own age? ``I'm a year older than
whatever David Copperfield says he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson despises magic without a sense of drama: Las Vegas
lounge-act magic, ``which is sort of heading into 1963 as we
speak.'' He sympathizes with what he calls the thousands of lonely
souls doing magic on cruise ships, and advises, ``Never work
anywhere you can't send out a press release.''
</P>
<P>
   Any magician who quotes Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction
writer and visionary, is in the right business: Clarke, Robinson
reminds us, wrote that in a sufficiently advanced society,
technology becomes indistinguishable from magic.
</P>
<P>
   But Clarke has it backwards, Robinson contends: ``Magic becomes
indistinguishable from technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Robinson, who lives in Manhattan, introduced the first
of many Web sites, www.allmagic.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mouse,'' he said, ``became the magic wand.'' He said he
gets 1.5 million to 2 million hits a month on all his Web sites,
with half a million regular visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about the Web,'' he said, ``is everybody's got
the best seat in the house and nobody is allowed backstage.''
</P>
<P>
   His ``Ask Magic'' columns answer queries on subjects like
levitation, coin cleaning, card forcing and showmanship. To someone
asking how to get started, he suggested choosing a few classic
effects, like the multiplying billiard balls or linking rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classics,'' he wrote, ``tend to have a life of their
own,'' whether they are close-up effects like ``card in wallet''
and ``coin in bottle'' or illusions like ``the broomstick
suspension'' and ``the sword basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites are an audiovisual treat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing you want to do is disrupt the flow if it's
working,'' Robinson advised performers in www.talkaboutmagic.com,
warning against adding material too hastily.
</P>
<P>
   In another audio segment, he suggested integrating mentalism
into a good magic show; ESP acts have a bad reputation, he said,
because they have often relied too much on boring card tricks.
``You have to create the same kind of theater of surprise and
wonder that you aspire to with a traditional magic show,'' he said
of mind-reading.
</P>
<P>
   On www.magictheater.com, six short segments show Robinson and
colleagues performing. Knives change color, strings suddenly come
together, cards disappear and reappear, balls jump from cup to cup.
</P>
<P>
   On www.supermagic.com are tapes of Robinson doing four routines,
including tearing out a paper butterfly and making it fly and
making candles multiply behind a fan, in a mood reminiscent of a
haunted-house film.
</P>
<P>
   His www.allmagicreviews.com discusses new tricks, new equipment
and both classic and innovative magic books.
</P>
<P>
   For serious magicians, there are discussions of cards (``At no
point in time have I ever done more than one card trick in an
hour's performance,'' Robinson said), and techniques with hypnotic
names like ``the Asher twist,'' ``the Elmsley count'' and ``the
Hindu shuffle force.'' He has a dealers' guide, a searchable index
called www.allmagicfinder.com (looking up ``rabbit,'' one gets a
list of equipment for sale), and a calendar of magic shows and
conventions, including events by the Society of American Magicians
(www.magicsam.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he received a lot of criticism when he went
online, particularly over segments in which effects are explained.
Magicians thought he was giving their tricks away, even if the
tricks had been invented centuries earlier. ``First of all,'' he
said, ``they weren't their secrets to give away, and second of all
we do not do that. Almost everything on the site is new and
original magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Two themes stand out in Robinson's maze of URLs: His homage to
the great performers, and his emphasis on showmanship instead of
mere illusion. His favorite quote is from Jean Eugene
Robert-Houdin, the 19th-century French conjurer from whom Harry
Houdini took his name: ``A magician is an actor playing the part of
a great magician.''

POPULIST THEMES SET GORE APART FROM CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ After a spring of ever-shifting strategies and
messages, Vice President Al Gore has turned to more red-meat,
populist themes that appeal to the Democratic faithful.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gore criticized drug companies for the second time
in three days, accusing them of ``price gouging'' and putting
``millions of dollars'' into a ``phony'' group that ``is polluting
the public airwaves with special interest TV ads designed to
deceive the American people about a prescription drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week he crusaded against ``Big Oil,'' suggesting that high
fuel prices in the Midwest could be due to collusion. Before that
he portrayed himself as acting on behalf of economically pressed
Americans, ``not just the ones who think comfortably about their
savings over scotch in the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's populist appeals have allowed him to speak in a voice
distinct from President Clinton's, tying the vice president back to
his own record in Congress where, as a young lawmaker, he fought
excessive drug company profits. Four years ago, when he ran for
re-election, Clinton largely shied away from such pointed appeals
to class and attacks on the powerful when his advisers decided that
the election should be fought over values.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore faces challenges Clinton did not. Unlike Clinton in
1996, Gore has been lagging slightly behind his Republican opponent
in many recent polls, in part because Democrats are not rallying
behind him as enthusiastically as Republicans are supporting Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. And, on his left, Gore has to contend with
Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate running on the Green Party line.
Nader is drawing only about 5 percent in the polls, but some Gore
supporters fear that, in a tight race, even a small percentage
could hurt Gore in key states.
</P>
<P>
   So the vice president's advisers and Democratic supporters say
the themes now being sounded by the vice president serve several
purposes. For one, they are supposed to stoke the perception that
Bush, whose campaign has raised record sums, is the candidate of
the well off. ``He's taken $90 million in this campaign, which is
unprecedented, and time and again he took the side of the special
interests,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The tones also rally the Democratic faithful. Gore appeared
today before some of his party's staunchest supporters, a teachers
union gathering here in Philadelphia, and conference of the African
Methodist Episcopal Church in Cincinnati. The audience at the
American Federation of Teachers convention here often cheered as
Gore criticized the insurance industry and pledged to give all
children health insurance. And though aides say it is not Gore's
primary intent, the attack on corporate interests co-opts some of
Nader's own anti-corporate message.
</P>
<P>
   By portraying himself as a fighter for the common man against
big business, Gore also takes one of his vulnerabilities _ that he
can seem strident _ and tries to turn it into a plus. As he put it
several times this week, ``The question is whether you're for the
people or for the power.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk is one that Clinton strategists identified four years
ago when they argued that class-based appeals do not get a
Democratic candidate above 50 percent with the voters because they
start to turn off as many people as they rally.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's aides say that, despite his comment about scotch
drinkers at the club, he is more often taking on corporate
interests that the public distrusts than he is the well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   At his appearance here, for example, he said, ``We know our
opponents in this election are on the side of the powerful, not the
people, and they have powerful interests lined up against us _ from
the big oil companies to the HMOs to the polluters.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides say these themes will resonate with swing voters as
much as with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues are core Democratic issues,'' said Douglas
Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, ``but they appeal to voters across the
board,''
</P>
<P>
   And Bush is no longer criticizing Bush head-on, the way he did
in the spring when he spoke of Bush's ``risky'' tax scheme and
criticized every Bush proposal. Instead, he goes after certain
business interests that he then tries to link to either the
congressional Republicans, Bush or both.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his fire Wednesday was against Citizens for Better
Medicare, a group that, despite its name, was started by drug
manufacturers. It has spent more than $2 million in recent weeks on
television advertisements opposing the Democrats' plan for a
Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Citizens for Better Medicare that was distributed
on his campaign plane, Gore challenged the group's leaders to make
public its donor list and show who was behind it. ``The American
people deserve to know who exactly is trying to influence this
critical issue,'' he said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance before the teachers, Gore said the group
should be called Citizens for Bad Medicare, saying, ``That's what
they are promoting _ our opponent's plan, which tells seniors to go
beg the HMOs and the insurance companies with help with
prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was referring to the House Republicans' plan for a
prescription drug benefit, which broadly follows principles Bush
has set out. Their bill gives subsidies and incentives to insurance
companies to provide drug coverage to Medicare recipients. Gore has
a more expansive plan that would offer the benefits directly
through the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Zielinski, a spokesman for the group, said it was reviewing
Gore's letter to decide on a response. He said the coalition had
not disguised its drug company backing.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore was delivering his criticisms, Democratic officials
sought to demonstrate ties between the pharmaceutical industry and
Republicans. They said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media
consultant who helped produce the commercials for Citizens for
Better Medicare, also had ties to the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush, accused Gore of trying to
``divert attention away from his Washington, D.C.,
one-size-fits-all'' approach to providing a drug benefit directly
through the federal Medicare program. He also noted that three of
Gore's friends and advisers _ Peter Knight, Tom Downey and Anthony
Podesta _ were lobbyists for the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said that Castellanos' firm, National Media had no
role in making Bush's campaign advertisements. One Bush adviser
acknowledged that the company did buy media time for the Bush
campaign, but said that Castellanos was on the ``creative side'' of
the company and was not involved in buying time for the Bush
commercials.

PGA VS. MARTIN: THERE WILL BE NO WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd think the PGA Tour would have better things to do than
take up the valuable time of the U.S. Supreme Court in an attempt
to revoke Casey Martin's license to drive a golf cart while trying
to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
   Like count its money and enjoy the warm, fuzzy glow that's
engulfed the sport. After all, the next Jack Nicklaus has finally
arrived _ thank you very much, Tiger Woods _ the game is the
darling of corporate America, and charities of all kinds are
sharing the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, the tour's policy wonks dragged the high court
into a fight in which there will be no winners.
</P>
<P>
   This strident stance makes what's long been percieved as an
elitest sport seem even more so and casts the tour in the role of a
villain.
</P>
<P>
   If the court sides with Martin, as past courts have done, there
will be some who think he's on tour courtesy of the legal system,
forgetting the fact his game was good enough to get him through the
rugged qualifying process.
</P>
<P>
   No one was saying much about it all on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The tour filed its appeal, issued a written statement and
declined further comment. The fight really isn't over Martin but
the to to set and implement rules for its competitions, the tour
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Martin kept a low profile, too, and his agent could not be
reached for comment. Martin, who sued in 1997 for the right to
ride, has a circulatory disorder called Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber
Syndrome in his right leg. It's painful for him to walk long
distances, which is what professional competitive golf is certainly
about.
</P>
<P>
   His right to use a cart is an exception to the rules. But then
golf is a game in which just about every rule has an exception.
</P>
<P>
   So the tour might have been better off at this point doing
nothing. There is no huge outcry from his fellow touring pros, and
Martin's cart is not mucking the tournaments in which he's playing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the issue could be moot by year's end. Martin is
struggling this season and ranks 161st on the all important money
list. There is the real possibility he'll lose his card and be
forced to requalify, so who knows what could happen.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the tour should have taken a cue from the rules of
the game and played this issue as it lay.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: !bold!John McCook has been named head professional at
the upscale Lost Canyons Golf Club in Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   McCook, 29, is the former head pro at Ocean Trails in Palos
Verdes and also worked at Pelican Hill Golf Club in Newport Beach
and Bighorn Golf Club in Palm Desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole feeling you get out here is something I've never
experienced. You are secluded back here in these canyons all by
yourself,'' he said of the Pete Dye-designed complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Sky Course is scheduled to open in late October and the
Shadows Course by the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   An 11,000 square-foot clubhouse, including an 1,800 square-foot
pro shop, will be ready by the time the course opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of courses that don't build their clubhouse
for a couple of years, so it's nice to see that we're opening
everything at once,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 14 greens and 15 fairways of the Sky Course have been
seeded. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are on sale for the second annual Williams World
Challenge, featuring Tiger Woods and 11 of the world's other top
golfers. And prices for the 72-hole event are reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Gallery badges, good for the entire week, are $65. Gallery
passes can be purchased for individual days. They range in price
from $10 (Monday) up to $30 (Saturday and Sunday). The event runs
Nov. 27 to Dec. 3 at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   The winner pockets $1 million.

COMPUTER ASSOCIATES AND BMC LOWER EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of Computer Associates International and BMC
Software, two of the nation's largest business software companies,
plunged in heavy trading on Wednesday after the companies warned
that earnings in the quarter that ended on June 30 would be well
below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies said a slowdown in sales of software for
mainframe computers was their main problem as major customers
delayed purchases until IBM delivers its next generation of
mainframes later this year. Investors' assumptions that IBM would
have disappointing news when it announces its earnings on July 19
in turn jolted the computer giant's shares.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Associates, the dominant maker of utility software that
helps mainframe computers operate more efficiently and reliably,
finished the day at $29.25 in trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, down $21.875, or nearly 43 percent. BMC, which is
especially strong in data management software for mainframes, fell
by almost the same percentage in over-the-counter trading on the
Nasdaq, finishing at $21.3125, down $14.1875.
</P>
<P>
   International Business Machines, on volume more than twice its
average, lost about 6 percent to close at $103.75.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the outlook was unlikely to improve soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next quarter doesn't look very healthy, either,'' said Ray
Paquet, who analyzes mainframe computer markets for the Gartner
Group, a research company in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Associates, in Islandia, N.Y., issued its warning early
on Tuesday and held a conference call with analysts before trading
began on Wednesday. Sanjay Kumar, president and chief operating
officer at the company, said revenue from contracts would be
between $1.25 billion and $1.3 billion for the quarter, up only
slightly from $1.22 billion in the corresponding period a year
earlier. In addition to disappointing mainframe software orders,
Computer Associates had disappointing results in Europe that Kumar
pledged would lead to a management shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 20 analysts that follow the company for stock
brokerage firms did not immediately announce reductions in their
earnings estimates, according to First Call, which tracks such
figures. But the consensus of the handful of analysts who did was
that Computer Associates earned just 14 cents a share in the
quarter, down from a consensus estimate of 55 cents before the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   BMC, of Houston, gave much more explicit guidance when it issued
its warning on Wednesday morning. When it reports on July 25, BMC
said, revenue is likely to be between $365 million and $375
million; net earnings, $47 million and $51 million; and diluted
earnings, 18 cents to 21 cents a share, down at least 50 percent
from the 42 cents a share it reported a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which as recently as May said that the mainframe market
appeared to be rebounding, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said there was no single factor behind the weakness in
the mainframe market. Paquet, among others, said that part of the
slowdown probably resulted from computer users redeploying
mainframes and software they had bought to help with testing for
Year 2000 computer problems. As much as 35 percent of mainframe
sales in the latter part of 1999 may have been for such
preparedness, analysts say, and most of those purchases were
accompanied by software sales so that the testing could mimic
actual conditions. Now, a substantial part of that computing power
is being put to work to support e-commerce and other applications.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor may be the growing capacities of other platforms,
like Unix and Windows NT systems. Some users may be balking at
Computer Associates' pricing policies, which make it harder for IBM
mainframe users to add capacity and new applications than for Unix
users, said Peter Burris, an analyst at the META Group in Stamford,
Conn. Last April, META cut its forecasts for growth in mainframe
capacity in half.
</P>
<P>
   Paquet said that Gartner clients reported in March that both
Computer Associates and BMC were pressing them to complete deals so
they could meet Wall Street's growth expectations for the fourth
quarter of their fiscal year. By moving sales that would otherwise
have fallen in the first quarter of the current fiscal year
forward, the companies set the stage for a tougher three months in
the quarter that just ended.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are also digesting major acquisitions. Analysts
said the poor quarter could also be a sign of trouble on that
front.

 &HT;    Government says they were outgunned at Mount Carmel

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ An agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms testified Wednesday that he heard automatic gunfire as
soon as he stepped out of a cattle trailer at Mount Carmel on Feb.
28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first gunfire I heard was fully automatic,'' agent Sam
Cohen testified. ``I thought we were in a real bad situation
because we didn't have any with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidians' $675 million wrongful-death lawsuit
against the government resumed Wednesday after a break for the July
4th holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF only had rifles that could fire two-round bursts,
several agents testified.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Gerald Petrilli told U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith
Jr. and a five-member advisory jury of being tracked by an
automatic rifle as he tried moving along a fence. Other agents
eventually asked him to quit moving, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drawing so much gunfire, some of which was impacting
around them,'' Petrilli said.
</P>
<P>
   Government co-counsel Michael Bradford showed a videotape to
display the firepower of an AK-47 automatic rifle. It reduced a
cinder block to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Caddell, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, questioned the
extent of the automatic gunfire at Mount Carmel, however. He showed
Petrilli a photograph taken during the raid of the fence that he
hid behind. It appeared to have a brick base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can agree that it has holes in it, but it's not
demolished, is it?'' Caddell asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir, not at all,'' Petrilli said.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Ken Latimer, now retired, testified that he saw clear
evidence of the Davidian firepower. He described the shot that
killed agent Robert Williams as powerful enough to plow through his
helmet and leave ``residue'' coming out of the back.
</P>
<P>
   Four ATF agents and five Davidians died during the attempted
raid.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen testified that he, too, saw Williams shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, 'He still hasn't moved. God I wish he would
move,''' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ATF agents described the gunfire that greeted them at Mount
Carmel as ``massive'' and ``amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, there was sporadic shooting,'' Petrilli testified.
``Then the entire front of the compound erupted in gunfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who said the amount of gunfire was ``amazing,''
testified, ``The wood was just flying off the walls as the rounds
came through them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another agent, Gary Orchowski, testified he heard a ``massive''
amount of gunfire after taking a few steps out of one of the cattle
trailers that carried the ATF agents to the front of Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way I could describe it is being in a hail storm
inside a building with a tin roof,'' Orchowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, however, all but accused some ATF agents of changing
their stories over the years.
</P>
<P>
   He gave Orchowski a transcript of his 1993 interview with the
Texas Rangers. Orchowski said then he thought the first shots came
from agents shooting the dogs at Mount Carmel, and he didn't
realize that he was under fire until almost reaching his designated
position at an underground bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's quite a different story, isn't it?'' Caddell asked.
</P>
<P>
   Several agents who testified Wednesday were wounded during the
shoot-out. Petrilli was wounded in the arms and the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Petrilli said he had 47 entry wounds in his arms, blaming them
on being hit by a grenade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared to be shrapnel,'' Petrilli told government
attorney Steve Yarosh. ``... Many of them (fragments) were removed
from my arms. Many of them are still in my arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, however, suggested that Petrilli might have been the
victim of friendly fire _ specifically by the ATF team assigned to
take out the Davidians' dogs. The team carried shotguns. Caddell
brought up Petrilli's testimony from the 1994 criminal trial of 11
Branch Davidians, when Petrilli said he was hit in the arms by
either an explosive device or a shotgun round.
</P>
<P>
   Petrilli, however, insisted that the shrapnel was irregularly
shaped, which he said was not typical of shotgun pellets.
</P>
<P>
   A man staying at Mount Carmel in 1993 testified that David
Koresh began readying the Davidians for a showdown with the
government months before the ATF raid.
</P>
<P>
   Don Bunds, a California engineer, said Koresh had him do part of
the work necessary to convert AR-15 rifles from semi-automatic to
automatic. Bunds, in a written deposition read to the court, said
he worked on about 90 rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs attorney Cynthia Chapman, however, countered by
having testimony read where Bunds said that he only saw enough
parts to make one automatic AR-15.
</P>
<P>
   Bunds testified that Koresh became militant in the months before
the ATF raid, equating the federal government with Babylon or ``the
enemy,'' and talked about a showdown between the Davidians and the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought this was an inevitable thing,'' Bunds said.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare, Koresh had men pour concrete two feet high into the
walls of Mount Carmel and asked him about the possibility of using
toy airplanes as weapons, Bunds testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to fly them into oncoming tanks and destroy them,''
said Bunds, a one-time pilot. ``He wanted to put a bomb in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunds said he told Koresh the planes were too hard to control to
serve that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman pointed out several contradictions in Bunds' testimony.
For example, Bunds, in one part of his deposition, said Koresh
considered ``the Beast'' to be the Roman Catholic Church and not
the government. He also said that Koresh never talked about the
world ending.
</P>
<P>
   ATF agents continued to maintain Wednesday they weren't
expecting a shootout when they arrived at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Yarosh asked Petrilli about the Mighty Men, the Branch Davidians
chosen to guard the secret of Koresh's many wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the male leaders so to speak of the Branch
Davidians,'' Petrilli said. ``We thought they would probably resist
us physically with fisticuffs when we came in.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, however, asked former agent Latimer if he had
previously received training from special forces' medics on
treating ``sucking'' chest wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since I was in the military,'' Latimer said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The California state prison system, which led the
huge national prison-building boom for years, has recorded the
first decline in its inmate population in more than two decades,
according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
   The drop, although tiny, has already caused some officials to
say that it is time for California to temporarily halt a prison
buildup that inspired spending in other states across the country,
and had a big effect on the state budget. At one point, in the
mid-1990s, California began spending more on prisons than for its
giant university system.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, California has spent $5.6 billion on prison
construction and, with increasingly tough laws for repeat
offenders, has had little trouble filling the new cells. ``But now
there are several prisons we aren't building,'' said C.A. Terhune,
the director of the Department of Corrections, on Wednesday.
``Frankly, it's a lot of money that the governor and the
Legislature can use for other social problems. We're still going to
need prisons, but at a much lower rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's prison population of 161,401 in late June was 360
fewer inmates than in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense, 360 is a drop in the bucket,'' said Franklin
Zimring, an expert on prisons and a professor of law at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``The big news is that the
bucket didn't get any bigger this year. It's not the decline, it's
the absence of an advance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very good news, which we haven't seen nationally,''
Zimring added. ``Now, the question is to what extent is California
serving as a leading indicator for the rest of the country?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the largest states, at least, California seems to be the
only one actually experiencing a decline in the prison population,
according to officials around the country. Nationally, the prison
population continues to grow, although the rate has slowed over the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, which has the nation's second-largest prison
population, the number of inmates increased by 2.9 percent, to
150,359, from June 1999 to last month, officials there said. This
rate of increase was greater than it was the year before, but
significantly less than the 5 percent increase in the state's
prison population from June 1996 to June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which has the third-largest prison population, had a
3.8 percent increase from June 1999 to last month, state officials
there said. The state's total prison population is 71,233. It
increased by just 0.6 percent from June 1996 to June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Between June 1999 and last month, New York state experienced a
0.5 percent increase in its inmate population, bringing its total
to 71,021. The rate of growth was down significantly from the 1.7
percent increase in 1997. From 1997 to 1998, there was a 0.3
percent decrease in the state's prison population, then it rose the
next year with a 2 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to New York, James B. Flateau, spokesman for the New
York State Department of Correctional Services, said, ``The violent
population is still increasing, but the nonviolent population is
not. And any growth is attributable to violent offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Terhune said the growth of the prison population in California
has been steadily slowing over the last three years. Between 1980
and 1989, the prison population grew by 14.5 percent a year. In the
1990s, the growth slowed to an average of 6.3 percent a year.
Terhune said it was still unclear whether the decline represents a
long-term trend or simply a short-term dip.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm happy about it,'' he said. ``Growth was up to nearly
12,0000 a year. Considering what growth was, this is significant.''
He speculated that several factors played a role in the decline,
including a decrease in new inmates sentenced by courts, fewer
parole violators returned with new terms and a slowdown in the rate
of parole violators returned to custody.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in California also said they were increasingly turning
to alternatives to prison, such as drug rehabilitation programs and
additional parole.
</P>
<P>
   Zimring said the declines should have occurred years ago to
match the decline in the crime rate, which has been falling in
California since the early 1990s. ``The prison admission numbers
have finally caught up with the trends in crime,'' he said. ``This
is a state that has become almost addicted to massive increases in
punishment, and now it appears it has taken a vacation from that
attitude.'' Several large cities in other states have also reported
decreases in crime in recent years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   California is still going ahead with plans to build a $335
million, 5,000 bed high-security prison in the town of Delano. But
it will be the last for several years, Terhune said, adding, ``We
can go five years without having to go to the Legislature for
additional construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Braz, a defense lawyer in Oakland and the program director
for Critical Resistance, a group that monitors prisons and criminal
justice issues, said the state's new numbers were evidence that the
Delano prison was not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us hope,'' Braz said. ``The race to incarcerate may
finally be slowing down. Maybe people are really starting to
question the reliance on incarceration as the answer to
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But other states, such as Virginia, have experienced declines
one year only to see increases the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``California, as in so many things, is the leader in the nation,
both in things good and bad,'' said Alfred Blumstein, a professor
of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ``The
drop in California is so small that it might just be noise, but it
could also be an indication that finally we're seeing the first
dove after the flood.''

IBM PLANS A TOUGH PROBLEM FOR BLUE GENE'S MILLION PROCESSORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By ROBERT HERCZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last December, IBM announced a five-year, $100 million program
to build the world's most powerful supercomputer. The cascade of
impressive figures _ the machine will house a million processors,
perform a thousand trillion calculations per second and move a
whole Internet's worth of data every second _ hardly raised an
eyebrow among supercomputing researchers. What did arouse interest,
and a little skepticism, was the announcement that the computer,
named Blue Gene, would try to simulate the folding of proteins, a
problem that may not be the best match for the new machine's
design.
</P>
<P>
   Although the machine was correctly labeled ``radical'' in press
releases (for example, you could jump into the middle of the
computer with a chain saw and start cutting cables, and it would
not stop running), computer experts have no doubt that IBM will
succeed in building it. But they do wonder whether proteins that
are large enough to be interesting will prove to be more than Blue
Gene can handle.
</P>
<P>
   Every protein is made up of amino acids _ up to a thousand or so
_ and the forces among their atoms determine the way each protein
will coil, curl or twist, then bend into its three-dimensional
shape. That shape makes the protein function, whether it is an
enzyme, a hormone or an antibody or gives structure to things like
skin or bone.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to model the physical forces involved in the folding
process would help scientists understand what goes wrong when
folding goes awry, as in Alzheimer's or mad cow disease, and would
aid in drug design.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, proteins fold in a fraction of a second, but
they do not have to do the math. ``In silico'' biology takes
longer. To analyze the folding of a protein, the computer has to
analyze the interactions among its thousands of atoms. Even at a
quadrillion calculations a second, it will take Blue Gene a year of
nonstop computations to simulate the folding of a single
average-size protein.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious way to make a computer more powerful is to add
processing units (the hardware that does the actual computation).
Today's fastest supercomputers have anywhere from a few dozen to
just under 10,000 processors running in parallel, which means that
they all work on pieces of the same problem at the same time. Blue
Gene, with a million processors, will raise the bar enormously.
</P>
<P>
   It does not matter how many processors you have if they're idle
much of the time, waiting for data to arrive from memory chips. IBM
is solving that problem with a ``processor in memory,'' or PIM,
design: Memory will be on the same chip as the processor, just a
millimeter or two away.
</P>
<P>
   The PIM design simplifies the machine considerably. ``This
machine has only one part in it, which I think is really remarkable
_ just one chip replicated 40,000 times,'' said Dr. Monty Denneau,
Blue Gene's chief architect. (There will be 25 or more processors
per chip.)
</P>
<P>
   IBM says the computer will be ``self healing.'' When a processor
fails (and with a million processors, one will fail every three or
four days) the computer will not stop. It will only slow down ever
so slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The million processors in Blue Gene will, in theory, meet
International Business Machines' performance target of one petaflop
(a thousand trillion floating-point operations per second). But Dr.
Ken Kennedy, a computer science professor at Rice University,
asked, ``Will it be a usable petaflop?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends on whether all those processors can be kept
busy. Not all tasks, even those that require untold trillions of
calculations, are supercomputer material.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can think of a massively parallel machine as a filing
cabinet with lots and lots of little drawers,'' said Dr. Bernard
Brooks, an expert on molecular simulations at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. ``If your problem is a
watermelon, you're going to have trouble. Some problems are more
amenable to being divvied up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a very small amount of sequential processing can create an
enormous bottleneck in a parallel system, according to Amdahl's
Law, a dictum devised in 1967 by Dr. Gene M. Amdahl, then an IBM
engineer. If Blue Gene has to work like a traditional serial
computer for just one second out of 10,000, it will be only 1
percent as efficient as it would otherwise be.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Brooks is worried that the speed at which data can
be moved around Blue Gene will not be able to keep pace with the
processors' demand for information. ``The communication speeds are
very good, but the processor speeds are even better, and it's the
ratio that counts,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Denneau acknowledges that there could be problems. ``There is no
guarantee of success,'' he said. ``This is a science project, not
just an engineering thing. The only way to find out is to build
this machine.''
</P>
<P>
   But computationally speaking, protein folding is relatively
simple. You want a real challenge? ``Light a candle and watch how
the smoke comes up,'' Denneau said. ``Try to model that correctly.
Modeling turbulence is incredibly difficult _ people just don't do
it.'' Having a petaflop at his command, he added, is just the
beginning. ``We could soak up another factor of a thousand,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that you might as well add the word for a thousand
petaflops _ an exaflop _ to your vocabulary right now. You'll be
seeing it soon enough.

TEACHERS REJECT LINKING JOB PERFORMANCE TO BONUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIRK JOHNSON c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Breaking with its leadership, the nation's largest
teachers' union on Wednesday soundly rejected the use of job
performance evaluations in paying bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the National Education Association convention,
meeting in Chicago this week, scrapped the performance proposal
after many rank-and-file members voiced concerns that it was unfair
to teachers and to the children who most need excellent teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If teachers compete for bonuses,'' said Barbara Kerr, a
delegate from California, ``who will want to teach the poor
students? The students who don't speak English well?''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the union, which represents 2.5 million members and
two-thirds of the nation's teachers, said many local unions have
already negotiated such job performance contracts. Under the union
plan, such performance evaluations would not rely on student scores
on standardized tests, and would be implemented only with the
guidance of teachers themselves. As an example, supporters of the
proposal said a district might pay bonuses to teachers who speak
two languages or who complete technological training.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dedman of Kentucky spoke in support of endorsing the option
for local unions to negotiate for job performance bonuses, if that
is what they desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the right to dictate'' to union locals, Dedman
said. ``I trust our members to do what is right. Let's give our
members the flexibility they need.''
</P>
<P>
   The job performance issue is also being studied by the nation's
other large teachers' union, the American Federation of Teachers,
which is holding its national convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers' unions, including those in Denver and Columbus,
Ohio, have already entered into agreements with school districts
that give teachers bonuses if certain goals are met.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of such cash incentives has become popular as business
leaders and politicians have called for higher standards in primary
education. Both expected presidential nominees, Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas and Vice President Al Gore, have proposed some shift
toward performance incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the debate in Chicago said they sought to increase
teachers' salaries overall, noting that starting teachers in
1998-1999 earned an average of less than $27,000 a year, far less,
they said, than recent college graduates with similar credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the job performance proposal said that school
districts would use the issue to lower overall salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to send a message to state legislatures and school
boards that we are willing to negotiate pay for performance?''
asked Robin Holcombe of New Jersey, adding, ``Bonus pay, merit pay
and pay for performance are all the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, the union president who supported the job performance
option, said he did not take the vote as a rebuke of union
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had union leaders on both sides, and we knew it would be
close,'' Mr. Chase said. ``But this was an issue that needed to be
debated. And I don't think it's an issue that's going to go away
anytime soon.''

Cooper's decision shows selfishness
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper wants you to know one thing. She is not
disgruntled.
</P>
<P>
   Angry, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Stifled, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   But not disgruntled.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after rocking the WNBA's world with the news of her
planned retirement at the end of this season, Cooper did more
change of direction than in a month of cross-over dribbles.
</P>
<P>
   She looked innocent. She looked incensed. She was contrite. She
was confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why my announcement was portrayed as
something negative,'' Cooper said. ``Yes, I'm unhappy with the way
my role has changed on the team. But that is entirely separate from
my retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   And pigs can fly.
</P>
<P>
   The trail leading to this point had been easier to follow than
powdered sugar down the chin of a fat man eating doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   From the day the Comets reported to training camp and Van
Chancellor's coaching staff began to implement minor changes in the
offense, Cooper has been a ticking bomb ready to go off.
</P>
<P>
   What she didn't understand was how after three championship
seasons, the Comets would dare take the ball out of her hands, even
the slightest bit, in order to get more scoring opportunities for
Sheryl Swoopes, Tina Thompson and Janeth Arcain.
</P>
<P>
   What she doesn't understand after 14-plus professional seasons,
evidently, is the game. Any team _ even the best one _ that stays
constant will fall behind. And the way to improve is to assemble
more weapons, give yourself more options.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes that have brought Thompson and Arcain more into
the focus of the attack have produced a WNBA-leading 15-2 record
and observations from a number of neutral observers that the Comets
are now a better all-around team than in their previous
incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes also have resulted in Cooper's scoring average
dropping from 22 points a game to 18.1 this year. Thus, the
full-court pout.
</P>
<P>
   She has carped, complained and whined about her plight virtually
from the season opener, never shy to let it be known that this is
not how the most decorated player in the toddling league's history
should be treated. As the second-leading scorer on her team.
</P>
<P>
   We know she can be the best player. This is about being the best
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly a student of the game, is it possible she just forgot
the individual sacrifice made by Clyde Drexler to help win the
Rockets' second title in 1995? Or that her idol, Michael Jordan,
didn't begin winning championships until he learned to give up the
ball to the likes of John Paxson and Steve Kerr?
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has practiced and played hard. That is to her credit. She
also has caused a smoldering air of uncertainty to pervade the
Comets' season. That is not.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. Cooper has unquestionably been the best player
in the WNBA from Day 1 _ though that may now be Swoopes _ and has
deservingly come home to the U.S. after 11 seasons of playing in
relative obscurity abroad to raise the level of awareness about
women's sports.
</P>
<P>
   Female athletes can be driven, assertive, commanding _ thought
to be solely male attributes at one time in the Dark Ages _ and the
best ones can carry their teams on their backs with the
determination and unrelenting competitive fire of a Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cooper shows us there are a few other words that are hardly
gender exclusive: Egotistical. Petulant. Dumb.
</P>
<P>
   None of us can climb inside Cooper's head and figure out why she
chose this time to drop her bombshell and turn the calm waters of
another Comets season into a scene from The Perfect Storm.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she was counting on an outpouring of sympathy to win her
points in the court of public opinion. Maybe she figured it was a
dramatic way to strong-arm a few extra shots per game out of
Chancellor's offense down the stretch run and into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Cooper was just throwing everything against the wall,
looking to see what might stick, and she didn't like the smell of
the early returns on the radio call-in shows and the streets. There
is the possibility the initial backlash to her statement could have
put some high-dollar business deals in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   So Cooper responded in the manner of so many male athletes
before her. By blaming the media. For misquoting her. For taking
her out of context. For not understanding. For ruining her Fourth
of July holiday.
</P>
<P>
   As Channel 13 cameraman Buzz Webb noted, you have to respect the
sanctity of any holiday that is celebrated with beer and
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper lit her own fuse. Now the Comets deal with the powder
burns.
</P>

MEXICO'S NEW LEADER WARNS DRUG SMUGGLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Minutes after Mexicans learned they had elected
Vicente Fox Quesada as president, they watched him glare into the
cameras in his first nationally broadcast interview and issue a
sober warning to drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the criminals, those who commit violence and live outside
the law, they should know the one thing we don't want in Mexico is
criminality, violence, drug trafficking, organized crime,'' Fox
said Sunday evening after Mexico's presidential balloting. ``To
them I say, this is the last call.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days since, Fox has vowed that fighting organized crime
will be one of his priorities, and he has outlined plans to
overhaul Mexico's federal law enforcement institutions. His
proposals would require several constitutional amendments, and,
experts said, they suggest that he intends to bring the power of
the presidency to bear in the fight against crime more than his
recent predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has pledged to tear down much of the tottering edifice of
corrupt police forces and special prosecutors' offices that
constitute Mexico's federal law enforcement system. Command of
various parts of this bureaucracy is splintered among the attorney
general, the Interior Ministry and the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The president-elect is not the first Mexican leader to announce
grand plans for ending corruption. But none of the others have
offered plans quite this ambitious, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox's plans have to be sweeping because the process of rot and
decomposition has advanced so far,'' said Ernesto Lopez Portillo, a
consultant to the Mexican Senate and one of the authors of a 1994
study of Mexico's criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say the corruption of the police and prosecutors
traces back at least to the 19th century. But in recent decades,
graft has worsened as control over the police has been shifted,
from scandal to scandal, between the Interior Ministry and the
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Under Fox's proposals, the attorney general, who commands the
federal police and oversees prosecutors, would be eliminated
completely, and the interior minister would be stripped of police
functions, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the federal police would pass to a new cabinet-level
Department of Public Security, and the work of thousands of federal
prosecutors would be administered by a new, as-yet-unnamed agency.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are aimed at reducing the police corruption that
grew dangerously in the 1970s, when Mexico faced several small
guerrilla insurgencies. Successive presidents gave the federal
police, especially an elite corps known as the Federal Security
Directorate, license to wipe out the subversives using whatever
means necessary.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1980s, the guerrillas had been suppressed. But the
Security Directorate, Mexico's political police, had acquired an
array of extralegal skills they began to use in the service of drug
traffickers. After agents of the Security Directorate, which was
controlled by the Interior Ministry, were discovered to be involved
in the 1985 murder of an U.S. drug agent, that agency was
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari opened his presidency in
1989 with two spectacular police operations, which brought the
arrest of a top trafficker and a corrupt oil union leader. But the
drug mafias nonetheless proliferated.
</P>
<P>
   The narcotics corruption continued under President Ernesto
Zedillo. Various anti-drug agencies working for the attorney
general's office have been abolished or restructured, and corrupted
again in a cycle repeated several times during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   If the governing party has had little success in fighting
organized crime, Fox's National Action Party has done no better.
Through much of the last decade, National Action governors
controlled the states of Baja California and Chihuahua, and the
narcotics violence only increased in both states, which are major
staging areas for smugglers moving drugs across the border. Fox
himself has little direct experience in combating organized crime
because Guanajuato, the state he governed, lies outside the major
drug corridors.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal for a new Department of Public Security would lodge
Mexico's federal police in a new agency, independent of both the
attorney general's office and the Interior Ministry. The aim is to
create a well-paid, modern and apolitical police force.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a agency to oversee the work of thousands of
federal prosecutors would strip away the other half of the attorney
general's duties. The new agency would seek to improve prosecutors'
abilities to gather evidence. Currently, more emphasis is often
placed on gathering intelligence on traffickers than on assembling
court-worthy cases, aides to Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's proposals will require the backing of large majorities in
both houses of Congress in order to enact several constitutional
amendments after he takes office Dec. 1.

VERIZON READY TO SWALLOW GTE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, CALIF. _ GTE is joining the ranks of Times-Mirror
and Home Savings: Major companies merged out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, GTE is no longer. In its place is Verizon, the
company created from its merger with Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has its California headquarters in Thousand
Oaks, has 16,500 employees and 3.4 million customers in California.
</P>
<P>
   The $59 billion merger between the two companies became official
Friday, creating the eighth-largest company in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies' wireless divisions already have been involved
in a joint venture with Vodafone Airtouch called Verizon Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at it as a transformational moment. The company
is literally being transformed,'' said Verizon spokeswoman Julia
Wilson. ``We will be one of the largest telecommunications
companies in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined company's new management will introduce itself to
California employees today when CEO Ivan Seidenberg visits three
Verizon sites: The Thousand Oaks regional headquarters, the Santa
Monica call center and the Long Beach operator services megacenter.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon has 1,200 employees based in Thousand Oaks, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the combined company will serve about one-third of the
households in the United States. In addition to local telephone
service, Verizon offers Internet service and is trying to become
designated as a long-distance carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said it is unlikely there will be any mass layoffs
resulting from the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mergers always bring change,'' she said. ``Everybody's kind of
nervous about what changes might occur, but that's part of any
merger situation.''

FUNGUS CONSIDERED AS A TOOL TO KILL COCA IN COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under pressure from the United States, Colombia has reluctantly
agreed to take the first step toward developing a powerful
biological herbicide against the coca and heroin-poppy fields that
are spreading almost unchecked across its countryside, Colombian
and U.S. officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For years, U.S. officials have been quietly debating ways to
conduct field tests of such an herbicide, developed from a fungus
that occurs naturally in many types of coca and other plants.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Colombian officials say they are completing a proposal to
the United Nations that would include testing for the presence of
the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum, in coca, the raw material of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   If the fungus is found in Colombian varieties of coca, Colombian
scientists would go on to evaluate its effectiveness, safety and
environmental impact as an herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is a program of research _ and only research _ on
the use of biological controls against these crops,'' the Colombian
environment minister, Juan Mayr, said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian government's uneasy support for the project comes
as President Clinton is about to sign a bill providing $1.3 billion
in aid to Colombia to fight drug traffickers and the insurgents who
protect their trade.
</P>
<P>
   Some powerful Republican in Congress told Colombian officials
that they were supporting the spending on the expectation that that
Colombia would agree to explore the use of Fusarium fungus in its
coca fields.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Clinton administration, officials said, the testing
of fungal herbicides was also pushed by the White House drug policy
adviser, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, and by officials of the U.S.
Southern Command, which is overseeing the U.S. overhaul of
Colombia's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and other activists in both countries are
raising a din of objections to any field tests of the fungus,
arguing that it is virtually a biological weapon _ one that might
upset Colombia's ecology or endanger farmers, animals and food
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, similar complaints by environmentalists in Florida
prompted state officials there to put aside plans to test a variant
of Fusarium for possible use against marijuana fields.
</P>
<P>
   Several plant pathologists who have studied the fungus
extensively said there was relatively little scientific basis for
the assertions about its danger. They acknowledged that a great
deal of testing still needed to be done, but they added that the
most significant unanswered questions might have less to do with
the safety of the fungus than with its effectiveness and cost.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If they're looking at local strains of the fungus, then I
can't see something scientifically dangerous about it,'' said Dr.
Jonathan Gressel, a professor of plant sciences at the Weizmann
Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. ``What you're doing is
taking a disease that is already present and putting on more of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But they'll be lucky if it works,'' Gressel added. ``Because
typically this inundative strategy isn't good enough in commercial
agriculture, and I'm sure the narcos have been planning ahead.
They'll probably go to fungicides or breed their coca to be
resistant to the fungus. It's relatively easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns about Fusarium's proposed use as a mycoherbicide,
or fungal herbicide, have been heightened by the shadowy history of
research into its impact on drug crops. Indeed, the proposed
Colombian study comes after years of often secret investigation by
scientists in the United States and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Fusarium, a naturally occurring fungus with
variants that can cause wilt in everything from tomatoes and grain
to marijuana, was first identified as a possible weapon in the drug
fight by CIA scientists in the early 1980s. The U.S. Agriculture
Department began more extensive research into the use of the fungus
on coca in 1988, and it continued, mostly in secret, for nearly a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   At roughly the same time, Soviet biological weapons scientists
at the Institute of Plant Genetics in Uzbekistan were working to
develop Fusarium fungus, plant bacteria and other pathogens to
destroy opium poppies _ and perhaps enable Moscow to limit the
world's morphine supply or undermine the opium-dependent economy of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States
continued to pay for research at the laboratory as part of an
effort to keep its impoverished scientists from joining the
biological weapons programs of countries like Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same research now continues under the auspices of
the United Nations Drug Control Program, with has quietly supported
the use of biological controls against drug crops since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened in the past, the work has to be redone now
in an open environment,'' said Eric Rosenquist, one of the
officials who has worked longest on the fungus. ``Only then can you
debate it on its merits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as some horrible thing that's going to mutate
and kill people _ that's science fiction,'' added Rosenquist, a
program leader for international programs at the Agriculture
Department's Research Service in Beltsville, Md. ``But you have to
demonstrate that it is going to be effective, and that hasn't been
done yet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rosenquist and other officials noted that a natural epidemic of
Fusarium in Peru, beginning in the mid-1980s, had only a limited
effect on the cultivation of coca there. By comparison, Colombian
coca growers have been considerably more sophisticated about the
science of their work.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of fusarium fungus as an herbicide is that its
strains have generally been found to attack only a single type of
plant, entering the roots and strangling the vascular system while
leaving other species untouched. The fungus can live on in the soil
for many years, moving from one coca plant to another.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of fungal herbicides say they may prove to be much
less damaging to the environment than chemical herbicides that are
now typically used to fumigate drug fields.
</P>
<P>
   Similar biological controls are increasingly being used to kill
weeds, noted Dr. David C. Sands, a plant pathologist who has led
much of the research on fusarium's potential use against coca.
``The question is whether this is considered a noxious plant,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sands, a plant pathologist at Montana State University, worked
almost single-handedly to revive congressional interest in
mycoherbicides after the Department of Agriculture began to phase
out its support for the fusarium research in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He also holds a patent on what officials say would be the likely
method for dispersing the fungus if it were ever used on coca or
opium poppies. The design involves dropping fusarium-coated seeds
from planes flying over coca fields, at higher altitudes than the
crop-dusting planes and helicopter that are routinely attacked by
drug producers and guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   For some years, lawyers at the White House and the State
Department debated whether it was possible to use the fungal
herbicide on drug crops without violating the international
conventions against the spread of biological weapons. It was
determined that the law would not be violated if a foreign country
made its own decision to use or test the fungus, but that has not
satisfied all U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support using a product on a bunch of Colombian
peasants that you wouldn't use against a bunch of rednecks growing
marijuana in Kentucky,'' said one United States intelligence
official. ``And there is definitely less-than-unanimous support for
this in Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayr, the Colombian environment minister, said he had flatly
rejected the first proposal for a mycoherbicide research plan that
was sent to him in late April by the U.N. Drug Control Program.
According to a summary of the plan, it stipulated that ``The
government of Colombia has agreed, in principle, to experimental
field trials being conducted in that country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayr and two other senior Colombian officials said their
counterproposal will propose to test only fungal herbicides that
already exist in Colombia. ``If Fusarium is not there, we won't
study it,'' he said. But they agreed to look at various types of
biological controls against coca, including predatory insects.
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.N. drug-control director in Bogota, Klaus Nyholm, and
the U.S. assistant secretary of state for international narcotics
and law enforcement affairs, R. Rand Beers, suggested they would
support the new Colombian plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an idea that ought to be investigated,'' Beers said of
the fungus' potential as a herbicide. ``It should not be
implemented until the science is clear. But if it is, then it
should be considered a tool.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, have agreed to meet at Camp David
next week for a summit conference intended to help them frame the
peace agreement they hope to reach by September, President Clinton
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the two leaders would face the ``most profound
questions,'' and that success was not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton extended his invitations by telephone on Monday for an
opening session July 11. He said that because teams of Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators had been at an impasse for the last month,
he had been left with no choice but to ask the two leaders to meet
and take on the most difficult decisions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're willing to give it their best shot,'' Clinton said in
the press room at the White House. ``And they understand too that
as we have already seen, delay tends to make these things worse,
not better.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his optimism, Clinton and his advisers refrained
Wednesday from even listing the major issues the two leaders will
tackle: the future status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian
refugees and the territorial shape of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak, faced with a fragile political coalition in his
government, the summit meeting fulfills a strategy he has been
urging on Clinton for several weeks. In Paris recently, the Israeli
prime minister spoke confidently of such a meeting as an
``important moment'' in the history of Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations. He said he would seek ``separation from the
Palestinians and the establishment of good-neighborliness with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Abu Ala, the speaker of the Palestinian Legislature
and the senior Palestinian negotiator, contended that Clinton had
bent to Israeli pressure, and that he doubted that the summit
meeting would ``achieve any of its aims.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians had made clear they believed that the divisions
between the two sides were so great that more discussion was needed
at a lower level before convening the leaders. In Ramallah last
week, speaking with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at his
side, Arafat made it clear that he would go to a summit meeting if
invited, but reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, a successful outcome would cap his foreign policy
achievements, giving him several accomplishments in the Middle
East. He has overseen a series of Israeli-Palestinian agreements
starting with a handshake between Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin, the
late Israeli prime minister, on the White House lawn in September
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's senior foreign policy aides, including Albright and
his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, met at Camp David on
Monday and decided that it was ``now or never,'' a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded, the official said, that little was to be gained
by waiting and that by sequestering the two leaders in the relaxed
atmosphere of Camp David, a positive outcome was not out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy influence on the decision on Monday, according to the
senior official, was the date of Sept. 13. Arafat's Palestinian
Central Council reaffirmed a few days ago that he would
unilaterally declare a Palestinian state on that day if a peace
agreement was not reached by then.
</P>
<P>
   With that threat, which the administration knew would prompt
retaliation by the Israelis and annexation of settlements on the
West Bank, the risk of increasing violence was unacceptably high,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to slide into that period when things begin to
unravel in anticipation,'' he said, alluding to Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Arafat's threat to declare a Palestinian state and the
emerging image of his being almost dragged to the summit,
administration officials said they believed that the Palestinian
leader preferred to have a state recognized by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Unilaterally declaring a state on 40 percent of the West Bank
that has been handed over to the Palestinians so far would be a
``mixed bag'' for Arafat, the senior official said, adding, ``That
is a prescription for turmoil, and he understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has set no deadlines for the summit meeting
and has left open the possibility of a second stage.

<P>
   The two teams of negotiators are to arrive in Washington during
the weekend, followed on Monday night by Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to leave Washington for Okinawa, Japan, on July 19
for a summit meeting of the leading industrial nations, known as
the Group of 7. Russia will also attend, and the president is to
meet with its leader, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we would have some clarity before that,'' the official
said of July 19, but added, ``We will face that when and if we get
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking at the task at Camp David, Clinton said: ``We all
know what the deal is. We know what the issues are. We know at
least within a range what the options are. I think if we work hard,
we can get it done in several days, but I will give it whatever
time is required, as long as we're still moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement, a senior official said that by
mentioning ``the deal,'' Clinton was not referring to a specific
outcome but rather to the fact that the negotiators know the broad
outlines of the ``story.'' The talks are likely to take more than
the ``several days'' described by the president, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
   A series of leaks in Israeli newspapers, which were intended to
put pressure on Barak not to make significant concessions to the
Palestinians, outlined the shape of what a final agreement would
look like. The newspaper accounts were not definitively denied by
the Israeli government, and they conformed with accounts given by
diplomats from the region in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the accounts said the future of the Palestinian
refugees scattered across the Middle East could be settled by
financial support from the international community _ perhaps as
much as $100 billion over 20 years _ enabling them either to stay
where they are or to emigrate to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   They also said differences were beginning to be narrowed on the
size of the Palestinian state _ about 90 or 92 percent of the West
Bank _ with about 40,000 Israeli settlers having to be evacuated
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of Jerusalem remains the biggest sticking point,
the diplomats said. The Israeli accounts said Barak was
contemplating conceding Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem to
Palestinian control. The Palestinians would have a capital in
Jerusalem based outside the current municipal boundary in Abu Dis.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian negotiators and Arab diplomats have said that in
the Palestinian mind, Abu Dis is not part of Jerusalem and that
therefore the proposal is not sufficient. ``Jerusalem for every
Arab and every Muslim is the holy city _ it's not Abu Dis,'' one of
the diplomats said. ``It's the walled city, and this is where you
have to find a creative solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, the diplomats said, it is highly unlikely that Arafat
will sign an agreement that did not include a settlement on
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Camp David as the site for the summit meeting,
Clinton is investing about the highest prestige possible for the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   The first Camp David summit meeting, called in 1978 by President
Carter between President Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister
Menachem Begin of Israel, concluded a framework for a peace treaty
between the two nations as well as a broader framework for peace in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the setting originally came from Carter's wife,
Rosalyn, who thought that the wooded retreat would provide an
undisturbed atmosphere for the two leaders, who by July 1978 had
been deadlocked for months in their negotiations. After 12 days
that mixed high emotions with tedious detail work, the agreements
were reached.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reflected Wednesday on the difficult dynamics of summit
meetings. ``The objective is often overshadowed, I might say, as
all of you know, by the abject dreariness of the pursuit,'' he
said. ``The ups and downs of the process, the daily hassles and
disputes, the open-ended nature of the negotiations _ all of these
over time have blurred the vision of what it is we are trying to
achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky to Resign
</P>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, who heads a
Russian immigrant party, said at an immigrant rally here Wednesday
that he would tender his resignation from the government at
Sunday's Cabinet meeting, two days before the Camp David summit
meeting is to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky has been uncomfortable with Barak's peace moves, and
he made his announcement at a rally opposing territorial
concessions to the Palestinians. If Sharansky withdraws his
four-seat party, Barak will still retain a majority in parliament,
though a slim one.

EARLY PIONEER TO RUN FOR GOLD

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The thoroughbred industry could keep paying
for the ads that compare the joys of racehorse ownership to the
prestige, thrills and financial rewards of owning a sports
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it could simply hand out photos of a smiling David Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is better than a sports franchise,'' said Wilson, whose
gelding Early Pioneer has an upset chance to win Sunday's $1
million Hollywood Gold Cup at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson would know. The 52-year-old Laguna Beach resident, a
Toyota dealer in Orange County, was involved all too briefly with a
sports franchise, the Anaheim Piranhas of the Arena Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking he'd help to fill the pro football void left by the
Rams' departure from Orange County, Wilson started with a 10
percent stake in the Piranhas in 1996. ``It seemed like a
no-brainer,'' he said. ``And it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Forced to bail out undercapitalized partners as the team's arena
deal at the Pond proved unfavorable, Wilson was the Piranhas'
majority owner by the time they went belly-up in 1997 after two
seasons. The experience left him convinced he couldn't make money
in sports of the human species.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure you can make money with horses, either,'' Wilson
said from Lake Arrowhead, where he, his wife Holly and their two
children spent the Fourth of July. ``But I know you can control
your own destiny. . . . It's like a sports franchise, only without
everybody whining for a raise. All they (horses) want is oats.''
</P>
<P>
   A rodeo cowboy's son who grew up around quarterhorses in Iowa,
Wilson became a thoroughbred owner about six years ago and has 16
in trainer Vladimir Cerin's barn at Santa Anita. Wilson controls
his racetrack destiny by searching the Daily Racing Form for
prospects to claim.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, Wilson spotted Early Pioneer, a then-3-year-old
whose owners, John and Betty Mabee of San Diego, had dropped him
into claiming races following some disappointing stakes-level
efforts on turf. Early Pioneer was entered, with a $62,500 price
tag, in a Santa Anita sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (Wilson) I'd take him unless I saw something glaring,''
Cerin said, recalling his inspection of the horse in the saddling
paddock. ``I didn't _ until they took the wraps off and I saw these
enormous ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   It was too late: Cerin had already dropped the claim slip in the
box.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me on his cell phone,'' Wilson recalled. ``He said,
`Do you still have claiming insurance? I'm not sure he's going to
make (it through) the race.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Under the unforgiving laws of the track, if you claim a horse,
you own it as soon as the race is over, no matter the horse's
condition.
</P>
<P>
   But Early Pioneer's unsightly ankles turned out to be the result
of calcifications that don't affect his performance, Cerin said.
The gelding finished second that day _ and has gone on to bigger
things.
</P>
<P>
   After frustrating near-misses at high odds against California's
most powerful sprinters, Wilson and Cerin decided to try the son of
Rahy in longer races. The result: the strongest efforts of the
5-year-old's career, most notably a narrow victory at 26-1 odds
April 9 at Santa Anita in the San Bernardino Handicap, a 1 1/8-mile
race in which he took advantageof a 10-pound weight break from
third-place General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   With five wins in 18 starts since the claim, Early Pioneer has
earned more than $400,000 for Wilson and his wife. Second to Out of
Mind and Big Ten in the Mervyn LeRoy Handicap and the Californian
in his latest starts, the gelding will switch jockeys, from Matt
Garcia to Hollywood Park leader Victor Espinoza, for the 1-mile
Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   A Gold Cup victory would be the first in a Grade I race for the
horse and his owner, trainer and jockey. Forced to challenge
General Challenge again at level weights (124 pounds), Early
Pioneer will be a favorite only in the sentimental sense. With
Budroyale and River Keen sidelined, he's the rags-to-riches story
of the moment in the local older-horses division.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to a riches-to-rags story, which Wilson might have
become if he'd stayed in the professional sports business.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the money I put into that football team,'' Wilson said,
``I could have a lot more graded stakes winners.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Blueprint is likely to join the Hollywood Gold Cup
field, increasing it to nine horses, trainer Bob Hess Jr. said
after a 4-furlong workout in 49 seconds Wednesday morning. Bill
Bianco and David Shimmon, who purchased the Irish-bred from Queen
Elizabeth, must pay a $25,000 supplemental nominating fee. . .
General Challenge worked 5 furlongs in 1:00 3/5 Wednesday morning
at Santa Anita. He'd be the first horse since Affirmed in 1979 to
win the Santa Anita Handicap and the Gold Cup in the same year. . .
. The Gold Cup lineup will be set this morning. Others expected to
be entered: Big Ten, Cat Thief, Chester House, David, Outof Mind
and Pleasant Breeze.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``How many ballet companies today are headed by a
woman?'' Twyla Tharp asked over a bitter cup of coffee. The answer
is less than a handful (usually abroad), and the question is more
than rhetorical, whatever it implies about a macho plot.
</P>
<P>
   More simply, it is Tharp's preface to explaining why she is
starting a new dance company _ which has its debut Thursday night
at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C. _ after 12 years of
free-lancing. Although most of the works she choreographed in that
period were for American Ballet Theater and other major classical
companies in the United States and Europe, she has had no ballet
company to call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to be grounded again in my own company,'' Tharp said
during several conversations in New York recently. ``These have
been 12 years of exile.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that she chose to dissolve the modern-dance troupe she
founded in 1965 because of financial and administrative burdens now
seems beside the point. At 58, Tharp retains the spunk and energy
familiar to those who knew her work at its bold and innovative
beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Tharp was part of the modern-dance experiments of the 1960s.
Robert Joffrey sensed her wide appeal. ``Deuce Coupe,'' her 1973
hit for the Joffrey Ballet, impelled her toward a blend of ballet
and modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions her status as a major choreographer. But more
than anyone, she epitomizes the highly original artist attempting
to work within the confines of large arts institutions, and the
frustrations that can entail.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet, companies for which she
recently choreographed two premieres, were once small creative
troupes with a family atmosphere. As Tharp found out, exercising
control over your own dance company is very different from sharing
dancers and limited rehearsals in ballet companies with some 40
works to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been 12 years since I've had a full dress and technical
rehearsal,'' Tharp said, referring to the stage time provided in
advance by the American Dance Festival for her company, Twyla Tharp
Dance. The program of two Tharp premieres, ``Surfer at the River
Styx'' and ``Mozart Clarinet Quintet K. 581,'' will be performed
through Saturday at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Although manifestly confident in her use of the ballet idiom,
Tharp has essentially retained the mind-set of a modern dancer.
That is, she sees movement as something to be explored and does not
regard the 350-year-old ballet idiom as a given, a vocabulary
sufficient unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   For her new troupe, Tharp has some surprises up her sleeve. The
six dancers she has hired as the ``seedling'' of a new company
might eventually be part of a larger company that performs
modern-dance classics, not just her own work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm founding the company so that the focus now will be on my
work,'' she said. ``But I am interested in an American repertory
company. It would provide a foundation for 20th-century works to be
grounded as other works are in the ballet companies. Do I see this
as a priority? No. Do I see this as a responsibility? Yes, I do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the work of modern-dance pioneers that would be included
in this eclectic company, Tharp's choreography has explored a
hybrid style of both ballet and modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   While she often contrasted ballet and modern dance idioms within
a single work, she is now less interested in what she calls
``collisions'' of idioms than in unifying them. Many of her pieces
have divided a cast into two units: classical dancers (on toe) and
less classical dancers (in sneakers).
</P>
<P>
   But this was not true of ``The Beethoven Seventh,'' the premiere
in which she used the composer's Seventh Symphony for the New York
City Ballet last winter. Nor was it true of ``Brahms-Haydn
Variations,'' presented this spring as the 15th work Tharp has
created for Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   If Tharp has shifted some of her thinking about choreography,
she said that this was not true of her thinking on how music serves
dance. Some City Ballet dancers were startled when she began with
one piece of music and then substituted another score by the end.
This is a practice, designed to avoid illustration of the music,
that is common to modern dance but not to the ballet world.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Push Comes to Shove'' in 1976, Tharp's first work for
Ballet Theater, she started with Bach for Mikhail Baryshnikov's
role. ``Misha is a rococo dancer,'' she said, explaining why she
switched to ragtime.
</P>
<P>
   The coexistence of ballet and modern dance is also reflected in
the kind of dancers in Tharp's new group. Andrew Asnes and Francie
Huber are modern dancers who were members of the Paul Taylor Dance
Company. The other four are ballet dancers: Elizabeth Parkinson was
in the Joffrey Ballet and has been a soloist in the Broadway show
``Fosse.'' Benjamin Bowman was in the New York City Ballet. Ashley
Tuttle, Keith Roberts and John Selya appeared often in Tharp works
at Ballet Theater (Tuttle returns there in August).
</P>
<P>
   The troupe will perform at the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts in Washington from Sept. 29 through Oct. 1. A new
company does not preclude other ventures for Tharp. One is a
possible adaptation of stories by Maurice Sendak. Tharp declined to
say which but offered assurances that she would have things go bump
in the night. ``It wouldn't be any fun if it weren't scary,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tharp added that she planned to keep choreographing single works
for ballet companies when asked. Among others, the Bolshoi Ballet
and the Kirov Ballet have put out feelers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Tharp has worked on a project-by-project basis,
both in ballet companies and with temporary groups of dancers. Some
of these core dancers, like Stacy Caddell, are also the dancers on
which she first tries out choreography in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after giving up her permanent company in 1988, Tharp has
often found it harder to keep up with her work. Often commissioned
by producers scattered around the world, many of her pieces of the
last three years have not been seen in New York.
</P>
<P>
   `` Worldly-Wise,'' a full-length piece inspired by the life of
Rossini that she did for the Royal Ballet in London in 1997, has
not been performed here. Nor have the works that started her
Beethoven cycle. ``Grosse Sonate'' was danced by the pick-up group
she called Tharp! at the American Dance Festival last summer.
``Diabelli Variations'' received raves last year in London and at
Hancher Auditorium at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   These pieces led into ``The Beethoven Seventh'' at City Ballet.
Tharp said she embarked on this cycle for two reasons. ``I wanted
to examine the Romantic material because I find the aesthetics of
the 20th century hopelessly barren,'' she said. ``So I'm going back
to early Romanticism, to what was overreacted to.'' The second
reason was her interest in ``how Beethoven kept faith with his
craft and art as he lost his instrument,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Beethoven's deafness, she acknowledged that she no
longer dances as before despite a daily visit to the gym. ``I'm
losing my primary instrument as a dancer,'' she remarked. ``And
when that is lost, you either have to find a new way or stop. I was
not interested in stopping. I was interested in how Beethoven did
it. He was a virtuoso at the piano, and although he couldn't hear
the music, he was unbelievably physical in his conducting. Movement
precedes music. And his moving through daily life motivated the
music.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tharp began choreographing the ``Beethoven Seventh'' for
City Ballet, she originally used some of Beethoven's bagatelles and
sonatas. The choreography now danced to the Seventh Symphony's
second movement by Wendy Whelan and Nikolaj Hubbe was originally
created to a sonata. Tharp explained: ``I looked at it, put the
choreography to the symphony's second movement, and I said, `Holy
Toledo, Beethoven's meter, cycles and thinking were exactly the
same in both.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers found that Tharp had ignored Beethoven. She noted
that ``my approach to music is different in each piece,'' but in
this case she had a purpose. ``The music is too familiar,'' she
said. ``You cannot let the dancers into the material frontally.
They would have backed off into clicheland. It would have looked
too square. I went through the back door and got intricacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I will parallel the music with the choreography, as
in `Brahms-Haydn.' But music can be an energy-driving source, like
gasoline in a car. We don't need to illustrate music, music
illustrates itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the same about narrative in dance. The content and
thematic materials of dance is of itself, like boxing. You play
tennis and baseball. But boxing is not a sport you play: you stand
up and do it.''

   Attention Editors: Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six
weeks, The New York Times has been publishing a series of articles,
``How Race Is Lived in America.'' The series is the outcome of a
yearlong effort by a team of Times reporters to capture some of the
voices of ordinary people and some of the troubling issues that
Americans continue to face. The following photos are the twelfth
installment in the series.
</P>
<P>
   (NYT134) NEW YORK -- July 5, 2000 -- RACE-HIPHOP-5 -- Elliot
Wilson, writer and editor for the hip-hop magazine XXL. Hip-hop had
inspired Wilson to believe that, precisely because he was black, he
could achieve what whites simply assumed was theirs by birthright
-- a gainful life over which he asserted control. ``My magazine
isn't some white-boy magazine,'' says Wilson, who has been editor
of XXL for a year. Still, ``it can't be totally black if a white
man is signing the check.'' (Nancy Siesel/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT133) NEW YORK -- July 5, 2000 -- RACE-HIPHOP-4 -- Wanted and
Respected -- Po, left, Trife and Dog -- a rap group, rehearsing at
a Manhattan studio. Trife sees music as his sanity. ``If I wasn't
doing this,'' he says, ``I'd probably be doing 25 to life.'' Dog
and Trife had followed a trajectory of intense poverty and outlaw
life. A few years ago, they gravitated to rap, embracing it the way
so many poor blacks have long embraced basketball. But it was
better. There were more slots. And it seemed to demand less talent.
``You don't even have to sing well,'' says Dog. (Nancy Siesel/The
New York Times)

<P>
   (NYT132) SEATTLE -- July 5, 2000 -- RACE-HIPHOP-3 -- Billy
Wimsatt, a writer and activist, whose tag is Upski, at the
University of Washington during one of his hip-hop race lectures.
For many, even most, young whites, hip-hop was ultimately a hobby,
to be grown out of in good time. For Upski, it became a cause,
especially as the late '80s gave rise to politically conscious
rappers like Public Enemy, with its peppery blend of black
nationalism and rebellion. ``Once it became a pretty full critique
of American life -- race, politics and political hypocrisy --
that's when it really registered with me,'' says Wimsatt. (Nancy
Siesel/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT131) NEW YORK -- July 5, 2000 -- RACE-HIPHOP-2 -- Chronicles
of hip-hop abound. Like The Source and XXL, they are mostly
white-owned. A brash and satiric black-owned hip-hop magazine, Ego
Trip, did not survive. A white prophet of hip-hop, Upski, wrote a
memoir, ``Bomb the Suburbs,'' and followed it up with ``No More
Prisons.'' (The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT130) SEATTLE -- July 5, 2000 -- RACE-HIPHOP-1 -- Billy
Wimsatt, a writer and activist, whose tag is Upski, embraced
hip-hop as a boy to slip the bounds of his whiteness. Like many
young hip-hop heads, he regarded hip-hop, with its appeal to whites
and blacks, as a bold modern hope to ease some of the abrasiveness
between the races. Hip-hop, as he saw it, endowed him with cultural
elasticity, allowed him to shed the privilege of whiteness, to be
as down with blacks as with whites. Wimsatt at a hip-hop party in
Seattle. (Nancy Siesel/The New York Times)

-- In the world of Internet start-ups, where a typical chief
executive is 30 and a labor shortage continues even as some Web
companies fail, in many cases dot-commers are recruiting their
parents. Prescott Lee is chief executive of eCircles.com, an
Internet service which builds virtual meeting places. His mother,

   (NYT10) UNDATED -- July 5, 2000 -- HOME-IMPROVEMENT -- In order
for electricity to power a lamp, motor, appliance or other load, it
must travel from a source through a conductor and a load, then out
into the ground. This path from source to ground is a circuit. (Ed
Lipinsksi/New York Times Illustration)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT9) BOSTON -- July 5, 2000 -- BUSINESS-SCHOOLS -- With a
swiftness that has surprised and puzzled educators, law schools
have gained the advantage in their long tug of war with business
schools for the attention of corporate America's future
participants. ``The opportunities presented to someone like me are
pretty compelling right now,'' says Brian Gale, 27, an equities
trader in Boston who is trying to decide between going to the
University of Chicago full time and working for a bank in Cleveland
that has offered to pay his tuition if he enrolls in Chicago's
weekend program. (Michael Quan/The New York Times) Story moved

   Attention Editors: Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six
weeks, The New York Times has been publishing a series of articles,
``How Race Is Lived in America.'' The series is the outcome of a
yearlong effort by a team of Times reporters to capture some of the
voices of ordinary people and some of the troubling issues that
Americans continue to face. The following photos are the twelfth
installment in the series.
</P>
<P>
   (NYT134) NEW YORK -- July 5, 2000 -- RACE-HIPHOP-5 -- Elliot
Wilson, writer and editor for the hip-hop magazine XXL. Hip-hop had
inspired Wilson to believe that, precisely because he was black, he
could achieve what whites simply assumed was theirs by birthright
-- a gainful life over which he asserted control. ``My magazine
isn't some white-boy magazine,'' says Wilson, who has been editor
of XXL for a year. Still, ``it can't be totally black if a white
man is signing the check.'' (Nancy Siesel/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT133) NEW YORK -- July 5, 2000 -- RACE-HIPHOP-4 -- Wanted and
Respected -- Po, left, Trife and Dog -- a rap group, rehearsing at
a Manhattan studio. Trife sees music as his sanity. ``If I wasn't
doing this,'' he says, ``I'd probably be doing 25 to life.'' Dog
and Trife had followed a trajectory of intense poverty and outlaw
life. A few years ago, they gravitated to rap, embracing it the way
so many poor blacks have long embraced basketball. But it was
better. There were more slots. And it seemed to demand less talent.
``You don't even have to sing well,'' says Dog. (Nancy Siesel/The
New York Times)

   (NYT132) SEATTLE -- July 5, 2000 -- RACE-HIPHOP-3 -- Billy
Wimsatt, a writer and activist, whose tag is Upski, at the
University of Washington during one of his hip-hop race lectures.
For many, even most, young whites, hip-hop was ultimately a hobby,
to be grown out of in good time. For Upski, it became a cause,
especially as the late '80s gave rise to politically conscious
rappers like Public Enemy, with its peppery blend of black
nationalism and rebellion. ``Once it became a pretty full critique
of American life -- race, politics and political hypocrisy --
that's when it really registered with me,'' says Wimsatt. (Nancy
Siesel/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT131) NEW YORK -- July 5, 2000 -- RACE-HIPHOP-2 -- Chronicles
of hip-hop abound. Like The Source and XXL, they are mostly
white-owned. A brash and satiric black-owned hip-hop magazine, Ego
Trip, did not survive. A white prophet of hip-hop, Upski, wrote a
memoir, ``Bomb the Suburbs,'' and followed it up with ``No More
Prisons.'' (The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT130) SEATTLE -- July 5, 2000 -- RACE-HIPHOP-1 -- Billy
Wimsatt, a writer and activist, whose tag is Upski, embraced
hip-hop as a boy to slip the bounds of his whiteness. Like many
young hip-hop heads, he regarded hip-hop, with its appeal to whites
and blacks, as a bold modern hope to ease some of the abrasiveness
between the races. Hip-hop, as he saw it, endowed him with cultural
elasticity, allowed him to shed the privilege of whiteness, to be
as down with blacks as with whites. Wimsatt at a hip-hop party in
Seattle. (Nancy Siesel/The New York Times)

have gained the advantage in their long tug of war with business
schools for the attention of corporate America's future
participants. ``The opportunities presented to someone like me are
pretty compelling right now,'' says Brian Gale, 27, an equities

SINGLING OUT SIERRA LEONE, U.N. COUNCIL SETS GEM BAN 
</HEADLINE>
 . N.-350&AMP;ADD-NYT   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS_ The Security Council voted Wednesday to impose a
worldwide ban on the purchase of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone
until its government can establish a system to certify the origin
of stones being exported, and begins to assert its authority over
the diamond fields.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Sierra Leone's diamonds, considered to be of high
quality, are under the control of rebels, who smuggle the rough
stones out of the country through Liberia to international markets.
Sales of diamonds falsely labeled as Liberian provide money to buy
guns and other war materiel for continued fighting in Sierra Leone.
The Liberian president, Charles Taylor, is close to the main rebel
group in Sierra Leone, the Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, sponsored by Britain, is experimental and
intended to get at the roots of war.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock of Britain told reporters that
the international diamond industry and governments were beginning
to reach an understanding ``whereby in areas of conflict, only
diamonds that are certified as being authorized for sale by the
proper government will go into the industry and be cut and sold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of work still to do,'' Greenstock said, ``and
this is only the beginning of a number of steps we need to take on
Sierra Leone. But it's a good beginning. We have begun a system
which will immediately make it more difficult for the traders to
deal in conflict diamonds _ some people call them blood diamonds _
from Sierra Leone, which are making the lives of the Sierra Leone
people a misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's ambassador, Ibrahim Kamara, thanked the council
for the step taken Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always maintained that the conflict in Sierra Leone is
not about ideology, tribal or regional difference,'' he said. ``It
has nothing to do with the so-called problem of marginalized youths
or, as some political commentators have characterized it, an
uprising by rural poor against the urban elite. The root of the
conflict is and remains diamonds, diamonds and diamonds.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The council also ordered a hearing on the role of diamonds in
fueling the conflict, a situation the United Nations has also
encountered in Angola and will probably face in Congo, where a
survey is planned on natural resources and how they are used.
</P>
<P>
   Council action on the Sierra Leone diamond trade was delayed for
nearly a week by a dispute over placing a time limit on the
embargo. France, concerned about sanctions that may be imposed and
then never lifted, won agreement to a term of 18 months, after
which sanctions would end but could be reimposed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, while backing the resolution, opposed having
a time limit, especially one so short. Ambassador Nancy Soderberg,
who led the U.S. delegation Wednesday, called the time limit
``arbitrary'' and said it would only undermine the effectiveness of
sanctions because those in illegal activities can simply sit out an
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Some nations in the region have been reluctant to single out
Liberia _ and by implication Taylor _ as a problem, just as they
have been unenthusiastic about putting the Revolutionary Front's
leader, Foday Sankoh, on trial in Sierra Leone, according to
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Mali alone abstained and did not support the resolution, which
passed 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh is now in the custody of the government of Sierra Leone,
and the Security Council is working on a separate resolution
establishing a method for trying him that will bolster a weak local
justice system with international legal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh engineered a 1999 peace accord that gave him a place in
the government that he earlier tried to overthrow, in a campaign
marked by atrocities. In May he turned again on the government, and
on U.N. peacekeepers sent in to enforce the 1999 truce. About 500
peacekeepers were taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is also working on a resolution to increase
the size of the peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone to 16,500 from
about 13,000. But the Clinton administration, facing a refusal in
Congress of money to pay the U.S. share of such a peacekeeping
operation, is reluctant to approve the increase, council members
say.

STATE PANEL VOTES TO IMPEACH NEW HAMPSHIRE CHIEF JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A committee of New Hampshire lawmakers voted Wednesday
night to impeach Chief Justice David Brock of the state Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day the Judiciary Committee of the state House of
Representatives had tied, 11-11, on whether to recommend that Brock
be impeached based on accusations that he had committed perjury in
defending himself against charges of ethical improprieties. But
after a dinner break, the members returned and voted for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is scheduled to decide on the committee's
recommendations on July 12. If the House votes in favor of
impeachment, the trial is expected to begin in the state Senate in
August. It would be the first Supreme Court impeachment proceeding
in New Hampshire since 1790.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier the committee had also voted 14-8 against censuring
Brock, who is accused of lying under oath, intervening improperly
in a 1987 case involving a powerful state senator and failing to
intervene properly when members of his court tried to influence
cases from which they had recused themselves _ particularly, one
justice who tried to intervene in his own divorce case. Brock
denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also decided against impeaching or reprimanding
two state Supreme Court justices, Sherman D. Horton Jr. and John T.
Broderick Jr., who were also accused of ethical missteps.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted 19-3 against impeaching Horton and 16-6
against admonishing Broderick. Both had been accused of failing to
turn in the colleague who tried to intercede in his own divorce
case and of discussing cases from which they had recused themselves
because of possible bias.
</P>
<P>
   But state Rep. Cynthia J. Dokmo, a Republican who is one of
several lawyers on the committee, said, ``Whether we impeach them
or not, their reputations are forever damaged by this process.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire judicial crisis began with an ugly divorce,
the split between a state Supreme Court justice, W. Stephen Thayer
III, and his wife, Judith, a former chairwoman of the state Board
of Education. Judith Thayer appealed aspects of the case up to the
very court on which her former husband sat, and its justices,
unable to rule on their own colleague, had to appoint a special
panel of other judges to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, according to a report by the state attorney general,
Thayer, who has since resigned, vehemently objected to the choice
of a particular judge for that panel. In response, Brock tried to
prevent the court clerk from calling that judge but was too late.
</P>
<P>
   That incident, which the court clerk reported to a judicial
conduct committee, prompted a broader inquiry into the court's
practices by the state Attorney General, Philip T. McLaughlin. It
found a worrisome pattern of justices' being allowed to comment on
cases even when they had excused themselves because of potential
conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court had already issued new rules on recusals, the
incident also raised strenuous protests from court critics across
the state, many of whom were already contending that the court
overstepped its bounds in a major 1997 ruling that revamped the
state's heavily local system of financing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Such critics in the Legislature moved this spring for an inquiry
into whether any justices should be impeached, and the Judicial
Committee of the House took up the question in April. It has since
heard weeks of testimony laying bare some of the innermost workings
of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Thayer divorce, another, somewhat dusty case
figured prominently in the discussions: accusations that in 1987,
Brock intervened in a case involving a powerful state senator and
commented that the senator held some control over justices' pay
raises. Brock denies making the call.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Thayer divorce case, Brock has testified that he had
wanted time to sort the matter out and that he had been influenced
by feelings of compassion.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Supreme Court justices are appointed by the
governor, though Gov. Jeanne Shaheen has recently created a special
screening commission in response to the crisis. Supreme Court
appointments are permanent until retirement and only the
Legislature can remove the justices.

EUROPE'S MOTORISTS OFTEN FIND LOWER GASOLINE PRICES BY CROSSING
BORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs grafs 1, 2, 3, and 6 for smoothing and clarifications)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LONDON _ Paul Cheringou, a Frenchman, buys his in Spain. In
London, Ken Reddy, a Briton, prefers to pop over _ or rather under
_ the Channel to France for his. In Berlin, Monika Brauer, a
German, prefers to buy hers in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   What these border hoppers have in common is the quest for
(relative- ly) cheap gasoline. And what drives them to cross
international frontiers just to fill the tank is an often wide
difference in gasoline taxes, one of Europe's most pervasive yet
surrep- titious taxes. For some Europeans, it's an offer they can't
seem to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries that share a border, a bridge or a tunnel, the
difference in the price of gas can be substantial. A driver in
Britain, where fuel can cost $5.50 a gallon, can save as much as
$1.80 a gallon by tanking up in France. Germans can pay $3.70 a
gallon _ or seek out gas in Poland for 75 cents less. The
difference is explained by taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Wedded to their cars, the Continent's motorists have long been
the target of governments that seek revenues by cranking up levies
on gasoline rather than confront the political repercussions of
higher sales and income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people now pay more duty on petrol than they do income
tax,'' said Britain's conservative tabloid The Daily Mail.``This is
stealth tax with a vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Couple those taxes with the same oil price increases that have
helped push gasoline prices past the $2 mark in some parts of the
United States, though, and Europeans face a double whammy from both
taxes and the oil companies. The result: gasoline prices in many
parts of the Continent are at levels that stagger even Europeans,
and would incense Americans.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone in the United States were told to pay the prices we
pay here, there'd be rioting in the streets,'' said Michael
Johnson, a spokesman for Britain's Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   The prices offer some insight into a yawning chasm in
trans-Atlantic perceptions of the little guy's relationships with
the big guys. While Americans protest vocally at gasoline prices
climbing past $1.50 a gallon, Britons sigh in grumpy resignation at
gas costing more than three times as much.
</P>
<P>
   While the perceived rapacity of Big Oil has become a campaign
issue in the United States, Europeans exude a despairing rage at
what seems to be a conspiracy between political parties whose
rivalries give way to a consensus on the beauty of gasoline taxes
and the riches they produce for those in power.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For every gallon sold at the pumps in French francs or German
marks or British pounds, European governments rake in an average 70
percent to 80 percent of the price, compared with 25 percent in
America.
</P>
<P>
   So, at a time when the European Union is ballyhooing its single
market and single currency, the discrepancies between tax regimes,
both within the European Union and beyond, are providing the little
guy one of the very few chances to profit from Europe's deep-rooted
national distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Even though France and Spain share the euro, for instance,
Cheringou, a hotel receptionist in the French resort of
St.-Jean-de-Luz, likes to head south over the France-Spain border
in his Peugeot 106 subcompact every 10 days on a mission to buy
gas, cigarettes, fresh fruit and fish.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-minute drive from the Hotel Prado where he works, he said,
Spanish entrepreneurs have thoughtfully erected a gigantic
supermarket, the Alcampo, to cater to him and thousands of other
French shoppers, with prices both in French francs and Spanish
pesetas. Because of an agreement between some European countries
removing border formalities, there is no need to slow down or show
his passport as he crosses the border.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is well worth his drive. He figures that with the $80
he spends on a 10-gallon tank of gas, a few cartons of Winfield
cigarettes and a grocery cart of produce, he saves about $30 from
what he would otherwise pay in France _ the equivalent of more than
$1,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he said, is that while gas costs seven French francs
per liter _ roughly $3.70 per gallon _ in France, the cost in Spain
is significantly less because taxes are lower. Indeed, according to
the International Energy Agency in Paris, French taxes account for
roughly 70 percent of the cost of a gallon of gas in France, while
Spanish taxes total about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctions exist not just within the 11 countries that
have adopted the euro to underpin their national coin. In non-euro
England, for instance, where taxes consume about 75 percent of gas
prices, Reddy, a 45-year-old security consultant, figures he will
save more than $3,000 a year simply by doing monthly shopping not
at his local stores in East London but in France.
</P>
<P>
   Taking his Alfa Romeo 164 sports sedan to France, he says, costs
him little more than the $37.50 day ticket to use the Channel
Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   But, because French taxes on gasoline, tobacco, liquor and food
are so much lower, his savings far outstrip the price of the
ticket. ``I go because of the ludicrous high taxes on everything we
do, buy, eat or sleep in Britain,'' he said. ``If we didn't have
these ludicrous, high taxes, I wouldn't go over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said, up until three years ago French gasoline prices
were higher than British prices. But since then _ coinciding with
Tony Blair's New Labor government _ gas prices have risen by more
than a third in Britain. ``I'd say that, in the last three years,
99 per cent of my fuel has been French,'' Reddy said.

<P>
   In Berlin, Brauer, a 55-year-old hospital administrator, has
gone one further. For many years, she said, she has kept a weekend
home in a trailer park on the German-Polish border at Frankfurt an
der Oder, 50 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, gasoline, laden with ecological and sales taxes,
costs $3.59 per gallon. In Poland, she said, it costs 20 percent
less. So, during her weekend at the trailer, Brauer does some of
her shopping by fueling her Opel Vectra compact _ and buying a
carton of cheaper cigarettes _ in Poland, for a savings of about
$500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I pay more taxes in Germany?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every European lives close to a border, so the
economic impact of those shopping for cheaper gas is minor. But the
crossborder odysseys play into a much bigger debate over the
environment, the economy and, increasingly, the Continent's
politics just at a time when summer vacationers take to the
Autobahns.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, this is a time of debates and migrations, when
Germans head to Italy, and French vacationers swarm the Riviera and
Britons drive across the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   It is a time when European environmentalists fret about auto
pollution and, this year, some politicians have begun to see the
risk to their constituencies presented by ever-higher gasoline
prices.
</P>
<P>
   In big economic terms, the case for high gasoline taxes is not
easy to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Higher gas prices spread increased costs across Europe's
economies, pushing up delivery and supply charges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, according to Fatih Birol, the head of economic analysis at
the International Energy Agency, the high proportion of taxes in
the pump price of Europe's gasoline effectively fixes so much of
the price of gasoline that consumers are cushioned from the wild
price swings Americans have seen this year.
</P>
<P>
   And governments argue that motorists should pay for the damage
they cause to the environment. ``It's sort of enshrined in
environmental policy to persuade people to use alternative means of
transport,'' said Vicky Sheriff, a spokeswoman for the British
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   For all those high-minded protestations, the reality is that gas
taxes produce significant income for governments that is difficult
to find elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, gasoline taxes and license fees net more than $55
billion a year, roughly the same as Germany's gas tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the high price of crude oil and the strength of the
dollar _ the currency of the oil industry _ have also pushed up
prices. Significantly, though, the latest increases have finally
nudged prices toward psychological barriers _ 2 German marks per
liter or $3.70 per gallon, and 1 pound per liter or $5.50 a gallon)
in Britain _ that may breach European apathy about gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Europeans sense that their love affair with their
cars leaves them vulnerable to ever higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In France people will sacrifice even on food rather than do
without their car,'' said Cheringou in St.-Jean-de-Luz.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep slapping on the tax and all we do is sit at home and
moan about it,'' said Reddy in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do anything you want with the Germans because they
won't leave their car at home,'' said Brauer in Berlin. ``The car
is their favorite child.''

FUNGUS CONSIDERED AS A TOOL TO KILL COCA IN COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs 4th graf for clarification in wording; subs 18th graf to note
much of anti-drug effort in Uzbekistan is funded by U.S.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Under pressure from the United States, Colombia has reluctantly
agreed to take the first step toward developing a powerful
biological herbicide against the coca and heroin-poppy fields that
are spreading almost unchecked across its countryside, Colombian
and U.S. officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For years, U.S. officials have been quietly debating ways to
conduct field tests of such an herbicide, developed from a fungus
that occurs naturally in many types of coca and other plants.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Colombian officials say they are completing a proposal to
the United Nations that would include testing for the presence of
the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum, in coca, the raw material of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   If the fungus is found in Colombian varieties of coca, Colombian
scientists would go on to evaluate its effectiveness, safety and
environmental impact before deciding whether to produce an
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is a program of research _ and only research _ on
the use of biological controls against these crops,'' the Colombian
environment minister, Juan Mayr, said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian government's uneasy support for the project comes
as President Clinton is about to sign a bill providing $1.3 billion
in aid to Colombia to fight drug traffickers and the insurgents who
protect their trade.
</P>
<P>
   Some powerful Republican in Congress told Colombian officials
that they were supporting the spending on the expectation that that
Colombia would agree to explore the use of Fusarium fungus in its
coca fields.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Clinton administration, officials said, the testing
of fungal herbicides was also pushed by the White House drug policy
adviser, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, and by officials of the U.S.
Southern Command, which is overseeing the U.S. overhaul of
Colombia's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and other activists in both countries are
raising a din of objections to any field tests of the fungus,
arguing that it is virtually a biological weapon _ one that might
upset Colombia's ecology or endanger farmers, animals and food
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, similar complaints by environmentalists in Florida
prompted state officials there to put aside plans to test a variant
of Fusarium for possible use against marijuana fields.
</P>
<P>
   Several plant pathologists who have studied the fungus
extensively said there was relatively little scientific basis for
the assertions about its danger. They acknowledged that a great
deal of testing still needed to be done, but they added that the
most significant unanswered questions might have less to do with
the safety of the fungus than with its effectiveness and cost.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If they're looking at local strains of the fungus, then I
can't see something scientifically dangerous about it,'' said Dr.
Jonathan Gressel, a professor of plant sciences at the Weizmann
Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. ``What you're doing is
taking a disease that is already present and putting on more of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But they'll be lucky if it works,'' Gressel added. ``Because
typically this inundative strategy isn't good enough in commercial
agriculture, and I'm sure the narcos have been planning ahead.
They'll probably go to fungicides or breed their coca to be
resistant to the fungus. It's relatively easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns about Fusarium's proposed use as a mycoherbicide,
or fungal herbicide, have been heightened by the shadowy history of
research into its impact on drug crops. Indeed, the proposed
Colombian study comes after years of often secret investigation by
scientists in the United States and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Fusarium, a naturally occurring fungus with
variants that can cause wilt in everything from tomatoes and grain
to marijuana, was first identified as a possible weapon in the drug
fight by CIA scientists in the early 1980s. The U.S. Agriculture
Department began more extensive research into the use of the fungus
on coca in 1988, and it continued, mostly in secret, for nearly a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   At roughly the same time, Soviet biological weapons scientists
at the Institute of Plant Genetics in Uzbekistan were working to
develop Fusarium fungus, plant bacteria and other pathogens to
destroy opium poppies _ and perhaps enable Moscow to limit the
world's morphine supply or undermine the opium-dependent economy of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States
continued to pay for research at the laboratory as part of an
effort to keep its impoverished scientists from joining the
biological weapons programs of countries like Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same research now continues under the auspices of
the United Nations Drug Control Program, with has quietly supported
the use of biological controls against drug crops since 1976. In
Uzbekistan, as in Colombia, much of the United Nations effort is
financed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened in the past, the work has to be redone now
in an open environment,'' said Eric Rosenquist, one of the
officials who has worked longest on the fungus. ``Only then can you
debate it on its merits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as some horrible thing that's going to mutate
and kill people _ that's science fiction,'' added Rosenquist, a
program leader for international programs at the Agriculture
Department's Research Service in Beltsville, Md. ``But you have to
demonstrate that it is going to be effective, and that hasn't been
done yet.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Rosenquist and other officials noted that a natural epidemic of
Fusarium in Peru, beginning in the mid-1980s, had only a limited
effect on the cultivation of coca there. By comparison, Colombian
coca growers have been considerably more sophisticated about the
science of their work.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of fusarium fungus as an herbicide is that its
strains have generally been found to attack only a single type of
plant, entering the roots and strangling the vascular system while
leaving other species untouched. The fungus can live on in the soil
for many years, moving from one coca plant to another.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of fungal herbicides say they may prove to be much
less damaging to the environment than chemical herbicides that are
now typically used to fumigate drug fields.
</P>
<P>
   Similar biological controls are increasingly being used to kill
weeds, noted Dr. David C. Sands, a plant pathologist who has led
much of the research on fusarium's potential use against coca.
``The question is whether this is considered a noxious plant,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sands, a plant pathologist at Montana State University, worked
almost single-handedly to revive congressional interest in
mycoherbicides after the Department of Agriculture began to phase
out its support for the fusarium research in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He also holds a patent on what officials say would be the likely
method for dispersing the fungus if it were ever used on coca or
opium poppies. The design involves dropping fusarium-coated seeds
from planes flying over coca fields, at higher altitudes than the
crop-dusting planes and helicopter that are routinely attacked by
drug producers and guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   For some years, lawyers at the White House and the State
Department debated whether it was possible to use the fungal
herbicide on drug crops without violating the international
conventions against the spread of biological weapons. It was
determined that the law would not be violated if a foreign country
made its own decision to use or test the fungus, but that has not
satisfied all U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support using a product on a bunch of Colombian
peasants that you wouldn't use against a bunch of rednecks growing
marijuana in Kentucky,'' said one United States intelligence
official. ``And there is definitely less-than-unanimous support for
this in Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayr, the Colombian environment minister, said he had flatly
rejected the first proposal for a mycoherbicide research plan that
was sent to him in late April by the U.N. Drug Control Program.
According to a summary of the plan, it stipulated that ``The
government of Colombia has agreed, in principle, to experimental
field trials being conducted in that country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayr and two other senior Colombian officials said their
counterproposal will propose to test only fungal herbicides that
already exist in Colombia. ``If Fusarium is not there, we won't
study it,'' he said. But they agreed to look at various types of
biological controls against coca, including predatory insects.
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.N. drug-control director in Bogota, Klaus Nyholm, and
the U.S. assistant secretary of state for international narcotics
and law enforcement affairs, R. Rand Beers, suggested they would
support the new Colombian plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an idea that ought to be investigated,'' Beers said of
the fungus' potential as a herbicide. ``It should not be
implemented until the science is clear. But if it is, then it
should be considered a tool.''

FORMER PARTNERS ALLOWED TO SELL SHARES EARLY
</HEADLINE>
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman Sachs Group said on Wednesday that it will
let its former partners sell as many as 18 million shares of stock
in an offering that could be bigger than the firm's $3.66 billion
initial public offering last year.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the firm will not get any of the proceeds. The
shares being offered for sale _ 40 million plus an optional 6
million more _ are owned by two big institutions and people who
were partners in the firm when it went public or who already had
retired as partners. Many of those shares were not supposed to be
sold for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, expected to occur in early August, could push down
Goldman's stock price as the supply of stock available to the
public increases. Only about 17 percent of Goldman's shares are
owned by outsiders. The other 83 percent are held by the firm's
current and former employees, a Hawaiian trust called Kamehameha
Activities Association and Sumitomo Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Kamehameha association, an affiliate of the Bishop estate in
Honolulu, is selling half of its 4.9 percent stake in Goldman and
Sumitomo is selling 40 percent of its 6.3 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman officials declined to comment on the proposed sale.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of internal struggle over whether to convert
from a partnership to a public corporation, Goldman sold 69 million
shares of stock for $53 each in May 1999. Since then, Goldman's
stock has risen 81 percent, to $95.9375 on Wednesday. At that
price, the sale could raise more than $4.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After the sale, Goldman's management will control 60 percent of
the firm.
</P>
<P>
   In documents related to its first-time stock sale, Goldman said
that it would restrict its former partners from selling the shares
they received in the conversion for three years. But now it plans
to let them sell between 12 million and 18 million shares, which
would be worth $1.15 billion to $1.73 billion at the current stock
price.
</P>
<P>
   The registration document that Goldman filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission after the stock market closed on Wednesday
does not disclose how many shares each of the former partners and
retired partners plans to sell. A person familiar with the proposed
sale said most of them will sell less than 7 percent of their
shares and none will sell more than 15 percent.

   FRANCE: U.S. ESPIONAGE INQUIRY
</P>
<P>
   The European Parliament in Strasbourg has voted to form a
committee to investigate allegations that Washington's vast
surveillance system, called Echelon, is being used to conduct
industrial espionage now that the Cold War is over. The system,
maintained by the United States and several allies including
Britain, listens to and watches millions of telephone, fax and
e-mail messages each day. The committee is expected to report back
in about eight months.

   FRANCE: MAYOR'S NEW PROBLEMS
</P>
<P>
   Jean Tiberi, the mayor of Paris, has received some more bad
news: A court is investigating his wife, Xaviere, for taking part
in a vote-rigging scheme. Tiberi would like to run for mayor again
in 2001, but his party has chosen someone else. Polls show fewer
than 10 percent of Parisians believe Tiberi is honest. His wife's
latest predicament is only the latest in a long line of
investigations surrounding Tiberi, once a close ally of President
Jacques Chirac. &QL;

   AUSTRIA: EUROPEAN WARNING
</P>
<P>
   Trying to veto any expansion of the European Union will backfire
against Austria, a spokesman for the European Union said. The
spokesman was responding to remarks by Austrian political leaders
saying they might hold up expansion plans if the union does not end
sanctions imposed after the anti-immigration Freedom Party was
allowed in government.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA: DENIAL BY MAYOR OF MOSCOW
</P>
<P>
   Yuri M. Luzhkov, the brash and ambitious mayor of Moscow,
heatedly denied a report in the newspaper Kommersant that he had
agreed to resign under pressure from officials at the Kremlin,
perhaps in exchange for a guarantee he would not be prosecuted for
undisclosed offenses. Luzhkov, like all leaders of Russian regions,
would lose immunity from prosecution should President Vladimir V.
Putin's plan to restructure the nation's Parliament succeed, as now
appears likely. &QL;

   YUGOSLAVIA: MILOSEVIC MOVE
</P>
<P>
   Parliament met to discuss constitutional changes that could
allow President Slobodan Milosevic to win a new term as federal
president, but through direct election, the official Tanjug news
agency said. Under current law, Milosevic was elected by Parliament
for a single four-year term, which runs out next year. He has
already served two terms as Serbian president. Milosevic is deeply
unpopular, however, and there is no guarantee that he would win.

<P>
   INDONESIA: BOMB REMOVED
</P>
<P>
   An unexploded bomb was removed from the office of the attorney
general a day after a small explosion in a toilet in the building.
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman called the explosion a ``terror
tactic.'' It occurred one hour after prosecutors finished
questioning a son of former President Suharto in connection with a
corruption case against Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA: NEW MALUKU DEATHS
</P>
<P>
   Fighting between Christians and Muslims continued to range in
the Maluku islands despite a nine-day-old state of emergency. As
many as 14 people have been killed in the past two days and the
region's biggest college, Pattimura University, was reported to

   The effects of a regional drought are becoming ``desperate,'' a
U.N. official said, in asking rich nations to donate $88 million to
feed 3.3 million Kenyans through the end of the year. Many rich
nations have been reluctant to give to Kenya, hard hit by drought,
because so much food meant for starving people is being stolen by
corrupt local officials. David Fletcher, of the World Food Program,
stressed that a new system was in place to cut down on corruption.

   DEMOCRATS REJECT TOBACCO MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco money is not welcome by the host committee that is
raising $35 million for the Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles next month. Noelia Rodriguez, chief executive of the
committee, Wednesday signed an agreement not to accept or solicit
donations from any tobacco company or its subsidiaries. This comes
at a time when the committee is still $3 million to $4 million
short of its fund-raising target. ``We look forward to showcasing
Los Angeles as the largest smoke-free city in the nation,''
Rodriguez said. Philip Morris, one of the nation's largest tobacco
companies, has given $250,000 to the Philadelphia host committee
for the Republican National Convention, which begins on July 31.

   Jack E. Robinson III, the beleaguered Republican challenger to
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, is going down swinging in this fall's
Senate election in Massachusetts. Robinson, an entrepreneur,
Wednesday appealed a decision by the state ballot law commission
last week that he lacked the 10,000 qualifying signatures he needed
to run because some of those he submitted had been forged and some
were printed upside down. Taking his case to the highest court in
Massachusetts, he challenged the decision that 129 signatures were
invalid. If the state Supreme Judicial Court upholds his removal
from the ballot, Massachusetts will lack a Republican candidate for
a Senate seat for the first time in the state's history, political
experts say.

LAZIO LETTER SAYS THE CLINTONS `EMBARRASSED' THE COUNTRY
</HEADLINE>
  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERTOWN, N.Y. _ In the strongest sign that he intends to raise
character and integrity as an issue in the Senate race, Rep. Rick
Lazio says in a fund-raising letter that Hillary Rodham Clinton and
President Clinton ``have embarrassed our country and disgraced
their powerful posts.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which was sent this week and is signed by Lazio, the
Republican nominee, does not specify what he believes Clinton, the
Democratic nominee, or the president have done.
</P>
<P>
   In a news briefing held on a bus that was carrying reporters
traveling with him on his cross-state campaign tour, Lazio would
not elaborate. He said many such letters pass across his desk and
he needed to review this one before elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, in asking for contributions to his Senate campaign,
includes the line, ``If you're like most Republicans you believe
that Hillary Clinton and her husband have embarrassed our country
and disgraced their powerful posts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, it says, ``covets power and control and thinks she
should be dictating how other people run their lives. No other
Senate hopeful enjoys a liberal national press that hangs on her
every word and treats her never-ending soap opera of scandals as
`irrelevant' and `yesterday's news.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also describes himself as a conservative and Clinton as a
liberal, although both campaigns have tried to claim the political
center.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, through a spokesman, called the letter a ``personal
insult.'' But Lazio defended the letter, saying he needed to strike
back after Clinton began broadcasting a series of negative
television advertisements a couple of weeks ago. He continued to
tell supporters at public rallies that he would wage a positive
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to reconcile the letter with his promise to stay positive,
Lazio drew a distinction between television advertising and letters
to supporters. The letter, he said, ``is not part of a mass
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's a totally different situation,'' he said.
``Our campaign is not focused on the negative; their campaign is
completely focused on the negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what you send to some House donor list that
matters,'' Lazio said as questions about the letter came to
dominate his 23-minute session with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio steadfastly refused to give examples of the conduct he
deemed offensive, but the letter seemed a reference to a string of
scandals, including the Monica Lewinsky matter and a series of
investigations into Clinton's law practice, the Whitewater land
deal and her handling of firings in the White House travel office.
Lazio voted to impeach the president on two of four articles.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Clinton, said, ``We are
confident that New Yorkers will reject Rick Lazio's campaign of
personal insults in favor of Hillary's campaign of issue-related
differences and real ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   He took issue with Lazio's drawing a distinction between what is
said on the campaign trail and what is said in fund-raising
letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for him to take responsibility for his campaign of
personal attacks and insults,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising letters, whether released through a candidate's
office or by a third party, often employ stronger language than a
candidate uses in campaign appearances or advertisements. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of New York, when he was considering a run for the
Senate this year, took criticism for a letter written by a
conservative group on his behalf that characterized Clinton as a
radical liberal who was anti-religion.

HOW POP HIJACKED THE LAB'S CREATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By   JON PARELES  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The composers, visionaries, theorists, tinkerers and crackpots
who invented electronic music were making it, at first, largely for
themselves. Working as a research-and-development corps at a
peculiar intersection of science and aesthetics, they spun off a
few practical applications, like sound effects for movies and funny
noises for commercials. They did their more serious work for those
few listeners who'd go to concerts where the only thing to look at
was a loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
   They probably never imagined that by the end of the 20th
century, thousands of people would regularly turn out to hear
electronic music in special environments, through sound systems
specifically designed for it. Those places are called clubs, and
electronic music lives in them quite comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from the labs of electronic music's pioneers.
But as soon as sound-shaping technology approached the threshold of
convenience, popular music took the paradigms of electronic
composition and ran with them. Sounds and strategems that once
seemed impossibly futuristic _ atonality, synthetic timbres,
superhuman agility, jump-cut juxtapositions _ are now taken for
granted by anyone who tunes in a Top 40 radio station.
</P>
<P>
   While the bulk of electronic popular music aims for dance-floor
functionality, there's no scarcity of musicians concocting sound
for sound's sake. It might be the razzle-dazzle, hands-on vinyl
manipulation of turntablists like the X-ecutioners (who perform on
Saturday as part of the Lincoln Center Festival's Electronic
Evolution series) or the shape-shifting, hyperlinked soundscapes
created by the three disk jockeys in We (which performs Saturday at
Creative Time's ``Remix'' series at the Anchorage under the
Brooklyn Bridge) or the quiet, slithery, ominous ambient music of
Microstoria or the giddy, haywire-robot antics of Autechre.
Distinguished composers in universities and government-sponsored
institutions have now been surrounded, and often outmatched, by
geeks with laptops and disk jockeys applying quick hands to
eclectic collections.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sudden turnaround, no revolution. Instead,
electronic noises and their implications spread by osmosis.
Musicians discovered new toys, manufacturers kept updating their
gadgets and producers devised tactics to harness them. Before long,
listeners took for granted the electronic timbres that once seemed
unearthly. Now, oscillators and microchips serenade us day and
night, from touch-tone phones to cash machines to car alarms.
Popular music, awash in electronic tones and digital control,
merely reflects everyday reality.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, rock and electronic music were always fellow
travelers. As documented on the ``Ohm'' boxed set, a survey of
early electronic composers, electronic music surged in the 1950s
alongside rock 'n' roll, after decades of sporadic activity
including the invention of electronic instruments like the
theremin. Rock, like electronic music, relied on instruments that
plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching for a radio audience and hit records, rock quickly
grew used to being disembodied. What counted, increasingly, was
what jumped out of the speakers. It did not take rock producers
long to realize that recordings didn't have to be souvenirs of
performances; they could be tweaked, spliced, gimmicked,
overdubbed. They could be, in a word, unnatural, as unnatural as
the artificial tones of electronic music.
</P>
<P>
   Explicitly or not, rockers came around to the same ways of
thinking that electronic composers were using. They started to hear
music as signals and processing, as textures distributed over time.
Electronic sounds weren't so alien to rock musicians; anyone who
has plugged an instrument into an amplifier has heard the harsh
beauty of electricity going astray, and rockers soon came to love
distortion and feedback. Still, it would take Jimi Hendrix to
completely reimagine the electric guitar as a source of pure
electronic signals: controlled or chaotic, abstract or as visceral
as the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Les Paul, toying with multitrack tape and speed manipulation,
unleashed the possibilities not just of improving music in the mix,
but of treating every sound, regardless of its origins, as a
variable that could be manipulated. Whether or not producers were
aware of Pierre Schaeffer's late-1940s work with noises on bits of
tape, multitrack recording and ever-improving studio equipment made
every song a potential exercise in musique concrete, turning
recorded sound into something never heard in real time. (It was an
insight music producers shared with the pragmatic collagists who
made radio advertisements, splicing and echoing their way to
maximum impact or annoyance.)
</P>
<P>
   While rock and rollers were using tape trickery for novelties _
early pop sampling, for instance, in Dickie Goodman's ``flying
saucer'' comedy singles, with a deadpan interviewer answered by
snippets of current hits _ academic composers and eccentric souls
were devising all sorts of precedents. ``Ohm'' shows them coming up
with, and then leaving by the wayside, techniques of cutting,
mixing, sampling, looping, layering and sequencing that would soon
become commonplace in rock.
</P>
<P>
   Rockers followed paths that more solemn electronic composers
puritanically disdained. They liked tonal harmony as much as they
liked abstract noise and saw no sin in combining the two. They
didn't consider a steady beat, even a simple 4/4 beat, to be
automatically trivial. They were also happy to let machines be
mechanical: that is, to repeat tasks like any other piece of
automation. First with short patterns _ melodies, rhythms, samples
_ and then with longer and longer ones as machine memories
improved, they built old-fashioned song forms or harnessed the
hypnotic power of repetition. (Of course, repetition can also be
abused. Far too many electronica albums, whether they're uptempo
dance music or ``hearts of space'' ambient music, end up more
numbing than incantatory.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Self-consciously artistic rock musicians, like Frank Zappa and
the Beatles, picked up ideas from the electronic avant-garde in the
psychedelic 1960s, and they put in long studio hours to come up
with determinedly avant efforts like the Beatles' ``Revolution No.
9.'' Others waited until synthetic sounds were available, thanks to
inventors like Robert Moog, at the touch of a familiar-looking
keyboard. By the early 1970s, rock had its own avant theorist in
the person of Brian Eno, who combined some of the aleatoric and
all-sound-can-be-music thinking of John Cage with the lessons of
20th-century visual artists and his own healthy intuitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Machine Soul: An Odyssey Into Electronic Dance Music,'' a
two-CD set compiled by Rhino Records, shows how musical ideas and
updated gizmos have leapfrogged each other since 1977, when Donna
Summer and Giorgio Moroder unveiled ``I Feel Love.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame the set doesn't go back two more decades, when
synthesizers and sequencers (the electronic equivalents of
player-piano rolls) had already escaped ivy towers and recording
studios to provide swoops, drones, blips and pulsations for various
pop projects.
</P>
<P>
   By deliberately limiting itself to dance music, the set also
avoids the thickets and tangents of electronic music that's not so
singleminded: ambient, illbient, trip-hop, minimal techno,
psychedelic trance, improvisation and other left-field subgenres.
But ``Machine Soul'' shows how fast electronic timbres and
metronomic drum patterns infiltrated pop. At first, synthetic
sounds are treated as alien and impersonal; they lead to lyrics
about outer space and robots. But by the early 1980s, musicians and
listeners both hear electronic sounds as just another tone color.
(Around the same time, another electronic marvel was being
domesticated: PC's were beginning to appear on desktops.)
</P>
<P>
   On ``Machine Soul,'' the old synthesizers have the out-of-tune
jolt of barely controlled analog equipment. The tones are at once
corny and defiant, crude like a beginning guitarist, until reverb
and digital synthesis smooth them out. Yet electronic popular music
keeps going back to the jolt: in hip-hop drumbeats sampled from
scratchy LPs, in bursts of static or distortion, in whole pieces _
by the likes of Pan Sonic _ made from the sounds of malfunctioning
equipment. Technology, even as it multiplies possibilities, can't
clean up rock's vandalistic impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Rock brought something even more valuable to the electronic
sphere: it removed the hermetic aspect of the music. Although there
were some improvising musicians (notably Musica Elettronica Viva)
among the electronic pioneers, most of the music was finished in
the recording studio, to be quietly appreciated during playback.
Rock (and dance music and hip-hop) pushed the music into a public
role by taking it to the party. To rock ears, the music invites
participation. In a club, the inhuman electronic beat is completed
by a dancing body, and the arty electronic abstraction becomes the
atmosphere of a chill-out room.
</P>
<P>
   When rock annexed electronic music from its pioneers, in some
ways it reinvented the wheel. But by hurling the music into the
mass media and into the marketplace, it rolled that wheel into a
whole new arena, where strange, improbable combinations are being
hooked up right now.

Agassi, Sampras move closer to showdown
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JODY GOLDSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ If Pete Sampras is to win a seventh
Wimbledon title and earn a record 13th Grand Slam championship,
it's looking more and more likely he'll have to get by fellow
American Andre Agassi to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, who is better known for his return game, also has been
spectacular on his service games this week. For the third
consecutive match, the No. 2 seed did not lose serve. At the same
time, Agassi overcame 22 aces from Mark Philippoussis to claim a
7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-4 victory in Wednesday's quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Sampras had more of a struggle but overcame a
challenge from up-and-coming American Jan-Michael Gambill, winning
6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   A rematch of last year's final, won by Sampras, is still one
round away. Sampras will face 22-year-old qualifier Vladimir
Voltchkov in one semifinal Friday. Voltchkov, who hadn't even
played an ATP Tour match in 2000 prior to this fortnight, has won
his last three matches in straight sets, including Wednesday's 7-6
(2), 7-6 (2), 6-4 quarterfinal against Byron Black.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, however, has the more difficult path, meeting 1999
semifinalist Patrick Rafter in the other semi. Rafter, who managed
a 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (1) victory over Alexander Popp Wednesday, was
knocked out in last year's semifinals by Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was high-quality tennis,'' the second-seeded Agassi said
about last year's semifinal. ``I don't expect anything less in a
couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi was forced to play more high-quality tennis Wednesday
against a player whose strong serves and volley game are perfectly
suited for Wimbledon's manicured courts. Nicknamed ``Scud'' because
of missile-like serves that reached more than 130 mph Wednesday,
Philippoussis drilled 22 aces and had 51 unreturned serves against
the best returner of serve in the men's game.
</P>
<P>
   But Philippoussis eventually succumbed to the pressure from the
service line. The 10th-seeded Australian, knowing he could only
beat Agassi with that weapon, couldn't afford to take much off his
second attempts. He double faulted to set up break point at 4-3 in
the second set, then aimed a second serve wide. It hit a net cord
and flew out of the court to give Agassi the first break of the
game. A double fault marred the only service break in the third set
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Double faults cost me both my service games,'' Philippoussis
said. ``Against a great player like that, you have to step it up a
bit on your serve, and that costs you. I had to step it up a
little. I put a little extra pace than I would have normally done.
I missed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither player had been able to break the other in the first
set, forcing a tiebreak that was won by Agassi despite a pair of
aces from Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's serve, which is generally overshadowed by his return
game, was steady the entire match. Philippoussis earned only five
break opportunities. Each time, Agassi stepped it up, often with
one of his seven aces. Agassi hasn't had his serve broken in his
last three matches despite facing 11 break points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's generally more difficult to break on grass,''
Agassi said. ``Grass helps my serve and helps other people's serve.
Playing Todd Martin (in the second round), I lost my serve six
times. Since him, I haven't felt a threat on the return quite as
intense. So I think I've relaxed a little bit, and I'm serving
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambill, a 23-year-old from Spokane, Wash., who has been
burdened with the responsibility of leading the next group of
American stars, hung in nicely against Sampras despite the pressure
of playing the tournament favorite on Centre Court. Gambill had his
serve broken three times in the four sets but was never able to
break Sampras to pull back even.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, put up a valiant fight. Gambill stayed with
Sampras until his final service game of the first set, then played
a flawless tiebreak in the second to even the match at one set
apiece. The third set again was decided in the final game, as was
the fourth. In each, Gambill managed to run down shots many others
never would have gotten to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit some great shots in the tiebreaker,'' Sampras said.
``All of a sudden, it's one set all. He was giving me a lot of
problems with his serve, his second serve especially, moving it
around. I never felt like I was in control of his service games. I
served well, was taking advantage of his two-handed on the forehand
side. I got through some tough situations. But you're looking at
the future of American tennis. I mean, I think he's a standout as
far as he's a young guy with a lot of potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras played one of his cleanest matches, committing only
three unforced errors in the first three sets, seven over the
four-set match. Gambill committed 11. Gambill also nearly matched
the hard-serving Sampras, trailing only 26-23 in aces.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' near-flawless performance was a bit surprising
considering he is still unable to practice between matches because
of tendinitis in his left shin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, it's a little unsettling,'' Sampras said. ``I've
been dealt this hand, and there's not much I can do about it now.
It's definitely something I'm not used to. I've gone through tough
weeks in Slams with other situations. You know, it's difficult, but
it's a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other quarterfinals, Rafter, a natural serve and
volleyer, had 21 winners at the net to defeat Popp. And Voltchkov,
who won three qualifying matches and now has won five in the main
draw, had 24 forehand winners and 52 overall to knock off Black.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked only 237th, Voltchkov became the first qualifier to reach
the men's semifinals since John McEnroe in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe is not the only former star whom Voltchkov, the
Wimbledon junior champion in 1996, is trying to emulate. No former
Wimbledon junior winner has progressed this far since Stefan Edberg
in 1987.

MIDCENTURY SERIALISTS: THE BULLIES OR THE BESIEGED? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compiling the history of U.S. music in the fractious decades
after World War II should not be so difficult, since so many
witnesses are around to report on it firsthand. But it's amazing
how much disagreement exists about a central _ perhaps the central
_ issue of the period: the influence of composers who advocated
12-tone techniques, or serialism.
</P>
<P>
   A widely held belief asserts that during these years a band of
rigorous, cutting-edge composers, mostly based in prestigious East
Coast universities, seized the intellectual high ground and bullied
their colleagues and students into accepting serial procedures as
the only valid form of modernism. All those fusty holdouts still
clinging to tonality were laughably irrelevant, the serialists
argued. If beleaguered audiences and even many critics recoiled
from 12-tone music, well, the cutting-edge commando declared, that
was their problem.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another, quite opposite take on that period holds that the
12-tone composers never wielded much influence, that they
themselves were the beleaguered minority group marginalized by the
majority of composers, who continued to write music that was
essentially tonal and far more popular.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the truth?
</P>
<P>
   Enter Joseph N. Straus, a professor of music theory at Queens
College. Surely, Straus felt, this question could be answered
empirically. What percentage of composers at the time were
serialists? Who held the teaching posts? Whose music was getting
performed, recorded and published? The answer he came up with is
clear from the title of his article ``The Myth of Serial `Tyranny'
in the 1950s and 1960s,'' which has been generating talk in
academic circles since its publication in the Fall 1999 issue of
Musical Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   Straus' study was sociological, not aesthetic in orientation.
``I am not concerned with whether serialism is intrinsically good
or bad, natural or unnatural, an inevitable evolution or an
avoidable mistake,'' he writes, ``although those concerns were, and
remain, alive in the literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Straus' disinterest in the merits of serialism for the purposes
of his study is useful. But it's not as if those critics and
musicians who hold that dogmatic 12-tone composers did in fact
exercise inordinate and stultifying power during that period, as I
do, are necessarily against 12-tone music.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever harm the dogmatism caused, the development of these
complex procedures was exciting and produced a great body of
important music. Most students during that period, and into the
1970s, were fascinated by the new modernism. Schoenberg and Webern
were godlike figures whose scores were pored over in theory classes
like Talmudic texts. Works by Milton Babbitt, Roger Sessions,
Donald Martino, Charles Wuorinen and other 12-tone American
composers were listened to with fascination and respect.
</P>
<P>
   For some time now the death of serialism has repeatedly been
proclaimed. Yet all the lushly scored, tonally grounded
neo-Romantic works that have been written over the last 20 years by
a new generation of composers trying to win back audiences to new
music have made all those knotty old 12-tone pieces sound more
invigorating than ever. I would rather hear a Boulez chamber work
or the Babbitt piano music than any crowd-pleasing piece by Richard
Danielpour.
</P>
<P>
   The problem that led to the ``myth'' of serial tyranny was not
the ascendancy of 12-tone music in the 1950s and '60s but the
disdain that was heaped on composers who continued to write tonal
music.
</P>
<P>
   Straus' findings suggest that the 12-tone tyranny never
happened. The methodology he devised was basically reasonable.
Confining his survey to the years 1950 to 1969 and focusing only on
Americans working in the Western classical music tradition, he
identified 468 composers who were notably active during those
years. He then divided them into four categories.
</P>
<P>
   First, ``serial'' (including 12-tone composers), meaning
composers who wrote with varyingly strict systems involving the
``precomposed ordering'' of all 12 pitches; Babbitt and Wuorinen
are representative of this group.
</P>
<P>
   Second, ``atonal,'' a broad category including composers who
adopted any ad hoc combination of nontonal procedures, some of whom
were heavily influenced by 12-tone theory, like Elliott Carter and
Leon Kirchner.
</P>
<P>
   Third, ``tonal,'' used in a broad sense to mean any composers
who employed essentially tonal, modal, highly chromatic or
Neo-Classical styles, like Samuel Barber and William Schuman.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, ``experimental,'' meaning composers who departed from
Western traditions and explored elements of chance and innovative
sound resources in their works, like John Cage and Morton Feldman.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that his categories and methodology are
``necessarily crude,'' Straus determined that during the period in
question, more than two-thirds of the active composers were tonal,
whereas serial composers constituted less than 15 percent of the
total. Even combining serial and atonal composers, those commonly
charged by concertgoers and critics with writing ``dissonant modern
music,'' they still account for a ``distinct minority,'' Straus
reports. His article includes charts and graphs galore to back his
figures, showing the percentages of composers from each stylistic
group who were getting published, performed, recorded and appointed
to tenured faculty positions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My main reservation about Straus' methodology concerns his
limiting the survey to the 1950s and '60s. The battle raged on
during the 1970s, as is indicated by a quotation from an essay
written in 1979 by Wuorinen, one of the many combatants Straus
cites in his article, proclaiming the defeat of the tonalists.
</P>
<P>
   While ``the tonal system, in an atrophied or vestigial form, is
still used today in popular and commercial music, and even
occasionally in the works of backward-looking serious composers, it
is no longer employed by serious composers of the mainstream,''
Wuorinen wrote. ``It has been replaced or succeeded by the 12-tone
system, first initiated by Schoenberg, subsequently developed into
a world of chromaticism extending far beyond the domains originally
envisioned for its use.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times Straus restates that the serial and atonal
composers constituted a minority, ``hardly a position of
dominance.'' But the history of the world, from the Roman Empire to
modern South Africa, is filled with examples of minorities
controlling majorities. Straus concedes as much when he raises the
question of prestige.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly serialism in this period commanded an intellectual
interest out of proportion to its actual measurable presence on the
musical scene,'' he writes. The scientific aura, novelty and
intellectual chic of 12-tone theory appealed to composers who were
steadily losing an audience among mainstream concertgoers and who,
disastrously, reacted to the situation by retreating into academic
havens, where their complex works at least provoked discussions
among their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Prestige cannot be measured with charts and data bases. You had
to have been caught in the battle to understand the tyranny, as it
was experienced by the tonalists. The trenches were in the
classrooms, recital halls and lunch hangouts of every U.S.
university with an important music department. On these campuses,
the most formidably complex serialist and 12-tone composers were
intimidating figures. Vulnerable composition students were easily
intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to report on the climate of the times without
resorting to personal recollections, and everyone who went through
the period had them. As a music student at Yale in the early 1970s,
I remember countless instances in which the prejudice against tonal
music was voiced unabashedly. One fellow student, a fine young
tenor, was ridiculed by a group of faculty and student composers at
lunch one day for daring to suggest that Britten's song cycle
``Winter Words,'' which he intended to sing in his degree recital,
was an important contemporary work.
</P>
<P>
   Once, a professor in a 20th-century analysis course would not
allow my choice of a Shostakovich string quartet as a topic for a
paper. Just try back then to defend Copland as a composer worthy of
attention, and you would be greeted by condescending scoffs. Even
Stravinsky's Neo-Classical works were regarded by many composers in
the modernist camp as really rather slight.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to understand that ingenious serialist composers
everywhere were writing exciting and provocative works. The problem
arose when young composers slavishly tried to imitate their
teachers. There was nothing stranger than hearing rigorous,
humorless, dry-as-dust 12-tone works by young Americans who had
grown up with the Beatles and the Band.
</P>
<P>
   One telling incident truly captured the tense climate of the
times. The composer Marvin David Levy received a commission from
the Metropolitan Opera to help celebrate the opening of its new
house at Lincoln Center. Levy's work, ``Mourning Becomes Electra,''
based on the O'Neill play, was given its premiere in 1967. Levy,
then 35, was no tepid tonal composer. His music was gritty, thickly
chromatic, pungent with dissonance. But as if to appease the
academics, he force-fed his score with tone rows and reined in its
lyricism. This wound up pleasing neither Met audiences nor the
12-tone dogmatists. The failure crushed him.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 years later, he was invited to revise the work for a
revival at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Though he did not radically
change the music, he cleared it of extraneous 12-tone complexities
and allowed it to sing more lyrically. He essentially composed the
work he had wanted to write in the first place, he has said in
interviews. It was performed during the 1998-99 season in Chicago
to critical and popular acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Established composers were also casualties of the battle. One is
Harold Shapero, born in 1921. In the 1940s and '50s, Shapero was
one of the most original and accomplished American Neo-Classical
composers. But during the 1960's and afterward, while he continued
to teach at Brandeis University, his output slowed to almost a
standstill. Although he does not like to talk about it today, he
could not bring himself to embrace 12-tone techniques that his
Neo-Classical colleagues on the faculty, like Arthur Berger and
Irving Fine, did. The dismissal of his tonal music in academic
circles eventually defeated him.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Straus' article is instructive and important. Like
other critics quoted in the article, I am probably guilty of having
used the term ``serialism'' too loosely in the past. Straus is of
course correct that many composers who were vigorously atonal never
employed full-fledged serial procedures. Whenever the ``dominance''
of 12-tone composers during that period is evoked, it should be
made clear that this was never a numerical dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The development of 12-tone composition was one of the most
invigorating occurrences of 20th-century music. As John Harbison
likes to point out, the challenge of 12-tone theory made some
composers who never quite adopted the techniques _ Messiaen, for
one _ question themselves, rethink their work and emerge even
greater. A vast number of bracing and lastingly important 12-tone
works were produced during those decades. Most important, the
12-tone technique remains a vital and valid resource for composers
today, when a wider range of musical styles exists than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   But I, like many critics and musicians, will never be argued out
of my view that the dogma of the 12-tone composers during those
decades had an intimidating and, on balance, hurtful impact on
American composers, especially young ones. I was there during the
battle, in the trenches, even if I was mostly just ducking for
cover and waiting for the fighting to subside.

For Williams sisters, family ties supersede shot at title
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JODY GOLDSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON _ When sisters Venus and Serena Williams used to face
each other as kids on the courts in Compton, Calif., Serena didn't
always play fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a problem with cheating when I was younger,'' she
admitted. ``Because I love to win. She was bigger and stronger. She
had unfair advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, being the older sister, Venus let her get away with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Serena was a cheater,'' Venus said. ``I just rolled with
it. It's tough to argue against Serena, because she was so good at
arguing, so good at cheating, it was no use.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen when they meet next. The two kids from Compton,
the ones their father predicted would one day be Nos. 1 and 2 in
the world, have proved to be two of the top four this year at
Wimbledon. One of them will walk off the court today with a chance
to play Saturday for the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still kind of trying to soak it up,'' Serena said after
both women advanced to the semifinals. ``One Williams will
definitely be in the final for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a whirlwind week and a half for their father, Richard,
the man responsible for getting them to this semifinal showdown.
It's his first trip to Wimbledon _ he hates to fly but finally came
over when the kids begged _ and he's spent his time running back
and forth between singles courts. He also watched his girls win
their first three doubles matches, those as partners.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras captured him going back and forth, with his two
daughters playing their singles quarterfinals at the same time on
courts about 500 yards apart. Serena, however, needed only 40
minutes for her match, so both younger sister and Dad were in the
stands to watch Venus pull out a long three-setter.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Williams said he won't be pulling for either
daughter today. As a matter of fact, he's taking the day off and
won't even watch. Instead, the quirky father said he plans to honor
a prior commitment to attend a funeral, despite the fact he never
met the deceased, who was a friend of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls will be trying to bury each other, so I thought it
would be better for me to go to a real funeral,'' Richard Williams
explained. ``At least there I get music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go watch Venus beat up on Serena, or Serena
beat up on Venus. Who would I pull for? The wife would leave me.''
</P>
<P>
   While most opponents don't see each other until just before a
match, Venus and Serena Williams continued business as usual. After
their semifinal matchup was set, they still had to go out and play
a third-round doubles match together. They then went home, spent
the evening together, got up and won a quarterfinal doubles match
and even maintained their off-day routine of practicing with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   They don't expect any coaching from dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to get any advice,'' Venus said.
``At this point, my dad will probably say, 'Here's the balls. Go
practice.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time they've been in this situation, though
it's clearly the most significant match, with the winner earning a
spot in the final against either defending champion Lindsay
Davenport or Jelena Dokic.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters have met four times before, with Venus holding a 3-1
lead over her younger sister. However, in their last encounter, the
1999 Compaq Grand Slam, Serena won in three sets.
</P>
<P>
   Serena swears there's no jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sibling rivalry,'' she stressed, adding that there
is a concession for the loser. ``Sure, one of us will be bitter
(about losing), but not to the degree you'd usually be bitter if
you lost in the semifinals. One of us will be in the final. That
will be great. We're always happy for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis is just a game. Family is forever. I don't even think
I'll be playing in 10 years. I don't want to ruin something that
could last a lifetime for something that just lasts a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, that's easier for her to say. Venus already
had to sit in the stands and watch as her sister hoisted a U.S.
Open trophy over her head last September. Venus then was off the
tour for most of this year with nagging injuries, and there was
plenty of speculation about jealousy in the household.
</P>
<P>
   If Serena wins another Grand Slam event, this one at Venus'
expense, it could be a tough pill to swallow, particularly with
Venus viewing this as her big chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as an opportunity, not an opportunity against
Serena,'' Venus said.
</P>
<P>
   Though one will walk away the loser, that's not anything they're
worrying about right now. Richard Williams said he plans to put $75
down on each girl, and for at least a few more hours, the girls are
simply enjoying the spotlight together _ attention they always
thought they'd earn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always believed that,'' Venus said. ``Our parents told us
that this would happen. That's what we were working for. That's how
we saw it. That's how we visualized it. We were always taught to
believe we were the best.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ After a spring of ever-shifting strategies and
messages, Vice President Al Gore has turned to more red-meat,
populist themes that appeal to the Democratic faithful.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gore criticized drug companies for the second time
in three days, accusing them of ``price gouging'' and putting
``millions of dollars'' into a ``phony'' group that ``is polluting
the public airwaves with special interest TV ads designed to
deceive the American people about a prescription drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week he crusaded against ``Big Oil,'' suggesting that high
fuel prices in the Midwest could be due to collusion. Before that
he portrayed himself as acting on behalf of economically pressed
Americans, ``not just the ones who think comfortably about their
savings over scotch in the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's populist appeals have allowed him to speak in a voice
distinct from President Clinton's, tying the vice president back to
his own record in Congress where, as a young lawmaker, he fought
excessive drug company profits. Four years ago, when he ran for
re-election, Clinton largely shied away from such pointed appeals
to class and attacks on the powerful when his advisers decided that
the election should be fought over values.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore faces challenges Clinton did not. Unlike Clinton in
1996, Gore has been lagging slightly behind his Republican opponent
in many recent polls, in part because Democrats are not rallying
behind him as enthusiastically as Republicans are supporting Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. And, on his left, Gore has to contend with
Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate running on the Green Party line.
Nader is drawing only about 5 percent in the polls, but some Gore
supporters fear that, in a tight race, even a small percentage
could hurt Gore in key states.
</P>
<P>
   So the vice president's advisers and Democratic supporters say
the themes now being sounded by the vice president serve several
purposes. For one, they are supposed to stoke the perception that
Bush, whose campaign has raised record sums, is the candidate of
the well off. ``He's taken $90 million in this campaign, which is
unprecedented, and time and again he took the side of the special
interests,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The tones also rally the Democratic faithful. Gore appeared
today before some of his party's staunchest supporters, a teachers
union gathering here in Philadelphia, and conference of the African
Methodist Episcopal Church in Cincinnati. The audience at the
American Federation of Teachers convention here often cheered as
Gore criticized the insurance industry and pledged to give all
children health insurance. And though aides say it is not Gore's
primary intent, the attack on corporate interests co-opts some of
Nader's own anti-corporate message.
</P>
<P>
   By portraying himself as a fighter for the common man against
big business, Gore also takes one of his vulnerabilities _ that he
can seem strident _ and tries to turn it into a plus. As he put it
several times this week, ``The question is whether you're for the
people or for the power.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk is one that Clinton strategists identified four years
ago when they argued that class-based appeals do not get a
Democratic candidate above 50 percent with the voters because they
start to turn off as many people as they rally.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's aides say that, despite his comment about scotch
drinkers at the club, he is more often taking on corporate
interests that the public distrusts than he is the well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   At his appearance here, for example, he said, ``We know our
opponents in this election are on the side of the powerful, not the
people, and they have powerful interests lined up against us _ from
the big oil companies to the HMOs to the polluters.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides say these themes will resonate with swing voters as
much as with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues are core Democratic issues,'' said Douglas
Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, ``but they appeal to voters across the
board,''
</P>
<P>
   And Bush is no longer criticizing Bush head-on, the way he did
in the spring when he spoke of Bush's ``risky'' tax scheme and
criticized every Bush proposal. Instead, he goes after certain
business interests that he then tries to link to either the
congressional Republicans, Bush or both.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his fire Wednesday was against Citizens for Better
Medicare, a group that, despite its name, was started by drug
manufacturers. It has spent more than $2 million in recent weeks on
television advertisements opposing the Democrats' plan for a
Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Citizens for Better Medicare that was distributed
on his campaign plane, Gore challenged the group's leaders to make
public its donor list and show who was behind it. ``The American
people deserve to know who exactly is trying to influence this
critical issue,'' he said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance before the teachers, Gore said the group
should be called Citizens for Bad Medicare, saying, ``That's what
they are promoting _ our opponent's plan, which tells seniors to go
beg the HMOs and the insurance companies with help with
prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was referring to the House Republicans' plan for a
prescription drug benefit, which broadly follows principles Bush
has set out. Their bill gives subsidies and incentives to insurance
companies to provide drug coverage to Medicare recipients. Gore has
a more expansive plan that would offer the benefits directly
through the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Zielinski, a spokesman for the group, said it was reviewing
Gore's letter to decide on a response. He said the coalition had
not disguised its drug company backing.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore was delivering his criticisms, Democratic officials
sought to demonstrate ties between the pharmaceutical industry and
Republicans. They said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media
consultant who helped produce the commercials for Citizens for
Better Medicare, also had ties to the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush, said that Castellanos'
firm, National Media had no role in making Bush's campaign
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush adviser acknowledged that the company did buy media
time for the Bush campaign, but said that Castellanos was on the
``creative side'' of the company and was not involved in buying
time for the Bush commercials.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan accused Gore of trying to ``divert attention away from
his Washington, D.C., one-size-fits-all'' approach to providing a
drug benefit directly through the federal Medicare program. He also
noted that three of Gore's friends and advisers _ Peter Knight, Tom
Downey and Anthony Podesta _ were lobbyists for the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane, Gore's spokesman, however, noted that the vice president
was acting in opposition to the drug industry despite the ties of
some of his friends and advisers. Lehane asserted that the Bush
campaign was benefiting from the Citizens for Better Medicare
advertisements, and was putting forward ``an agenda that is in the
best interests of the pharmaceutical companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight previously worked for the Schering-Plough Corp. but has
since left the lobbying business. &QL;

STATE PANEL RECOMMENDS IMPEACHING NEW HAMPSHIRE CHIEF JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs lede, overline to clarify, vote was a recommendation;
Adds second impeachment charge in 3rd graf.) 
By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A committee of New Hampshire lawmakers voted Wednesday
night to recommend that Chief Justice David Brock of the state
Supreme Court be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to recommend impeachment of Brock on accusations
that he had committed perjury as he defended himself against
charges of ethical improprieties came on a vote of 17-5. Earlier in
the day the Judiciary Committee of the state House of
Representatives had tied, 11-11, on that question, but after
revising the charges, the members voted that there was enough
evidence of possible perjury to warrant it.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also endorsed a second article of impeachment
charging that the chief justice had called a lower-court judge in
1987 about a case involving a powerful state senator, The
Associated Press reported. The vote was 14-8. Brock has denied
making the call.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is scheduled to decide on the committee's
recommendations on July 12. If the House votes in favor of
impeachment, the trial will begin in the state Senate in August. It
would be the first Supreme Court impeachment proceeding in New
Hampshire since 1790.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier the committee had also voted 14-8 against censuring
Brock, who is accused of lying under oath, intervening improperly
in a 1987 case involving a powerful state senator and failing to
intervene properly when members of his court tried to influence
cases from which they had recused themselves _ particularly, one
justice who tried to intervene in his own divorce case. Brock
denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also decided against impeaching or reprimanding
two state Supreme Court justices, Sherman D. Horton Jr. and John T.
Broderick Jr., who were also accused of ethical missteps.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted 19-3 against impeaching Horton and 16-6
against admonishing Broderick. Both had been accused of failing to
turn in the colleague who tried to intercede in his own divorce
case and of discussing cases from which they had recused themselves
because of possible bias.
</P>
<P>
   But state Rep. Cynthia J. Dokmo, a Republican who is one of
several lawyers on the committee, said, ``Whether we impeach them
or not, their reputations are forever damaged by this process.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire judicial crisis began with an ugly divorce,
the split between a state Supreme Court justice, W. Stephen Thayer
III, and his wife, Judith, a former chairwoman of the state Board
of Education. Judith Thayer appealed aspects of the case up to the
very court on which her former husband sat, and its justices,
unable to rule on their own colleague, had to appoint a special
panel of other judges to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, according to a report by the state attorney general,
Thayer, who has since resigned, vehemently objected to the choice
of a particular judge for that panel. In response, Brock tried to
prevent the court clerk from calling that judge but was too late.
</P>
<P>
   That incident, which the court clerk reported to a judicial
conduct committee, prompted a broader inquiry into the court's
practices by the state Attorney General, Philip T. McLaughlin. It
found a worrisome pattern of justices' being allowed to comment on
cases even when they had excused themselves because of potential
conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court had already issued new rules on recusals, the
incident also raised strenuous protests from court critics across
the state, many of whom were already contending that the court
overstepped its bounds in a major 1997 ruling that revamped the
state's heavily local system of financing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Such critics in the Legislature moved this spring for an inquiry
into whether any justices should be impeached, and the Judicial
Committee of the House took up the question in April. It has since
heard weeks of testimony laying bare some of the innermost workings
of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Thayer divorce, another, somewhat dusty case
figured prominently in the discussions: accusations that in 1987,
Brock intervened in a case involving a powerful state senator and
commented that the senator held some control over justices' pay
raises. Brock denies making the call.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Thayer divorce case, Brock has testified that he had
wanted time to sort the matter out and that he had been influenced
by feelings of compassion.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Supreme Court justices are appointed by the
governor, though Gov. Jeanne Shaheen has recently created a special
screening commission in response to the crisis. Supreme Court
appointments are permanent until retirement and only the
Legislature can remove the justices.

HARTFORD COURANT APOLOGIZES FOR SALE ADS IT PUBLISHED IN SLAVERY
ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ In March, a front-page article in The Hartford
Courant reported that Aetna Inc., one of Connecticut's largest
companies, had apologized for profiting from slavery by issuing
insurance policies on slaves in the 1850s. The next day, The
Courant, the state's largest newspaper, ran a second front-page
article speculating that Aetna's contrition might prompt many other
American companies to apologize ``for having reaped profits at the
cost of human freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   That prediction turned out to be accurate. On Tuesday, after a
four-month investigation into its own archives, The Courant ran yet
another front-page article, in which it apologized for having
published advertisements in its pages for the sale of slaves in the
18th and 19th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   In that article, below a banner headline, ``A Courant
Complicity, an Old Wrong,'' a spokesman for the newspaper said it
was sorry ``for any involvement by our predecessors at The Courant
in the terrible practice of buying and selling human beings that
took place in previous centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ads were common in newspapers of the 1700s and early 1800s,
when slavery was legal in many states, including Connecticut. But
even at a time when many companies are acknowledging past wrongs,
The Courant's apology is unusual _ in part because so few of those
newspapers still exist. The Courant, founded in 1764, is the oldest
continuously published newspaper in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the article about the ads appeared on Independence Day,
when many readers may have been preoccupied with holiday plans,
many blacks interviewed in Hartford on Wednesday reacted positively
to news of The Courant's apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it makes a big difference,'' said Aristede Hill, a
youth program director at Hartford's YMCA. ``I appreciate it. It
should be brought to the forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would find the article, which he had not yet read,
and show it to the youths he worked with. ``I'll definitely bring
it up,'' said Hill, 30, of Bloomfield, a Hartford suburb. ``It's
something to talk about, debate about.''
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the slave ads was known by some Courant
executives, but no one discussed it, said Lou Golden, the
newspaper's vice president and deputy publisher. But after the
Aetna article, editors in the news department began an inquiry into
The Courant's history. And when they presented their findings,
everyone agreed an apology was appropriate, Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't really focused on it, but when it came up, we
decided to act on it,'' he said. ``If we had focused on it sooner,
we would have apologized sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Courant is not the first U.S. newspaper to confront its
involvement with slavery. The paper, which said it published slave
ads from 1765 until at least 1823, is one of many across the nation
believed to have routinely printed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would just have been a natural thing that newspapers would
advertise slaves the way they would advertise any other
commodity,'' said David Brion Davis, a Yale University history
professor and author of ``The Problem of Slavery in Western
Culture,'' noting how deeply rooted slavery was, even in Northern
states like Connecticut, which abolished slavery in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tradition in American journalism goes back very early,''
said Tom Leonard, a professor of journalism at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``I've seen it in Benjamin Franklin's
`Pennsylvania Gazette' even though he was an opponent of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times was founded in 1851, after slavery was
outlawed in New York state. A spokeswoman for the Times, Catherine
Mathis, said the paper did not believe that it had run ads for the
sale or capture of slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Other newspapers have published, or are preparing to publish,
articles on their complicity in the slave trade. The forerunner of
The Times-Picayune in New Orleans, a newspaper called The Daily
Picayune, also ran advertisements seeking to sell slaves or find
runaways, a fact the paper noted in a long article in 1993, said
Jim Amoss, the newspaper's editor.

SETTLING IN FOR A LONG RUN AT THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFTON BROWN   
c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEMONT, Ill. _ The territory that once belonged to Michael
Jordan now belongs to Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that Woods has replaced Jordan as the
world's most famous active athlete. So it's fitting that Woods is
playing in the Chicago area this week, returning to action for
Thursday's first round of the Advil Western Open at Cog Hill Golf
and Country Club. On the heels of his record-setting 15-stroke
victory at the U.S. Open last month, Woods has solidified his
status as the most magnetic sports figure on the planet. Golf
fanatics watch Woods. People who don't play golf watch Woods.
People who don't even like golf watch Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Making history makes people pay attention. Serena and Venus
Williams will make history Thursday in the Wimbledon semifinals.
They are the first sisters to play each other this late in a Grand
Slam tournament in more than 100 years. And just as the Williams
sisters have excelled in a sport in which members of minority
groups have often felt lonely, Woods is showing a new generation of
youngsters that they can excel in whatever sport they choose.
</P>
<P>
   By winning 12 of his last 21 starts on the PGA Tour, Woods has
ended any debate about his ability. Nobody argues about whether
Woods is the best golfer in the world. Instead, some people are
asking this: Is Woods' dominance good or bad for golf?
</P>
<P>
   For golf, the thought of Woods winning golf tournaments for the
next 20 years doesn't carry much downside. Just the presence of
Woods at a tournament adds adrenaline to the atmosphere, just as
Jordan added a special buzz to any basketball arena. When Jordan
and the Chicago Bulls played the Los Angeles Clippers, the building
still sold out. And when Woods tees it up Thursday, as the
defending champion he will draw thousands of additional fans.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, many of Woods' peers feel overshadowed at times,
like Vijay Singh, who won the Masters in April and who is also in
this week's field. But when a player commands the spotlight as
Woods does, others simply fade into the background.
</P>
<P>
   Some players were envious of Woods and his lucrative endorsement
deals when he first joined the tour in 1996, before he won a
professional tournament. That reaction was natural. People forget
that Jordan also suffered backlash from veterans when he first
entered the NBA. Remember Jordan's first All-Star Game, when some
of his Eastern Conference teammates froze him out and refused to
pass him the ball? But through the years, Jordan earned the respect
given to the game's best player, just as Woods has done. Today,
Woods' competitors have a hard time working up much jealousy,
because they understand how good he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you could ever be tired of greatness,'' Jeff
Sluman, who won the 1988 PGA Championship, said when asked if he
tired of talking about Woods. ``I think it's great for the tour. I
can't think of anybody else, except maybe the guy that hung up his
No. 23 in town a few years ago, that would even compare to Tiger
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 24, in a sport where players can excel well into their
40s, Woods could have a run atop the sports world longer than
Jordan did. And Woods plays an individual sport, giving him far
greater control over his success than Jordan, who needed teammates
to help him win championships.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Woods met the NBA stars Grant Hill of Detroit and
Tim Duncan of San Antonio at the exclusive Isleworth community in
Orlando, Fla., where Woods lives. Duncan and Hill are being wooed
by the Magic, and Hill is reportedly ready to sign with Orlando,
tired of playing on mediocre teams with the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is unfamiliar with long-term failure. He has won at every
level, and he expects to win whenever he plays. While Woods is
looking forward to the British Open later this month, with the
chance to complete the career Grand Slam, he will not overlook this
weekend, when he will be trying to win at Cog Hill for the third
time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I turn the switch on and off?'' Woods asked Wednesday,
repeating a question. ``No. I always have it on. In order to play
at the highest level, you've got to always have it on. I've tried
to be a little more lightheaded on the golf course, but I just
can't do it. It's just not the way I play my best.''
</P>
<P>
   So this week, golf fans in the Chicago area will have a chance
to see another special athlete. Jordan had a great run with the
Bulls. But Woods' reign at the top is beginning at an earlier age,
and it could last even longer.  &QL;

BUFFETED BY SEA, FAME AND COMMERCE
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oh, for the simple life of a sailor _ being battered
by storms, struggling with broken equipment, subsisting largely on
dried bread.
</P>
<P>
   After three hectic days in New York, the crew of the Ukrainian
schooner Bat'kivshchyna, the little ship that almost didn't make it
to OpSail 2000, seemed to have grown a little weary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like New York,'' Vadim Biriukovich, at 14 the youngest
member of the crew, said on Wednesday as an endless line of
tourists waited to clamber aboard and hand him $15 for a
Bat'kivshchyna T-shirt. ``But sometimes when you get sick of the
people, it's pressure on you and you want to be somewhere alone.
Also, I am getting homesick. But I'm not complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather and the captain of the ship, Dmytro Biriukovich,
was also doing his best not to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is great, better than small town,'' the captain said
as he was hustled off the boat, docked at West 44th Street just
below the carrier Intrepid, to attend a reception at the Ukrainian
consulate, ``but I'm tired here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, New York has been very, very good business
for the grossly underfinanced Bat'kivshchyna (pronounced
Bat-keev-SHIN-a), which endured a three-month, 8,000-mile voyage
involving pretty much every hardship between stem and stern to take
part in Tuesday's grand Parade of Sail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need these T-shirts!'' Roy Kellogg, the captain's
son-in-law, barked into a borrowed cell phone. ``We need them now!
He's sending us partial shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Kellogg, a Canadian-born public relations
consultant who has been coordinating the voyage from on land,
emerged with big news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally found a sponsor,'' he announced, and introduced
Andrei Hartt, the U.S. importer of Soomska Ukrainian vodka, winner
of two of the four top spots in the most recent Beverage Trade
Institute competition in the flavored vodka category.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsorship deal involves an undisclosed amount of cash and
a large amount of merchandise, Kellogg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's provided three cases right now for New York,'' Kellogg
said, ``and will supply a party of 500 people with vodka _ that's
about 250 bottles _ in Connecticut, and provide vodka in Halifax
and Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a huge sponsorship,'' Kellogg added, ``but the crew
will love the vodka. That's why we're selling T-shirts: to get the
crew vodka. You should see how much they drink.''
</P>
<P>
   The little sightseeing that crew members have had time for has
been mostly a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buildings here fantastic,'' said Gena Vovk, the souvenir
concessionaire. ``Times Square is unbelievable. And I saw a nice
dog made of flowers, in Rockefeller Center.''
</P>
<P>
   In the four days' shore leave he has left, Vadim Biriukovich
said he hoped to visit the Virgin Megastore in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to find the Sex Pistols' album for what they won the
award on MTV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pomp of the Fourth of July seemed to have made little
impression on him. ``I don't want to lie to you,'' he said when
asked about Tuesday night's fireworks. ``I expected some kind of
picture _ something like `2000' or maybe American flag.''
</P>
<P>
   But Katya Dvornichenko, a crew member and 21-year-old philology
student, was more than contented.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my dream to see fireworks above the Statue of
Liberty,'' she said. ``I saw that. Now since that time I have no
more dreams. I do not know what to dream now.''

   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ He has ridden in more than 30,000 races.
He'll soon become only the 16th jockey in horse racing history to
reach 5,000 victories, and, yet, Ronald Ardoin's career might have
been best captured in an otherwise uneventful claiming race last
week at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Ardoin (pronounced AR-dwahn) had just lost a half-length lead on
a horse named Yoyoyo in the seventh race June 29. With the horses
coming down the stretch, Ardoin applied the whip.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoyoyo didn't respond. He was hanging _ not improving his
position _ while a horse named Fast N Away eased past to take the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then it clicked in Ardoin's veteran mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had won on this horse before when I threw a cross with the
reins in the stretch,'' Ardoin said. ``He just exploded that night
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now trailing by a half-length, Ardoin took his whip and stuck it
in his left hand and kept it there. But he moved his right hand up
the rein and started flipping it under the cheek of Yoyoyo. With
less than an eighth of a mile to go, Yoyoyo started running as if
he wanted to win again. He closed fast to win by a neck.
</P>
<P>
   When Ardoin made it back to the jockey's locker room, the place
was buzzing. About the only jockey not talking about the ride was
Roman Chapa, a younger rider who said he keeps his locker next to
Ardoin's because he wants to learn from him. Chapa stood silently
and watched a video replay to try to find out how he didn't win on
Fast N Away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that's a ride, Ronnie,'' jockey Casey Lambert said. ``I
think you'll get 5,000 before you leave here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert and the other riders weren't the only ones impressed. In
the winner's circle, Yoyoyo trainer Danny W. Payne smiled when he
greeted Ardoin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I've got to give you that one. You won this race
for us,' '' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw,'' Ardoin responded. ``I just had to do some thinking for
him tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a ``thinking man's'' jockey, Ronald Ardoin might be
it.
</P>
<P>
   Burl McBride now trains a string of horses in Texas. But he rode
against Ardoin in the 1970s at Louisiana Downs, where Ardoin is
that track's all-time leading rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of my favorites to ride for my horses now, and he was
one of the toughest I rode against,'' McBride said, ``because he's
smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever he does do something that works, he remembers it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with Yoyoyo last week. He was similar to so
many other horses when they're challenged down the lane and then
quit. At least until Ardoin resisted the urge to whack away with
the whip and instead went with something else that worked before,
an idea that popped into his head in the heat of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``His memory on a horse will outdo almost any rider's,'' Payne
said. ``It's amazing. His brain goes a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ardoin, 43, has a slender build, even for a jockey. He doesn't
use brute strength to get a horse home. Ardoin's power on a horse
comes from between his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's like playing chess,'' Ardoin said. ``When you're
on a horse, you react instead of act. I've been in every possible
situation. And I go out there with a plan A, B and C.''
</P>
<P>
   It has worked. That Ardoin is about to hit the 5,000-victory
mark puts him among the biggest names in the sport. There are only
six active jockeys with more victories than Ardoin: Laffit Pincay
Jr., Pat Day, Russell Baze, Chris McCarron, Eddie Delahoussaye and
Earlie Fires. Ardoin has won more races than Eddie Arcaro and Gary
Stevens. Before he's done, Ardoin could pass Jacinto Vasquez (5,231
wins) and make a serious run at Johnny Longden (6,032).
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Ardoin wins approximately 100 races a year, it
might be hard to reach 6,000, but it sounds like he's willing to
give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will as long as I'm healthy and feel good about it, and I
have `live' horses to ride,'' Ardoin said. ``I still like it. I
don't see a time in the near future when I'll quit. I'm still
having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He has to be having fun to ride at night and come out to the
track early the next morning to gallop and work horses. He could
let the stables' exercise riders handle that job, but Ardoin
continues to go out and get a feel for the horses he rides in the
races.
</P>
<P>
   And it looks as if he's all business in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's galloped horses for me for so many years,'' Payne said.
``If you totaled up the times he was late in the morning, it might
add up to 15 minutes. If he's coming to get on a horse for you in
the morning, you better have them tacked up and ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The countdown to 5,000 is at 15. Reaching that figure at Lone
Star might be tough with only 13 race days remaining before the
season ends July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Ardoin is quite capable of getting hot. He ended the season last
year at Lone Star by winning 13 races in 14 days. And he owns a
Lone Star record by winning six races in a single day, including
five in a row, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't get the record here, it's likely he'll get the job
done at Louisiana Downs. That's all right by Ardoin, who has won
five riding titles at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ardoin has ridden in the Breeders' Cup in 1984 and in the
Kentucky Derby in 1985 and '96, he has mostly stayed close to his
home in the Shreveport area rather than take a crack at the major
tracks in Southern California and New York. His wife of 25 years,
Patti, and his 19-year-old daughter, Natalie, are the reasons he
has stayed in one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really been blessed with my whole career,'' Ardoin said.
``I have a great marriage and a beautiful daughter, who has been
our whole life. She's in college now \Rat nearby Louisiana Tech\S
and she really has her head on her shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made a good living at this, and I got to stay close to
home when my daughter was growing up. That's priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some of those Ardoin rides. Almost 5,000, and counting.

FEMALE POLITICIANS COMPLAIN OF LENIENCY FOR OFFICERS IN PARK
MELEE 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Criticism of the Police Department's handling of the
Central Park sex attacks intensified Wednesday as a group of
prominent female politicians expressed dissatisfaction with the
punishment meted out thus far to officers accused of misconduct or
lapses in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of the attacks, too, said the department's treatment of
those officers was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Police Commissioner Howard Safir released the details
of the department's investigation of the violent aftermath of the
National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11, when groups of men
attacked at least 59 women in or near Central Park. Safir said a
dozen officers and dispatchers faced discipline for inaction or
mistakes that day.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to the investigation, eight women in elected office
met with Safir and senior police officials Wednesday morning to
express their concerns. The meeting was organized by Rep. Carolyn
Maloney of Manhattan, who requested it two weeks ago in a letter
that was signed by 21 female officials. All the women are
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's session, the women praised the department for
what they described as a swift investigation, but criticized it for
not suspending any of the accused officers or subjecting them to
the most serious possible discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Safir has said the department's investigation is not complete.
Those officers accused so far, he said, were cited for offenses
ranging from improperly classifying 911 calls to inadequately
supervising subordinates to sending home police officers just as
the attacks in the park were reaching a frenzied pace. Two officers
are also accused of not assisting victims who reported crimes to
them.
</P>
<P>
   To date, four accused officers have been reprimanded, four face
trial-like administrative hearings and four face a lesser form of
discipline that could result in a loss of 10 days of vacation time.
Department officials say that while the officers facing
administrative trials could lose their jobs if found guilty,
dismissal was unlikely. Rather, they said, possible punishments
would be moderate, and could mean the loss of up to a month of
vacation time or assignment to probationary status.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, speaking Wednesday afternoon during an appearance with
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at Public School 48 in Washington Heights,
said that the department's performance on June 11 ``was not one of
our best examples of policing a parade,'' but that commanders were
implementing measures to prevent such problems in the future.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The commissioner also said that while he assumed that officials
he met with Wednesday were acting in good faith, he questioned
whether they were also motivated by an interest in gaining news
coverage. The group held a news conference at City Hall just after
the meeting ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congresswoman Maloney asked me if I would work with her in the
future,'' he said. ``I said I would work with anybody who is
constructive and interested in doing something positive, as opposed
to doing press.''
</P>
<P>
   At times the exchanges Wednesday were testy, even personal.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the meeting, Assistant Chief William Taylor Jr.,
the commander of detectives in Manhattan, referred to victims of
the attack as ``girls,'' a reference that angered some of the
women. State Assemblywoman Adele Cohen of Brooklyn said after the
meeting that the wording was a patronizing indicator of
insensitivity in the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women _ grown women _ are referred to as women,'' she said.
``As long as law enforcement continues to think of grown women as
girls, we will not get the care and respect that we deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen's remark was met with incredulity by police officers,
who said Taylor was referring to teen-age victims.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey, a department spokesman, said: ``I
find it amazing, incomprehensible, that a New York City police
chief should be attacked for being insensitive because he referred
to teen-agers as girls. That's absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials were also angered by a remark by City
Councilwoman Annette M. Robinson of Brooklyn, who said: ``We looked
at the officers that were on duty and wondered, if they were not in
uniform, would they be the ones that participate in the kind of
behavior that was existent in Central Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir called the statement inflammatory. Fahey said it displayed
an underlying anti-police bias. ``That type of remark shows the
reverse prejudice that police officers deal with every day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Maloney's group sparred with police officials, two victims,
Ashanna Cover and Josina Lawrence, both college students, held a
separate news conference, in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Both women have notified the city of their intention to sue the
department for negligence. They said investigators had not been
forthcoming with the details of their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been left in the dark, and nobody has talked to us in
over a week,'' Cover said of the department's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Another victim, Pamela N. Abrams, 42, said in a telephone
interview that the investigation had singled out a small number of
officers for a passive attitude that was pervasive among scores of
officers at the parade. ``It's frustrating that a few people take a
rap for widespread behavior,'' she said. ``I feel in some ways they
let themselves off the hook by just reprimanding a few people.''

GIULIANI BOOKS LACK THE HOT CAMPAIGN CONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were supposed to be the hot properties of a big
New York summer: two books about the private and public lives of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, published in the middle of his incendiary
Senate campaign against the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Wayne Barrett's ``Rudy! An Investigative Biography''
and Andrew Kirtzman's ``Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City'' are
now about a man of uncertain political future with only 18 months
left in office.
</P>
<P>
   Basic Books, the publisher of Barrett, has cut back its planned
first printing to 45,000 copies from 100,000 since Giuliani dropped
out of the race citing his prostate cancer. William Morrow, the
publisher of Kirtzman, is printing 40,000 books.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Giuliani at any stage is rich material, as both authors
said Wednesday. ``His future is uncharted water,'' said Barrett, an
investigative reporter at The Village Voice. ``I don't think he's
going to disappear into the sunset with sailboats.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirtzman, a political reporter for New York 1, agreed. ``His
interest, I'm convinced, has been on the presidency,'' he said.
``Maybe that dream is gone, maybe it isn't. But he'll run for
something again.''
</P>
<P>
   Although City Hall watchers will not find any news that
dramatically changes the perception of the mayor, the books contain
revelations that fill out the picture of his two terms at City Hall
and introduce new complexity into Giuliani's past.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's book, which claims that relatives of the mayor were
connected to the mob and that his father spent time in prison for
armed robbery, also raises questions about why Giuliani, a former
federal prosecutor, became so tough on crime.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett reports that Lewis D'Avanzo, a first cousin of the
mayor's, was ``a ruthless and widely feared mob associate in charge
of a massive stolen car ring'' who was killed by FBI agents in
Brooklyn in 1977. Barrett attributes much of his information to FBI
documents. Wednesday, he also made available court and prison
papers backing up his information about the mayor's father on a Web
site that features government documents, TheSmokingGun.com.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's book makes it clear that Giuliani was not close to
D'Avanzo, even though he did invite D'Avanzo to his 1968 wedding to
Regina Peruggi, his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   Kirtzman, whose book focuses on Giuliani's two terms as mayor,
reports that after the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
immigrant, City Hall aides were so worried about Giuliani's
unapologetic response that they persuaded him to attend a focus
group of city residents intended to identify the public's deepest
feelings about him. Grudgingly, Giuliani attended the session in
April 1999, watching with his advisers on one side of a two-way
mirror as an all-white group of New Yorkers picked apart what they
said was the mayor's insensitive response to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Kirtzman writes, Giuliani exploded, venting his anger
at his pollster, Frank Luntz. ``This is a waste of time!'' Kirtzman
quotes Giuliani as yelling. ``I've learned nothing from this. I am
not going to turn against the police. I am not going to give in to
the mob mentality!''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said Wednesday that he had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's press secretary, Sunny Mindel, said Wednesday that
``the mayor hasn't seen these books, he's not going to read these
books and he has no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The books are to be available in stores next week. The
publishers of both pushed to get the them out earlier after
Giuliani withdrew.

NEWARK AIRPORT GIRDS FOR REPAIRING OF MONORAIL
</HEADLINE>
  By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK _ With repairs scheduled to begin this weekend on parts
of Newark International Airport's ailing monorail system, the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey announced a plan Wednesday to
use 57 new buses and vans, as well as 200 new employees and an
extensive system of signs, to ease travelers through the
disruption.
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day, the monorail system, which serves 30,000 people a
day at the nation's eighth largest airport, will close for three
months for the repair work, and the buses and vans will be the only
airport-provided transport between terminals, rental car sites and
outlying parking locations.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the sections of the four-year-old, 1.9-mile-long
rail system that will be the immediate focus of repairs and service
disruptions are at the far ends of the line, which serve parking
and car rental sites. Monorail service among the airport's three
main passenger terminals and some closer locations will not be
affected, said John S. Jacoby, assistant director of airport
operations for the Port Authority, which operates the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The repairs became necessary after service was disrupted for
five days in January, when the system's operator discovered that a
design flaw had caused water to accumulate and damage the heating
elements that were supposed to prevent icing in winter on the
system's single rail.
</P>
<P>
   The repairs, which are expected to cost $25 million, will be
paid for by ADtranz, the Pittsburgh-based division of
Daimler-Chrysler that operates the $354 million monorail.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the temporary bus service, signs, additional
employees and advertising and marketing is estimated at $9 million,
and Port Authority officials are still in negotiations with the
monorail operator over who will pay.
</P>
<P>
   Bright orange signs have already started to appear at the
airport, informing travelers of the new ``Monorail Bypass''
arrangements that will start this weekend. Airlines are expected to
make on-board announcements of the disruption to their arriving
passengers, and computerized systems used by many travel agents
will carry alerts about the changes. Local radio stations will also
broadcast announcements about the disruptions, encouraging
travelers to plan for up to 30 minutes' more time spent traveling
in and around the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The new white buses and vans, emblazoned with the words
``Monorail Bypass'' in bright orange letters, will be driven by 80
new bus drivers and scheduled to run at five-minute intervals,
Jacoby said. The longest travel time that anyone is likely to have
from getting onto the bus to getting off at the destination is
estimated to be 24 minutes, and that will be at peak travel times
between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 additional customer service representatives dressed in
their trademark bright red blazers will be put on duty to assist
travelers in making their way to and from the temporary bus
services. And more than 40 supervisors and support workers will be
added as well, Jacoby said.

RACE FOR WINSTON CUP READS LIKE 17-RACE SPRINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Halfway through the NASCAR Winston Cup schedule, native Texan
Bobby Labonte sits atop a points chase that could take another 17
races to sort out.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the ultimate way to determine the 2000 Cup
champion _ at the season-ending NAPA 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway
on Nov. 21. That scenario failed to unfold a year ago, when Dale
Jarrett declined to cooperate and clinched his first title at the
33rd of 34 events.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through 2000, however, there is every indication that
this championship will go the distance. Considering the season
began with a ``boring'' Daytona 500 and fan and media criticism
that ultimately prompted Jarrett to defend the quality of Cup
racing, that represents a huge turnaround in perception.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the tight points race stands as the best story
of the season's first half.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that after his victory in the Pepsi 400 last July,
Jarrett had scored 2,674 points and held a 177-point lead on
runner-up Labonte. Third-place Mark Martin was 234 points out. Jeff
Burton was in fourth, 255 points behind Jarrett. And fifth-place
Jeff Gordon, then the reigning and three-time series champion, was
394 points back of the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, Labonte and Martin held their positions the remainder
of the season, with Jarrett winning the championship by a
comfortable 201 points.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to Saturday night at the Daytona International
Speedway, where Labonte finished 12th in the Pepsi 400. Labonte,
with 2,527 points, saw his lead on runner-up and seven-time series
champion Dale Earnhardt reduced from 67 to 52 points. Jarrett, the
Pepsi 400 runner-up, is third overall, 76 points behind Labonte.
Ward Burton is fourth, 180 points back.
</P>
<P>
   That 180 number is significant. Under NASCAR's scoring system,
the winner of a Cup race is awarded 175 points. That total climbs
to 180 if he leads a single lap and to 185 if he leads the most
laps in that event. Given the right circumstances, that means
Earnhardt, Jarrett and Ward Burton are within a single victory of
moving into the points lead. Furthermore, fifth-place Jeff Burton
is only 213 points out after his victory in the Pepsi 400.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the points separation from leader Jarrett to
10th-place Jeremy Mayfield was a runaway 656 points. Heading into
New Hampshire International Speedway for Sunday's New England 300,
the points separation from Labonte to 10th-place Gordon is 334.
That gap certainly is significant, but it is the second-lowest
difference since the modern era points system was introduced in
1975. In 1989, the difference from first to 10th was 311 points.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through 2000, this championship is far from being sorted
out.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other items that made headline news since the
season-opening Daytona 500 on Feb. 20:
</P>
<P>
   History favors Bobby Labonte's championship bid: Labonte took
the points lead for the first time after the third race, at Las
Vegas Motor Speedway, and has held it for 14 of 15 weeks since.
Leading at halfway is a good thing. The last leader at the half not
to win the championship was the late Davey Allison in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt challenging for eighth title: A year ago, Earnhardt
was seventh in points, 492 behind Jarrett and sucking air.
Earnhardt's victory total (one) is the same as last year at the
half, but his seven top-fives and 14 top-10s are four better in
each category than in 1999. At 49, does Earnhardt have the stamina
to make it through the dog days of summer? That's a stupid
question.
</P>
<P>
   Two new tracks added to 2001 Cup schedule: Much to the chagrin
of the management of Texas Motor Speedway, the Winston Cup schedule
will grow to 36 points-paying events with the additions of races at
Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, Ill., and Kansas Speedway in Kansas
City, Kan. Meanwhile, a first-half season record of 223,000 fans
turned out for the DirecTV 500 at TMS in Fort Worth on April 2.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty killed in practice crash: Petty, 19, the first
fourth-generation athlete in any sport, was killed while driving
his Busch Grand National car at New Hampshire International
Speedway on May 12. Petty made what proved to be his only Cup start
at TMS on April 2. Sadly, NASCAR has yet to pinpoint the cause of a
crash that has devastated Kyle Petty and NASCAR's royal family.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON ... Funny Cars facing Showdown revision
</P>
<P>
   It took NHRA Funny Car champion John Force a little more than
five seconds to rock the drag-racing establishment last July, when
he won the inaugural Winston Showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Force defeated Top Fuel driver Bob Vandergriff Jr. in the final
of the first-ever Funny Car vs. Top Fuel matchup at the Bristol
(Tenn.) Dragway. Billed as the National Hot Rod Association's first
true all-star event, the unique format generated enough notoriety
and controversy to warrant a second look.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 edition of the Showdown is scheduled to unfold tomorrow
through Sunday at Bristol Dragway, where Force returns as king of
the mountain, albeit with a smaller starting-line handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Both the NHRA's Top Fuel Dragster and Funny Car classes are
powered by supercharged, nitromethane-burning 500 cubic-inch
engines. The minimum weight of a Top Fuel car is 2,150 pounds,
including the driver. The minimum weight of a Funny Car is 2,325
pounds, including the driver. To even up that differential last
year, NHRA officials used a handicap based on an average of
qualifying times that gave the Funny Cars an advantage of 0.36
seconds off the starting line.
</P>
<P>
   But after some grousing from the Top Fuel camp, the NHRA has
revised the system. Graham Light, the NHRA's senior vice president
of racing operations, and his staff took an average of the top six
qualified cars in Top Fuel and Funny Car at each national event run
in 2000. The average for each event was added and the differential
between Top Fuel and Funny Car worked out to 0.28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask any Funny Car driver and they're not going to like the
sounds of that,'' said Tony Pedregon, Force's teammate and driver
of the Castrol Syntec Ford Mustang. ``The NHRA is basing all of
this off an average. They seem to have forgotten the reaction time
discrepancy has been overlooked. A Top Fuel car is 200 pounds
lighter; it reacts quicker than a Funny Car and that really wasn't
calculated into the formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no complaints. The format will be very fair. It'll keep
the crew chiefs a little more aggressive. Maybe if luck shines on
us we can repeat what John did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Force, driver of the Castrol GTX Ford Mustang, covered the
quarter-mile in 5.470 seconds at 262.18 mph. Vandergriff, who, like
Force, qualified No. 1 in his class last year, ran 5.876 seconds at
243.90 mph in the final.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ever-changing atmospheric conditions, the Top
Fuel and Funny Car teams will be competing this year under the
NHRA's new ``90 percent'' nitromethane rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the Top Fuel teams have adapted to that as well,'' said
Pedregon, a first-round loser to Top Fueler Tony Schumacher last
summer. ``The only areas you can gain is in the tuneup. The drivers
have to reach into their little bag and hope they can get out of
the gate as quickly as they can. There's a lot at stake. Lots of
pride.''
PIT STOPS \Nsubheds:CART tests at Chicago Reigning CART champion
Juan Montoya will be joined by seven other event winners from the
2000 FedEx Championship Series in the second Open Test of the
season today and tomorrow at Chicago Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.029-mile oval is located in the Chicago suburb of Cicero,
Ill., where teams will compete in the Target Grand Prix on July
28-30.
</P>
<P>
   The test will feature use of the Handford MK1, the superspeedway
variant of the rear-wing aerodynamic package utilized by CART at
its oval events. The Handford MK1 will be the only rear-wing aero
package allowed during today's on-track activity. \Nsubheds:Montoya
tops quarterly vote Juan Montoya, winner of the 84th Indianapolis
500, has topped second-quarter balloting for Driver of the Year.
Montoya polled 12 of 15 first-place votes and 121 points to
outdistance NASCAR Winston Cup rookie Dale Earnhardt Jr. and NHRA
Top Fuel driver Gary Scelzi, who earned 41 points each.
\Nsubheds:Zanardi may rejoin CART Alex Zanardi might be making a
cameo appearance in the CART series.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi, CART champion in 1997-98 for Target/Chip Ganassi
Racing, is scheduled to test in Mo Nunn's Reynard/Mercedes on
Saturday and Sunday in Sebring, Fla. Zanardi could compete in the
Molson Indy at Toronto on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having worked with Alex in the past, I really am interested in
his feedback,'' said Nunn, who was Zanardi's engineer for both of
his championship seasons. Nunn is in his first season as a team
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi left CART after the 1998 campaign to return to Formula
One with team owner Frank Williams. But the Italian was dropped at
the end of last season after failing to score a point.
</P>
<P>
   American Bryan Herta currently is driving for Nunn, replacing
the injured Tony Kanaan. The Brazilian broke ribs and his left
wrist in a crash at Detroit last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all goes well, and Alex is totally comfortable, we just
might see him before Tony is fit to resume as our full-time
driver,'' said Nunn, who added that Zanardi could be in a
second-team entry in 2001. \Nsubheds:Surgery sidelines Amato Eye
surgery will force five-time NHRA Top Fuel champion Joe Amato to
skip the second annual Winston Showdown at Bristol Dragway this
weekend. Amato, 52, underwent laser surgery to repair two tears in
the retina of his right eye in Scranton, Pa., on June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunn, who has 10 career Top Fuel wins and was fourth in
points while driving for Darrell Gwynn last year, will drive
Amato's DynoMax/Valvoline/Keystone Automotive Dragster in the
all-star event. \Nsubheds:Dodge logs track time As NASCAR's
``common template'' or ``aero matching'' program continues to
develop, the Dodge Intrepid R/T completed three test sessions last
month under the supervision of point man Ray Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham, former crew chief for three-time Cup champion Jeff
Gordon, said he wants to test next at 1-mile and 1.5-mile
racetracks. NASCAR Busch Grand National regular Casey Atwood has
logged the bulk of test miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning on presenting an initial view of the car to
NASCAR before the Brickyard 400 \Rnext month\S, and presenting the
final view some time after the race,'' said Evernham, who will
field the Dodges driven by former Cup champion Bill Elliott and
Atwood beginning next year. ``If the engine is ready, we'll present
that, too.'' \Nsubheds:The last word ``The rules of the
championship are clear. If we don't win, they \RMcLaren-Mercedes\S
do.'' _ Jean Todt, director of Formula One racing for Ferrari

RANGERS PITCHER DAVIS DEALS WITH REAL LIFE FIRST, THEN WITH
BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Pitcher Doug Davis is fighting for a
permanent spot on the Rangers' roster.
</P>
<P>
   But when he pitched two hitless innings against the Oakland A's
to earn his second victory of the season on Tuesday, Davis' mind
strayed from balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I really cared about was my son the whole time I was
pitching,'' Davis said. ``I really didn't even think about who I
was facing or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after being recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma for the
second time this season, Davis was roughed up by the Mariners for
three runs in 21/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he was headed back to Oklahoma City. He hadn't been
sent down. The news came from his wife, Stacy, and it was far more
frightening than any demotion. His 6-week-old son Jordan, violently
ill with a stomach disorder, was on the verge of needing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in and told Bos \RRangers pitching coach Dick Bosman\S
I couldn't be here tonight \RTuesday\S,'' Davis said. ``It ended up
Tuesday morning they had to do surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   It was discovered that Davis' sonhad pyloric stenosis, a
developmental problem in which the muscle at the outlet of the
stomach enlarges so much that it obstructs the stomach's outlet. It
occurs only in infants and affects about one in 500.
</P>
<P>
   It causes the infant to vomit forcefully soon after eating. No
one knows how or why the disorder affects certain infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started about two weeks ago,'' said Davis, 24, who also has
a 21/2-year-old daughter, Drew. ``He just threw up once a feeding,
then once every 24 hours, then it was twice a night, then it was
every third feeding, then every feeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Davis underwent successful surgery at 9 a.m. Tuesday at
an Oklahoma City hospital. By 10 a.m., a relieved father caressed
his son.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., Davis was on an airplane and headed for The Ballpark
in Arlington. A starter at Oklahoma with an 8-3 record and 2.84
earned-run average in 69 2/3 innings, Davis pitched in relief
Tuesday in the sixth inning with runners at second and third and no
outs.
</P>
<P>
   In front of a sold-out Fourth of July crowd, Davis surrendered a
run-scoring sacrifice fly to Jason Giambi, then got Ben Grieve to
fly out and struck out Olmedo Saenz to get the Rangers out of the
jam. In the scoreless seventh inning, he walked two but struck out
two to earn the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' short-term future with the Rangers is uncertain. He could
be headed back to the RedHawks when Darren Oliver or Ryan Glynn
return from injuries. Or, the Rangers could keep him and use him in
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``What his role is, I don't know right now,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``He's starting in the minor leagues. What he
did \RTuesday\S, he showed he can help us at the big-league level
out of the bullpen. What his immediate role is past this week, I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Rangers decide, Davis will be back in Oklahoma City
on Monday, spending the All-Star break at home with his family.

STATUS UNCERTAIN FOR RANGERS SHORTSTOP CLAYTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers shortstop Royce Clayton, sidelined
with a strained muscle in his left side, said he should be ready to
play tomorrow. Manager Johnny Oates isn't as confident and said it
could be after the All-Star break until he's back in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the doctor says he's ready to play, he'll play,'' Oates
said. ``If the doctor says hold him out, we'll hold him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, who injured himself in Sunday's game, said he could
have played yesterday but wanted to use today's day off to give
himself extra time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready for Friday,'' Clayton said. \Nsubheds:Former
prospect earns star Add Florida Marlins pitcher Ryan Dempster to
the long list of former Rangers who were drafted by former scouting
director Sandy Johnson and have gone on to greater glory with other
teams. Dempster, who is 9-4 with a 3.39 earned-run average, was
selected yesterday to the National League All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster was taken in the third round of the 1995 draft but was
traded to the Marlins on Aug. 8, 1996 along with Rick Helling for
pitcher John Burkett.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time we made the deal, we knew he would be a pretty
good pitcher,'' Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said. ``We
thought he'd be a No. 1, 2 or 3 starter in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he still believes the Rangers would not have made
the playoffs in 1996 without adding Burkett for the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember at the time, there was a big outcry in Seattle, how
did they let him get through waivers,'' said Melvin, pointing out
that the trade was made after the July 31 non-waiver trading
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to give up a little more because we were past the
deadline and there weren't many other options,'' Melvin said. ``If
he had been with us, he wouldn't have become an All-Star this year
because he probably wouldn't have gone to the big leagues until
this year. He got to the big leagues quicker with the Marlins than
with us.'' \Nsubheds:Alicea disappointed The Rangers were left with
only one All-Star for just the second time in 10 years. New York
Yankees manager Joe Torre declined to select a Ranger as a pitcher
or a reserve to join catcher Ivan Rodriguez for the trip to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Luis Alicea, who was hitting .314 before last
night's game, had his hopes up, but Torre selected just one second
baseman in reserve, Chicago's Ray Durham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, but it's all right,'' Alicea said.
``Durham's having a good year. I still had a great first half, I
just need to keep getting more hits. Maybe I can get 200 hits.''
\Nsubheds:Extra work for Kapler Center fielder Gabe Kapler came out
yesterday for early work on his throws to home plate. Kapler cost
the Rangers a run in Tuesday's game with a throw that sailed high
and wide, going all the way to the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the outfield, you may go 10 games and make one
throw that means something,'' Kapler said. ``I wanted to remind
myself what it's like to make a good, crisp throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler, who moved from right to center when Ruben Mateo broke
his leg, said throwing to home plate is different in center field
than in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In right field, you can bounce the ball 100 times to home
plate,'' Kapler said. ``In center field, you've got to clear the
mound or the ball can bounce 100 different ways. It can be a little
tricky.''

THE METS SIMPLY GRIN AND WIN IT IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Last Dec. 23 was a fulfilling day at the office for
Steve Phillips, and he is rewarded for that work on nights like
this.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that day that Phillips, the Mets' general manager,
traded Roger Cedeno, Octavio Dotel and a minor leaguer to the
Houston Astros for the No. 1 starter Mike Hampton and Derek Bell,
an expensive outfielder whose skills seemed to be declining.
</P>
<P>
   Both new Mets are having solid seasons, and they teamed up
Wednesday night to help the Mets bash the Florida Marlins, 11-2, at
Pro Player Stadium. Hampton improved his record to 8-5 with six
strong innings and had three hits. Bell went 3 for 4 to help the
Mets avoid a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Hampton was making his final start before the
All-Star Game break, which starts next Monday. But Hampton did his
part to make sure he would be an option for Sunday's start against
the Yankees. He worked six innings, allowing two runs (one earned)
on four hits and two walks. His three hits tied a personal mark and
a club record for a pitcher while improving his batting average to
.318.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton batted for himself in the seventh inning, with the Mets
leading, 8-2, and he helped increase the lead with a run-scoring
single. The Mets scored twice in the seventh, and manager Bobby
Valentine brought in Dennis Cook for the seventh. Hampton had
thrown only 79 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have been evasive about whether they would consider
starting Hampton on three days' rest on Sunday. When asked directly
Wednesday if the left-hander Bobby M. Jones would make his
scheduled start on Sunday, Valentine was short: ``How would I know?
Is it going to rain? He's set to pitch that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine would not dismiss the idea that Hampton might pitch
instead, and the perfect scenario played out Wednesday night: The
Mets built a big lead, and Hampton left early with a low pitch
count.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever pitches against the Yankees, the Mets will have one more
weapon than they did when the teams met in June. Bell was in the
middle of a dreadful slump in that series, and although he had five
runs batted in when the Mets beat the Yankees, 12-2, it was only a
one-day vacation from his slump.
</P>
<P>
   Bell has been wildly streaky for the Mets this season, and his
hot streaks and slumps have been long. After a slow start, he
blistered National League pitching for a .404 average over 36
games. Then he slumped for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bell is hot again. He is deliberately trying to pull the
ball, but by starting his swing earlier, he has also been better at
hitting to right. He singled to right in the first inning, then
singled to right-center in the third.
</P>
<P>
   With two on and no outs in the sixth, the Marlins reliever Joe
Strong tried to back Bell off the plate, coming inside with a
fastball. Bell crushed it into the seats above the tall left-field
scoreboard for a three-run homer, increasing the Mets' lead to 8-1.
He hit a three-run shot to the same location on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's singles had helped the Mets build Wednesday night's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Mora led off the game with a single off Chuck Smith, and
Bell followed with another. Mike Piazza's single to right scored
Mora, and Robin Ventura brought in Bell with a groundout to put the
Mets ahead, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Bell and Piazza also singled in the third, and Todd Zeile drew a
two-out walk to load the bases. Jay Payton chopped a ball to the
first-base side of the pitcher's mound, and Smith overran it.
Payton was safe, Bell scored, and one batter later Benny Agbayani
drove in two with a single to put the Mets ahead, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   The game had started off ominously for the Mets, who had taken a
5-0 lead on Tuesday but ended up losing, 9-8. Their two-run lead
Wednesday was put into jeopardy right away on an error by the
shortstop, Mora.
</P>
<P>
   Mora made one error on Tuesday, prolonging a six-run inning that
lifted the Marlins to a victory. He also made a critical misplay
that was not scored an error when he had trouble removing the ball
from his glove and was unable to catch Mark Kotsay at home plate on
the back end of a double steal.
</P>
<P>
   Mora discussed the play before Wednesday night's game, saying
that he would easily have thrown out Kotsay had he not held the
ball so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we lose, I feel guilty, because I'm a part of the team,''
Mora said. ``When we lose, everybody loses, and I feel really bad.
But now I feel comfortable because I play every day, so I can do
little by little for the team, help the team offensively and
defensively and try to do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he never compares Mora defensively with Rey
Ordonez, the three-time Gold Glove winner who is out for the
season. &QL;
