<HEADLINE> Pak FM: Lifting of Sanctions to Avert Short-term Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Saturday said the partial lifting of U.S. sanctions
will "avert a short-term economic crisis" for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Sartaj was talking to journalists on the eve of an
International Monetary Fund (IMF) team's arrival here for talks
with Pakistani officials.
</P>
<P>
"We will solve our immediate economic problems and a short-term
crisis will be averted as the IMF and other financial institutions
have given green signals for releasing the stalled loans," he
said.
</P>
<P>
About the talks with the IMF team, which flies into the capital
 Monday, he said there has been general understanding on issues
with the financial institution.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the IMF will release about 530
million U.S. dollars and the World Bank and Asian Development Bank
will release 1.2 billion dollars within the current financial
year.
</P>
<P>
While Paris Club, which is scheduled to meet on December 7, is
expected to provide about 1 to 1.5 billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF-Pakistan talks, which began in September, are aimed at
reviving a 1.56-billion dollar Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF), which was suspended after Pakistan detonated
nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves were down from 1.43
billion dollars in May to about 500 million dollars at present.
The country's external debts stand at 32 billion dollars and it
has reportedly to pay around 1 billion dollars in debt servicing
by December.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Urged to Speed up Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak urged Sunday the government to speed up
its cooperation with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to
move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government should speed up the peace process and
the Palestinians must redouble their efforts in fighting terrorism
and only in this way could the two sides move the process forward,
Barak told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of security cooperation between the
two sides, Barak also urged the government to ratify the peace
accord the two sides signed last month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel will
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinians' tougher measures against anti-Israeli terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet postponed indefinitely on Friday the Wye
Accord's ratification following the car bombing incident in
Jerusalem, in which two Palestinian assailants were killed and 25
Israelis were injured.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu did not convene his cabinet meeting on Sunday as
usual, but went to Beer sheba, southern Israel, to attend a
ceremony of "computer for every child."
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, Netanyahu once again stressed the
importance for the Palestinians to take tough measures to fight
terror before the Israeli side ratifies the peace agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
Sunday invited applications from individuals and organizations
willing to form the implementation unit of the national HIV/AIDS
behavioral change communication strategy.
</P>
<P>
Individuals, companies, institutions and organizations
interested in becoming part of the communication implementation
unit should sent applications of not more than 10 pages to the
government tender board, according to the Ministry of
Information, Posts and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The HIV/AIDS Communication Strategy was adopted by
stakeholders and launched by Information, Posts and
Telecommunications Minister Chen Chimutengwende in September this
year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement the behavioral change
strategy had been completed with the collaboration of the Health
and Child Welfare Ministry's national aids coordination program.
</P>
<P>
The strategy's main thrust is to influence behavior change in
view of AIDS and calls for advocacy at all levels but more
specifically at the highest level of leadership, mass
communication and multimedia campaigns, community mobilization
and education.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is second in the world in terms of prevalence of AIDS
among its population with 700 people dying every week from
related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) statistics show that at
least one quarter of the adult population is infected with the
HIV virus which causes AIDS.

<P>
HARARE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Sunday arrived in Burkina Faso to attend a meeting of the
High Level Mission on the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict at the
invitation of OAU Chairman Blaise Compaore.
</P>
<P>
Also invited to the summit are Djibouti President Hassa Gouled
Aptidon and OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported from Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The High Level Mission, set up by the OAU heads of states, has
on its agenda the drafting of a framework agreement aimed at
ending the conflict in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The draft will later be presented to the Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi and Eritrean President Isias Afewerki for
their consideration.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry said the draft framework would
be based on the principles of peaceful resolution of disputes,
rejection of the use of force and respect for colonial borders,
among other things and call for end to all hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the two states broke out on May 6 this year
when security forces from both countries exchanged shells over
the control of the Yirga Triangle -- some 400 square kilometers
of land near the border with Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
Both countries now claim ownership of the disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
Although fighting has now subsided, hundreds of people were
killed in the exchanges as both sides deployed thousands of
soldiers along their 1,000-km-long border.
</P>
<P>
The two have expelled thousands of nationals deemed citizens
of the other, a situation which has seen splits in extended
families in the Horn of Africa.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Parties Lose Direction: Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa said Sunday that people made a wise decision when
they voted the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party into power in 1995
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is also national chairman of the party, noted that
the decision has enabled CCM to continue with its policies which
embody national unity, human dignity and harmonious living.
</P>
<P>
"CCM did not promise wonders to Tanzanians but have all the
same been creating an enabling environment and building capacity
for social and economic development devoid of overdependency on
foreign aid," he told a public rally in the central district of
Kondoa.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Mkapa poked fun at the
opposition parties which he said have lost both "direction and
credibility," with some even failing to maintain unity within
their own parties.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, members of some parties are at conflicts
with each other and they are at a loss to know who should be the
proper leader.
</P>
<P>
The president defended the privatization policy saying that it
has improved the operational efficiency and productivity of
government-owned enterprises, bailing the public sector out of
doldrums. The policy has put more than 150 companies under
divestiture, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president is scheduled to leave Kondoa on Monday morning
for the central city of Dodoma.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has rejected the latest
U.N. Security Council resolution which condemned the Iraqi
decision to halt all cooperation with U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) for disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz made the remarks Sunday
in his meeting with visiting former Irish Prime Minister Albert
Reynolds, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Aziz explained why Iraq's leadership
decided to halt cooperation with UNSCOM, the agency said. But it
did not give further details.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced on October 31 that it has decided to suspend
all its relations with UNSCOM, which has been in charge of
dismantling Iraq's chemical and biological weapons, and long-range
missiles since 1991.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq allows the International Atomic Energy Agency, which
takes charge of destroying Iraq's nuclear program, to continue its
mission.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein has said Baghdad will not resume
cooperation with UNSCOM unless the Security Council gives a
timetable for the removal of the sanctions imposed on Iraq after
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will not be lifted until UNSCOM verifies that Iraq
has destroyed its banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution adopted Thursday, the U.N. Security Council
condemned Iraq's non-compliance with U.N. resolutions and urged it
to resume full cooperation with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources said Sunday that it will withdraw another six
UNSCOM staffers from Iraq Tuesday. The first batch of 15 weapons
inspectors left Baghdad Saturday. UNSCOM has a staff of about 120
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reynolds, who arrived here Saturday with a joint
British-Irish parliamentary delegation, called for an early
lifting of the sanctions, saying that peaceful means should be
adopted in solving international disputes.
</P>
<P>
The visiting delegation will hold meetings with Chairman of
Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) Saadoun Hammadi to discuss
parliamentary cooperation.

ANKARA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Sunday started a
large-scale cross-border military operation against the rebels of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party in northern Iraq, Turkish
private Star TV reported here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest of a series of cross-border actions Turkish
troops have taken in northern Iraq where the PKK has taken shelter
and built camps.
</P>
<P>
The report said that about 20,000-strong Turkish government
troops have taken part in the cross-border operation in a bid to
wipe out about 200 PKK militants in northern Iraq, who escaped
from neighboring Syria.
</P>
<P>
Turkish F-16, F-15 fighter planes and military helicopters have
bombarded the PKK shelters or camps in northern Iraq, added the
report.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by Turkey and Syria in Adana,
southern Turkey, on October 20, Syria will not permit any activity
which emanates from its territory aimed at jeopardizing the
security and stability of Turkey.

Syria will not allow the supply of weapons, logistic material

other facilities for training and shelter or to have commercial
activities on its territory, said the agreement.

Al-Faisal cautioned against a possible attack pursued by the

Baghdad announced October 31 to halt all its dealings with the

The devastating U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 will not be lifted until UNSCOM
certifies that Baghdad has got rid of all its banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has said that all the options are on the table,
including military action, to force Iraq into cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspections.

<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen has just concluded a

<HEADLINE> Qatari Ambassador Affirms Goods Ties with Jordan </HEADLINE>

AMMAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Ambassador to Jordan
Sheikh Fahd Bin Jasim Bin Abdullah Al Thani said here Sunday that
Jordan's closure of a Doha-based satellite television station's
office in Amman will not harm bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Jordan have "common feelings," so Qatar understands
why the Jordanian government Wednesday closed the Al-Jazeera
television station's office in Amman and decided to stop all its
cooperation with the station, Thani said in a press statement
issued right after he presented his credentials to Crown Prince
Hassan, the Regent.
</P>
<P>
Qatar will deal with the issue "sincerely and objectively,"
while the "brotherly" ties between Jordan and Qatar will continue,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Jazeera Tuesday in his program entitled "The Opposition
Direction" accused Jordan of conspiring with Israel since its
foundation in 1948 and said that the Jordanian army surrendered
Palestinian land to Israel without any resistance.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government Wednesday revoked the press cards of
all the six staff of the station's office in Amman, effectively
closed the office and protested to the Qatari embassy in Jordan
over this issue.
</P>
<P>
Jordan accused the station of intending to harm Jordan's
dignity and deform its history and political life.
</P>
<P>
This has been the first time that Jordan closed down a foreign
media office in accordance with Article 9 of its newly-established
Press and Publication Law.
</P>
<P>
The government insisted that those responsible must apologize
officially and publicly, if the station wants the cooperation with
it to be resumed.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Link With Suicide Bombing in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Sunday dismissed the allegation that
Tehran had indirect link with Friday's suicide bombing in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi accused Israeli and Palestinian officials of blaming
the suicide bombing attack on a foreign country to divert public
opinion from the events taking place in Israel, the official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran has no relation with such actions
and Iran supports the Palestinian nation in accordance with its
principled stand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Such actions have their roots in the events inside Israel and
blaming such terror acts on another country by Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority is a move in desperation, Mohammadi
said.
</P>
<P>
"Such suicide bombings result from denying the Palestinian
nation its right," he said.
</P>
<P>
A red car driven by two Palestinian suicide bombers blew up in a
crowded market in downtown Jerusalem Friday and the two
Palestinians were killed instantly while 21 Israelis were injured.
</P>
<P>
The radical group Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility for the
bombing attack and vowed more attacks to try to block the new
Palestinian-Israeli peace accord signed in Washington on October
23.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw from another 13
percent of the West Bank while the Palestinians step up crackdown
on Islamic militants.

condemned the Iraqi non-compliance with U.N. resolutions and
urged Iraq to resume cooperation with UNSCOM immediately and
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq has refused to back down and demands a timetable
for lifting the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Prakash Shah, who has been busy contacting with the Iraqi
government for the past two days, said the U.N. Security Council
had entrusted Annan with the mission of mediating the current
Iraq-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
Annan has said that the latest Iraqi move violated relevant
U.N. resolutions and called on Iraq to resume cooperation with
UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said that it is possible that Annan
himself will pay another visit to Baghdad to persuade Iraq to
reverse its October 31 decision.
</P>
<P>
Annan visited Baghdad last February and helped avert possible
U.S. military strikes against Iraq. He persuaded Saddam into
agreeing to open his presidential palaces to U.N. weapons
inspectors.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has called the presidents of Honduras and Nicaragua for an update
on those countries' efforts to recover from the deadly devastation
of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman and Honduran
President Carlos Flores Saturday night from the presidential
retreat at Camp David, Maryland, said White House national
security spokesman David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the calls to pledge U.S. assistance "in any way
possible" and to receive an update on recovery efforts, Leavy
said.
</P>
<P>
"These weren't calls to pledge specific levels of aid. It was a
status report more than anything else," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also told them that first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore's wife, Tipper Gore, would be traveling
to the region this month. Clinton himself currently has no plans
to travel there, Leavy said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Non-Oil Exports Drop By 15.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The earnings of Iran's non-oil
exports in the first seven months of this Iranian year starting
March 21 saw a drop of 15.6 percent to reach 1.53 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Head of Iran's Customs Mehdi Karbasian said Sunday that income
from industrial exports fell by 19 percent compared with the same
period last year while earnings from agricultural exports remained
unchanged, the Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran has a long way to go to attain its target of fetching 5
billion dollars from non-oil exports in this Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Commerce Minister Mohammad Shariatmadar attributed
revenue plunge from non-oil exports to lower prices of metal and
petrochemical products resulting from sagging oil price.
</P>
<P>
He said that the depressed economic situation around the world
had a negative impact on Iran's non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Iranian government is making efforts to boost the country's
heavily oil-dependent economy to a more healthy one by developing
non-oil sectors.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Top Security Aides on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
met his top national security advisers Sunday over the Iraqi
weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary
William Cohen, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and CIA
Director George Tenet were meeting with Clinton at his country
retreat at Camp David in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The president was not expected to make any final decision at
Sunday's meeting on whether to use force and if so, at what level,
National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say they want to end the stand-off by using
diplomatic pressure on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, although an
attack on key military targets is also being considered, perhaps
starting with cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times said Sunday the administration, despairing
that Saddam will ever be persuaded by political pressure to accede
to intrusive inspections, was abandoning hope of enforcing the
U.N. weapons searches and turning more to containing Iraq
militarily and with tough sanctions.
</P>
<P>
However, an administration official rejected that suggestion,
saying no decision had been made and Washington remained a strong
supporter of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) which runs the
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced last month it suspended all cooperation with
U.N. inspectors until the U.N. Security Council lifts sanctions
against it.

<HEADLINE> Livingston: Public's View Must Be Taken Into Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The leading contender to
succeed Newt Gingrich as House speaker said Sunday that Congress
must take into account the public's view that the Clinton affair
and cover-up do not warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Representative Bob Livingston said on television Sunday, "The
charges are that he... lied under oath. And I think that is very
serious." He added he would vote for impeachment "if the evidence
is there."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot simply disregard the fact that there are other
people in our society, in the military and in various other walks
of life, CEOs or principals of schools, who have been likewise
charged and have lost their jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Livingston said, however, "I think that the American people
have certainly indicated in the polls that they don't see it as an
impeachable or dismissible offense, and that would have to be
considered in the political arena."
</P>
<P>
Asked about polls suggesting that voters felt last Tuesday's
poor election showing by Republicans was due to their handling of
the Lewinsky matter, Livingston said on ABC's "This Week With Sam
Donaldson and Cokie Roberts," "Obviously they have decided that we
didn't do a good enough job."
</P>
<P>
Both Livingston, chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, and his opponent for the speaker's job, Republican
Policy Committee chairman Chris Cox, said they would rely heavily
on the Judiciary Committee's recommendations in the impeachment
inquiry. The committee plans to hear testimony on November 19 from
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
"We need to get this over with," said Representative Dick
Gephardt, the House's minority leader. "This committee has not
spent one day on the standards of impeachment. They should have
done it four weeks ago. They need to get to work starting
tomorrow." Gephardt appeared with Cox on CBS' "Face the Nation."

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The controversial
Confederations Cup in Mexico might be switched from January to
July so that world champions France would agree to play, FIFA
president Joseph Blatter has said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The French had withdrawn from the eight-nation tournament,
insisting that they would not compete as European clubs would be
unwilling to release players in mid-season for the competition
sanctioned by FIFA.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said last month he was "surprised and disappointed" by
France's pullout and resolved to make another change to see if he
could talk them round with new dates.
</P>
<P>
FIFA had expressed that they would not change the dates of the
upcoming Confederation Cup, but would reduce the time clubs are
required to make their players available in a response to strong
protests from European clubs.
</P>
<P>
The other countries due to take part are Mexico, Saudi Arabia,
Bolivia, Egypt, Brazil, New Zealand and the United States.

representing the ruling Democratic Convention won with 1 pct more
votes the Sunday election for Bucharest's General Mayoralty,

</P>
<P>
After the votes had been counted in all the 1175 polling

scored 50.5 percent of the votes, while his counter-candidate
running for the main opposition Party of Social Democracy Sorin

Viorel Lis said on Monday, after learning the elections
outcome, he would continue all the projects he had already started
before the partial local elections. He had decided that the
leasing of lands for building houses to become reality.

BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The geological prospecting for
the restoration of the Peking Man Site has been fruitful and will
be of great importance for the coming work of restoring the ruin.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by the United Nations

Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Electric Company of France (EDF),
sponsors of the program at a news briefing.
</P>

prehistoric caves buried underground, and in these caves the
fossil and relics of prehistoric man are expected to be found.
</P>
<P>
According to the sponsors, the consolidation and protection of
the caves, which are threatened by erosion, will be accomplished
over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are convinced that the Peking Man Site, for several
hundred thousand years a bivouac for prehistoric man, still
contains numerous relics of great interest, and that only about a
third of the remains have been so far properly excavated.

WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Representative Chris Cox of
California Monday withdrew as a candidate for speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives, apparently assuring that Representative
Bob Livingston of Louisiana will succeed Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
Cox said that since Gingrich announced he was stepping aside
Friday, he had picked up about 90 commitments from the 223
Republican members of the new Congress.
</P>
<P>
But, "Bob Livingston has put together over 110," Cox said on
ABC's `Good Morning America.'
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, the vote is in. Bob Livingston is going to be
our next speaker and I'm withdrawing my name for that reason," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Livingston, currently chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, said on Sunday that he would win the post Gingrich had
decided not to seek again.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich is being blamed in large part for the party's loss of
five House seats in Tuesday's elections, even though Republicans
still retain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas is also under attack
in his own party. Two senior Republicans are close to a decision
to join Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma, who is already
lining up votes to unseat Armey.
</P>

Republicans will choose their new leaders in a caucus on
November 18. The leaders will take office when the 106th Congress
convenes in early January.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus-Israeli Ties Covered by Cloud: Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ambassador to Cyprus,
Shemi Tzur, described here Monday the arrest of two Israeli
nationals on suspicion of spying in Cyprus as a cloud over the
Cyprus-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides, Tzur
said, "we do hope that this cloud which appeared last weekend will
leave us and we will continue the good relations."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who paid a
state visit to Cyprus last week, conveyed a message to his Cypriot
counterpart Clerides through Ariel Shumer, Director General of his
office.
</P>
<P>
Tzur said the message "is a message of friendship, of
continuation of what we achieved during Weizman's visit, upgrading
the relations and to continue the close relations," but he
refrained from disclosing the content of the message.
</P>
<P>
Udi Argov, 37 and Ig'al Damari, 49, both Israeli nationals,
appeared before Larnaca District Court on Saturday and were
remanded in custody for eight days on suspicion of spying between
November 6-7 in the southern coastal village of Zygi.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus police said they found sophisticated listening devices
and radio scanners, tuned into police radio frequencies during
their search for suspects' apartment.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israeli Embassy in Nicosia, the two Israelis
have denied the allegations against them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cyprus' Ministry of Justice and Public Order issued
a statement here Monday, wishing to "clarify that it has not been
established in the course of the inquiries, regarding the case of
spying for which two Israelis are in custody, that their actions,
presently under investigation, are connected in any way with the
government of Israel."
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Secretary of the island's Foreign Ministry,
Alecos Shambos, also said the two governments are in contact,
through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
"When police investigations are over, there will be official
statements on the issue," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Fresh Turkish Invasion of its North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday condemned the
fresh Turkish invasion of its north, and asked Ankara to withdraw
its troops immediately and to refrain from repeating such hostile
acts.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi government vehemently condemns the Turkish military
aggression and asks the Turkish government to pull out its
invading forces from the Iraqi territories," a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said in a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who was not identified, said that more than
25,000 troops of the Turkish armed forces on Sunday carried out a
new incursion into northern Iraq, where Baghdad has lost actual
control since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Defense Minister Ismat Sezgin said his troops entered
northern Iraq to track down the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party,
which has been fighting for independence in southeast Turkey since
1984.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman criticized Sezgin for "repeating" previous
claims in an attempt to justify the invasion. Turkish troops have
crossed into northern Iraq many times since 1991 to wipe out
Kurdish militants, allegedly seeking shelter there.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish invading troops were supported by Turkish jet
fighters and helicopters," the spokesman said, adding the invasion
has caused heavy human and material losses to Iraqi Kurds.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that such acts contradict the U.N. Charter, the
international law and norms and the good neighborly relations
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said the new incursion "coincided with the feverish
activities and threats made by the U.S. administration and the
Zionist entity against Iraq and to cause more harm to the people
of Iraq through the continuation of the embargo and maintaining
the abnormal status in northern Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. of blocking the lifting of
U.N. sanctions imposed on it following its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"The return of the legitimate authority to the northern Iraq is
the sole guarantee to establish security and stability in the
region," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Nazarbayev Defends Decision to Hold Early General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said on Sunday the parliament had their reasons for
moving the general election in the year 2000 to an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
The three reasons are reportedly the impact of the worldwide
financial crisis on the mid-Asian country, the political crisis in
Russia, and the domestic situation, Nazarbayev told the InterFax
news agency.
</P>
<P>
The parliament approved a constitutional amendment in September
announcing that a general election would be held on January 10,
1999.
</P>
<P>
He said he is "not prepared" for the earlier match for
presidency, although he is widely regarded to benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
The president recently declared his intention to run for the
office again.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's economy has reportedly been victimized by external
and internal factors. Agricultural and industrial production as
well as foreign trade have suffered drastically this year.
</P>
<P>
The situation is expected to worsen next year and the year 2000
will be a peak year for the country to pay its back debts,
Nazarbayev said in an interview with the Kazakh daily Pravda.
</P>
<P>
As the first and only president of Kazakhstan since its
independence in 1991, Nazarbayev's tenure was extended to 2000 in
a 1995 referendum.

SUZHOU, November 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 flood victims from
Jiangxi province, which was severely affected by this summer's
floods, found new homes in the city of Suzhou in east China's
Jiangsu Province this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This marks the prelude to a drive sponsored by the Chinese
Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA) to help flood victims
start a new life away from the flooded provinces.
</P>
<P>
This is a new way of aiding the victims compared with the old
method of raising relief funds and donating goods to the
disaster-ridden areas, says the CCBA.
</P>
<P>
The new residents are now in well-furnished apartments provided
by "Suzhou Garment Town." The general manager of the garment town,
Jiang Xike, said that homes for 1,500 families will be provided by
the end of this year, and rent will be free for the coming year.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Against Re-arrangement of Districts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A majority of Portugal's voters
have rejected a proposal raised by the ruling Portuguese Socialist
Party (PSP) to re-divide the country's 18 existing districts into
eight, a referendum released Monday showed.
</P>
<P>
Some 4.17 million voters out of the 8.65 million voters
registered nationwide participated in the November 8 referendum.
</P>
<P>
The returns showed that 37 percent of the voters agreed with
the PSP to set up eight big administrative districts in the
mainland of Portugal, while 63 percent voted against it.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the referendum outcome, PSP Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres said it would not affect the country's political stability.
</P>
<P>
Guterres also said he himself will shoulder responsibility for
his party's failure in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese parties, both in position and in office, have been
divided over the shift to big administrative districts in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Since coming to power in 1995, the PSP has advocated
re-dividing the country's districts, reportedly to give a push to
the overall reform of Portugal's administrative system. But the
idea is firmly opposed by the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Portugal's parliament decided in June to hold a referendum on
the PSP proposal.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: No Approval of Accord until Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said here Monday that Israeli cabinet will not
ratify the newly-singed peace accord until the Palestinian side
fulfill its commitment of fighting terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a group of American businessmen at his Jerusalem
office, Netanyahu insisted again that the Palestinian side must
convene the Palestinian National Council (PNC) to change the
anti-Israel clauses in its charter and fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israel has asked the Palestinians to convene the PNC meeting
to delete 26 clauses in its charter that deny Israel's right to
exist.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has submitted
a timetable to the United States on fighting terrorism, and the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee has
ratified the January 22 letter from Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to U.S. President Bill Clinton announcing the cancellation
of the clauses in the charter.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu postponed Friday the cabinet ratification of the
peace agreement signed last month in Washington after a car
bombing incident occurred in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said the cabinet meeting on the accord will
probably be delayed until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Due to the delay, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who was
scheduled to travel to the United States for talks, postponed his
trip by several days.
</P>
<P>
To help move the peace process forward, opposition Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak traveled to Jordan Monday to exchange views
with Jordanian officials on the peace agreement.

BRUSSELS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union (EU), said Monday that it
had approved for Sudan an emergency humanitarian aid worth 10
million ECU (11 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian aid will be used on assistance to victims of

</P>
<P>
The aid, to be managed by the EU humanitarian branch, the
European Community Humanitarian Office, will enable the World Food
Program (WFP) to purchase and transport food as part of its
emergency operation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is considering delivering 15,000 tons of food per month
over the next few months to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The EU aid will cover the humanitarian operations for the next
12 months, commission officials added.
</P>
<P>
The commission quoted the non-governmental organization
Medecins sans Frontieres as saying that the mortality rate in
southern Sudan had reach 70 in every 10,000 people a single day in
July when the country was hit by drought-caused famine.
</P>

Aid experts say that a mortality rate of 2 in every 10,000

<HEADLINE> Taliban Set Deadline for Giving Evidence Against Osama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
have set November 20 as the deadline for receiving any evidence of
terrorism by Saudi millionaire Osama Bin Ladin, said a report
monitored here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban supreme court said if those accusers fail to meet
the deadline, the court will consider Osama innocent, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The court said that no evidence has so far been received
showing Osama is guilty of terrorist acts and it will not
entertain any charges against him after November 20.
</P>
<P>
The United States formally indicted Osama last week in
connection with the August bombings of two American embassies in
East Africa, which killed more than 200 people. The U.S. State
Department has already set a reward of 5 million U.S. dollars for
information leading to Osama's capture.
</P>
<P>
Osama has been living in Afghanistan as what the Taliban
describe as its guest. The hardline militia are reported to have
turned down the U.S. request to extradite him, and have said they
are ready to try Osama if proof of his role in terrorist acts is
provided.
</P>
<P>
In August, the U.S. launched missile attacks on suspected
terrorist camps in Afghanistan, killing at least 26 people. U.S.
officials alleged that the camps are run by Osama and form part of
an international terrorist network.

BANGKOK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand might consider a bid
to host a future Olympic Games if next month's Asian Games turned
out to be a success, Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul said
Monday.

to China, so perhaps 2020 -- I hope I am still alive to see the
Games being hosted by Thailand then." said the official on a tour
of new Asian Games stadiums here.
</P>
<P>
The build-up to the December 6-20 Games has been in the middle
of an economic slowdown, setting off worries that they would have
to be held elsewhere if stadiums would not be finished on time.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Zoologists Help Wild Horse Regain Wild Nature (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
International organizations including the United Nations
Environment Program and Food and Agriculture Organization have
made plans to protect the wild horse, aiming to return it to its
former natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
China began to reintroduce wild horses in the 1980s, and about
100 wild horses are now in breeding centers in Jimsar County in
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Wuwei County in Gansu
Province.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration and the
Beijing Institute of Biodiversity have recently initiated a new
program to return the wild horses to nature in Anxi.
</P>
<P>
"It will take seven or eight years for the horses from Britain
to get used to the environment here, and to increase their
number. During this period we will study their behavior and
reproductive habits," said Yang Rongsheng.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to return the horses to nature after 2005 and follow
their tracks for study," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Anxi Wilderness Nature Reserve, covering an area of 800,000
hectares, is home to more than 300 species of plants and 100
species of animals.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the reserve is a good environment for the wild
horses, and cross breeding with domestic horses can be avoided
because it is far away from human activity.
</P>
<P>
A similar program is under way in Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Opposition NLD Members Resign: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 68 members of three
township branches of Myanmar's opposition National League for
Democracy (NLD) have resigned and two branches of the group
dissolved recently, the official New Light of Myanmar newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NLD members, who resigned "out of their own volition since
they had no desire to carry out political activities of the NLD,"
are from Thanbyuzayat in Mon state, Myitkyina in Kachin state and
Sittway in Rakhine state, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The NLD members respectively presented their resignations to
the township Multi-Party Democracy Election Commission offices.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the number of NLD members has been
reduced considerably due to member deaths, resignations and other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The NLD headquarters based in Yangon, however, said last
Saturday in a statement that "it could not accept the dissolution
(of the branches) at all," adding that "as a branch of the party,
it has no right to do so without the knowledge of the Central
Headquarters."
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the members' resignation goes against
the Political Parties Registration Law issued by the authorities
concerned.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of the NLD members and the dissolution of the
branches came after a series of government-organized "mass
rallies" across the country against the NLD and its leadership,
especially Aung San Suu Kyi, the party's general secretary.
</P>
<P>
The NLD said that the authorities were "illegally" using the
people from all walks of life who are under "pressure" to express
"the people's desire," and created further political confusion.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that it reserves the right to organize similar
mass rallies to present facts on the current situation in Myanmar
as a legal political party.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
on Monday urged Arab Palestinians in East Jerusalem not to vote in
Tuesday's municipal elections held by Israel, according to Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) minister
in charge of Jerusalem affairs, said that East Jerusalem is part
of the occupied territory and will be the capital of future
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Municipality of Israel does not have the
authority to organize municipal elections in East Jerusalem so
the Arab Palestinians there should boycott them, he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Municipal elections are scheduled for Tuesday in all major
cities of Israel. During the elections, the voters will choose
mayors of the cities as well as members of the municipal councils.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Mayor Ehud Olmert from Likud still wants to
retain his post. He chose secretary-general of Jerusalem's Labor
Party branch, Haim Cohen, as his teammate in contesting the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's cooperation with Olmert received full support from
Labor's strongman former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, but angered
Labor Chairman Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Peres reportedly said that Jerusalem is a strong base for the
right-wing, but Labor's participation in the city's
administration could prevent all municipal powers from being taken
by the Right.

more remains.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the DPRK formed an inquiry team specializing in
locating places where remains were buried. As a result, more
remains were recovered in the fourth and fifth rounds of
exhumations.

It has also been reported that whether the joint exhumations

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- India has agreed to join
global efforts to develop AIDS vaccine and decided to offer sites
for international vaccine trials after years of hesitation.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Monday that the
decision, which still needs a formal approval by the cabinet, was
taken on Sunday following a two-day brain-storming meeting of
officials from India's National AIDS Control Organization (NACO),
the United States National Institute of Health (NIH) and the
United Nations AIDS Program (UNAIDS).
</P>
<P>
The PTI quoted NACO chief Prasad Rao as saying on Monday that
the Indian government has accepted the need for AIDS vaccine and
the country is capable to develop it with international support.
</P>
<P>
NACO, with assistance from NIH and UNAIDS, has planned to
create an umbrella organization comprising a multi-disciplinary
team with administrative and financial independence to take up all
aspects of AIDS vaccine research and trials on a mission mode.
</P>
<P>
An official source said Monday that India would be ready to
launch the trials in two years.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,500 people including those attending clinics for
sexually-transmitted diseases had been recruited for the trials,

WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- NBA owners and the players
union will spend this week waiting each other out rather than

dispute.

Games through December 7 officially were lost over the weeke

Billy Hunter said. "If it means we don't play until January or
February, that's what it means."
</P>
<P>
Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, said: "The owners
believe totally that they will not operate until we have a fair
deal. And if that means missing the whole season, that's what it
means."
</P>
<P>
The owners ended Friday's talks when the union was unwilling
to back off its proposal that 60 percent of revenues go to player
salaries. Last season, players got 57 percent of revenues.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said he would call a meeting of the union's executive
committee this week. He also is considering holding regional
meetings of the rank and file and launching mail and phone
campaigns to counteract what teams might tell players.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to stand by and let the owners and league
attempt to have unfettered access to our players and let them
manipulate them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hunter is upset that NBA Commissioner David Stern authorized
teams to answer players' questions on the owners' proposal.

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees Asia Crisis Now Bottoming Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 9 (Xinhua) --The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) believes the crisis in Asia is now bottoming out as
pessimism about the world economy has lifted, IMF first deputy
managing director Stanley Fischer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
While speaking at a press briefing in Melbourne, Fischer said,
"It's our guess that you are going to see growth in Asia probably
early next year if it isn't happening now," the Australian
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Fischer is in Australia to deliver a lecture outlining the
IMF's plans to stabilize the global economy through strengthening
of financial systems, introduction of monitored standards and
regulation of big investors such as hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
He said the nation still providing the most difficulties is
Japan, where there is no prospect for a sharp economic turnaround
but the concern that it may not have hit the bottom yet, while the
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) nations had.
</P>
<P>
"The worst-hit crisis countries are doing so now or will be
shortly," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that there had been a "significant change in
sentiment in the last month and a half" across the world since the
gloom and doom of the Russian crisis.
</P>
<P>
That change in sentiment had been led by cuts in U.S. and
European interest rates, Brazil's actions to stabilize its own
economy, and the beginning of economic improvement in Latin
America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
"There is not normalcy, but its nowhere near as critical as it
seemed a month ago."
</P>
<P>
The IMF is currently working on proposals for a new global
architecture which would prevent continual re-occurrences of
regional meltdowns caused by the sudden shifts in world capital -
largely controlled by massive investment houses.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is also working on adopting international standards for
banking systems, in a similar vein to international accounting
standards.
</P>
<P>
"A general idea is that we ought to put out there standards and
codes of good behavior and encourage countries to adopt them -
that's an important part of what the new system is about," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In advanced countries, the focus would be on adopting good
macro-economic policies, and finding ways of regulating investors
in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
One measure close to being announced is a new form of lending
and financing for contagion-threatened countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the IMF was trying to find a way to control
private sector capital outflows, but said it would be best if that
is voluntary rather than through capital controls.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said there was broad agreement on the IMF's package to
be adopted in Brazil, but documentation was still to be completed.
</P>
<P>
He said the package would be big enough to prevent a
devaluation of the Brazilian real.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Take Drastic Measures Against Traffic Jams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will introduce urgent
measures to help relieve the traffic jam during next month's
Asian Games in Bangkok, the chairman of the organizing committee
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Firstly schools and universities all over the country will be
closed. In addition all roadwork will be suspended during the
games," said Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, the assignment of 12,000 traffic police will ensure
that everybody is in the right place at the right time."
</P>
<P>
Police Colonel Jirapat Labunukrom, in charge of security for
the Games, said 6,000 of the total would be deployed specifically
for traffic control, while the rest would be assigned to security
tasks.
</P>
<P>
A team of 300 soldiers would also be deployed to finish the
main carpark at Muang Thong Thani, said Santiparb Thejavanija,
deputy secretary-general of the Games organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Bhichai who describes Bangkok's notorious traffic as his
biggest nightmare for the December 6-20 Games, admitted that a
key road link from central Bangkok to the venue for the opening
ceremony in the east of the city appeared not be ready.
</P>
<P>
The official added although some countries had withdrawn teams
from some events and the total number of athletes and officials
would be lower than expected, the event would still be the
biggest Asian Games ever held.

<P>
BRUSSELS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and

trade in goods and services between them, the European Commission
said.
</P>
<P>
The first round of negotiations was being held in Mexico City
while another two rounds are slated for Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The three rounds of negotiations, due to end early next year,
focus on discussions over market access, services and the movement
of capital, as well as competition and dispute settlement.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said the economic aims of an EU-Mexico
free trade agreement is to open up markets, step up investment and
promote reciprocal investments to help build a more competitive
industrial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, they added, is expected to include
commitments concerning other areas of mutual interest, such as
political dialogue and cooperation in a variety of fields.
</P>
<P>
The EU and Mexico first expressed their wish to create a new
platform for commercial and political matters in 1993, and signed
an agreement in 1997 on economic partnership, political
coordination and cooperation.

CAIRO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Holding Company for Food Industries has
signed a contract to supply 150 million U.S. dollars worth of food
to Iraq. It was disclosed by the company's chairman Engineer Adel
Al Shahawi.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's daily "Al Gomhouria" reported Monday that the deal
includes the supply of 35,000 tonnes of cooking butter valued at
about 30 million dollars, 6,000 tonnes of toilet soap, 10,000
tonnes of detergents, and 150,000 tonnes of sugar.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- An Iranian daily claimed on Monday that Saudi company
of Aramco has been trying to capture Iran's oil markets as the
sluggish oil market shows no sign of recovery.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, drawing on its political relations with Pakistan
and South Africa, is out to capture Iran's oil markets in those
countries, the English-language Tehran Times quoted an informed
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
On condition of anonymity, the source said that under the
present conditions that oil prices are falling due to an oil glut
and limited demand, it is natural for oil exporters to competing
to capture oil markets.
</P>
<P>
The source did not elaborate evidence to prove his saying, but
said that Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi objected to
such efforts by Saudi Arabia during his recent visit to Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Given the close cooperation between Iran and Saudi Arabia
within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), the Saudi's move is unfriendly, he added.

AMMAN -- More than one million foreign tourists visited Jordan
from January to September this year, increasing by 12.6 percent

</P>
<P>
The revenues from tourism in the period reached 399.7 million

Jordanian dinars (about 605 million U.S. dollars) in the first 10
months this year, a 58 percent increase over that in the same
period of 1997, said a semi-official report obtained by Xinhua
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Churches to Face Tough Scrutiny in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official has
disclosed that churches seeking registration in the country will
now be thoroughly scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Christian fellowship fund-raising luncheon here
Sunday, Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs Peter Chintala said
this was aimed at stopping the rising number of fake worshiping
institutions emerging in Zambia, a country which was declared a
Christian nation seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister stressed that new churches including those
from abroad which want to set up branches in Zambia will have to
fulfill the moral requirement of the indigenous Zambians.
</P>
<P>
Chintala warned that the Zambians should be careful when they
want to join some of these churches since many of them now are
being run by "dubious characters."
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that the Zambian government will not
allow the churches for homosexuals and lesbians to be registered
as it would be against the morals of the nation.
</P>
<P>
In later August 1998, the Zambian government deregistered the
Universal Church of the Kingdom of God and canceled the work
permits of the church's bishops coming from South Africa and
ordered them to leave the country within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Register of Societies, Herbert Nyendwa, later explained
that the cancellation of the church's registration was necessary
because its continued registration was not in the interest,
welfare and peace of Zambia as the church was pursuing "unlawful
objectives other than those registered for."
</P>
<P>
However, Nyendwa failed to name the unlawful objectives of the
church which is based in Brazil and has its branches in more than
60 countries all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The rich cult that started 21 years ago as a miserable sect in
a Rio de Janeiro township has been involved in various scandals
and controversies both in Brazil and abroad,
government-controlled Zambia Daily Mail newspaper said in an
earlier report.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Zoologists Help Wild Horse Regain Wild Nature (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese zoologists are trying
to help the Mongolian horse regain its wild nature in the Gobi
Desert in Gansu Province and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000 horses, raised in zoos around the world for
generations, are at risk of degenerating and losing their
biodiversity," says Yang Rongsheng of the Beijing Institute of
Biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
Ten Mongolian horses donated by Britain's Howletts and Port
Lympne Foundation have been transported to the Wilderness Nature
Reserve in Anxi County, Gansu Province, not far from the famous
Mogao Grottos. Zoologists plan to return them to nature after they
get used to the environment of the Gobi Desert.
</P>
<P>
"The wild horses are in good condition here, and two female
horses are pregnant," says Ning Ruidong of the reserve's
administrative office. "They are expected to give birth next
summer."
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian horse is smaller than the domestic horse and its
fur is a single color, brown, Ning says.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian wild horse is the ancestor of the modern domestic
horse, and the last wild horse was seen in its natural habitat
near Anxi County in northwestern China in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"Close breeding among the wild horses in zoos will cause
infertility," said Yang Rongsheng. "Less physical burden and food
consumption will lead to the degeneration of the jaw and teeth,
an increase in weight, and loss of running speed."
</P>
<P>
"The only way to save the wild horse is to return it to the
wild and put it under the pressure of natural selection," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholar Urges Global IPR System to Protect Human Genomes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese expert on
intellectual property today urged that the intellectual property
rights (IPR) protection mechanism should create incentives,
enabling the developing nations to gain equitable benefits from
technical inventions based on genetic and biological resources.
</P>
<P>
"With the advent of the Convention on Biological Diversity, it
is necessary to examine some functions of the IPR systems, such as
technical transfer based on genetic resources, biochemical and
related biological resources, protection of plant varieties,
trademark and name-of-product-origin labeling," Hao Xiaofeng, a
scholar at Beijing University's School of Intellectual Property,
said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said biological resources associated with genetic diversity
in plants, animals and microbes include a diversity of chemicals
that serve as sources for pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food
additives and industrial compounds.
</P>
<P>
"Genetic resources are usually considered a common heritage,
and users from other countries customarily returned no direct
economic benefits to the countries or communities that provided
and conserved the resources," said Hao, who completed his
university education in biology at Zhongshan University in 1984.
</P>
<P>
As for its own special-resources intellectual property, China
issued regulations in September restricting the removal of human
genome resources from the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, human organs, tissues, cells,
blood and related materials cannot be transported outside of China
without permission from the Ministry of Science and Technology.

of the extraction of biochemical matter beneficial to mankind,"
Hao noted.
</P>
<P>
Generally, he claims, researchers whose inventions qualify for
IPR protection do their work in developed countries, while the
communities that are near genetic resources, and the developing
countries that provide biological resources, do not participate in
the advanced research that leads to IPR-protected inventions.
</P>
<P>
"The Convention on Biological Diversity shows that the IPR
systems can create indirect economic incentives for conservation,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "people must achieve the sustainable use of
biological diversity required by the Convention, 'properly' gain
generic resources, share the benefits, and acquire or transfer
related technology by 'proper', equitable and rational means," Hao
said.
</P>
<P>
Human genetic research has been intensified throughout the
world in the 1990s, and scientists expect to discover all of the
100,000 human genomes before the year 2005. Approximately 30
laboratories in China are now involved in research to decode the
enigma of human genetics.

<HEADLINE> More U.N. Arms Inspectors Leave Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 9 (Xinhua) -- About 10 U.N. staffers working
in Iraq, including five arms inspectors, left Baghdad Monday,
while more journalists flooded in amid the Iraq-U.N. standoff over
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
This is the second batch of the withdrawal of U.N. arms
inspectors from Iraq in three days. Fifteen U.N. staffers left
Baghdad Saturday as a response to the Iraqi decision to suspend
its cooperation with U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership announced on October 31 its decision to halt
all forms of cooperation with U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
for disarming Iraq until the U.N. Security Council moves toward
the lifting of the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted last Thursday, the Security Council
condemned the latest Iraqi defiance and urged it to resume
cooperation with UNSCOM immediately and unconditionally, but Iraq
has refused to back down.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. trade embargo imposed on Iraq in 1990 for its invasion
of Kuwait cannot be lifted until weapons inspectors verify that it
is free of banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
In sharp comparison with the withdrawal of arms inspectors,
more correspondents, photographers and TV cameramen are flooding
into Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Press Center suddenly becomes crowded as the number
of foreign reporters has been more than doubled to over 100.
</P>
<P>
Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM here, told reporters
Monday that the commission now has about 100 staffers in Iraq after
the two batches of reduction of its teams.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources told Xinhua that more arms inspectors will leave
Iraq on Wednesday and Saturday.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Resume Talks on Sir Creek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan resumed
talks Monday on the Sir Creek maritime boundary dispute in Rann of
Kutch area in the western state of Gujarat, in a bid to resolve
the border demarcation in the Arabian Sea.
</P>
<P>
This is the second phase of the on-going composite dialogue
process between the two countries following their failure in
finding amicable solutions to a navigation project and the Siachen
Glacier dispute last week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the marking of the boundary with Pakistan
would have an important bearing on the exploitation of promising
sea-based resources in the area.
</P>
<P>
Maritime boundaries between India and Pakistan would determine
the limits of Exclusive Economic Zones available to both countries
for possible commercial use.
</P>
<P>
While India has defined maritime boundaries with Myanmar,
Thailand, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia, it is yet to
reach such a settlement with Pakistan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Talks between India and Pakistan on boundary dispute over Sir
Creek, along the Gujarat-Singh coast, have been going on since
1965 without concrete results.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi has been contending that the boundary should be an
average notional mid channel in the creek where the contours
change due to shifting tidal movement while Pakistan, in a bid to
gain more territory, has been insisting that the boundary should
start from the southern edge of the creek, Indian sources said.
</P>
<P>
The boundary dispute over the creek has prevented both India
and Pakistan from submitting their claims under the United Nations
convention on the law of the sea on the limits of their respective
continental shelves.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have to resolve the issue by the year 2004 or
else they have to submit to U.N. mediation, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Indian and Pakistan failed to make any headway last Friday on
the disputed Siachen issue after three hours of talks in New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The two countries failed to make any breakthrough last Thursday
on the dispute over the Tulbul navigation project, which was
called Wullar Barrage in Pakistan, after four hours of talks
between two countries' water resources and power delegations.

meeting with Switzerland-based Nestle Company President Peter
Brabeck-Letmathe here today noted that the Chinese market will be

<HEADLINE> Lebanese High School Teachers Stage Open-ended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 9 (Xinhua) -- About 30,000 Lebanese high
school teachers Monday staged an open-ended strike to protest
against the readjusted salary scales bill approved by the
parliament last month.
</P>
<P>
The strike followed a two-day warning strike in October to
protest against parliament's failure to recognize their demands.
</P>
<P>
High school teachers, in addition to primary school teachers,
were demanding that end-of-service payments be based on 100
percent of their final salaries in the new pay scale bill for the
public sector.
</P>
<P>
The new bill states that end-of-service payments would only be
based on 85 percent of the teachers' final salaries.
</P>
<P>
The teachers also want the parliament to amend the already
endorsed bill, an unnamed member of teachers' union said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of National Education, Youth and Sport Jean
Obeid reportedly supported teachers' demands but criticized the
way of protest.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the strike has halted classes for some
250,000 students across the country.

billion Dollars and remaining at the same level as 1996.
</P>
<P>
Regional media Monday quoted a report by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) as saying that 18
countries, including Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Angola,
Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana, marked an increase in the FDI over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The story by "World Investment Report 1998: Trends and
Determinants", says that the ratings are based on the annual FDI
inflows, inflows per 1,000 Dollars of the gross domestic product
(GDP), average ratio of inflows to capital formation and inflows
per capita.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania and Uganda both absorbed about 300 billion Dollars,
ranking 16th and 17th in Africa while their neighbor in east
Africa, Kenya, only got around 50 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, Zimbabwe, Cameroun and Mauritius received respectively
some 100 million Dollars of the total African FDI shares, which
were mainly landed in manufacturing, technological advancement
and the service sectors.
</P>
<P>
The report lists seven African states with "front runner"
status -- Botswana, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Mozambique,
Namibia, Tunisia and Uganda -- for their dynamic FDI attraction.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD report cites as factors attracting higher than
average levels of the FDI -- GDP growth, a stable political and
macro-economic environment, speedy privatization and efforts to
tackle corruption.
</P>
<P>
It lists the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan as the
four leading FDI providers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. kept the highest FDI outflows record of 115 billion
Dollars, but only one-third destined to the developing countries,
mostly in Latin America, says the report.

wide-ranging common interests and shoulder grave responsibilities
for safeguarding world peace and promoting a common economic
growth.

Qian noted that the British Conservative Party, whether in
power or out, has made positive contributions to the development
of Sino-British relations for a long time, and he hopes party
leaders such as Howard will continue their efforts to this end.

Howard spoke highly of China's economic achievements, and said
he believes China will play an increasingly important role in

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference on Prevention of Drug Abuse Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai said Monday that the strengthening of the family
institution is an important factor in helping solve the drug
problem because the family is the natural and fundamental group
unit of a society.
</P>
<P>
In his address at the 17th International Federation of
Non-government Organization (IFNGO) Conference on the Prevention
of Drug and Substance Abuse, which opened here Monday, Chuan
pointed out that communities as well as educational and religious
institutions can also help address the problem as well.
</P>
<P>
He noted that drug abuse is one of today's major problems that
not only causes great harm to the health of the people, but also
undermines a country's economic and social well-being as well as
national security. The drug problem is not an isolated one, he
said, but has global proportions affecting all countries.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said Thailand has, therefore, fully supported all
regional and international endeavors to fight drug abuse. For
example, Thailand takes part in the sub-regional strategy
initiated by the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP).
</P>
<P>
At the regional level, Thailand and other ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) member countries adopted, last December,
the ASEAN Vision 2020, which establishes the goal of a Southeast
Asia free of illicit drugs and their production, processing,
trafficking and use, well before 2020, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN foreign ministers recently issued a joint
declaration for a drug-free ASEAN, which also highlights the role
of non-government organizations or NGOs as well as the private
sector in collaborative alliances in the development and
implementation of drug abuse prevention and control programs and
activities.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Bangkok Declaration and Plan of
Action to be formulated by the IFNGO conference will promote the
fight against drug. "Only by cooperating with each other can we
help eradicate drug and substance abuse, with a view to creating a
drug-free world for the children," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference, under the theme "New Dimensions on Prevention
of Drug and Substance Abuse," is hosted by the National Council on
Social Welfare of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 representatives of 54 non-government organizations
worldwide are attending the conference which will last through
November 13.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Lottery for Flood Victims (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- With the approval of the State
Council, China's cabinet, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has
initiated a five billion yuan (about 600 million U.S. dollars)
lottery to raise funds for victims of the country's devastating
summer flooding, ministry officials announced here today.
</P>
<P>
With a fund-raising rate of 30 percent, the lottery, which is
being sold nationwide from October 1 to April 1, 1999, is expected
to raise 1.5 billion yuan for the flood victims, officials said.
</P>
<P>
All the money will first go to the State Council and then be
allocated to various flood-stricken areas, and neither the civil
affairs departments nor the local governments will take a penny,
they added.
</P>
<P>
From July to September, the entire Yangtze River valley and
northeast China's Nenjiang and Songhua river basins were hit by
the worst flooding in decades. Floods killed more than 3,000
people nationwide, negatively affected the life of over 200
million people, and caused direct economic losses worth some 20
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time China has raised special
disaster-relief funds through a lottery system," said Fan Baojun,
vice-minister of civil affairs.

<P>
China's lottery system has been run by the civil affairs
departments since its debut in 1987. Over the past 11 years, the
system has helped raise approximately 8 billion yuan in welfare
funds, which has gone to more than 73,000 various welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the central government gave approval to the
Ministry of Civil Affairs to issue a six-billion yuan conventional
lottery between October and next June. The newly sanctioned
flood-relief lottery brings China's total lottery issue this year
to a record 11 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lottery sales in China was only 2.1 billion yuan in 1994, but
jumped to 6 billion yuan the following year.
</P>
<P>
China's lottery issue and sales are under the supervision of
the People's Bank of China, and the results will be examined by the
National Audit Office.
</P>
<P>
"We will always uphold the principle of openness, fairness and
justice in issuing and selling the welfare lotteries," vowed a
senior official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Usually, some 55 percent of the total value of each lottery
issue goes back to the winners, while 30 percent becomes welfare
funds under the management of civil affairs departments at all
levels.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Share prices took a hammering
on Singapore Stock Market Monday on foreign selling led by
property stocks.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) plunged by 64.48 points
to 1,219.28 points, almost offsetting the hefty gains in a week
period at the beginning of November.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the STI gave in to heavy profit-taking after
successfully fending off a correction last week
</P>
<P>
The belief that global interest rates have stabilized and are
not headed any lower allowed profit-taking to gain a firm foothold
in the market, they said.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that weaker regional currencies and poor
earning of some big companies also contributed to the sharp drop
Monday.  The total volume dropped to 347.26 million units valued
at 540.47 million Singapore dollars (about 328.15 million U.S.
dollars). Losers edged out gainers by 310 to 20, more than 15
times, with 88 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
KepLand topped the actives chart of the day with a turnover of
18.53 million units. The DBS Land was the second most heavily
traded stock with 16.00 million shares done. Wing T was next with
13.60 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 was the top gainer of the day as it lifted 30 cents
to close at 25.80 Singapore dollars. Thai Pr gained 12 cents to
finish at 4.00 U.S. dollars. CK Tang inched up eight cents to end
at 0.63 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, CenProp led the descent of the day with a loss
of 110 cents to 8.50 Singapore dollars. DBS F retreated 90 cents
to close at 10.20 Singapore dollars. SPH dipped by 80 cents to end
at 14.20 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bad Loans in Malaysia Stand at 8.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Total non-performing loans
(NPLs) in Malaysia's banking system accounted for 8.1 percent of
total loans as of September 30, 1998, Malaysian Deputy Finance
Minister Affifuddin Omar said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NPLs based on the six-month classification amounted to 51.8
billion ringgit (about 13.631 billion U.S. dollars) as of
September 30, 1998, he said in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that Bank Negara (State Bank or Central Bank) Malaysia
had taken steps such as restructuring the finance sector and
corporate debt, foreign exchange controls and improving liquidity
to strengthen the financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Total loans approved by the banking system for this year until
September dropped sharply compared with those for the same period
last year, according to figures revealed by Affifuddin. Total
loans for the period under review were 38.8 billion ringgit (10.21
billion dollars) against 197.8 billion ringgit (52.052 billion
dollars) for the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction in credit given this year is due to financial
institutions being cautious following the continued economic
crisis, tight liquidity in the banking system and a deterioration
in asset quality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara has directed financial institutions to achieve a
8-percent growth in loans by the end of this year against 4.5
percent at the end of September, 1998.
</P>
<P>
To improve transparency in lending, Bank Negara has required
financial institutions to provide information on total loans given
out, sectors to which loans were provided, types of loans, the NPL
ratio, provisions for bad and doubtful loans as well as interest
payment suspension in their annual financial reports.
</P>
<P>
The financial institutions were also required to announce
annual half-year accounts while the chief executive officers were
directed to show transparency when rejecting loan applications and
to give reasons for the rejection to the clients.
</P>
<P>
Affifuddin said that total assets in the country's banking
system as of September 30 this year amounted to 610.1 billion
ringgit (160.552 billion dollars) against total liabilities
including deposits of 561.6 billion ringgit (about 147.789 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the present liquidity in the banking system is adequate
to meet the funding needs of banking institutions following the
government's move to lower borrowing costs and to improve
liquidity by lowering the Statutory Reserve Ratio from 13.5
percent to the present 4 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has described its financial system as sound, saying it
has weathered the Asian currency crisis despite intense pressures
from neighboring economies.
</P>
<P>
In a report released by the Philippine News Agency Monday, the
central bank said that the system is able to recover from the
decline the country had experienced in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Resources of the financial system grew by 3.8 percent to 3,399
billion pesos (84 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of the second
quarter of the year, a positive turnaround from the 2.4 percent
drop recorded at the end of the previous quarter, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed this to the growth in bank deposits,
recapitalization of banks in compliance with the new minimum
capital requirements, and the increase in the number of bank
offices.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' non-performing loan ratio only rose to 10.6
percent in April 1998, much lower than that of its neighbors, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the country's non-performance ratio will
further improve in the months ahead as interest rates continue to
decline.

CANBERRA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares lost ground
Monday as expectations grew that interest rates would not be cut
until after Christmas following the latest statement from the
Reserve Bank of Australia.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index gave up 8.2 points to 2,689.1 by the
close after it had traded as high as 2,712.5 points prior to the
release of the Reserve Bank's semi-annual statement on monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
The continued strength of the banking sector, which has risen
as speculation of a monetary policy easing has grown, supported
the hopes for a rate cut, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The banking subindex ended 27.3 points up at 5,807.8 while the
broader all industrials index gave up 14.7 points to 4,687.0 and
all resources index shed 2.9 points to 1,084.9.
</P>
<P>
Overall 303.60 million shares were traded on the exchange worth
977.62 million Australian dollars (620.78 million U.S. dollars),
with 514 rises, 570 falls and 437 stocks steady.

Among resource stocks, the dual listed Rio Tinto added 26

Barican told reporters that the next round of talks is aimed at
resolving the impasse over the MILF proposal for the government to
recognize its 46 "camps" in Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The government is still optimistic about forging an agreement
with the rebel group that would lead to lasting peace in the
south, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Back channels remain open," Barican said. "Leaders of both
panels will meet and discuss the next scheduled meeting and the
agenda in order to resolve the impasse."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was referring to the issue involving the MILF
proposal for the government to recognize its 13 major and 33 minor
"camps" all over Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
During their November 4-6 meeting, the two sides failed to
reach any agreement on the camp issue.
</P>
<P>
Barican said that the recognition of these "camps" shall be
solely for the purpose of determining the coverage of the
agreement on cessation of hostilities agreed upon in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the "camps" identified by the MILF will be verified by the
government as to their existence and actual occupation by the
rebel forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF became the country's sole major rebel group which is
fighting for independence of Mindanao, after the Moro National
Liberation Front and the government signed a peace pact two years
ago.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Stronger After RBA Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
stronger Monday supported by indications the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) was unlikely to cut domestic interest rates in the
near term.
</P>
<P>
After the release of the central bank's semi-annual statement
on monetary policy, financial markets are now looking toward next
month and even next year as the next likely timings for a rate
cut.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 63.37 U.S. cents from 63.00 on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar is staying strong," Bankers Trust
Australia manager of foreign exchange Angelo Gangemi said. "But
it's all relative, even after the comments from the Reserve Bank,
the Aussie has basically remained static."
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the RBA noted current monetary policy
settings were broadly appropriate.
</P>
<P>
It added that economic growth was likely to slow to less than
4.0 percent going forward and it was unlikely inflation would
exceed its target band of two to three percent in the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
In response, economists said the contents of the statement
indicated the RBA appeared happy to hold the line on interest
rates and an easing might not eventuate for up to six months.
</P>
<P>
Gangemi said the foreign exchange market had now put the
possibility of a rate cut "on the back burner" for the time being.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates, the Australian dollar finished the local
session at 75.74 Japanese yen from 74.51 and 1.0624 German marks
from 1.0452.

<HEADLINE> IMF Loan Expected to Strengthen Rupiah: Indonesian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund's (IMF's) approval of a 960 million U.S. dollar loan to
Indonesia is expected to strengthen the rupiah, Coordinating
Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the loan disbursement would raise confidence in the
rupiah," Ginandjar said after President B.J. Habibie declared
former vice president, the late Adam Malik, as a national hero.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the decision of the IMF executive board in
Washington on Friday to allot a 960 million U.S. dollar loan to
Indonesia, Ginandjar said the loan disbursement would confirm the
international community's confidence in Indonesia's economic
programs and policies.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian currency has been hovering at the 7,500 to the
U.S. dollar level last month, although it has weakened to the
8,000 to the U.S. dollar level last week before a major political
event, the special session of the People's Consultative Assembly
on November 10 to 13.
</P>
<P>
During the same occasion, Bank Indonesia Governor Syahril
Sabirin said the new IMF loan would be used to strengthen the
country's foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
The fund, he said, will not be used for market intervention.
</P>
<P>
The amount to be used for market intervention will come from
bilateral loans, he added.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Airlines to End Dealings With Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Airlines will end its
business dealings with its Zimbabwean partner because the former
is soon to be privatized.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Hadija Nakitende, the Ugandan Airlines' public relations
officer, told Xinhua in a telephone interview from southern town
of Entebbe Monday afternoon that its contract with Zimbabwean
Airlines expires on November 15 and that it will return a
Boeing-767 plane it has leased from Harare.
</P>
<P>
Extension of the contract, which will cover another three
years, is not considered because the government has plans to sell
very soon majority shares in the airlines to Ugandans to retain
it as a national flag carrier and is looking for investors to
take up the remaining shares, she said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the airlines is under any government pressure to
end dealings with Zimbabwe because the two governments are
standing on opposite sides of the war in the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC), she said the commercial airlines does so on
business basis and that this has nothing to do with the war
there.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on whether the Zimbabwean aircraft
was used to transport Ugandan soldiers to the DRC as reported by
a Zimbabwean newspaper, the Ugandan Airlines official said it has
not been used to transport a single soldier there.
</P>
<P>
She also observed that the airlines is considering cooperation
with Djibouti Air in opening a route to Dubai. Djibouti Air is
said to offer an Airbus with a bigger cargo and passenger
capacity than Zimbabwe's Boeing-767.
</P>
<P>
Dubai is one of the most lucrative destinations for Uganda
Airlines. Another profitable route is Entebbe-Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Pubic Enterprise Reform and Divestiture
Committee announced that 51 percent of Uganda Airlines' shares
will go to Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
Four international airlines were reported to have shown
interest in the purchase of the remaining shares. They are
British Airways, Sabena Airlines, Air Mauritius and Alliance Air.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Shift to Disclosure-Based Regime Toward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
agreed to shift from merit-based regulation to a predominantly
disclosure-based regime in its approach to regulation of capital
markets in the country, according to a government release Monday.
</P>
<P>
This fundamental change is contained in the government's
item-to-item response to 38 recommendations by the Corporate
Finance Committee concerning the philosophy and framework of
regulation, standards of disclosure, and measures to liberalize
and develop Singapore as an international corporate fund-raising
center.
</P>
<P>
The release also said the government has accepted all the
committee's specific recommendations on rules and guidelines over
the capital market in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The shift from merit-based to disclosure-based regulation is
proposed with an aim to promote innovation, entrepreneurship,
efficiency and business flexibility while protecting the integrity
of the securities market, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The committee, founded to study the reform in the financial
sector in the city state, holds that a disclosure-based system
will allow investors to judge the commercial merits of
transactions, and give companies and market intermediaries more
flexibility in conducting their businesses and fund-raising
activities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it deems that the proposed disclosure-based regime
will also provide greater protection to investors by increasing
the legal obligation to disclose, raising the standard of
disclosure, and empowering the regulator to pursue civil actions
in the public interest.

<HEADLINE> Beverage Advertizing Rises in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua)-- The beer war between Kenya
Breweries and its South African counterpart for the east African
market has led to a steady increase in the advertizing of
beverages in the whole east African region.
</P>
<P>
Advertizing of beverages is highest in Uganda where it
accounts for 23 percent of the overall bookings followed by
Tanzania with 12 percent and Kenya 10 percent, the East African
weekly Monday quoted a company report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based Steadman and Associates firm conducting
media monitoring in the three states said in a report that most
beverage advertizements in Uganda were placed in the electronic
media.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's 10 radio stations took 72 percent of the overall
bookings, compared with 18 percent for the print media and 10
percent for television between January and September this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, transport consumed 14 percent of the advertizing
spend in Kenya, 16 percent in Tanzania, and only three percent in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A trend common to the three east African countries is the move
toward corporate advertizing which Tanzania recorded 13 percent
followed by Uganda with 11 percent and Kenya 10 percent of the
overall market share.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that in the third quarter of 1998, the
advertizement revenue in Uganda rose to 3.1 million U.S. Dollars
from three million Dollars in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, Tanzanians showed their preference for
television, which accounted for 73 percent of the bookings with
radio taking 20 percent and the print media five percent of the
advertizing revenue.
</P>
<P>
Revenue in Tanzania from the third quarter rose to 8.3 million
Dollars, up from 8.1 million Dollars recorded in the second
quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
Kenya maintained its traditional preference for the print
media which accounted for 42 percent of all advertizing revenue,
representing a seven percent decline from the 49 percent recorded
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Advertizing revenue in Kenya dropped from 45.8 million Dollars
in the second quarter to 35 million Dollars in the third, a
reflection of the general depression in its economy.
</P>
<P>
The report does not touch on outdoor advertizing which has had
tremendous growth in Kenya with billboards becoming a dynamic new
medium.

<HEADLINE> SADC Takes Step to Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Southern African
Development Community (SADC) countries have taken another
significant step in their plan to free trade exchanges in the
sub-region, agreeing on a technical framework for the program.
</P>
<P>
In last week's negotiations in Windhoek, capital of Namibia,
the 14 SADC member states agreed not to raise tariffs while the
talks were under way and to meet more frequently to sort out
trade problems, Business Day newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The "standstill clause" on tariffs would be effective from
July this year and the target for free trade is eight years, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
However, sources said that some countries may have to join the
free trade area later, including strife-torn Angola and the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
At the Windhoek meeting, SADC countries adopted a program
including monthly meetings of the trade negotiating forum, the
SADC's body for thrashing out trade bloc details, and occasional
technical meetings. They also agreed to identify non-tariff
barriers to trade.
</P>
<P>
At least eight of the SADC's 14 members tabled their opening
offers at the meeting. They were South Africa, Botswana,
Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, Malawi, Zambia and Mauritius, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said other countries were still preparing their
offers.
</P>
<P>
The countries embroiled in war might have to join the free
trade area at a later stage, as peace and stability in
participating countries was critical in ensuring predictability
in the investment environment, the report quoted sources close to
the meeting as saying.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has offered to open its markets to other SADC
members in five years, three years earlier than required under
the framework.
</P>
<P>
The SADC heads of government signed the free trade protocol in
1996. However, only four countries have so far ratified the
agreement, which needs to be ratified by a two-thirds majority to
be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The SADC secretariat has said that the free trade plan will
help the region create about 5 million jobs.

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Wind Power Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China has taken wind power as
an important source of electricity, and expects wind power
stations to have a total generating capacity of one million kw by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China State Power
Corporation (CSPC), China has installed 10 million small wind
power generators for individual families, with a total capacity of
20,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
China now has the capacity to produce 30,000 wind power
generators annually, and has built 15 large wind power fields with
a combined installed capacity of more than 30,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China will continue to carry out its
policy of developing small generators for individual families
living in border areas and remote regions who have no access to
power grids.
</P>
<P>
The country is implementing its plan to develop wind power in
provinces which are rich in wind power resources and lacking in
power supplies. The official source said that China is abundant in
wind power resources, and about two-thirds of the country is
windy, with total wind energy resources estimated at 253 million
kw.

PARIS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The people of New Caledonia Sunday voted frankly and
massively for the agreement of Noumea which will allow the French
overseas territory to gain emancipation from France and, perhaps,
from now on in a transitional period of 15-20 years, a total
independence.
</P>
<P>
Signed in May by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin with the
pro-independence FLNKS and the pro-French PRCR, the agreement
foresees a gradual and irreversible transfer of power by France to
the local authorities, the recognition of a "Caledonian
citizenship" and the establishment of a mechanism of
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
-- While some humanitarian associations are angry with the
weakness of the international aid to Central America after the
ravages by hurricane Mitch, foreign ministers of the European
Union will discuss the cancellation or at least an alleviation of
the debts owed by Honduras and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch, which was one of
the most destructive of the century, is so heavy that rescuers
seem to be at a loss where to begin their work, while the demands
for aid are increasing day by day in Central American states. The
figure of casualties, now estimated at 4,000 dead in Nicaragua and
6,000 dead in Honduras, could still rise. Nicaraguan President
Arnoldo Aleman has called on the international community to cancel
his country's debt.
</P>
<P>
-- The French government will begin to sell from Monday another
part of the stocks of France Telecom.

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants to Bring Back Two Israelis Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel wants to clarify the issue
about the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on charge of spying,
with the aim of bringing them back home.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israeli TV Channel 2 Sunday night, Netanyahu said
that "every Israeli citizen is important to us. We will clarify
this, and of course we will bring them home."
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landu, Chairman of Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, has also said that they should be brought back
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic activities are widely said to be underway between
the two sides, because they want the affair to end quietly.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot Justice Ministry issued a brief statement Sunday,
saying the two men were not working for Israel. It did not mention
the word "Mossad," Israel's intelligence organization.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Jerusalem have declined to comment till now,
except confirming that the two are Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Suspects Udi Hargov, 37, and Igal Damary, 49, have been
remanded for eight days and were transferred Sunday to Nicosia
for further investigation at an unspecified location, reports from
Cyprus said, adding that the two are being held separately.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has expressed concern over the military alliance between
Turkey and Israel, but is also keen on maintaining good relations
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time this year that Israel has been
embarrassed by a "security mishap" in Cyprus. In April, two
Israeli planes were caught flying over a planned missile base in
the northwest of the Island.

<HEADLINE> Kim: S. Korea Seeks Cooperative Partnership with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung said on Monday that his nation would like to establish a
comprehensive and cooperative partnership with China.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries, especially in the
economic respect, have sustained rapid development since the two
set up full diplomatic links in 1992, Kim said in an exclusive
interview with Chinese reporters before his five-day state visit
to China starting from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade volume with China -- its third largest
trade partner, has tripled since 1992. Last year the volume was
23.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kim stressed that there are much room for further
development with regard to the comprehensive partnership.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Kim said South Korea's consistent policy
is that there is only one China in the world, namely the People's
Republic of China, and Taiwan is a province of China.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean president said while staying in China, he will
discuss various bilateral, international and regional issues with
Chinese leaders, with emphasis on cooperative ways to maintain
peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, to strengthen
cultural exchange and to realize peace and prosperity in the
Northeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the economic situation of South Korea, Kim said
his country has overcome the crisis of foreign exchange currency,
with its foreign exchange reserves rising to 45 billion dollars
last month from the 3.8 billion dollars in February this year.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that South Korea's economic growth will turn
positive from negative late next year and the country will recover
rapid development from the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Chinese Taking Marriage Photos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Photos of many elderly couples
in China can now be seen in their rooms, not because they just got
married, but because the photographs are becoming popular.
</P>
<P>
One couple, Zhang Xiang and Liu Yu, who are in their
forties, took a marriage photo recently, with Liu wearing a
wedding dress and Zhang wearing a black suit.
</P>
<P>
They're a little bit shy when asked to explain why, but Liu
says that it was their 20th wedding anniversary and their son
insisted on the photo, to which Zhang adds that it was actually
she who wanted to take the photos. "Why say it's our son's idea?"
he jokes.
</P>
<P>
People who were married decades ago did not even dare take a
photo at the wedding ceremony because it was considered a
capitalist practice. But things are completely different now and
some people don't hesitate to spend nearly 1,000 yuan (120
U.S. dollars) on marriage photos. "It's worth the memory," says
Liu, even though the cost was about the equivalent of half a
year's salary several decades ago. "Better late than never," she
says, adding: "but for reforms and opening up, we would not have
dared to dream of taking a marriage photo."
</P>
<P>
A photograph is a mirror of society and people can know more
about the times through pictures, explains Li Zhen, who has been a
photographer for 30 years. Li has studied photos in the past and
there are clear differences with today. In most of the older
photos women can be seen standing behind their husbands, whereas
now they sit or stand side by side, reflecting the change in
social status of women.
</P>
<P>
Li says wedding photos became fashionable about ten years
ago. At first, the elderly accounted for 30 percent of the
customers, but the figure is down a bit, but still around 15
percent.

CANBERRA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia's northernmost city
of Darwin was shaken Monday by a major quake in the Banda Sea,
measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
The quake was felt in Darwin, capital of the Northern
Territory, at 4:30 p.m. (local time) Monday (0530 GMT Monday),
said Kevin McCue, an expert with the Australian Geological Survey
Organization (AGSO).
</P>
<P>
The Banda Sea is situated about 1,000 km north off Australia.
</P>
<P>
McCue was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying
one of their monitors in Darwin said it was the strongest quake he
had felt in 14 years or so."
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of damage.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a report from Indonesia's Antara News Agency said the
epicenter of the quake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, was

JOHANNESBURG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Johannesburg and

cooperation, resulting in the Namibian Stock Exchange (NSX)
becoming one of Africa's most advanced stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The computer link-up would be a boost to the liquidity and

The Namibian Stock Exchange will retain full independence in

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Takes No Action to Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Political pressure in Israel
prevented the army from taking actions against at least five new
hilltop outposts that Jewish settlers have built in the West Bank
since the Wye accord was signed two weeks ago, local paper
Ha'aretz reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The outposts are on hilltops near existing settlements, in
areas that are likely to become subject to negotiation in final
status talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The new settlement activities have been spotted at the hill
near Dolev and the Talmonim settlements northwest of Ramallah, a
hill near Alon Shvut in Gush Etzion about 40 kilometers south of
Jerusalem, a hilltop east of Shiloh and north of Ramallah, a
hilltop west of Shilon near the Eli settlement where hundreds of
homes remain empty and a hilltop east of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Israel's peace group Peace Now said that at least
three other new footholds near Alfei Menashe, Avnei Hefetz and
Bracha, have gone up since the Wye agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
All these settlement activities had been reported to the
Defense Ministry but the army has taken no action to stop such
constructions, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But the Defense Ministry is estimating that it will cost at
least 12 million U.S. dollars to beef up security for the
settlement enclaves which will abut Palestinian-controlled
territories after the second further troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side sharply criticized such new Jewish
settlement activities. Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Abu
Ala said in Ramallah on Sunday that "we can not sit around doing
nothing and we won't be able to prevent the explosion caused by
the provocation of the settlements."
</P>
<P>
On October 23, the two sides signed the agreement in
Washington, under which Israel will withdraw from another 13
percent of the West Bank, while the Palestinians will step up
efforts to crack down on Islamic militants.

JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A top Israeli government official indicated Sunday that
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now searching for a
"creative" solution which would allow the peace talks with the
Palestinians to continue although Netanyahu announced last week
that the cabinet would not ratify the new peace agreement until
the Palestinians meet certain conditions. The official also said
that the cabinet will probably resume ratification discussions
later this week.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and Palestinian investigators have concluded that
the two suicide bombers responsible for Friday's bombing attack in
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market were sent by a local branch of
Islamic Jihad, operating out of the West Bank town of Jenin. The
town is located within Area A, which is under the control of the
Palestinian National Authority, though both men lived in villages
in Area B under Israeli security control.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is considering a plan to
launch a second communications satellite, NileSat 102, the
Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Information Safwat el-Sherif was quoted as
saying on Sunday that negotiations are underway with the French
Matra Markoni corporation to build the satellite.
</P>
<P>
A contract is expected to be signed late this year, el-Sherif
added.
</P>
<P>
The NileSat 102 will carry 12 satellite channels transmitting
84 digital channels to countries in Africa, the Middle East and
South Europe, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
El-Sherif stressed that the satellite is basically meant to
cover the African continent in an effort to promote cooperation
among the African countries in the media field.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Egypt launched its first telecommunications
satellite, NileSat 101, which has 50 general and specialized
television channels with a presumed life span of 16 years.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Province Increasing Fixed Assets Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi Province
has added 2.5 billion yuan to its fixed assets investment plan for
November and December this year.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used for technological improvements in large
and mid-sized state enterprises, infrastructure, and flood and
disaster prevention, according to a report of the provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
The devastating floods this summer caused as much as 38 billion
yuan in losses here, or about three years' fiscal revenue of the
underdeveloped province.
</P>
<P>
To date, the central government has allocated more than two
billion yuan in funds for re-construction work in the province.
</P>
<P>
Output of grain, cotton, oil-bearing seeds and meat in the
province is expected to decline a great deal this year, and the
year's GDP is projected at 186 billion yuan, 7.8 billion yuan less
than the annual plan.
</P>
<P>
To ensure economic growth in the province, local financial
institutions increased loans by 6.85 billion yuan in the
July-September period alone, which accounted for 71.7 percent of
what they have granted so far this year.

YINCHUAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Yinchuan, capital of
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is brighter at night now that the
new Guangming Square is illuminated as much as Beijing's

<P>
The square represents the way Ningxia has gone from an
electricity-poor region to an electricity-rich one.

<P>
For a long time after the founding of New China in 1949,
Ningxia was described as a dark place and, in fact, had only one
generator which was left over from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Now, Ningxia can produce 11 billion kwh of electricity a year,
ranking the second place in per capita electricity output in
China. It is also the first in the northwest to light up every
village.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia says it will use its coal and hydraulic power
resources to increase its generating capacity to 10 million
kilowatts by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Delta Becomes China's New Granary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural development that
began in the 1980s has turned the Yellow River Delta in Shandong
Province into a granary for northern China.
</P>
<P>
The province harvested 1.77 million tons of summer grain from
the delta from January to June, a rise of 73,000 tons over the
same period last year. And winter wheat is doing well. The delta
is expected to increase its grain production by at least 100,000
tons this year.
</P>
<P>
A third of the delta's 800,000 hectares of farmland are
saline-alkali and used to be a sparsely populated area with poor
vegetation. But, in the past decade, farmers have improved 286,666
hectares of land, reclaiming 120,000 hectares of wasteland and
alkali soil, and upgrading 100,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the delta's grain production has been increasing
about 100,000 tons annually in the 1990s and the delta annually
sends more than 200,000 tons of grain to the cities of Tianjin and
Beijing and to Hebei and Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
There are about 200,000 hectares of low-yield farmland in the
Yellow River Delta, which adds more than 2,000 hectares of land
annually because of silting from the upper and middle reaches of
the river.
</P>
<P>
The state has decided to increase investment in science and
technology, to encourage farmers to use new varieties of grain,
and to expand the processing business in combination with
improving low-yield farmland and water conservation in its
comprehensive agricultural development program there.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Clarifies Position on Congo Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African Foreign
Ministry has made clear that South Africa was not considering
sending peace-keeping troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), but would provide logistical support if required to do so.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a weekend newspaper report stating that South
Africa may sent troops to the DRC, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Marco Boni said Saturday that South Africa has so far committed
itself only to providing logistical support to a possible
multinational peace-keeping force in the DRC, South African
newspapers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This would happen only after a cease-fire had been agreed to
by the warring parties in the conflict in the Great Lakes region,
Boni said.
</P>
<P>
He said no decision had been taken to contribute troops to a
peace-keeping force if it is sanctioned by international
organizations, and no decision had been made on what sort of
logistical support to provide.
</P>
<P>
The possibilities of the latter included airlifting
peace-keeping forces from other countries, and medical backup,
Boni was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo was expected to meet
his Congo counterpart Jean-Claude Lolakombe this week, following
Rwandan Vice-president Paul Kagame's admission on Friday that his
country's forces were involved in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Lolakombe will be the first member of beleaguered Congolese
President Laurent Kabila's government to visit Pretoria in the
latest attempts to end the three-month war.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's admission on Friday is seen as the removal of a major
stumbling block in the peace negotiations. Diplomats said this
would hopefully lead to intensified efforts from all sides to
accelerate the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Half of Yi People in China No Longer Living With Their Livestock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Some one million Yi people,
or 62 percent of the total Yi ethnic people in southwest China,
have stopped living together with their livestock, thanks to
the help from the central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Because of poor living conditions, farmers in the Yi ethnic
manority region often lived together with their livestock in
dark, damp rooms, something that lead to the spread of highly
infectious diseases. The death rate among children below the age
of 5 was as high as 10 percent in the region.
</P>
<P>
One of those beneficiaries from the help, Gyike Yeqoi,
a 65-year-old farmer who has spent most of his life in a small
village on Daliangshan Mountain in southern Sichuan, looks
at the new cowshed and toilet in his courtyard that give his
family a cleaner healthier life, and says, "For the first time
we don't have to live under the same roof as our cows."
</P>
<P>
Xue Caiquan, a local official, says that in the past 6 years,
more than 35 million yuan has been used to help local farmers
build livestock sheds and toilets and pave courtyards.
</P>
<P>
The village of Subuxi used to be so dirty and poor that few
girls would marry young men from the village.
</P>
<P>
Things are different today in the village, however. Mountains
have become greener, rivers clearer and houses clearner. In
addition, greenhouses with plastic sheeting have been built to
grow vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The 85 poorest families in the village have also moved into
new houses with running water. One of the villagers, Gyigu
Gyalgyal, talks about how satisfied he is with his life today,
with his business doing well and one of his sons studying in
college.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Sales to Grow in New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Housing sales in the United
States will grow in the new millennium, but the way in which the
market grows will vary according to the changing needs of several
generations, said a comprehensive study released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Existing-home sales will average 4.6 million units per year
between 2000 and 2010 in the country, then rise to about 4.9
million sales per year from 2010 to 2020, according to the study
by the U.S. National Association of Realtors (NAR).
</P>
<P>
The study was presented at the ongoing annual convention of
NAR, which is America's largest professional association
representing nearly 720,000 members involved in all aspects of the
real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
NAR projects median existing-home price to range from 210,000
U.S. dollars to 252,000 dollars between 2010 and 2020, while the
median new-home price should range from 261,000 dollars to 302,000
dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The changing needs of three generations -- the baby boom, the
baby bust and the millennium generation -- will have significant
impacts on the housing market between 2000 and 2020, NAR said.
</P>
<P>
Although the baby bust (born between 1965-79) and millennium
(born after 1979) generations are smaller than the baby boom (born
between 1946-64), NAR said, a rise in immigrant and minority home
buyers will offset a shrinking number of more traditional
households.
</P>
<P>
Each generation will shift in its housing needs, keeping the
housing market strong during the first part of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
The fastest growing demographic group will be 45-65 year olds,
which means there will be strong demand for up-scale housing and
second homes.
</P>
<P>
The millennium generation is expected to reach its prime
first-time home buying age in 7-10 years. Growing demand from
immigrants and minorities will preserve activity in the
starter-home market.
</P>
<P>
Racial and ethnic diversity will continue to increase in the
United States, according to the study. By 2020, the white
population will shrink from 76 percent of the total to about 64
percent. Hispanics will surpass blacks as the leading minority and
will account for 16 percent of the U.S. population. Blacks will be
just under 13 percent, while Asian and Pacific Islanders will be
under four percent.
</P>
<P>
In the next century, NAR said, the home buying process will
become easier and faster, spurred by deregulation and new
technologies. The millennium generation is techno-savvy, and will
do much of their home searching on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
During the first 20 years of the next century, the
U.S. population is projected to grow by an average of 2.4 million
per year. This translates into 1.1-1.2 million new households per
year, NAR said.

CHENGDU, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A dog has given birth to 15
puppies in the city of Chengdu in southwest China and its owner
has reported the event to the Guiness Book of World Records office
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Li Xinguo, the dog's owner, said he has been raising dogs for
more than 10 years and bought the mother, a dalmatian, at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
When she gave birth to 15 puppies on November 1 she didn't have
enough milk to feed all the puppies, so Li had to give them
powered milk, and all are doing well.

Zoologists say that dogs usually have only four to six puppies
at one time.

<HEADLINE> Drought, Pests Threaten Vietnam's Winter-Spring Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Water shortages and pests are
threatening the winter-spring crop in the Red River and the Mekong
deltas, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Red River delta and the Mekong delta are the biggest rice
producing areas of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam's National General Department of
Meteorology and Hydrology, at present, water levels in rivers and
reservoirs in the north of Vietnam are lower than those recorded
at this time in 1997. Water flow in rivers is between 20-30
percent lower than the average for this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the Mekong delta, water levels on the Tien and Hau
tributaries of the Mekong river are decreasing with levels now at
a record low.
</P>
<P>
The National Center for Meteorological and Hydrological
Forecast said annual flooding may come late to the delta this
year, and the flood peak is also likely to be the lowest in 170
years.
</P>
<P>
The delayed arrival of flood season has provided ideal
conditions for the breeding of rats and other pests in the Mekong
delta.
</P>
<P>
Surveys conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development (MARD) in 28 cities and provinces showed that by the
end of October about 72,000 hectares of food crops, mainly rice,
had been damaged by rats. Golden snails are also invading nearly
15,400 hectares of rice fields in many localities, especially in
the Mekong delta.
</P>
<P>
Although other pests pose less threat than they did during the
same period last year, the Department for Plant Protection under
MARD said the threat of bugs, grass hoppers, rats and locusts is
great. The department has held a conference to discuss pest
control measures and issued detailed instructions to localities in
this field.

<HEADLINE> Central Chinese City Keeping Double-Digit Industrial Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- In spite of this summer's immense
flooding on the Yangtze River, the city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei
Province, has still had double-digit growth in its industrial
sector.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, the sector generated
26.5 billion yuan in added value and 87.8 billion yuan in output
value, both increasing by more than 10 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
With improvement in performance, industrial enterprises sold
96.6 percent of their products in the nine months, which was
higher than the target set at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Forced by the serious summer flooding, more than 1,100
enterprises stopped production in the June-September period,
causing direct economic losses worth more than 800 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government tried every way possible to help them
restore production, with special attention being given to 55 key
enterprises, which led economic growth in the city.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters, the 55 enterprises had sales of
30.6 billion yuan and pre-tax profits of over 3.6 billion yuan, up
14 and 12.3 percent, respectively, from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports are another reason for the growth. By restructuring
foreign trade and opening markets in Europe, North America and
the Middle East, enterprises in Wuhan exported more than 170
million U.S. dollars worth of goods in the nine months to
September, up 61 percent from a year earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has ordered police to thoroughly investigate the murder
of former finance minister Ronald Penza by unknown gunmen in the
early hours of last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The president issued the order here Sunday at a service for
Penza, saying that the police should not listen to rumors but
should do a thorough probe for the killing.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen stormed into the house of Penza in the suburb of
Lusaka last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked the police not to rest until they bring the
culprits to book. I have asked them to leave no stone unturned
and to be meticulous in following up the circumstances
surrounding the death of Mr. Penza," Times of Zambia newspaper
quoted Chiluba as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the public not to despair but to cooperate
with the police in ensuring that the criminals are tracked down
and punished for their actions.
</P>
<P>
He said crime in his country should not be left to degenerate
into a situation where innocent and harmless people are killed in
cold blood.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba described Penza's death as untimely and a loss to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
"He was a young man who had been taken away prematurely by the
cold hand of evil," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the murder, five of the six gunmen have been gunned down
by police.
</P>
<P>
Penza, 49, had been finance minister from 1994 until March of
1998 when he was dismissed.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie said the government will of course follow up the
recommendations made by the Joint Fact-Finding Team investigating
the May riots.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with an Australian newspaper recently, the
president however said that he has not officially received the
report from the team.
</P>
<P>
The government-sponsored team, chaired by Marzuki Darusman,
deputy of the National Commission on Human Rights, presented its
findings to the media last week.
</P>
<P>
Their findings showed that nearly 1,300 people were killed
during the May 13-15 riots and that 52 women were raped with 14
more falling victim to rape with violence, 10 to sexual attacks,
and 9 to sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
The team is urging the government to investigate a secret
meeting held at the Army's Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad)
headquarters on May 14, and the possible role of former president
Soeharto's son-in-law Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subiyanto and former
Jakarta military commander Maj. Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoedin.
</P>
<P>
The government is prepared to probe into the possible
involvement of Prabowo and Sjafrie in the May riots in Jakarta,
and if necessary, bring them to a military tribunal, the president
was quoted by Antara News Agency Monday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Further Promote Thrift Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Thrift should be further promoted
to increase funding for economic development, Vietnam's Finance
Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung was quoted Monday by the Vietnamese
official media.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Vietnam has since 1996 slashed up to 40
percent of the budget for the state machinery.
</P>
<P>
Hung told the local press on the sidelines of the current
National Assembly sitting here that belt-tightening should be
accelerated among the public, state firms and government agencies
at all levels.
</P>
<P>
For state-owned enterprises, expenditure by management and for
materials and fuels should be made public, the minister said,
adding that "thrift here does not mean spending less, but spending
efficiently."
</P>
<P>
Hung stressed that importance should be attached to state
budget saving. This means that estimates for investment must be
strictly supervised and careful consideration should be given to
the establishment of businesses.
</P>
<P>
Two tasks should be carried out immediately to restrict public
spending. The government should try not to spend more than the
estimates approved by the National Assembly and spending should be
audited, the finance minister said.

<HEADLINE> E. African States See High FDI Rise: UNCTAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Tanzania are among
18 African countries that received an increase in foreign direct
investments (FDI) last year, according to the latest report by a
U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
Kenya does not feature among the top 20 on the list while
Tanzania is ranked 16th and Uganda 17th, says the report which is
to be officially released by the Geneva-based U.N. Conference of
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania and Uganda both received a little under 300 million
U.S. Dollars in FDI last year, nearly six times Kenya's figure of
around 50 million Dollars, says "World Investment Report 1998:
Trends and Determinants."
</P>
<P>
The report doesn't list the outflows of capital from these
three east African economies, which are estimated to be high,
considering the interest on debt repayment and repatriation of
profits by businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is also listed among the top seven countries, named
"front-runner" economies, to have marked an improvement over the
previous year in at least one of four indicators used to ranks
the 18 states.
</P>
<P>
The ratings are based on the annual FDI inflows, inflows per
1,000 U.S. Dollars of the gross domestic product (GDP), average
ratio of inflows to capital formation and inflows per capita.
</P>
<P>
Political stability, minimized corruption, privatization and
efficient tax regimes are also mentioned as additional factors
that attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicates that the FDI to Africa as a whole
amounted to 4.7 billion Dollars in 1997, remaining at the same
level as in 1996. However, the figure has doubled since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Countries such as Zambia, Zimbabwe, Cameroun and Mauritius
received an estimated 100 million Dollars in investment.

SHANGHAI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Browsing Internet for job
vacancies has become something of a fashion in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters, 500,000 people have visited job

<HEADLINE> Cleaner Energy Sources Used in Rural Southwest China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province in southwest
China is pushing for newer energy sources, especially methane and
electricity, in rural areas to protect the environment, local
sources say.
</P>
<P>
Some two million families in the province are using
methane-generating pits to make gas for cooking and heating, which
saves about a million trees, or 131,000 hectares of forest in the
process, according to the provincial energy office for rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In the past, farmers had to burn wood and plant stalks, with
some bad effects on the environment. These days, a tenth of the
rural people in Sichuan have begun to use methane.
</P>
<P>
The methane-generating pits are usually built under toilets and
pigsties, where manure, stalks, and vegetable waste is fermented
to generate methane which is pumped into houses for cooking and
heating.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is restricting the rural people on
logging next year, which will reduce the amount of wood available
for fuel.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan's power generating capacity is increasing by 227,000 kw
annually. By the year 2000, some 200 methane, solar, and other
energy projects costing 2.5 billion yuan will be introduced to 10
villages in Sichuan.

<HEADLINE> Luxurious Books Not Most Popular Item for Chinese Shoppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China book sellers now tend to
refuse books that are expensive and well designed, with good
bindings but are not as attractive to buyers as a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
At a recent book market in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province,
a large number of these books were not moving, even though sellers
had cut the price by half.
</P>
<P>
One of the people who arranged the market said that the high
price of these "noble books" kept them from selling.
</P>
<P>
A set of the "Twenty-Four Histories" was valued at from 16,000
yuan (1,900 U.S. dollars) to 38,000 yuan in various de luxe
editions, and a hand-bound edition of Chinese classics was going
for 1,600 yuan.
</P>
<P>
A professor from Shaanxi Teachers University said that he
really longed to own a set of "The Mirror of History", but he
stopped when he saw the price of 670 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some children's books were also expensive, with some priced
from several hundred yuan to 10,000 yuan. And some parents were
complaining that new editions are priced out of their reach and
they look back fondly to the days of cheap picture-story books.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hongbo, chief editor of Xinjiang People's Publishing
House, said that publishing houses should consider people's
ability to spend when they make publishing decisions, and that
producing books with luxurious bindings is not attractive to
buyers.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake-Damaged Part Of Southwestern China Back To Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On February 3, 1996, the 800-year-old county was hit by a quake
measuring 7 on the Richter Scale that claimed the lives of 309
people and destroyed 1,737 of the county town's 4,750 houses.
</P>
<P>
But, thanks to a joint government and local citizen effort,
transportation, telecommunications, water, and power supplies were
back to normal in 10 days, and after 15 days, the problems of
daily living were solved.
</P>
<P>
A few months after the disaster, the local government started a
three-year project to rebuild unsafe buildings, improve the water
supply and drainage system, plant trees, and install fire
prevention equipment.
</P>
<P>
A great effort was also made to repair schools, and by
September of last year, 100 million yuan had been spent on 120
schools.
</P>
<P>
Ying Zhenyi, the head of the No. 1 Middle School, says that the
school was badly damaged by the quake, but a month later, some
temporary rooms were put up on the playground for classrooms, and
the school was able to start the new semester on schedule. About a
year later, the school's 2,000 students and 200 teachers moved
into new buildings.
</P>
<P>
In the village of Wenrong, around 113 houses were badly
damaged, but now each household has a floor space of 192 square
meters and the new houses are made of brick, which is much better
than the old wooden ones.

<HEADLINE> Author of Book on Moi to Be Sued in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A Judge of Kenya's Appeal
Court is preparing to sue Andrew Morton, the British author of
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi's new biography which officially
goes on sale across the east African state Monday.
</P>
<P>
Justice Evans Gicheru, quoted by the East African weekly
Monday, said that he is to sue the author over a passage in the
book on the Judicial Commission which investigated the murder of
Foreign Minister Robert Ouko in February 1990.
</P>
<P>
Gicheru, who headed the judicial inquiry set up by Moi in 1990
after the minister's death, argues with the book's suggestions of
links between the Commission judges and a powerful governmental
official whom the author believes may have killed Ouko.
</P>
<P>
The book, titled "Moi: The Making of an African Statesman,"
suggests the minister's killing may have been ordered by the then
permanent secretary in charge of internal security, Hezekiah
Oyugi, over rivalry for political leadership and a woman's love.
</P>
<P>
Oyugi died in 1992 while undergoing treatment for a mysterious
ailment in London.
</P>
<P>
It is said the book makes unflattering references to Gicheru
in the Ouko murder inquiry in 1990/91, famed anthropologist Dr
Richard Leakey, and the president's son, Major Philip Moi.
</P>
<P>
"Such allegations, if uncontested, can bring (damage) on
judicial integrity. Public confidence in the judiciary is
severely dented when such reckless claims are made," said Gicheru
at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I am already organizing myself to sue for the damage caused
to my integrity as a judge by these false assertions," he said,
claiming that Morton never contacted the judges to verify the
information he had gathered in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The writer has received cooperation from the Kenyan government
and been given access to different people who had known the
president for a long time.
</P>
<P>
However, Morton in London told the weekly newspaper by phone
that the book doesn't question the judiciary's integrity.
</P>
<P>
"There is no criticism of the judges. What I offered was an
example of how Oyugi took such a keen interest in the inquiry,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Morton made his name with the best-selling "Diana: Her True
Story" about the late British princess.

<HEADLINE> S. African Firms Given Green Light to List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- South African Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel has come out in favor of large South
African companies having primary listings offshore, Business Day
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Large South African companies need to have a primary listing
on a foreign stock exchange for their access to capital for
growth, Manuel said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that such listings could benefit South Africa as
they would result in a capital flow into the country, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Manuel's comments at a business breakfast came in the wake of
an announcement by Anglo American, South Africa's flagship mining
group and the country's biggest listed company, that it would
move its primary listing and hence headquarters to London.
</P>
<P>
There were indications that some other business giants could
soon follow suit, including Sappi, the largest fine paper
producer in the world which was based in South Africa, and
Africa's leading life assurance group Old Mutual.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said that the choice for companies such as South
African Breweries (SAB), one of the largest brewers in the world,
was either to grow globally and remain in the top league, or
become the object of a takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
"If SAB wants to grow it has to look at whether it can do this
from South Africa. If it goes to London for a listing then its
access to capital will be so much better," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
It has to be accepted that this is the way the world worked,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Anglo American's relocation has encountered opposition from
trade unions, which said the group's abandoning of the South
African ship would have grave effect on employment in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said large South African corporations that qualified
for the FTSE 100 index, the top 100 companies by market
capitalization on the London Stock Exchange, stood to receive
re-ratings as international investors were forced to buy shares
relating to index funds.
</P>
<P>
This could result in a much-needed capital flow into South
Africa, they said.

LONDON -- Irish police Sunday arrested seven suspected members
of a breakaway group of Sinn Fein, political wing of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
An Irish police spokesman was quoted by Reuters as saying that
three men from Britain's Northern Ireland region and four from the
Irish Republic were arrested in a swoop on activists who had
attended the annual convention of the Republican Sinn Fein party
in Drogheda, north of Dublin. The suspects were being questioned
about suspected membership of the Continuity IRA, the only armed
group involved in Northern Ireland's 30-year conflict which has
not declared a ceasefire, the report said.

HARARE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Talks to end a border dispute
between Ethiopia and Eritrea collapsed in Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso Sunday, giving rise to an intensification of war in the Horn
of Africa, according to a report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Well-placed sources disclosed that Eritrea steadfastly refused
to withdraw from the border frontier of Badme until a United
Nations peace-keeping force was in place.
</P>
<P>
The Eritreans were also not comfortable with Djibouti joining
the mediation talks, saying that country was an ally of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the two warring parties refused to sit on the same
table.

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe for the greater part of
Sunday made efforts to converge the two countries.

"contentious issues" before their presentation to Compaore.

Mugabe later joined the leaders from the two other mediating
countries, Compaore and President of Djibouti Hassan Gouled
Adtidon, at the Ouagadougou foreign affairs office to discuss
proposals made to Eritrea and Ethiopia.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk Monday presided over the ceremony of the 45th anniversary
of Independence Day at the Independence Monument in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the blessing by several eminent Buddhist monks,
the King lit the flames in the monument's brazier which will last
for three days.
</P>
<P>
Only Defense Minister Tea Banh attended the ceremony, Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen and ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
President Chea Sim and other senior government officials have not
appeared.
</P>
<P>
The King remind the history about how Cambodia won its national
independence on November 9, 1953, and made the prominent
achievements since then.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five years ago, then-Prince Sihanouk won his crusade to
lift the yoke of French colonialism which dated back to 1853.
</P>
<P>
Many countries' leaders, including Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, United States' President Clinton and UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan, sent the messages of congratulation to King Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
They saluted the important role the King has played in trying
to bring about peace and reconciliation to the country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wishes Cambodia's leaders to participate in peaceful
dialogue leading toward a resolution of outstanding election
issues and formation of a government that reflects the will of the
people as expressed in the July election.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a statement released by Prince Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC party Monday spoke highly of King's important role for
the nation's reconciliation and development.
</P>
<P>
It also said FUNCINPEC was ready at any time to break the
present political deadlock, but insisted that all the political
parties must make some necessary concessions for the sake of the
nation and the country, just like the FUNCINPEC did in 1993.

<P>
YANGON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has experienced the
entire process of human history such as the period prior to
evolution of the human beings, Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age
and Modern Age.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), was quoted by
Monday's official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar as saying
that it was confirmed that primates originated in the Pontaung
Ponnya areas of Myanmar about 40 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Sunday at a ceremony of handing over antiques and
cultural objects to the Ministry of Culture, Khin Nyunt, who is
also chairman of the Cultural Heritage Preservation Committee,
said firm evidence showed that human beings of the Stone Age lived
in the Padalin Cave and discovery of Stone Age implements
indicated that it took place in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Discovery of its paintings near Yegantaung in Myeik township,
southern Myanmar, also indicated that Stone Age man resided in
different areas of the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the excavation of bronze objects and weapons at
Nyaunggan area in Budalin township and Tatkon township in central
part of the country proved that Bronze Age existed, developed and
flourished in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The objects handed over include those of the Pyu period and the
National Museum would be able to display a wide array of Pyu
period objects, and experts would be able to evaluate the
antiquity of the objects, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
In September, the SPDC enacted a Protection and Preservation of
Cultural Heritage Regions Law, aiming at protecting and preserving
the cultural heritage that has existed for many years in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Price Plunge Shrinks Bangladesh's Shrimp Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's frozen food export
has been badly hit by the price fall of shrimps in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 tons of frozen shrimp are waiting in the freezers
for buyers, but the market is dull, The Daily Star Business
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh usually exports shrimps worth between 2-3 billion
taka (41.67-62.5 million U.S. dollars) during the peak season from
September to October, but only 500-600 million taka's (10.41-12.50
million dollars) shrimps have been exported this year, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
"As the international markets have seen prices fall, buyers are
waiting for further cuts," one expert was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The price of a common variety shrimp in the international
market fell to 4.25 U.S. dollars per pound from six dollars
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"If we can't export shrimps during the peak season, the growth
of the sector will come to a standstill," the expert said.
</P>
<P>
The price slump in the international market was attributed to
bumper production and massive devaluation in some Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Massive devaluation of currencies made Southeast Asian
products much cheaper," said Azizur Rahman, member of Asian
Seafood and an executive member of the Bangladesh Frozen Food
Exporters Association.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Bangladesh would face a sharp production
shortfall this year. The country's shrimp production this year
might fall by as much as 40 percent to around 15,000 tons from
last year's 25,000 tons, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The shrimp sector in the country has already been reeling under
various problems such as the European Union's import restrictions
and dull international market, which may force many fish
processing plants out of business in the country.
</P>
<P>
Twenty out of the 50 running processing plants may have to
close soon, plant owners said. Seventy-three processing plants
have shut down in the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry has asked the Export Promotion Bureau to
work out measures to help the exporters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.5 million professional fishermen in
Bangladesh, and the export of frozen food, both fish and shrimp,
contributes about 8.7 percent to the country's total foreign
exchange earnings.

<HEADLINE> State Auction of Property Succeeds in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's state auction of
real estate assets seized from the 56 closed financial
institutions was a surprising success, an official from the
Financial Sector Restructuring Authority (FRA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The auction, held on Sunday, attracted thousands of bargain
hunters with a number of real estate assets sold at higher prices
than expected, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 318 lots, whose floor price was about 3.85 billion
baht (105.5 million U.S. dollars), were put up for auction. They
were divided into two categories -- those worth below 15 million
baht (410,959 dollars) and above.
</P>
<P>
Of the 46 lots worth over 15 million baht each, 13 were sold
for 778.5 million baht (21.3 million dollars), about 34 percent up
from the starting price of 581.4 million baht (15.9 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the sale of Bangkok property in the under 15-million-baht
category, 60 lots were sold for 323 million baht (8.8 million
dollars), about 66 percent higher than the floor price of 195
million baht (5.3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The official said the sale was a success and should herald
clearance of a moribund property market.

<HEADLINE> Italian Scientist Optimistic about Cancer Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 8 (Xinhua) -- One of Italy's top cancer
researchers Sunday voiced "optimism and hope" for efforts to find
a cure for the disease.
</P>
<P>
Marking the National Anti-Cancer Day at a meeting with Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, professor Umberto Veronesi said
that more progress has been made against malign tumors in the last
twenty years than "in the previous 2,000".
</P>
<P>
But he also admitted that a "giant effort" is still needed,
with innovative research ideas and more money for research.
</P>
<P>
He urged people to realize that tumors can now be cured" in 50
percent of the cases", which is why he said national information
days such as today's are important in helping "leave behind the
prejudices of the past".
</P>
<P>
Veronesi also said that Italy is now in the vanguard of
anti-cancer research and is making a "constructive" contribution
to the world research effort.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro expressed in his speech thanks to Health Minister Rosy
Bindi, Veronesi and the others present for their "seriousness" in
cancer research.
</P>
<P>
He contrasted "serious" research of this kind with the
"unserious clamor" stirred up over the last twelve months around
the claimed cancer cure devised by the Modena doctor, Luigi Di
Bella.
</P>
<P>
The results so far available from official testing have
confirmed that it has no identifiable effect, and supporters of
the 86-year-old doctor now claim they only said it could help
terminal patients cope better with the final stages of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro said the media played an important role in stirring up
the "clamor" which saw rallies of thousands in the city streets,
thanks largely to "political contamination", presumably a
reference to conservative politicians who sought to ride the wave
of pro-Di Bella protests.

<HEADLINE> Few Old Ladies of Chinese Ethnic Group Have Grey Hair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Visitors walking the streets of
Xishuangbanna, a popular tourist spot in the southern part of
China's Yunnan province, may be surprised by the long, black hair
of elderly Dai minority women, even though they may have wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
Local elderly women take pride in their hair because so few
have grey hair. They attribute this to the unusual way they wash
their hair.
</P>
<P>
Even though the shops and grocery stores in the region sell all
kinds of shampoo, most women there still favor a product from the
natural Chinese honey locust. And, after washing, they like to
soak their damp hair in a kind of fermented water for a few
minutes before they wash it with clear water. The fermented water
is stored up after it has been used to washing rice before cooking.
</P>
<P>
Some visitors have noticed how local people like to eat cold
dishes made from wild plants, which have a lot of protein and
vitamins. They believe that fresh food provides the hair with
necessary nutriments.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Foreign Minister to Visit Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Foreign Minister
Abdus Samad Azad will pay a three-day visit to Myanmar from
Wednesday to Friday at the invitation of his Myanmar counterpart
U Ohn Gyaw, according to an official announcement here Monday.
</P>
<P>
It will be Azad's second visit to Yangon since September 1996.
The issue of Myanmar refugees in Bangladesh is expected to top the
agenda of talks between the two foreign ministers during the
visit.
</P>
<P>
During Azad's first trip to Myanmar, the two countries agreed
to complete the repatriation work of the Myanmar refugees from
Bangladesh at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers then noted that there is no serious
problem existing between the two countries, saying that even if
there is problem, settlement would be made, based on mutual
respects, trust and friendship.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw visited
Bangladesh and bilateral issues, particularly the repatriation of
Myanmar refugees, border trade and cooperation in joint ventures,
were discussed between the two foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, a total of 250,000 Myanmar Muslims refugees fled
across border into Bangladesh from Western Rakhine state and about
230,000 of them have been so far reportedly repatriated under
joint supervision of Bangladesh and Myanmar governments as well
as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, the repatriation process, which began in September
1992 following an agreement reached between the two sides earlier
in April the same year, has remained stalled since July 1997
reportedly as a result of the refugees' refusal to return.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Presses for Wider Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is negotiating with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a wider budget deficit
in order to stimulate the shrinking economy, the Bangkok Post said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, negotiations with IMF, which
brokered an economic bailout of Thailand, will start Monday as
part of the country's updated commitment to economic reforms,
better known as the sixth letter of intent.
</P>
<P>
The previous letter calls for a fiscal 1999 budget deficit
equaling 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), or 150 billion
baht, of which two-thirds would go to state enterprises while the
rest was part of the central budget.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic and Social Development Board, the Finance
Ministry, the Bank of Thailand and the Budget Bureau are now
evaluating the extent to which the deficit can be increased based
on their projection of economic growth for next year.
</P>
<P>
The government wants most of the deficit to help agriculture
and other productive industries, especially those of small and
medium size that would play a major role in a recovery, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Oilfield Tapping into Offshore Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Shengli Oilfield at the mouth of
the Yellow River, said it pumped 1.36 million tons of crude oil
from the Bohai Sea in the first eight months of the year.
</P>
<P>
One local observer called this a major breakthrough in using
offshore oil reserves to offset a fall in continental production.
</P>
<P>
Shengli was set up in 1964 and has produced 640 million tons of
crude oil since then, or more than a fourth of the country's total
since 1949. In recent years however, its annual output has been
dropping because of shrinking oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield began offshore operation in the Bohai Sea several
years ago and has drilled 140 wells, gaining an annual production
capacity of a million tons.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield is expected to raise annual output of marine crude
oil to five million tons by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Insists on Being Everybody's Friend but </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is still pursuing a
policy of being everybody's friend but nobody's ally despite the
end of the Cold War, a latest official report on the political
situation of Myanmar said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for the Myanmar government to expound its
foreign policy in details in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by the Office of Strategic Studies of the
Defense Ministry, said that Myanmar's natural and inborn policy
has not been accepted today on account of the imposition of the
will of a solitary existence of a super power.
</P>
<P>
"Today's concept virtually imposed on Myanmar is either she has
to become an ally or an opponent," the report said.
</P>
<P>
On reviewing the country's foreign policy, the report pointed
out that since Myanmar regained independence from the British in
1948, it has chose to pursue an active and independent foreign
policy, leaving the British Commonwealth and adopting a neutral
and later a non-aligned policy throughout the Cold War period.
</P>
<P>
"In pursuance such a policy there are some pluses she has been
accorded mainly enabling her to stay out of the regional
conflicts. The minuses are that she has neither developed
capitalist nor communist alliances," it stated.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that when Myanmar became a socialist
country after the end of its parliamentary era, the western world
regarded it as a pro-communist state, while the socialist world
upheld it as a sort of a namesake socialist country.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Myanmar has more or less stayed away from
the regional and international crisis with doors partly closed
eventually leading her to self-imposed seclusion in pursuit of its
own ideals, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), it recalled that
Myanmar, one of the founding members of the NAM, left the
organization in 1979, considering the movement strayed from its
original course, but later rejoined the movement in 1992,
realizing that the stance of the organization was in accordance
with its objectives of strict neutrality and non-alignment.

<HEADLINE> China's Yellow River Delta Attracting Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River Delta in east
China's Shandong Province has emerged as a new place for foreign
investment in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Two major places, the city of Dongying and Binzhou Prefecture,
have reported nearly 600 overseas-funded enterprises, with foreign
investment of about 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local government sources said that the investment is coming from
Japan, the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and
half a dozen other countries. Most of the enterprises engage in
agriculture, machinery, or the chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
Du Shupeng, a Chinese-American, set up a farm on 1,600 hectares
of waste land in the delta at a cost of 10 million U.S. dollars
three years ago. He now grows grain and has aquatic products and
has had good harvest for two consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-funded enterprises in Binzhou alone reported 1.6
billion yuan in output value for the first half of the year, up 30
percent from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that, of China's three large delta areas
long the Pearl, the Yangtze and the Yellow rivers, only the Yellow
River still needs to be exploited on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments have put the Yellow River
Delta at the top of their agenda, and the United Nations
Development Program has a program to assist the delta's
development that has been given priority for the next
century.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Wants to Resettle 850,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
targeting to resettle 850,000 squatter-families and other homeless
Filipinos as part of its commitment to uplift the living standards
of poor people,
Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This figure includes 450,000 squatter-families in Metro Manila
alone whom President Estrada wants the Housing and Urban
Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) to resettle in accordance
with the government's mass-housing projects, HUDCC Chairman Karina
David was quoted as saying over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
 "Our target" is to resettle first the squatters living along
the Pasig River and Esteros in two years, then to resettle at
least 850,000 families within six years, Karina David said.
</P>
<P>
 The HUDCC chairman said President Estrada wanted the banks of
Pasig River to be developed into "parks and promenades".
</P>
<P>
 "Once the squatters have been relocated, we will develop the
river banks into parks... We will have ferry boats, we will build
terminals in Makati, Mandaluyong, Manila... It will become an
alternative mode of transportation for our people," President
Estrada was quoted as saying in his housing program.
</P>
<P>
 The president earlier ordered HUDCC to reverse an earlier
low-cost housing policy by pumping the bulk of its funds into
socialized housing projects for the poor.
</P>
<P>
 This means that 80 percent of housing funds will now be
devoted to socialized housing, and only 20 percent to economic
housing. Socialized housing units each cost 180,000 pesos or less.
</P>
<P>
 During the previous Ramos administration, 80 per cent of the
housing funds went to economic housing and only 20 per cent to
socialized housing.

<HEADLINE> Sofia Prison Inmates Receive Vocational Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Inmates of the Sofia prison are
attending training courses at the moment and will receive
certificates as stokers and cooks, according to the prison
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Zhoro Petrov, the Sofia prison's deputy chief, said that the
three-month courses were organized with the assistance of the
catering and hoteliery college and the vocational school of power
engineering, the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The preparation of inmates for life outside prison starts three
months before their release. Their social officers connect them
with employment agencies. A special club called Employment and set
up at the prison acts as an intermediary.
</P>
<P>
The average age of prisoners in Bulgaria is 31.7. Nearly 1,000
inmates of the prison in Sofia are about this age.
</P>
<P>
The inmates are divided into 13 groups of 60 to 120 persons
each. A social officer is attached to each group. He can make
recommendations for release on parole of prisoners who behave well
or for giving them certain privileges in compliance with the
Execution of Punishments Act.
</P>
<P>
"Social work here involves activities aimed to help prisoners
readapt to society, give them work experience and individual work
with everyone of them," said Stana Genova, prison inspector in
charge of inmates' preparation for release.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes former inmates come back to prison because they
cannot take care of themselves or just have no other place to go,"
Genova said.
</P>
<P>
However, employers in Bulgaria are still not inclined to hire
former prisoners, though they have vocational training and would
agree to work for a lower pay, inspectors say.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reinforcing Buildings Against Possible Quakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China is strengthening key
buildings in Beijing and the vicinity because of possible threats
of earthquakes, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"A special 544 million yuan (65.54 million US dollars) fund
will be diverted this year to seismic retrofitting and structural
reinforcement of 3.96 million square meters of existing buildings
in the Capital Circle," Qu Qi, director of the Anti-Earthquake
Office under the Ministry of Construction, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Capital Circle includes Beijing, Tianjin, and parts of
Hebei Province, which covers an area of 150,000 square kilometers
and a population of 60 million in 10 cities, according to sources
from the Pubicity Department of the China Seismological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Another 156 million yuan (18.8 million US dollars) will be used
to construct seismograph stations in the Capital Circle, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
China is now in the midst of a period of seismic
activity. Seismologists warned that a destructive earthquake could
hit the northern parts of North China in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Some 240,000 people died on July 28, 1976 in a catastrophic
earthquake in Tangshan City, Hebei Province. The latest disastrous
one in January this year in Zhangbei County of the province killed
49 people and caused at least 2.39 billion yuan (287.9 million US
dollars worth of direct economic losses.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the unparalleled importance of the region, and the
severe quake situation, the State Council decided in July to build
the Capital Circle into an anti-quake and disaster relief pilot
zone," said Qu.
</P>
<P>
Priorities will be given to the historically significant
facilities, such as the National Museum of Chinese Revolution, the
Agriculture Exhibition Hall, the main buildings of Qinghua
University and Beijing Hotel, which were constructed in the 1950s
and 60s and are possibly vulnerable to the quakes, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Anti-earthquake departments should apply for funds from local
governments to strengthen another 28 million-square-meter
buildings and some so-called lifeline projects within the Capital
Circle, according to Qu.
</P>
<P>
Qu said that a series of earthquake-fighting techniques,
including rubber base-isolator, rubber cushioning, energy
dissipation and structural controls will be applied in the
strengthening project, expected to be finished by the end of
2000.

<HEADLINE> Seven Guerrilla Suspects Arrested in Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Irish police Sunday arrested
seven suspected members of a breakaway group of Sinn Fein,
political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
An Irish police spokesman was quoted by Reuters as saying that
three men from Britain's Northern Ireland region and four from the
Irish Republic were arrested in a swoop on activists who had
attended the annual convention of the Republican Sinn Fein party
in Drogheda, north of Dublin.
</P>
<P>
"They were arrested between 4 p.m. (1600 GMT) and 5.30 p.m.
(1730 GMT) (Sunday) in connection with alleged paramilitary
activities as part of ongoing investigations," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were being questioned about suspected membership
of the Continuity IRA, the only armed group involved in Northern
Ireland's 30-year conflict which has not declared a ceasefire, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Continuity IRA has remained violently opposed to the peace
process for its failure to bring about Irish unity and bitterly
opposes the IRA's truce, which it sees as a sell-out.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Qufu, the hometown of Confucius,
the Chinese educator and thinker more than 2,000 years ago, has
become a major tourist destination in Shandong Province, east
China.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, the city has had over 28 million domestic
tourists and 420,000 overseas visitors, according to Kong
Xiangjin, director of Qufu's Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Qufu has a number of historic sites like the Temple of
Confucius, the Confucius Mansion and the Confucian Forest, all
three of which have been put on UNESCO's World Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the city has tried to protect its cultural
relics by setting up tourist areas in the ancient city, including
a stone tablet garden and natural scenic spot.
</P>
<P>
The city also has more than 120 hotels, compared with only one
at the beginning of the 1980s. A seventh of the city's people are
involved in the tourism industry. Last year, tourism income
accounted for more than 10 percent of the city's gross domestic
product.

<HEADLINE> Transient Workers Return Home to Run Their Own Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Farmers from China's western
regions who searched for jobs in more developed eastern parts of
the country in the early 1980s have started to return home and
used the knowledge and skills they gained to contribute to the
economic growth and cultural progress in their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Tianping, from China's Sichuan Province, is one of
thousands of people in central and western parts of the country
who are benefiting from work in more developed coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Xiang, 32, now runs a furniture factory that has 500,000 yuan
(60,000 U.S. dollars) in registered capital and earns more than 2
million yuan from annual sales. His products account for 60
percent in the furniture market in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Xiang left his home to work at a furniture
center in the city of Shunde in Guangdong Province, where he
acquired the technology and management skills and accumulated a
small sum of money. He returned to his hometown in 1995 and took
30,000 yuan from his savings, with which he invested in a small
factory of his own.
</P>
<P>
In another instance, the village of Sanhe in Hunan Province had
fewer than 400 laborers, and 120 of them were working outside in
1994. Beginning in 1995, 45 have returned and two-thirds of
them have opened various businesses in their home villages, such
as brick factories, hair salons, clothing stores,
restaurants, auto repair shops, and small transport companies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the reason why more transient workers have
been returning home lies in the rapid development of industries and
the service sector in rural areas in recent years and the fast
development of small towns.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Race For U.S. House Leadership Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republicans fought on
airwaves on Sunday over the leadership of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Representative Bob Livingston of Louisiana, who challenged
Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia last week, said conservatives
must accept that their agenda was subject to Republicans'
wafer-thin majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, who in 1994 led the party to its first House majority
in 40 years, on Friday announced he was stepping down from the
post, causing a battle for leadership posts.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's television talk shows became a Republican campaign
rally as candidates for several House leadership jobs set forth
their points.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on ABC television's "This Week" program, Livingston
said House Republicans' small majority in the next Congress, which
would be sworn in January, would leave the new Speaker no option
but to compromise.
</P>
<P>
"When you have slim margins... you can't do everything that you
want," Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's decision to step down was reportedly precipitated
partially by Livingston's announcement of his candidacy on
Friday. Livingston was encouraged by Republicans who blamed
Gingrich's political miscalculations for the loss of five seats to
Democrats in the November 3 midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
Livingston, 55, currently House Appropriations Committee
Chairman, won the crucial support on Saturday of Representative
Tom DeLay, who as Majority Whip holds the number three leadership
position in the House.
</P>
<P>
DeLay is the only senior House leader expected not to face a
challenge, and his support for Livingston was interpreted as an
effort by the leadership to limit the bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
Challenging Livingston was Chris Cox, a relatively young
conservative from California. Cox said he believed the race was
still wide open.
</P>
<P>
"What is at stake here is not just the future of the House of
Representatives but the future of Congress and the country," Cox
told "Face the Nation" on CBS.
</P>
<P>
House Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner, the
number-four Republican in the House, appealed for as little
bloodletting as possible on "This Week". Boehner is being
challenged by Representative J.C. Watts, the only black Republican
in the House.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Representative Steve Largent said he had contacted
more than 100 members to get support for his bid to challenge
Representative Dick Armey for House Republican leader, the number
two position. "We have strong commitments from over half of the
people we called," he said.
</P>
<P>
An ABC poll said 70 percent of Americans favored Gingrich's
stepping down. Ninety percent said the Republicans should find a
speaker who tries harder than Gingrich did to work with
Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Muslim Region Expands Trade Ties With Arab Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region has established trade relations with 17 Islamic countries,
and its trade volume with them soared to 11.4 million U.S.dollars
worth in 1997, 13 times more than the figure 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to Qian Genfang, head of the Bureau of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, exports to Islamic countries accounted
for 4.3 percent of the total export volume in 1997. Major export
commodities include textile products, garments, mineral products,
raw materials for the chemical industry, and machines.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, total import and export volume reached 303 million
U.S. dollars, of which 225 million U.S. dollars were earned from
export.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has 5.3 million Muslims, more than a third of its
population. Since the 1980s, it has sent nearly 4,000 workers and
technicians to Egypt, Yemen, and Kuwait for construction
projects. It has set up a number of companies in the Islamic
countries to promote trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, many Islamic and Arab countries have sent
delegations to Ningxia to conduct scientific, trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government has promised to provide a 14
million dollar low-interest loan for an irrigation project in
Ningxia.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Bronze Drum Discovered in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China has discovered a bronze
drum which was cast in the late Tang Dynasty more than 1,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The drum was discovered in a village of Zhenfeng County in
southwestern China's Guizhou Province. It was being used by Yu
Xuekui, a sorcerer of the Bouyei nationality, and has been handed
down in his family for generations.
</P>
<P>
The rusty drum is 35.5 centimeters tall, with the top diameter
55 centimeters and 57 centimeters at the foot, and decorated with
four groups of designs resembling a frog's legs around the body,
which is somewhat damaged.
</P>
<P>
The bronze drum is an ethnic cultural relic of the minority
nationalities of southern China, and Guizhou is the province
where most of the bronze drums have been discovered. It is
estimated that there are still more than 1,000 bronze drums in
the hands of the common people of the region.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Beat Everton in English Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- One goal from Nicolas Anelka at
the sixth minute gave defending champions Arsenal a 1-0 victory
over Everton in the English Premier League on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Arsenal collected 23 points from 12 matches, two
behind league leaders Aston Villa who have played one match fewer
and who beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Anelka lashed the ball home with a powerful left-foot shot
from the left-hand side of the penalty area. He has scored in
Arsenal's last five league matches.
</P>
<P>
Everton went close to an equaliser several times but the
Gunners, who clinched the championship with a 4-0 win over
Everton at Highbury last season, rarely looked in danger of
dropping any points.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, who were second at the start of play,
slipped back to third after being held to a 0-0 draw by Newcastle
United in an uninspiring match at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, unbeaten in the league since the opening day of the
season, needed a 75th-minute header from Nigerian international
Celestine Babayaro to save them from defeat in the London derby
against West Ham which ended 1-1.
</P>
<P>
The Hammers took the lead through Neil Ruddock after four
minutes. The point could prove costly for Chelsea, who lost
Italian striker Pierluigi Casiraghi with what appeared to be a
serious knee injury in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Play was suspended for five minutes while Casiraghi was
treated before being carried off on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's other match saw Leeds United beat Sheffield Wednesday
2-1.
</P>
<P>
The schedule was split this weekend as Arsenal, Manchester
United, Leeds United and Chelsea were all involved in European
action.
</P>
<P>
The six other matches on Saturday produced wins for Aston
Villa, who stayed top of the table after their victory over
Spurs; Coventry, who won 2-1 at Blackburn to climb out of the
bottom three; Derby, who won 2-1 at Liverpool for their first
success at Anfield since 1970, and Wimbledon, whose 1-0 win at
Nottingham Forest left Forest in 19th spot.
</P>
<P>
The only team below them are Southampton, who drew 3-3 with a
Middlesbrough team that ended the match with nine men after
having Robbie Mustoe and Phil Stamp sent off in the second half.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Highest Legislative Body Holds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's highest legislative
body, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), will hold a
special session here on Tuesday to discuss important political
events that faces the country.
</P>
<P>
The four-day session, From November 10 to 13, is expected to
adopt a timetable for the implementation of general elections next
May and a general MPR session to elect a president and vice
president in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
The MPR usually meets once every five years to elect a
president and vice president. It last convened in March this year
when former president Soeharto was elected for a seventh five-year
term. Soeharto resigned on May 21 amid a savage economic decline,
mass protests against his rule and rioting in Jakarta and other
cities that killed over 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree produced at the MPR sessions held in March,
the general election will be held in 2002, and if the election is
to be held earlier, an MPR special session must be held to issue a
decree on the matter.
</P>
<P>
According to Speaker of the MPR Harmoko, the MPR working
committee has produced 12 draft decrees and draft decisions to be
taken up at the session.
</P>
<P>
One of the draft decree, supported by all five factions in the
MPR, will impose a limitation on the presidential and vice
presidential terms of office to only two five-year terms of
office. The draft decree was proposed to avoid misinterpretations
of the 1945 Constitution's Article 7 on the subject and to boost
democratization.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution's Article 7 only states that the country's
president could be "elected again" after his or her first term,
without citing how many times. And Soeharto has abused the article
by maintaining his post for seven consecutive five-year periods.
</P>
<P>
Draft decree to lift the March 1998 decree on the granting of
an extraordinary power to president has also won the support of
all factions in the MPR. It was reported that the ruling Golkar
(Functional Group) contrived to give birth to the decree in order
to provide Soeharto with extraordinary power so he could crush all
movements against his regime.
</P>
<P>
All of the five factions also agreed on the draft decree on
separation of MPR leadership from the House of Representatives
(DPR) which is aimed at empowering both houses.
</P>
<P>
"The current single leadership of the two state institutions
has in fact been manipulated by the (Soeharto's) New Order regime
to turn the bodies into mere rubber stamps," legislator Poedjono
said, adding that the proposed decree would prevent such a
situation in the future.
</P>
<P>
However, the factions were still divided on many issues related
to the general elections next year, and on whether the Assembly
should issue a decree to warrant investigation into corrupt and
nepotistic practices during Soeharto's 32-year administration.
</P>
<P>
Students and political figures had insisted that MPR should
take action against Soeharto for "political and economic crimes",
as well as human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
And the biggest question is whether there will be a showdown
between those who support it and those against it.
</P>
<P>
Those in favor say that only with the session, which will
revoke an earlier decree on elections, will the country be able to
hold a fair and democratic general election. Armed Forces
Commander General Wiranto has described it as the only gate toward
democratization.
</P>
<P>
Those against, however, see it as a ploy designed to give
President B.J. Habibie more time to strengthen his position. Some
groups have even spoken about forcing Habibie to step down before
the session commences.
</P>
<P>
It was following expression of these conflicting opinions that
rumors spread of impending clashes between protests and
counter-protests during the special session.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the session of the 1,000-strong legislature, over
25,000 military personnel bolstered by 125,000 civilian recruits
have been deployed in the capital. A total of 4,500 troops are
stationed within and around the MPR compound.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen warships have been made ready along with six aircraft
and helicopters, two police patrol boats, and another two patrol
boats from the coast and sea guard units, in anticipation of
eventualities in connection with the session.
</P>
<P>
ABRI Commander General Wiranto made it clear that if there is
any group intending to disturb the meeting they would be acting
against the constitution and the law, and for that reason ABRI
will take stern action against them.
</P>
<P>
The president has repeatedly called on the country to help
ensure the success of the special MPR session, which he described
as a very important milestone in Indonesia's journey through the
past 53 years.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with regional police chiefs and military commanders
across country on October 31, Habibie asked them to be patient in
facing mounting demonstrations. In the run-up to the political
events, the political temperature normally tends to rise, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some newspapers are hoping that the special session will run
smoothly, peacefully, orderly and turn out results as expected.
</P>
<P>
"It would be in our national interest to give the forthcoming
session of the MPR our full support so that it can proceed with
its work, putting everything in place for the elections scheduled
in May next year," the Indonesian Observer said.

<HEADLINE> "Fishing Break" Brings Bigger Catch to Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A new practice called "fishing
break" has increased the catch by a wide margin for local
fishermen in parts of east China's Fujian Province this year.
</P>
<P>
Some of the local fishermen were unhappy when the provincial
authorities first put a ban on fishing this summer, effective from
June 15 to September 15, but smiles returned when local trawlers
caught many more fish than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
The fishing break protects fish resources and increases aquatic
production, Xinhua was told by both local government officials and
the fishermen themselves.
</P>
<P>
In Ningde Prefecture alone, the September catch reached 45,500
tons, up 54 percent over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
In some parts of the province, where this practice has not been
adopted, fishermen have asked the local government to start a
fishing break for them next year.

<HEADLINE> Evidence of Antioxidants Effectiveness Still Pending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 8 (Xinhua) -- There is not enough
scientific evidence so far for antioxidant therapy, according to
an American doctor of medicine.
</P>
<P>
Two ongoing trials may provide a definitive answer to the
debate about whether antioxidants supplementation is effective as
primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD),
said John Keaney, Jr., associate professor at Boston University's
School of Medicine, at the ongoing 71st annual American Heart
Association Scientific Sessions in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
One of the trials he mentioned is the women's health study of
primary and secondary prevention of CHD, including 40,000 healthy
U.S. female nurses.
</P>
<P>
"Until these studies are completed, there is no solid evidence
that antioxidants will or will not prolong life," said Keaney,
whose presentation is posted at the annual session's Web site.
</P>
<P>
Although the link between elevated total cholesterol and
atherosclerosis is well-established, he said, the medical
community still does not know precisely how cholesterol leads to
heart attacks and stroke.
</P>
<P>
However, doctors do know that LDL cholesterol particles cannot
cause atherosclerosis unless they are oxidized. This knowledge has
stimulated interest in the role of antioxidants in preventing
heart disease, Keaney said.
</P>
<P>
The interest is probably even greater in the United States,
where cardiovascular disease remains a major clinical problem.
Statistics from 1990 estimate that 55 out of every 100,000
Americans will die of coronary artery disease each year. The
economic cost of cardiovascular disease exceed 225 billion U.S.
dollars annually in the United States.
</P>
<P>
There is currently a wealth of epidemiological data examining
the interaction between antioxidant intake or antioxidant status
and the development of vascular disease. The data consist of a
collection of descriptive studies, case-controlled studies,
prospective cohort studies and a limited number of randomized
data. But Keaney said the distinction between study types is
important because only randomized, controlled studies should be
used to make public health recommendations.
</P>
<P>
He made a point by citing descriptive studies, which examine
the characteristics of a population and its associated disease
rates, and compare the data sets from one time period or country
to the next. In general, descriptive studies suffer from the
inability to control for potential confounding factors.
</P>
<P>
A total of five descriptive studies published since 1975 have
shown an inverse association between fresh fruit and vegetable
consumption and cardiovascular disease rates or, in some cases,
between certain vitamins (i.e., vitamin C, vitamin A) and
cardiovascular disease mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
Keaney said that the strongest theme from these studies is an
observed trend across populations, and within populations over
time, that fresh fruit and vegetable consumption protects against
cardiovascular disease. But whether this is due to the intake of
dietary antioxidants or the replacement by fresh fruits and
vegetable of potentially harmful dietary components such as animal
fats cannot be determined.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tries to Resolve Iraqi Crisis by Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
decided Sunday to hold off using force to oblige Iraq to open its
weapons sites to U.N. inspectors and directed senior security
advisers to continue pursuing a diplomatic settlement.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen, National Security Council
advisor Sandy Berger and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
with Clinton for about two hours Sunday at the Camp David
presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked them to give more thought to how the United
States could use force to make Baghdad comply with U.N. Security
Council demands and at the same time to the consequences of
bombing Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reviewed the diplomatic and military options with them
and "asked for a follow-up on both fronts," said David Leavy,
spokesman at the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"They will report to him over the next several days," Leavy
said. "The president has made no decision."
</P>
<P>
Leavy and other administration officials described the
situation as "very serious."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported Sunday that the administration has
concluded the U.N. inspection regime is no longer an effective
instrument for restraining Iraq. The report quoted unidentified
senior administration officials.
</P>
<P>
But Leavy said, "This whole situation is predicated on getting
UNSCOM (the U.N. special commission) back on schedule."
</P>
<P>
"We are not walking away from UNSCOM.... In fact, we are
pulling for cooperation," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 31, President Saddam Hussein declared an end to Iraq's
cooperation with the U.N. special commission that conducts
searches for chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said it will not cooperate with inspectors unless the
Security Council moves to end trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the council again condemned Iraq, but the 15
nations remained divided over whether to authorize military
strikes.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Plan to Clone Human Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- British researchers behind the
cloning of Dolly the sheep, the world's first cloned vertebrate,
are in talks to develop ways of cloning human cells for transplant
organs, the BBC reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists, including researchers from the Roslin Institute in
Scotland where Dolly was created, are planning to collaborate with
their American counterparts on a revolutionary "body repair kit."
</P>
<P>
"We are in discussion and we are exploring a number of
possibilities," Dr Harry Griffin, assistant director of science at
the Roslin Institute, told BBC News Online.
</P>
<P>
A team of U.S. scientists reported in the Science journal last
Friday that they have engineered human embryonic stem cells,
parent cells of all tissues in the body.
</P>
<P>
These undeveloped "parents" of all human tissues have the
potential to become any component of the body and would eliminate
the risk of rejection currently suffered by patients receiving
donor transplants.
</P>
<P>
The Roslin Institute's expertise in cloning, using a technique
called nuclear transfer, could be applied to "stem cell" research.
Cloned cells would provide a limitless supply for a transplant
patient and therefore avoid the need to give anti-rejection drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Our particular contribution might allow those cells to be
derived from the patient, thereby avoiding any immunological
problems, for example of rejection of the human cells by a patient
that recognizes those cells as foreign," Dr Griffin said.

<HEADLINE> Earth to Be Hit by Solar Storm in 2000: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have warned that
solar storms, which will reach a peak early in 2000, may disable
many of the 500 satellites that orbit the Earth, a British
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We now have hundreds of billions of dollars of equipment
orbiting over our heads, and they will all be at risk in the first
few weeks of the millennium," Nick Flowers, of Britain's Mullard
Space Laboratory, was quoted by the Observer newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The electromagnetic space storms may also wipe out telephone
lines and television signals, cripple aircraft navigation systems
and leave cities without power supplies, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said last week that the sun is heading into the
most violent part of its 11-year cycle of activity, known as the
solar maximum, which will peak in about 18 months' time.
</P>
<P>
There are 250 communications satellites in special high orbit
over Earth. Hovering 23,000 miles (37,000 kilometers) above the
ground, they are particularly vulnerable to solar storms.
</P>
<P>
However, scientists warned that the greatest danger is likely
to be posed by a breakdown in the U.S. Global Positioning System.
This fleet of satellites provides navigation and guidance for
aircraft across the world.
</P>
<P>
"A failure of this system could have very serious consequences.
Even if it was only a temporary breakdown, it won't cause aircraft
to crash, but it could bring havoc to traffic control," said
Flowers.

<HEADLINE> New Computer System Identifies Plagiarism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- British researchers have created
a computer program that can find whether students copy essays from
the Internet or classmates, The Sunday Telegraph newspaper said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The system, developed by the Forensic Linguistics Research
Group in Birmingham University's English department, can pick out
similarities in the use of vocabulary, phraseology and sentence
structure.
</P>
<P>
Inaccurate quotes, mistakes with punctuation and other errors
made by a student while tinkering with a copied text can also be
highlighted.
</P>
<P>
The system, focusing on the nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs, known as the lexical vocabulary in an essay, can compare
hundreds of essays and highlight any suspect ones automatically.
</P>
<P>
Normally, each student will use a variety of such words and a
comparison of an essay with that of a rival will reveal that only
40 percent or fewer are common to both pieces.
</P>
<P>
But when a student has copied from someone else, the proportion
of common words is likely to increase to 80 percent or above,
researchers said.
