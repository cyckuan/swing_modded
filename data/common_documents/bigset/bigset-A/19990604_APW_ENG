<HEADLINE> Estate Sale for Centenarian Sisters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT VERNON, N.Y. (AP) -- Lots of old ladies leave teacups  
behind. Sarah and Bessie Delany left about 200. 
</P>
<P>
	The centenarian sisters, who became famous for their  
best-selling memoir ``Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 
Years,'' also left behind dentist tools, homemade soap, and a corn 
liquor still. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday it all went on sale, four months after Sarah's death  
at 109, and four years after Bessie's at 106. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a wonderful way to leave, sharing your legacy with people  
who admired you,'' said Pamela McIver of Yonkers, who had read the 
sisters' 1993 memoir. 
</P>
<P>
	The book is a colorful account of the sisters' upbringing in the  
South as the daughters of a freed slave, and their later lives as 
trailblazers for black professional women. The publication won them 
many fans, some of whom showed up at the auction for a bit of 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miss Sadie,'' as Sarah was known, was New York's first black  
home economics teacher. ``Dr. Bessie'' was the state's second black 
female dentist. They lived their entire lives together, the last 38 
years in Mount Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
	McIver was among 100 or so people who had arrived at the estate  
Friday morning hoping to find a memento. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost a feeling of sacredness to share the experience,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many antique dealers arrived early and rushed from room to room  
seemingly unaware of the Delany history. 
</P>
<P>
	One dealer quickly claimed a $1,500 Harvard Dental Chest Bessie  
had used for her picks and mirrors. He left behind the $125 sign 
that said, ``Dr. Bessie Delany, Dentist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The still, which was used to make corn liquor, went for $35.  
Sarah's bed, an antique, went for $1,500; Bessie's for $75. 
</P>
<P>
	Some treasures had been winnowed out, including the sisters'  
diplomas, the investiture papers of their father, who was America's 
first elected black Episcopal bishop, a book inscribed to the 
Delanys by author James Weldon Johnson, whose books include 
``Autobiography of an Ex-coloured Man,'' family photos, letters, 
awards and travel diaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Those items will go to the Schomburg Center for Research in  
Black Culture in Harlem or to St. Augustine's College in Raleigh, 
N.C., where their father was a vice principal and where they grew 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	The house itself was left to two nephews and sold for just under  
$300,000; they also will get the $10,000 or so expected from this 
weekend's tag sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernadette Carey Smith, whose family was close to the Delanys  
and who was working at the tag sale, called the sale extremely 
emotional. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad but in a way good because there was no way anybody  
could keep all this stuff and it forced us to go through it and 
find what really should be saved,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Alaskan Homes Evacuated in Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOMER, Alaska (AP) -- More than 50 people were evacuated from  
their homes Friday as an out-of-control wildfire threatened to 
consume the structures. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was burning among beetle-killed spruce trees east of  
Homer and destroyed one mobile home by Friday evening, according to 
Homer fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported, said Elaine Grabowski, the fire  
department's service coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Homer High School was opened as a shelter for people evacuated  
from the homes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flames are shooting up -- we can see them way over here,'' said  
Colleen Leavitt, a clerk at a resort located about 10 miles from 
the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters were dispatched from Soldotna and Anchorage, along  
with a plane from Palmer to drop fire retardant, said Bob Painter, 
Homer's assistant fire chief, 
</P>
<P>
	The wildfire started when a resident burning a brush pile lost  
control of his fire in high winds, Painter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Homer area has been ravaged in recent years by the  
spruce-bark beetle. Large swathes of land are covered with dead, 
dry spruce trees that are an ideal fuel source for a wildland fire.

<HEADLINE> School-Shooting Students Gather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- Several survivors of the Colorado school  
massacre met with and consoled victims of shootings at a Georgia 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took us a month to get over this,'' Columbine High School  
student Barbara Schneider said Thursday. ``We are just hoping to 
speed things up for the Heritage kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people died at Columbine during the April 20 shooting  
spree. Exactly one month later, a gunman opened fire and wounded 
six students at Heritage High in Conyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps a lot to know they care. They've been there,''  
Heritage sophomore Zach Moore said about meeting the five students 
from Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado students came up with the idea, contacted school  
officials and learned of Thursday's picnic for Heritage students at 
Smyrna Presbyterian Church, about a mile from the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Smyrna organizers housed them and paid for meals. Delta Air  
Lines provided transportation for the students, who were 
accompanied by two Columbine parents and a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 students attended the cookout. They played volleyball,  
tennis and Frisbee -- and talked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are miles and miles apart, but we have so much in common  
now,'' said Columbine senior Michael Staver. ``We're just trying to 
get on with our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The students discussed how the shootings affected them, how they  
are coping and what can be done to prevent school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reaching out to each other is one of the most important things  
we can do in our schools,'' said Columbine's Christine Bell. ``We 
need to unite schools in this nation and make sure people don't 
feel outcast to the point where they make this kind of tragedy 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heritage freshman Jaime Taylor, who is friends with two of the  
shooting victims, said she and her classmates will never be the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having the summer off will help give everybody a chance to get  
over it,'' she said. ``But it is always going to be in the back of 
our minds.''

<HEADLINE> Narhi Wins NCAA Javelin Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Washington State's Bernard Lagat showed he's  
ready for his showdown against Arkansas' Seneca Lassiter in the 
1,500 meters at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The irrepressible Lagat held off Stanford's Brad Hauser to win  
the 5,000 Friday night at 14 minutes, 1.09 seconds, smashing the 
Bronco Stadium record at Boise State by more than 12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagat, the first Washington State 5,000 champion since 1984 and  
the NCAA indoor mile winner, will face Lassiter, the two-time 
defending champion in the 1,500 on Saturday's final program. 
</P>
<P>
	Hauser's second-place finish, along with a fifth by his brother  
Brent and and an eighth by Jason Balkman, accounted for 13 points 
and gave Stanford the men's team lead with 45 points after 10 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford, seeking its fourth title but its first since 1934,  
leads seven-time defending champion Arkansas and SMU by 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's team title race became a three-way battle among  
defending champion Texas, UCLA and Southern California. After 11 
events, the Longhorns had 31 points, and UCLA and Southern Cal had 
28 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, South Carolina's Terrence Trammell electrified the  
crowd of 7,124 with his brilliant speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Trammell ran the second leg of the Gamecocks' 400-meter relay  
that won its first title in the event in the meet's 78-year 
history. South Carolina was timed at 38.92, .01 off the stadium 
record, in beating Southern Cal by three meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Trammell, a sophomore, also had the fastest time in the  
semifinals of the 110 hurdles, 13.54, and advanced to Saturday's 
final in the 100, clocking 10.08 in his semifinal heat, behind the 
10.05 of Florida freshman John Capel. 
</P>
<P>
	Capel also won his 200 semifinal heat at a wind-aided 20.37.  
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's Coby Miller, Capel's big rival from the Southeastern  
Conference, won the other 200 semifinal at 20.37 and was second in 
his 100 semifinal at 10.12, behind defending champion Leonard 
Myles-Mills of BYU (10.08). 
</P>
<P>
	In other men's finals, Baylor's Bayano Kamani won the 400  
hurdles with a stadium record and 1999 collegiate and career-best 
48.68; indoor champion Derrick Peterson of Missouri took the 800 at 
1:46.97; indoor champion Jacob Davis of Texas won the pole vault at 
18-2 3/4, and UTEP's Matti Narhi took the javelin at 261-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas earned the women's lead with the help of a second  
consecutive victory in the 400 relay and second-place finishes by 
Tonja Jarrett in the 400 hurdles and Liz Diaz in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
	In the relay, freshman LaKeesha White put the Longhorns ahead  
with a strong third leg and LaKeisha Backus brought them home at 
42.95, a stadium record. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory set the tone for the Longhorns.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're the type of team where one event does well, the rest of  
them catch on fire,'' leadoff runner Kim McGruder said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 400 hurdles, UCLA's Joanna Hayes set a stadium record and  
ran the fastest time by a collegian this season in beating Jarrett, 
55.16 to 55.80. 
</P>
<P>
	It was vindication for Hayes, who couldn't compete in the 400  
hurdles last year because of a strained right hamstring. She 
hyperextended her right knee in winning her heat in 1997 and 
finished seventh in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes also qualified for Saturday's final in the 110 hurdles.  
</P>
<P>
	LSU's Claudine Williams took the lead with about 250 meters  
remaining in the 800 and held off Diaz's late charge to win by .06 
at 2:03.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Other women's winners included Baylor's Stacy Bowers in the  
triple jump at 45-1, Villanova's Carrie Tollefson in 3,000 at 
9:26.51 and Georgia's Vigdia Gudjonadotti in the javelin at 182-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia's Debbie Ferguson, the defending champion in the women's  
100 and 200, advanced to Saturday's finals in both events. So did 
Texas' Nanceen Perry, LSU's Peta-Gaye Dowdie, Southern Cal's Terri 
Edwards and Ball State's Latasha Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Backus, counted upon to score for Texas in both  
sprints, failed to reach the final in either event. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's Donica Merriman registered the season's fastest  
time by a collegian in the 100 hurdles, winning her semifinal heat 
at 12.84. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first four events of the heptathlon, favored Tracye  
Lawyer of Stanford led with 3,721 points. The final three events -- 
long jump, javelin and 800 -- will be contested Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Polygamist Convicted of Incest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A member of a polygamist clan has been  
convicted of incest and unlawful sex with his 16-year-old niece in 
a case activists say signals an end to Utah's generally tolerant 
attitude toward plural marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	David Ortell Kingston was convicted Thursday in a trial that  
brought renewed attention to polygamy in Utah, where an estimated 
20,000 to 30,000 polygamists reside. 
</P>
<P>
	The conviction ``gives girls trapped in polygamy the hope that  
they can escape,'' said Laura Chapman, a founder of Tapestry of 
Polygamy, which opposes the practice. ``This says there is hope in 
the state of Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The secretive Kingston clan has as many as 1,000 members and  
business assets worth up to $150 million. While the clan shares 
many of the beliefs of other polygamous groups in Utah, it stands 
apart in practicing incest, former members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingston, an accountant, faces up to five years in prison for  
each felony. 
</P>
<P>
	At trial, the girl, now 17, said that Kingston, 33, called her  
in October 1997 and suggested they marry. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her father performed the ceremony attended by  
Kingston's other wives. Her uncle later gave her a ring with 15 
diamonds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ceremony, they had four sexual encounters, all in  
1998, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now in foster care, testified she continued to live at  
home and repeatedly tried to avoid her husband-uncle when she knew 
he was planning to visit. Defense lawyers said the wedding and sex 
never occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingston was not charged with polygamy, and there was limited  
discussion of the topic during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of Utah's population are members of The Church  
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which renounced polygamy in 
1890 after Congress passed tough anti-bigamy laws. Large-scale 
prosecution of polygamists has not taken place in Utah for more 
than four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Brass, a Salt Lake City criminal defense attorney not  
affiliated with the case, doubted it was a bellwether. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen polygamy wax and wane as an issue here,'' he said.  
``I don't think legally it will be significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Tapestry attorney Douglas White said Kingston's conviction  
shows Utah ``is not a polygamy-free zone anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a single prosecutor in the state who is not  
watching what's been done here,'' White said.

<HEADLINE> Claiming Races to Edge of Greatness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The filly was the talk of horse racing. The colt  
wasn't even a murmur in February. 
</P>
<P>
	But now it's Charismatic, the colt who twice ran in claiming  
races, who can become the first Triple Crown champion in 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, however, remains a very interesting  
conversation piece. She takes on the role of spoiler when she makes 
her debut against colts in the 1 1/2-mile classic on Saturday in the 
Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	It might not end up as a two-horse race, but going in it's a  
two-horse story. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unique,'' said Bob Baffert, Silverbulletday's trainer.  
``It's like a heavyweight title match. You've got the 3-year-old 
filly against the 3-year-old colt who won the two big races this 
spring. It's for serious bragging rights. ... This should be on 
pay-per-view, and I want a piece of the action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday was the third early favorite at 4-1.  
Charismatic, 31-1 in the Derby and 8-1 in the Preakness, was 2-1. 
Menifee, runner-up in the Derby and Preakness was 7-2. Menifee is 
trained by Elliott Walden, trainer of Victory Gallop, who foiled 
Real Quiet's Triple Crown bid by a nose in the 1998 Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday was the champion 2-year-old filly last year when  
she won six of seven starts, including the Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
Fillies. This year she is unbeaten in five starts. Eleven of the 12 
starts have been in stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, on the other hand, twice ran in claiming races --  
the first time as a 2-year-old. Much has been made of his second 
claiming start, for a $62,500 price, because it was only four 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Zito, trainer of Belmont starters Adonis and Stephen Got  
Even, put that Feb. 11 race at Santa Anita in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always get a great line from the $2 bettors, who are the  
heart and sole of racing,'' Zito said. ``I was leaving the track 
one day and I heard a bettor say, `Charismatic was never a claimer, 
Wayne just ran him in a claiming race.' I think that's the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, bought for $200,000 as a weanling by Bob and  
Beverly Lewis, was put in the claiming race by Lukas in an effort 
to boost the strapping chestnut colt's confidence. Luckily, no one 
claimed him, but Bob Lewis said he would not have minded if someone 
had because the colt didn't appear to be worth the investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises own Silver Charm, who failed to become the first  
Triple Crown champion since Affirmed in 1978 by finishing second in 
the 1997 Belmont. Silverbulletday is owned by Mike Pegram, owner of 
Real Quiet. Both colts are trained by Baffert. 
</P>
<P>
	The claiming race turned out to be Charismatic's second win in  
nine starts when the first-place finisher was disqualified, The 
colt then finished second in his next two starts, then fourth in 
the April 3 Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas then decided the colt that Bob Lewis calls a chow hound  
needed to be kept busy because he holds his weight. So in the next 
six weeks, Charismatic won the Lexington at Keeneland, the Kentucky 
Derby and Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic had to beat 18 other 3-year-olds in the Derby and 13  
in the Preakness. Saturday's 12-horse field will be the second 
biggest of the 26 horses that had a chance to win the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest was 13 when Canonero II finished fourth in 1971. The  
biggest field for any of the 11 successful Triple Crown bids was 
eight when Seattle Slew won in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``One reason I think a lot of people are going at him is they  
think he's got to throw in a bad one,'' Baffert said. `People are 
thinking maybe he'll go backward. He's run hard. If anything, the 
son of a gun is going forward. That's what makes him such an 
incredible horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A victory by Charismatic at Belmont Park would be worth $600,000  
from the $1 million purse and a Visa-sponsored $5 million bonus for 
sweeping the three races. That would boost Lukas' career earnings 
to more than $200 million and probably clinch Horse of the Year for 
the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	A win by Silverbulletday certainly would put her in the lead for  
Horse of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said he thinks Silverbulletday has kept fresh this year  
because she won her races easily, and that should benefit her in 
the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand, she has not been pressured,'' he said.  
``That's the gray area as far as Silverbulletday is concerned. When 
she makes that move it's not going to be a 3-year-old filly who 
will run 30 yards with her, but four or five colts who will grab 
her by the throat. She will have to pass the test. If she does, 
Bob, Beverly, Chris (Antley, the jockey) and I will shake their 
hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The field in post-position order: Teletable, John Velasquez;  
Vision and Verse, Herbert Castillo Jr.; Silverbulletday, Jerry 
Bailey; Charismatic, Chris Antley; Pineaff, Sidney LeJeune Jr.; 
Lemon Drop Kid, Jose Santos; Patience Game, Kent Desormeaux; 
Adonis, Jorge Chavez; Prime Directive, Mike Smith; Menifee, Pat 
Day; Stephen Got Even, Shane Sellers; and Best of Luck, Jean-Luc 
Samyn.

<HEADLINE> Figga Sees Opportunity With Orioles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mike Figga has absolutely no reservations about  
leaving the defending World Series champions to join the last-place 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the Figga, claimed on waivers Thursday from the  
New York Yankees, finally has a shot at getting some playing time 
as the backup to catcher Charles Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Figga was with the Yankees from the start of the season but made  
only two appearances, both on defense, while playing behind Joe 
Girardi and Jorge Posada. He was designated for assignment May 25 
after New York called up former Orioles outfielder Tony Tarasco 
from the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing. I hope I get a chance to prove I can play  
at this level,'' Figga said Friday before the Orioles faced the 
Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``In New York, I didn't have a chance. It was a bad situation,  
playing behind Joe and Jorgie,'' Figga said. ``I understood why, 
but it was tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figga was out of options, so the Yankees risked losing him by  
designating him for assignment last week. He went home to Tampa and 
worked out at the Yankees' training complex until the Orioles 
claimed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Figga, 28, will be the backup to Johnson until Lenny Webster  
comes off the disabled list. Webster has a strained tendon in his 
right ankle and still has difficulty moving to his right, Orioles 
manager Ray Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Figga, the 15th new player to appear on the Baltimore roster  
since opening day, will wear No. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't care if was 99. I'm just happy to have a number on  
my back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Figga, the Orioles optioned catcher Tommy Davis  
to Triple-A Rochester.

<HEADLINE>  Astronauts Get Ready for Trip Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Discovery's astronauts shifted their  
attention Friday to the trip home after spending nearly a week 
getting the international space station ready for its first 
permanent occupants next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The space shuttle is due back on Earth around 2 a.m. Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Discovery unlatched itself from the international space station  
Thursday evening after six days of linked flight. The seven 
astronauts unloaded 2 tons of gear, made electronic repairs and 
installed mufflers to reduce noise from clattering fans. 
</P>
<P>

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Discovery's astronauts shifted their  
attention Friday to the trip home after spending nearly a week 
getting the international space station ready for its first 
permanent occupants next year.

<P>
	The space shuttle is due back on Earth around 2 a.m. Sunday.  
</P>

	Discovery unlatched itself from the international space station  
Thursday evening after six days of linked flight. The seven

<HEADLINE> Coroner IDs Philip Kramer's Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles County coroner has  
identified remains found in a ravine as those of former Iron 
Butterfly bass player Philip ``Taylor'' Kramer, who disappeared 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The skeletal remains were positively identified Thursday using  
dental records, said Scott Carrier, a spokesman with the coroner's 
office. The cause of death had not yet been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Hikers found the remains last Saturday inside a wrecked van in  
the bottom of a ravine. The van matched the description of the 
vehicle Kramer was driving when he disappeared on Feb. 12, 1995, 
while driving to the airport to pick up a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer was 42 when he disappeared.  
</P>
<P>
	The musician joined Iron Butterfly in 1975 during an attempt to  
revive the group, which had several incarnations with various band 
members. The band's most famous song was the 17-minute 
``In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida'' in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer later worked in the aerospace industry and at the time of  
his disappearance, was chief technology officer at Total 
Multimedia.

<HEADLINE> Junior Brathwaite Shot and Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Junior Braithwaite, one of the three  
surviving members of Bob Marley's legendary Wailers reggae group, 
was shot and killed in a Kingston home, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the second Wailer to die in this manner. Peter Tosh was  
shot and killed at his Kingston home in 1987. Marley died of cancer 
in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Braithwaite, 47, was one of two men slain Wednesday night by  
unidentified gunmen in the home of a local musician. Police are 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The musician recently returned to his Caribbean homeland from  
Chicago, where he had lived for more than 20 years. He had been 
attempting to revive the singing career that he gave up when he 
left the Wailers in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Marley, Tosh, Bunny Wailer and Beverly Kelso,  
Braithwaite formed the original Wailers in Kingston in the early 
1960s. He sang on the group's 1965 breakthrough hit ``It Hurts To 
Be Alone.''

<HEADLINE> House Members To Boost Office Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative lawmakers trying to force  
spending cuts may have found a new target: bipartisan legislation 
that would boost spending for House members' own offices by 7.3 
percent for the upcoming election year. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase is included in a $1.92 billion bill financing  
Congress' operations next year that may be considered by the full 
House as early as next week. The total excludes Senate expenses, 
which that chamber adds later. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the overall bill is 6 percent below this year's $2.05  
billion measure, it would increase House members' allowances for 
staff salaries, taxpayer-paid mail to voters and district office 
rents. It would also boost spending for leadership offices and most 
committees and pay for renovations of a fountain, a cafeteria and 
other Capitol Hill facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll work to try to change it,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn,  
R-Okla., who last month was among conservatives who blocked passage 
of an agriculture bill they said was too costly. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra dollars for members' offices come even as Republicans  
plan other bills slicing education, aid to veterans and other 
popular domestic programs in the coming year. That juxtaposition 
has drawn fire from conservative and liberal congressional 
watchdogs alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be good if the House leadership would ... show some  
leadership and eliminate waste from their own budgets,'' said Gary 
Ruskin, director of the Congressional Accountability Project, which 
is affiliated with consumer advocate Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
	If conservatives do try to amend the bill, they could give House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., his newest headache in a year when 
Republicans' thin majority has made it tough to move legislation 
through the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	But conservatives face a tough task cracking the broad  
bipartisan support the annual bill financing Congress' own 
operations traditionally draws. Most incumbents of both parties, 
eager for the electoral advantages the measure would provide, are 
likely to support the bill, said GOP and Democratic aides, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to cut members' office accounts ``is where it gets very  
personal,'' said Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., another conservative. 
He said lawmakers think, ``'You're talking about my chances of 
getting re-elected.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The cut in the overall bill's price tag from last year is ``the  
important factor here,'' said Michele Davis, spokeswoman for House 
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But conservatives say that comparison is phony. They say when  
one-time emergency spending for 1999 for Capitol security and other 
items is subtracted, next year's bill would be nearly $100 million, 
or 5 percent, higher than this year's. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff director James Dyer of the House Appropriations Committee,  
which produced the bill, said he has detected little support for 
cutting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If members want to go out on the floor and say, 'Cut me, cut  
me,' OK, we have provisions to allow that to happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyer said the extra money would help legislators' ``desperate  
scramble here to keep people with a corporate memory'' by allowing 
for pay raises. And he said construction projects were included 
because lawmakers have ``a custodial responsibility for this 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the account most directly affecting lawmakers, the bill would  
increase House members' office accounts from $385.3 million this 
year to $413.6 million next year. The accounts, based largely on 
the number of each district's postal customers, cover staff 
salaries, official office travel and other expenses, but not 
members' salaries, which seem likely to remain at $136,673 each. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to providing a 7.3 percent increase in office  
accounts, the measure would complete an important change that the 
House Administration Committee made last year in House rules 
governing taxpayer-funded mail to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Effective this year, House members can use as much of their  
accounts as they please for mail to constituents. Until now, only a 
small, specified portion could be used for mail, based mainly on 
the number of postal customers per district. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the bill assumes a $17 million increase -- to $29  
million -- for members to respond to letters and send mass mailings 
to constituents. Mail costs traditionally grow in election years. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also provides:  
</P>
<P>
	--$14.2 million for House leaders' offices, up from $13.1 million  
this year. Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, would get $380,000 
more, a 36 percent increase in his budget, and Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo., $396,000 more, a 24 percent boost. 
</P>
<P>
	--3 percent more for House committees, to $91.6 million. The  
House Appropriations Committee budget would grow 10 percent, which 
spokeswoman Elizabeth Morra attributed to pay raises and new 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	--$153,000 to improve the Bartholdi park and fountain at the foot  
of Capitol Hill, $3.4 million to renovate the Rayburn House office 
building cafeteria and $115,000 to renovate House Judiciary 
Committee rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 7 percent raise, to $135,200, for new Congressional Budget  
Office Director Dan Crippen.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Unhappy With Leaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- New San Diego Chargers coach Mike Riley is  
already unhappy with Ryan Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley tried to be diplomatic about Leaf missing a second day of  
the Chargers' voluntary workout yesterday. While not mandatory, the 
Chargers made it clear that Leaf should be here, what with his 
horrendous play as a rookie and because Riley continues to put in 
his new offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf's absence ``is a story because of everything that's gone on  
in the past,'' Riley said. ``It's not a story when some other guys 
have done the same thing all around the country, but this is 
special because of the history, for sure. I can tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf's brief NFL career was marked by his 39.0 passer rating,  
lowest in the league, and 15 interceptions compared to just two 
touchdown passes. He screamed at a reporter in the locker room, and 
reportedly acted boorishly on a visit to his college campus during 
the Chargers' bye weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said Leaf told him several weeks ago that he would have a  
conflict due to a charity event, but the coach was under the 
impression it would be for just one day. Riley doesn't expect Leaf 
here until Monday, meaning he will have missed three days of what 
the Chargers call ``summer school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his round Thursday in the NFL Golf Classic in New Jersey,  
Leaf was asked if he had spoken with Riley about his absence, but 
he basically evaded the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we had practice yesterday and today and tomorrow and  
we had the schedule for about a month or so,'' Leaf said. ``But we 
have a summer school next week, too, and I'll be back for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of heading back to San Diego, Leaf said he's going to a  
children's telethon in Orlando, Fla., this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaching staff can fill in Leaf on what he missed on the  
field, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more concerned, however, with how this is going to affect  
what his teammates think of him,'' the coach said. ``That's 
appeared to be the biggest deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he's heard more than one player say, ``Where's  
Ryan?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not really questions, but statements,'' Riley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Leaf's standing inside the locker room took a beating last year  
when some teammates felt he wasn't trying hard enough to win back 
the starting job after he was benched for poor play as well as bad 
behavior off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley noted that while some veterans such as Pro Bowlers Junior  
Seau and Rodney Harrison have been excused from these workouts, 
several others have traveled across the country to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Aaron Taylor didn't want to talk about Leaf's absence  
after Thursday's workout, saying: ``It's too early for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he offered a brief comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``All I will say is that as a football player, I welcome any  
opportunity to get better,'' said Taylor, who played in two 
straight Super Bowls with the Green Bay Packers before signing with 
the Chargers. ``You can always get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although these workouts are not mandatory, Leaf needs to realize  
the expectations placed on him, said newcomer Jim Harbaugh, who's 
considered the starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do you do the things that you are asked to do, but  
you've got to ask more of yourself,'' Harbaugh said. ``So he's got 
to continue to set that bar of expectation for himself very high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bobby Beathard called Leaf's absence ``very  
disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd love for him to be here. He needs it as much as anybody.  
We just hope he wants to play football as badly as we want him to 
play football.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Stand by Jaret Wright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Jaret Wright isn't going to the bullpen or  
Buffalo any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians manager Mike Hargrove said Friday the embattled Wright,  
who is 0-3 with a 12.79 ERA over his last four starts, will be 
allowed to work through his pitching problems in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not right now, no,'' Hargrove said when asked if he would  
consider sending Wright down to Triple-A. ``After a lot of 
discussion, we feel that Jaret's best chance to get back to where 
he's an effective major league pitcher is here right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like there is good work being done with Jaret. That  
Jaret is working very hard about the things he needs to do to 
become more consistent. And we feel like his best chance to be that 
and do that is here and not somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who despite his recent struggles is still 4-3, allowed  
seven runs and six hits in 3 1-3 innings in his last outing on 
Wednesday in New York. The start came one day after the 23-year-old 
was summoned to AL president Gene Budig's office to discuss his 
role in two bench-clearing brawls this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright's 7.61 ERA is the second highest of any starter in the  
AL, and if not for the Indians averaging 8.06 runs in each of his 
starts, he wouldn't have a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Hargrove is standing by the right-hander and insists  
Wright isn't in jeopardy of losing his spot in the starting 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason for Jaret to feel like he's on thin ice or  
his future is hanging in the balance,'' Hargrove said. ``Jaret is a 
starter on this ballclub and will continue to be a starter. 
Obviously, we're not going to sit here and let start after start be 
like the last two or three he has had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lack of confidence could be one of Wright's biggest problems  
said Hargrove, who thinks the recent headhunting accusations may 
have affected the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a 23-year-old kid whose got great stuff and is struggling  
to find his command,'' Hargrove said. ``I haven't asked him that 
but I have to believe (his confidence) has probably been dented a 
little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove does have an option if Wright, 8-10 since the All-Star  
break last season, continues to have trouble. He could move long 
reliever Steve Karsay into the rotation and use Wright out of the 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about that a lot,'' Hargrove said. ``But it came  
down to the point that we believe in Jaret Wright, and we believe 
that Jaret is going to pitch better. And we believe that Jaret is 
going to make us win here as a starter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove doesn't want to mess with Karsay (5-1, 2.15 ERA) or his  
bullpen right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we start doing that, we're robbing Peter to pay Paul,''  
Hargrove said.

<HEADLINE> TruServ To Cut 1,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- TruServ Corp. will cut 1,000 corporate jobs, or  
15 percent of its work force, by year's end as the parent of 
several hardware chains reorganizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based company said Friday the restructuring plan  
completes a 20-month effort to merge operations from hardware 
retailers Tru Value, ServiStar and Coast to Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will eliminate corporate staffers through a  
combination of job cuts, early retirement and the closing of two 
support offices in Chicago and suburban Schiller Park, executives 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``TruServ's members -- the store owners -- will now realize the  
full benefits of the merger in terms of organizational efficiency 
and responsiveness, accuracy and reliability of deliveries, 
high-quality merchandise and marketing support,'' said Daniel 
Cotter, TruServ chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the plan, TruServ has already closed six of 25  
distribution centers and a paint manufacturing facility. The 
company also reconfigured two distribution centers, expanded three 
others and opened a new distribution center in Hagerstown, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	TruServ has 10,400 stores and sales of about $4.3 billion. Other  
stores names are Grand Rental Station, Taylor Rental, Home &AMP; Garden 
Showplace and Induserve Supply.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Military leaders from NATO and  
Yugoslavia plan to meet Saturday on the Macedonia-Kosovo border to 
discuss a Serb withdrawal -- the key step before NATO will stop its 
bombing. The Pentagon said that if the Yugoslav authorities 
cooperate, NATO airstrikes could end as soon as Sunday. Allied 
planes hit Serb ground forces, flying 610 sorties in the 24 hours 
ending at midday Friday. NATO said 234 were attack sorties and 74 
were aimed at suppressing Yugoslav air defenses.

jet that crashed in rough weather said today the approach appeared 
fine until they touched down and could not stop on a rain-slickened 
runway. First Officer Michael Origel, who is recovering from a 
broken leg at a hospital, spoke to investigators. Rather than slow 
to a stop Tuesday night, the jet skidded off the runway about 90 
mph, hit a bank of runway lights and crashing into a steel walkway 
just short of the Arkansas River. The plane broke into three 
pieces, killing eight passengers and the pilot.

<HEADLINE> Hoechst Calls Shareholders Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Hoechst AG shareholders will meet July  
15 to vote on the company's proposed merger with France's 
Rhone-Poulenc SA that would create a huge drug and agricultural 
chemical conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting date was announced Friday. The new company will be  
called Avantis. 
</P>
<P>
	With the merger, both companies will divest most of their  
non-core industrial chemicals businesses. In Hoechst's case, these 
will be spun off into a new company called Celanese AG, listed 
separately on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is set for November, and the Aventis life sciences  
group is to be headquartered in Strasbourg, France. 
</P>
<P>
	At the July 15 meeting, shareholders also will be asked to  
approve a shortened fiscal year ending July 31, a necessary step in 
order to distribute a special dividend.

<HEADLINE> Some Teens in Smoking Ads Lose Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Some teen-agers responsible for gritty  
anti-smoking advertisements credited with contributing to a decline 
in Florida youth smoking have lost their jobs in the state 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Students Working Against Tobacco, or SWAT, produced the state's  
``Truth'' campaign, financed by money received from tobacco 
companies in Florida's settlement with the industry. One TV ad 
depicted tobacco executives getting awards for being the biggest 
killer, beating out murder and Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, some of the teens who worked on the project for $6 an hour  
are losing their jobs, victims of a political fight that slashed 
the campaign's budget in half. Critics of the cuts say lawmakers 
were uncomfortable with the in-your-face tenor of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Jared Perez, the creative force behind many of the ads, was one  
of those fired by the state Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, 18, said Thursday he understood the need to cut jobs  
given the budget. But he said those let go were the people most 
adamant about the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``They cut the teens, and the teens are what made this program  
special,'' Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
	National anti-smoking groups agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The kids are the guts of the program,'' said Bill Novelli,  
president of Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids in Washington. ``This 
has the potential to be devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention showed that over the last year, smoking among Florida 
middle school students has dropped 18 percent, 9 percent among high 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of the 31 people at Florida's Tobacco Pilot Program were  
told in the last couple weeks they would be offered jobs elsewhere 
in the health department. 
</P>
<P>
	Adult professionals were also fired, including the press  
secretary and the director. 
</P>
<P>
	The health department and Gov. Jeb Bush requested $61 million  
for the project. Lawmakers earmarked roughly $32 million -- less 
than half what it got last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's spokesman Cory Tilley said Thursday the governor remains  
``totally supportive of the program,'' but that a staff of 20 was 
more than enough.

<HEADLINE> FBI Raids Don King's Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Federal agents raided the offices  
of boxing promoter Don King on Friday as part of an investigation 
into whether the IBF sold rankings and arranged fights for 
kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents entered the offices of Don King Productions with  
empty boxes. A boxing industry source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, told The Associated Press they were looking for records 
involving the International Boxing Federation, Don King Productions 
and Monarch Productions, a company run by King's son, Carl. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Newark, N.J., has been investigating the  
IBF for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI would not confirm the raid at King's office -- in  
Deerfield Beach, about 40 miles north of Miami -- was linked to the 
IBF investigation or if the search would be completed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can tell you is we are serving search  
warrants on his offices as part of an ongoing investigation,'' FBI 
spokesman Mike Faregas said. 
</P>
<P>
	King spokesman Greg Fritz did not immediately return a call for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, HBO president Lou DiBella denied King's  
assertion that a rematch was set between Evander Holyfield and 
Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	And sources close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said one of the stumbling blocks was the possibility 
King could be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	DiBella said there were ``some problematic issues that need to  
be worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HBO has insisted King step aside as the fight promoter if he  
were to be indicted on charges stemming from a number of 
investigations, sources close to the negotiations told the AP. So 
far, King has refused such a clause in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Newark, federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all  
IBF records since 1982 on rankings and contracts for fights, as 
well as checks, invoices, expense forms and telephone records, its 
attorney has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors, citing grand jury secrecy, will not  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF and two other sanctioning groups -- the World Boxing  
Association and World Boxing Council -- set rules and rankings that 
play a large role in determining bouts. Boxers who defy the groups 
risk losing the chance to be declared a champion and earn large 
purses.

<HEADLINE> Green Returns to Blue Jays Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Shawn Green, who returned to the Blue Jays'  
lineup after missing a week because of a small fracture in his left 
wrist, left Friday's game against Montreal in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Green sustained the injury after being hit by a pitch in the  
fourth inning May 28 against the New York Yankees. He went 0-for-2 
with a strikeout and a flyout and seemed to be clenching the hand 
during the game, which Toronto won 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to a wait a couple of weeks until it's complete  
healed,'' Green said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto lost five of six while he was out.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be sore, and if it gets too bad I'm not going to  
play,'' said Green, who only took a few swings in batting practice 
so as not to aggravate it. ``Right now I feel I can do it. It's 
better to get out there and play than to sit and watch.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Release Carlos Baerga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Former major leaguer Carlos Baerga, who has  
been trying to earn a promotion from the Cincinnati Reds' farm 
system, was released by the Reds on Friday so he could sign a 
minor-league contract with the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, 30, had been playing with the Reds' Triple-A  
Indianapolis team. The Reds said he asked for his release so that 
he could join San Diego's Triple-A club. 
</P>
<P>
	The infielder batted .290 in 52 games at Indianapolis, with  
three home runs and 27 runs batted in. He agreed to a minor league 
deal during spring training that allowed him to become a free agent 
if another team wants him for its major league roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds had considered bringing him up, but bypassed him to  
promote other players and acknowledged that they could lose Baerga 
as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sorry that we were not able to provide Carlos an  
opportunity at the major league level, but we believe we kept the 
best 25-man roster to win now and long-term,'' Reds general manager 
Jim Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga made the American League All-Star team in 1992, 1993 and  
1995 while with the Cleveland Indians. Cleveland traded him in July 
1996 to the New York Mets. He played for the Mets through last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals signed Baerga as a free agent in  
January, then released him during spring training. The Reds signed 
him on March 23 to his Triple-A contract with Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Mostly Lower / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices were mostly lower Friday,  
boosting interest rates to the highest level in 13 months, as money 
flowed back into stocks after a key report eased the recent 
inflation worries. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipped 1/8  
point, or $1.25 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
	Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, edged higher  
from late Thursday's 5.95 percent to finish at 5.96 percent, the 
highest level since mid-May of last year. The long-bond yield is a 
barometer for the interest charged on many types of consumer and 
business loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of Treasury securities with  
short-term and intermediate-term maturities finished unchanged to 
1/32 point lower, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	In a key reading on inflationary pressures, the Labor Department  
reported Friday that the nation's unemployment rate dipped back to 
a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	While a strong job market could give workers leverage to force  
wages higher, pushing up production costs and prices, 
inflation-wary investors were relieved to see that only 11,000 jobs 
were created last month, far below the 225,000 predicted by 
economists. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also showed that average hourly earnings rose 3.6  
percent in May compared to a year ago, only a slight acceleration 
from a 3.2 percent increase the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve recently warned that it was prepared to  
boost interest rates to slow the economy in the event of a 
resurgence of inflation. Higher rates and inflation make bonds and 
other fixed-income investments less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Friday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
fell to 4.53 percent from 4.60 percent late Thursday, while the 
discount fell 0.06 percentage point to 4.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields were unchanged at 4.94 percent while the  
discount held steady at 4.75 percent. One-year yields rose to 5.06 
percent from 5.04 percent late Thursday, while the discount rose by 
0.02 percentage point to 4.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.63 percent, down from 4.81 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 121 3/16. The average yield 
to maturity held steady at 5.42 percent.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia PM Urges Balkans Aid Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski  
said today the 242,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees in his country may 
choose not to return to their homeland unless the West provides 
sufficient economic support. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that happens, the result will be Milosevic achieving his  
aims,'' Georgievski said, referring to Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgievski, speaking through a translator at a news conference,  
said at another point that he received news of Thursday's peace 
breakthrough with ``great optimism'' because it meant that 
Milosevic had failed in his quest to ``destroy Macedonia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Milosevic was intent on accomplishing this by flooding  
Macedonia with refugees, thus creating an economic disaster and 
generating tensions between the largely Muslim refugees and the 
Christian population of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``His aims did not succeed,'' Georgievski said. After Albania,  
Macedonia was the prime recipient of refugees, with 330,000 
arrivals all told. About 97,000 are in camps and 145,000 in private 
homes. The remainder have resettled in third countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgievski, here for talks with administration officials, said  
the Balkans need an economic development plan similar to the one 
that enabled Europe to recover after World War II. He added that 
Macedonia is less interested in loans than in ``real and fruitful'' 
compensation for the losses it suffered as a result of the Kosovo 
turmoil.

	NATO Bombing May End Sunday  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said today NATO might stop  
bombing Yugoslavia as early as Sunday if Serb begin to retreat from 
Kosovo. President Clinton said he was ready to end allied air 
strikes following a tentative peace deal. He explained: ``There is 
an enormous opportunity to be seized here, a chance to shift our 
focus from defeating something evil to building something good.'' 
Clinton said 11 weeks of NATO bombing have been worth the effort to 
end Serbian repression in Kosovo.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ready to halt the air campaign  
against Yugoslavia, NATO generals were expected to meet 
face-to-face tomorrow with Yugoslav and Russian counterparts. They 
will discuss plans for a Serb withdrawal from the disputed province 
of Kosovo -- the key step before NATO will stop the bombing 
campaign. Plans for the Serb retreat, including logistical 
questions about which roads and bridges to use, were to be 
considered in the NATO-Yugoslav military meeting.

pro-democracy demonstrations, China kept a close watch on Tiananmen 
Square. Dozens of police, some in plainclothes, were on hand. Two 
protesters were arrested. Near the capital, more than 20 relatives 
of five victims of the 1989 assault held a commemorative gathering 
under police guard. In Hong Kong, the only place in China where 
commemoration of the Tiananmen protests were allowed, thousands 
gathered for a candlelight vigil.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bypassing Senate confirmation, President  
Clinton moved today to directly install gay businessman James C. 
Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. The president invoked a 
provision of the Constitution allowing him to make such 
appointments during a congressional recess. Hormel, 66, who will 
become the first openly gay U.S. ambassador, can serve in the 
diplomatic post through the end of 2000. He is an heir to the

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate dipped back

of payroll jobs was the smallest in more than three years. 
Unemployment among blacks fell to the lowest level on record while 
the jobless rates of teen-agers and adult women hit 30-year lows,

<HEADLINE> No Problems for Team Kool Green </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST ALLIS, Wis. (AP) -- A friendly chat and a quiet lecture by  
team owner Barry Green apparently has healed any possible breach 
between teammates Paul Tracy and Dario Franchitti after their 
untimely collision last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	All three members of Team Kool Green, at the Milwaukee Mile on  
Friday as practice began for the Miller Lite 225, downplayed the 
incident last Saturday during the Motorola 300 in Madison, Ill. 
Tracy and Franchitti collided while racing each other for second 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy, whose bad-boy reputation had people immediately pointing  
fingers, wound up in the concrete wall and out of the race. 
Franchitti somehow managed to keep his car spinning in the middle 
of the track, recovered and went on to finish third. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul and I talked a little yesterday and everything is just  
fine between us,'' Franchitti said. ``There's no problem at all. 
It's just a little awkward right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time the teammates have been involved in an  
altercation. Last October in Houston, Tracy wrecked both team cars 
when he hit Franchitti while trying to pass on the tight city 
street circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy then got into a brief shoving match with Green in the pit  
lane. 
</P>
<P>
	In this latest incident, it was Franchitti who was trying to  
make the pass. Tracy, who was barred from driving in the season 
opener by CART for a rough driving incident last fall in Australia, 
simply rode off on his motorbike after returning to the pits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no tension between Dario and I,'' Tracy said Friday.  
``I'd be lying, though, if I said I wasn't disappointed. We could 
have had a podium finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``From my standpoint, we've got to pull the positives out of  
last week. We were competitive all three days, qualified on the 
front row and led the race. Now we've got to carry that momentum 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, second by four points in the driver standings behind  
rookie sensation Juan Montoya, said he still trusts his teammate 
``as much as you trust anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I think most of our problems on the racetrack are  
because we are teammates,'' Franchitti said. ``We would attack a 
lot harder with somebody else. It's when you hesitate that you get 
in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy agreed, saying, ``I give him more room than anybody else  
out there. I went wheel to wheel with Montoya and with Greg (Moore) 
and I gave them less room than I gave Dario. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just drove in very hard to try to make the pass. I left  
room, but there just wasn't enough room after he skipped across 
some bumps and moved up a bit. I sure didn't want that to happen. 
We had a good car and we need that finish badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green said the team had its usual Friday morning meeting, but  
admitted the topic this week was the incident in Madison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a racing incident,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, it  
involved both of our cars. And there was equal blame to go 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green said he remains happy with his driver combination.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great problem to have when you get two drivers who are  
so competitive and so aggressive. That's what I want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The aftermath of the crash certainly didn't slow Tracy on Friday  
as he led the opening practice for Sunday's race with a lap of 
168.681 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was second at 168.475, followed by Patrick Carpentier at  
168.048, Madison runner-up Helio Castro-Neves at 167.979, Montoya 
at 167.650, Christian Fittipaldi at 167.487 and defending race 
winner Jimmy Vasser at 167.261. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Andretti, who won the Motorola 300, was 10th at 166.765.  
Franchitti struggled to find the right setup and tied for 16th with 
Michel Jourdain Jr. at 165.032.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Lawmen Acquitted of Frame-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- Four sheriff's officers and a former  
prosecutor were acquitted Friday of charges that they conspired to 
send the wrong man to death row for the killing of a 10-year-old 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury deliberated about 10 hours in the case, which charged the  
lawmen with obstructing justice, perjury and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the defendants were acquitted by the jury. A fifth  
defendant, a sheriff's officer, was acquitted by the judge Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts said they knew of no other case in which law  
enforcement officials were prosecuted for carrying out their 
official duties. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict followed the dismissal of charges last month against  
two other former county prosecutors accused in the case. The judge 
ruled that special prosecutor William Kunkle had not presented 
sufficient evidence against them. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven were indicted in 1996 on charges they lied and  
fabricated evidence against Rolando Cruz, who was twice convicted 
for the 1983 rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl in the Chicago 
suburb of Naperville. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz spent nearly a decade on death row before he was acquitted  
in 1995 during his third trial, and charges against a fellow 
defendant, Alejandro Hernandez, were later dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	While on death row, Cruz and Hernandez became the centers of a  
cause argued by law professors, journalists and death penalty 
opponents who claimed the evidence against them was fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators claimed Cruz described having a dream about the  
crime, but Cruz denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	Kunkle accused detectives Thomas Vosburgh and Dennis Kurzawa of  
concocting the statement, and their supervisor, Lt. James 
Montesano, of lying to bolster the story. Lt. Robert Winkler was 
charged with falsely testifying that Cruz made other incriminating 
statements to him while in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Former assistant state's attorney Thomas L. Knight was accused  
of using the detectives' perjured testimony and lying repeatedly 
over the years to cover up the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorneys accused Cruz of giving different versions  
of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen years after the murder, no one stands convicted of  
Jeanine Nicarico's killing. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA evidence pointed to another man, Brian Dugan, who had  
pleaded guilty to raping and killing a woman and a 7-year-old girl. 
Dugan claimed he alone killed Jeanine, but he refused to make a 
formal confession.

<HEADLINE>  Failed Japan Bank Files Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A failed Japanese bank filed a criminal complaint  
with police and prosecutors on Friday, accusing its former 
executives of engaging in illegal business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., which was nationalized  
in October after being declared insolvent, acted in response to an 
internal probe begun after the resignation of top executives.

	The statement did not name the former executives it was  
targeting or give details of the allegations against them. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit bank became the first Japanese bank to be  
nationalized since the end of World War II after financial 
authorities determined it had liabilities exceeding assets by about 
$2.79 billion.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate at 29-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unemployment edged down to 4.2 percent last  
month, returning to a 29-year low and helping workers who 
historically have had a harder time finding jobs. Black 
unemployment hit a record low, and jobless rates for teen-agers and 
adult women fell to the lowest levels in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the drop in unemployment, there was only a tiny increase  
of 11,000 jobs in the nation's payrolls in May -- a sharp slowdown 
from 343,000 jobs created in the previous month and the weakest 
showing since a decline in January 1996, the Labor Department said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures show that the economic expansion, the longest in  
peacetime history, has given the country a low overall unemployment 
rate while aiding minority groups, who traditionally lag behind in 
economic gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of unemployed blacks fell to 7.5 percent last month,  
the lowest level since the government began tracking this statistic 
in 1972 but still far above the 3.7 percent unemployment rate for 
white Americans. In April, the black unemployment rate was 7.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate for teen-agers, meanwhile, dipped to 12.6  
percent while the rate for adult women fell to 3.6 percent, both 
30-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Combined with the continued strong overall economic growth,  
low long-term inflation and continued rising wages, we are widening 
the circle of opportunity for more Americans,'' President Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.2 percent jobless rate in May matched March's level and  
was slightly lower than April's 4.3 percent. Before that, 
unemployment last touched 4.2 percent in February 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists agree that the record length of the expansion, now in  
its ninth year, and its accompanying tight labor market help spread 
prosperity to groups that have traditionally had higher 
unemployment rates than white males. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economic prosperity and low unemployment are a boon to those  
groups who have been faring the worst in the job market,'' said 
Bill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock in Boston. ``When the 
unemployment rate goes down, employers break old barriers and get 
more creative in their hiring and training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said the strong economy, coupled  
with an increase in the minimum wage and an earned income tax 
credit, are ``making work more attractive. And as we do that, we 
have more of a magnet, if you will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some employment gains for women, she said, can be attributed to  
women moving off welfare and into the work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts offered mixed views on whether May's tiny 11,000  
jobs-creation performance really signified a slowdown in the 
nation's economic growth or was a statistical fluke. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, which had grown increasingly jittery over  
worries that too-rapid growth would prompt the Federal Reserve to 
boost interest rates, took heart from Friday's report. The Dow 
Jones industrial average closed at 10,799.84, up 136.15 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ``indicates that the economy remains on a path of  
solid, noninflationary growth,'' said Janet Yellen, chairman of the 
Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of showing a decrease in jobs demand, the small gain in  
payroll jobs could reflect that employers are having trouble 
finding qualified people in the tight labor market, some analysts 
said. Others noted that while May's jobs increase was tiny, the 
April figure had been revised up sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department also said that average hourly earnings, a  
closely watched indicator for inflation, rose by 3.6 percent in May 
compared to a year ago, just a slight move upward from the previous 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists remained split on whether the new employment  
information would make it more or less likely that the central 
bank's Federal Open Market Committee at its next meeting on June 
29-30 will start raising interest rates to slow the economy and 
keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	``This report should not dissuade the Fed from tightening at the  
June 30 meeting, despite the soft headline report of just 11,000 
new jobs,'' said First Union economist David Orr. 
</P>
<P>
	But Merrill Lynch's Bruce Steinberg disagreed. The weak 11,000  
jobs figure ``should be sufficient to keep the Fed on hold'' at the 
June 30 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before today, a tightening was almost considered to be a done  
deal. Now there is a little more doubt,'' said economist Joel 
Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. Still, he believes odds favor a 
June 30 rate increase.

<HEADLINE> 4 Convicted of Immigrant Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Three Chinese nationals and a fourth man from  
Taiwan were convicted of smuggling some 150 immigrants aboard a 
packed fishing boat the U.S. Coast Guard intercepted nearly a year 
ago off Baja California, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict Friday against  
three other defendants after three weeks of deliberations in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard intercepted the ship Chih Yung about 150 miles  
southeast of San Diego on Aug. 27, 1998. Authorities found 150 
illegal immigrants from China packed into its fish hold and another 
24 crew members and suspected smugglers on deck. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrants testified they paid an average of $30,000 to be  
smuggled from southern China to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys had argued that all seven defendants were  
either crew members of the ship who were unaware of the smuggling 
operation or were simply migrants, not smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen Biao, Lin Hui, Li Xiang Feng, the Chinese nationals who  
were convicted, were smugglers, prosecutors said. The fourth 
convicted defendant, Tu Yu Piao, who is from Taiwan, was the ship's 
first officer.

<HEADLINE> Clinton on Guns: Blame Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tweaked about whether his gun control  
proposals were tough enough, President Clinton gave a nationally 
televised finger-wagging discourse on politics as the art of the 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The president defended measures moving through Congress in the  
wake of the Littleton, Colo., school shootings as the strongest 
steps the Republicans might accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``How foolish would it be for me to be debating this issue when  
these things are before the Congress that can save children's 
lives?'' he said. ``I should blow by them because they're not 
enough? I don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his wife, Hillary, brought their campaign against  
youth violence to the nation's breakfast tables Friday in a session 
with teen-agers -- some from schools made infamous by shootings -- 
broadcast by ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anchor Charlie Gibson opened the broadcast from the White House  
Roosevelt Room with a one-on-one interview with Clinton. He quoted 
an unnamed Clinton ally as saying that after the Colorado 
shootings, Clinton ``had a chance to roar and he meowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reacted strongly.  
</P>
<P>
	``Look, let's join the real world here,'' he said, narrowing his  
eyes and wagging his finger at Gibson. ``You want an honest 
conversation, let's have an honest conversation. I am the first 
president who ever took on the NRA,'' the National Rifle 
Association. ``I got my party in Congress to stand with me on the 
Brady bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton pounded his left fist into his right palm.  
</P>
<P>
	``For you to say I shouldn't take what I can get and instead I  
should ask for things that I am absolutely positive will be 
defeated in the Congress is quite wrong,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate last month passed a bill that requires mandatory  
background checks for firearm sales at gun shows and pawn shops and 
child-safety locks on all new handguns. Vice President Al Gore cast 
the tie-breaking vote on the amendment requiring the background 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration believes it has agreement with House  
Republicans for background checks on sales of explosives and 
increasing from 18 to 21 the legal age for owning handguns and 
assault-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	But it lost a bid for quick House passage of the entire Senate  
package before the Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``They went home before taking action. Why?'' Clinton asked.  
``To give the NRA time to lobby them, to water down what was 
passed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton deferred action on more controversial gun controls, such  
as a mandatory three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases 
and limiting gun purchases to one per month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should we do more? Should people ought to have to register  
guns like they register their cars? Do I think that? Of course I 
do,'' Clinton said. ``But I tell you, the American people may have 
one opinion, but they elected the Congress and the Congress doesn't 
have that opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the president's one-on-one interview in the Cabinet  
Room, he and Mrs. Clinton sat down with students from Littleton, 
Springfield, Ore., West Paducah, Ky., Conyers, Ga., and other areas 
for an uninterrupted discussion of youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	One student, Albert Smith, questioned the president skeptically.  
``How spectacular is this legislation and why will it make a 
difference?'' Another student in the discussion was Missy Jenkins, 
who was paralyzed from the waist down on Dec. 1, 1997, when a 
classmate opened fire inside her West Paducah high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton beseeched kids to ask questions and demand safe  
surroundings. ``If you guys are going to a party, make sure there 
are no guns around,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady also asked students to speak out for tougher gun  
controls. ``There's no reason why a lot of you who are about to be 
or are already 18 can't let your voices be heard too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons viewed ``Good Morning America'' and its estimated 7  
million viewers as an opportunity to ``talk directly to families as 
they get ready for another school day,'' White House spokesman Jake 
Siewert said.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Central Bank Head Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- The president of Honduras' Central  
Bank, Emin Barjum, resigned Friday in order to spend more time on 
his businesses and to assist his ailing wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Barjum announced his departure in a radio address, a day after  
he met President Carlos Flores Facusse to explain his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Barjum took charge of the bank in January 1998, two days after  
Flores Facusse had been sworn in. Educated as an industrial 
engineer, Barjum owns a liquor distillery and business centers in 
Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
	The government made no mention of who would replace Barjum.  
</P>
<P>
	Barjum had been involved in Honduras' recent negotiations with  
the International Monetary Fund, which has supported easing the 
country's debt.

<HEADLINE>  Hingis Seeks First French Open Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Pressure? What pressure? For Steffi Graf,  
Saturday's French Open women's final is just another tennis match. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she is playing for a Grand Slam title for the first  
time in almost three years, Graf has won this clay-court 
championship five times before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I obviously feel that I don't have to prove anything,'' Graf  
said. ``I don't have the feeling that I have to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the case for her 18-year-old and No. 1-ranked  
opponent, Martina Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	She is determined to win at Roland Garros and become only the  
ninth woman -- and the first since Graf -- to triumph at each Grand 
Slam singles stop. 
</P>
<P>
	It should be a tight final, a clash of generations if not of  
styles. Both Graf and Hingis are big hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	But, while Hingis doesn't have any clear weaknesses, Graf -- in  
her first Grand Slam final since the 1996 U.S. Open -- will look to 
take advantage of her greater athletic ability and speed, and 
attack the Swiss player's unexceptional serve. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis will be wary of Graf's renowned forehand. But the  
29-year-old German's tendency to run around her backhand could 
leave her out of position -- and exposed to Hingis' accurate ground 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, who has won seven Grand Slam doubles titles, is happier  
at the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steffi has a powerful baseline game,'' Hingis said. And in  
addition to Graf's forehand, ``her slice backhand is very deep and 
low. You can't do much out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, holder of 21 Grand Slam titles, is 6-2 against Hingis  
lifetime, but Hingis won their only previous match on clay -- in the 
1996 Italian Open -- and their most recent meeting -- this year at 
the Pan Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	After terrible luck with injuries, Graf is storming back.  
</P>
<P>
	A win against Hingis would leave her one shy of Chris Evert's  
record of seven French Open singles titles. She already has equaled 
Evert's record of nine finals appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf will move to No. 3 in the rankings next week, her best  
placing for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	And if she beats Hingis, Graf would be the first woman in open  
history to defeat the top three players in the same event, already 
eliminating second-seeded Lindsay Davenport and No. 3 Monica Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, looking to add to her fifth Grand Slam win in Australia  
this year, has had a much easier route to the final, facing only 
one seeded player, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she has been in outstanding form here, not dropping a set  
so far, and is eager to overcome the disappointment of her surprise 
French Open final defeat two years ago to Iva Majoli. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis admits that she underestimated Majoli in that match.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have learned to play smarter now,'' she said. ``The last two  
or three years I felt worse. Now I am feeling better. That is the 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis added that she is happier facing Graf than Seles, and  
hopes that the German will have stage fright on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``With her absence in the last two years I hope she will be a  
little bit nervous,'' Hingis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's reply? ``I won't.''

<HEADLINE> Whirlpool Names New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Home appliance maker Whirlpool Corp.  
named a new president on Friday, promoting Jeff M. Fettig, who had 
been head of Whirlpool Europe operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fettig, 42, was also named as chief operating officer. He will  
report to chairman and CEO David Whitwam. 
</P>
<P>
	Whirlpool also named Mark E. Brown, the company's comptroller,  
as chief financial officer, while Bengt G. Engstrom was selected to 
take Fettig's job as head of Whirlpool Europe. The moves are 
effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitwam said in a statement that Whirlpool had gone without a  
president for a number of years, but decided to fill the position 
to help manage the company. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Fettig led ``our significantly improved performance in  
Europe, which has led to Whirlpool's position as the number one 
brand of appliances in Europe.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Ewing: Bring Me My Ring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- How do the Knicks replace Patrick Ewing?  
For starters, Jeff Van Gundy isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what my starting lineup is yet,'' the coach of  
the Knicks said Thursday after Ewing stood before his teammates at 
practice, his injured left leg strapped into a thick, black walking 
cast, and made a request. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to go out and get me my ring,'' Ewing said.  
``They're ready to go get it for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first step in that process comes Saturday when the Eastern  
Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers resumes. The series, 
tied 1-1, will look a whole lot different since a partial tear of 
the Achilles' tendon will keep Ewing sidelined for the rest of the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy was giving no decent clues as to his thinking on the  
new lineup, although Latrell Sprewell said he expected to continue 
coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can start big with Chris Dudley, you can start big with  
Marcus Camby, you can start small,'' Van Gundy said. ``I just have 
to decide what's best for our team in Game 3, and I haven't decided 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of Ewing will be especially troublesome if the  
remaining Knicks big men get into foul trouble. Van Gundy will be 
reluctant to press 40-year-old backup Herb Williams into service 
behind Dudley and Kurt Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has been getting the early defensive matchup on Rik  
Smits, while Ewing was guarding the less-dangerous Dale Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he expects Smits to see more playing time since  
he can avoid foul trouble by not having to guard Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formula for winning is the same no matter who plays: Play  
defense, rebound and get quality shots,'' Van Gundy said. ``We 
can't turn into a jump shooting team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What they can turn into is a run-and-gun team that pushes the  
ball upcourt and tries to get into the paint before Indiana sets up 
its defense. The Knicks had 22 fast-break points in their Game 1 
victory but only seven in the Game 2 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ewing sat out 12 games earlier this season, that was the  
strategy the Knicks used successfully. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel we have an opportunity to win it,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ewing's teammates echoed that confidence, bouyed by the fact  
they already know what it's like to win without him. Tendinitis in 
the same tendon kept Ewing out of 12 games during the regular 
season, and he missed most of the previous season because of a 
broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling a little confident because we have played without  
him and we've been successful without him during the regular 
season. He's going to be missed a lot, but we'll play a more 
uptempo style,'' Camby said. ``Everyone's in an uptempo spirit, 
everyone's ready to raise their level of play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing's role with the Knicks, especially on offense, has  
diminished during the playoffs because of a multitude of injuries. 
He scored 16 points during 40 minutes in Game 1, then had 10 points 
in 25 minutes in Game 2 after feeling a ``ripping sensation'' in 
his Achilles' tendon during pregame warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told it was unlikely that when you have tendinitis it  
leads to a tear. Unfortunately, it happened,'' Ewing said. ``I 
don't regret playing. It was rough enough for me last year to sit 
and watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Indianapolis, the Pacers said they know what to expect of the  
Ewing-less Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can look at it one of two ways,'' Davis said. ``Either  
they're going to respond to him or it is going to hurt them badly. 
Knowing the character of that team, I think they'll respond 
positively. I look for them to push the ball more. They're going to 
be home, so I look for them to be more of an uptempo team.''

<HEADLINE> Hall of Fame Spices Pepper's Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Dottie Pepper doesn't want an LPGA  
career measured by majors. Her goal is loftier. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepper, who won the season's first major with a record 19-under  
par at the Nabisco Dinah Shore, is 7 under and only three strokes 
off the lead halfway through the U.S. Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	As one of the fiercest competitors on the tour, there is no  
question Pepper would like to win the Open. But she insists her 
focus is on the LPGA Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in this for the big picture. I'm not in it to just win  
majors of X number of tournaments,'' Pepper said Friday after her 
second sub-70 round at Old Waverly Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Under requirements revamped this year, there is a point system  
for induction into the LPGA Hall of Fame. Instead of needing to win 
at least 30 tournaments with two major titles, players now need to 
earn 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Players get one point for each career victory, scoring title and  
player of the year award, and a bonus point for winning in one of 
the four majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepper, who is 33 years old and a 12th-year pro, has 19 points  
toward the Hall of Fame. She has 15 victories, including two Dinah 
Shore titles, and in 1992 was the LPGA player of the year and 
scoring champ. The win at this year's Dinah Shore ended a nearly 
three-year victory drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is the Hall of Fame. I'll take whatever it takes to  
get in there,'' Pepper said. ``It can be eight more regular 
tournaments. It could be four more majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an Open is among them that would be great. But I'm not  
going to freeze frame myself to think that's the only way I'm going 
to get in it is by winning an Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pepper is in position to make a run at an Open title -- and add  
two points toward her Hall of Fame total. 
</P>
<P>
	A 68-69 start follows top 10 finishes at the Sara Lee and  
Corning tournaments, where she shot in the 60s for all four weekend 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	And in 15 previous Opens as a pro, Pepper has 10 times finished  
in the top 15. That includes five straight top 10 finishes between 
1988-92. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you do after two days is try to get yourself in the thick  
of it. And that's exactly what's happened,'' Pepper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure your excitement level tends to rise a little bit,  
especially on the weekend, but I think it's important not to 
overemphasize that the world doesn't end with U.S. Opens or majors 
specifically.''

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Tries for Triple Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Here we go again.  
</P>
<P>
	For the third year in a row, and for the seventh time in 21  
years, thoroughbred racing stands on the threshold of its first 
Triple Crown champion since Affirmed swept the Kentucky Derby, 
Preakness and Belmont in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around, the 3-year-old on the verge of racing  
immortality is Charismatic, a great-grandson of the mighty 
Secretariat. Charismatic won the Derby and Preakness less than four 
months after he was tossed into a $62,5000 claiming race. 
</P>
<P>
	A win today in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont, considered the ``Test of  
Champions,'' would boost the 3-year-old chestnut's earnings to more 
than $2.5 million and clinch a Visa-sponsored $5 million bonus for 
owners Bob and Beverly Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, trained by Hall of Famer D. Wayne Lukas, is  
attempting to become the 12th Triple Crown winner and avoid joining 
14 others who flopped in the Belmont after winning the Derby and 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the timing is right, I think the public would like to  
see it,'' Lukas said of a Triple Crown. ``We're just hoping that 
the energy level is there to have one more great race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, the energy level fizzled in the final  
strides for Silver Charm and Real Quiet, a pair of colts trained by 
Bob Baffert, who tries to play spoiler today when he sends out star 
filly Silverbulletday to challenge Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Silver Charm battled Free House down the stretch,  
but Touch Gold swept by on the outside in the final 50 yards and 
won by three-quarters-of-a-length, denying the Lewises a Triple 
Crown on their first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Victory Gallop nosed out Real Quiet at the wire after  
a sensational stretch run, giving trainer Elliott Walden a win 
after his colt finished second in the Derby and Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden is in the same situation today: Menifee, runner-up in the  
Derby and Preakness, could give the 36-year-old Kentucky-based 
trainer his second straight Belmont victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Baffert and Walden leave no doubt that, sure, a Triple  
Crown would be terrific for racing, but not at their expense. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no part of me that wants to see Charismatic win the  
Belmont,'' Walden said. ``That said, if we can't win, I'd like to 
see Charismatic win the Triple Crown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's view of the race is slightly different.  
</P>
<P>
	``Winning the Triple Crown is either meant to be or not meant to  
be,'' he said. ``I lost the last two, and if Charismatic wins, 
it'll be a great story. But if Silverbulletday wins, it'll be a 
great story, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises, meanwhile, can't believe their good fortune.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you asked me what the odds of having another chance at the  
Triple Crown were, I'd say astronomical, unbelievable,'' Bob Lewis 
said. ``I think my elation at Pimlico was prompted not by the 
victory Chris and Wayne brought, but the fact that we were going to 
run for the Triple Crown again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris would be Chris Antley, who has perhaps the best comeback  
story of all. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of being one of the nation's top jockeys, the  
33-year-old rider dropped out of the sport in 1997, bedeviled with 
drug problems that played a part in his weight ballooning to 147 
pounds. After nearly 1 1/2 years out of the sport, Antley returned, 
and Lukas gave him a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I can get this done,'' Antley said. ``If it doesn't  
happen, I'm going to still be the same. Believe me, nobody wants it 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic will face 11 challengers, making his task all the  
more difficult. In the 25 previous Belmonts where a Triple Crown 
was on the line, the only field larger was in 1971, when Pass 
Catcher denied Canonero II the series sweep in a 13-horse field. 
Also, none of the 11 Triple Crown winners faced more than seven 
opponents in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, who won just one of his first nine races before  
Lukas began working him harder and running him more frequently, won 
the Derby at odds of 31-1, the Preakness at 8-1, and was expected 
to be the favorite at post time (5:27 p.m. EDT). 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, with Pat Day aboard, and Silverbulletday, with Jerry  
Bailey in the irons for the filly's first race against males after 
winning 11 of 12 against her own sex, were expected to be the next 
to choices of an expected crowd between 80,000 and 85,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The other challengers are Best of Luck, Stephen Got Even,  
Adonis, Lemon Drop Kid, Vision and Verse, Patience Game, Pineaff, 
Prime Directive and Teletable.

<HEADLINE> Congress Examines Olympic Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Olympic officials have turned over 18  
boxes of financial records to congressional investigators examining 
the city's winning bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Three staff members for a subcommittee of the House Commerce  
Committee were escorted to Olympic offices Thursday and given 
immediate access to the records, which are only a fraction of the 
1,400 boxes of documents chronicling the Atlanta Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, said  
investigators most likely will want to see all Olympic records, 
including any files purged from the boxes by lawyers for the 
Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, which contends it owns the 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	While the GAAF will not prevent the investigators from looking  
at all records, it wants to ``direct'' their review, spokesman Lee 
Echols said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be directing them, pointing out where they can find  
the information they are looking for,'' Echols said. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee received a report this week from Billy Payne  
and Andrew Young, the foundation's cochairmen, detailing some of 
the enticements they used in winning the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation hoped the report would satisfy the investigators,  
but the details of expensive gifts, excessive travel and lavish 
receptions only piqued their interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just scratching the surface,'' Upton said after reading  
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation is keeping the records closed to public scrutiny  
and is battling Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker and The 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution in court to keep them private.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Fans Show Up To See McGwire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- There's no question Mark McGwire is the reason  
fans are jamming Tiger Stadium this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since Mark Fidrych talked to the ball and groomed the mound  
in 1976 has one player drawn fans to the old ballpark like McGwire, 
who's in Detroit with the St. Louis Cardinals for a three-game 
series with the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40,000 fans are expected each game. During 12-plus years  
with the Oakland Athletics, McGwire hit more home runs at Tiger 
Stadium than any other park but his own. He hit his first major 
league homer at Detroit in 1986 and two years ago became one of 
just four players to hit a fair ball over Tiger Stadium's 
left-field roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think much about stuff like that,'' McGwire said  
before Friday night's game. ``I let the media do it. I don't get 
caught up in stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game is not an individual thing; it's not one guy. It's a  
team. It bothers me to see: `Mark McGwire and the St. Louis 
Cardinals come to town.' It's not just me. It's the St. Louis 
Cardinals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even four hours before game time, the usual crowd of autograph  
seekers outside the visiting team's entrance gate was much larger 
than normal. Most fans were wearing Cardinals caps, some sported 
McGwire jerseys or T-shirts and all had pens at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Not far away, a long line of concession workers stood along a  
stadium wall waiting to punch in for a busy night. A supervisor for 
SportService, the Tiger Stadium concessionaire, said up to 100 
extra workers, including some from Cincinnati and Milwaukee, would 
be on hand for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium gates opened two hours before the first pitch, a  
half-hour earlier than usual. Fans immediately surrounded the 
Cardinals' dugout area, hoping for an autograph or at least a 
close-up photo opportunity when McGwire emerged from the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Others headed to the left-field seats in both the lower and  
upper decks, all with the hope of catching a batting practice homer 
off McGwire's bat. McGwire didn't disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit seven batting-practice home runs, including two over the  
left- field roof. One other ball cleared the roof but was a few 
feet foul.

<HEADLINE> Hearing Held on Notre Dame Booster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The NCAA held a hearing Friday on whether a  
former Notre Dame booster gave financial help to as many as a dozen 
football players. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was closed, and the school said a decision is  
expected in July or August. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA is investigating whether Kimberly Dunbar's relationship  
with players broke a rule stipulating that schools and their 
representatives cannot provide an athlete or a relative or friend 
of an athlete a benefit not authorized by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records show Dunbar, who is serving a four-year prison  
sentence after pleading guilty to embezzling more that $1.4 million 
from her former employer in South Bend, provided players, their 
families and friends with more than $35,000 in gifts and trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame spokesman Dennis Moore said the school responded to  
the NCAA in a ``forthright and complete'' manner. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said Notre Dame has disbanded the Quarterback Club, a  
group of boosters whose members included Dunbar. The school has 
held assistant coaches accountable for athletes' academic and 
personal development, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA has already established that Dunbar became a  
representative of the university in June 1995 when she joined the 
Quarterback Club. Court records show she purchased gifts and trips 
for several players after that date, including presents for players 
with whom she had personal relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were Jarvis Edison, with whom she has a child. She  
took him, fellow player Allen Rossum and Rossum's girlfriend on a 
$10,000 trip to Las Vegas in 1997 to see the Evander Holyfield-Mike 
Tyson fight. She also took then-boyfriend Derrick Mayes to Las 
Vegas in 1995, paying for his $1,836 ticket and a $756 stay at the 
Luxor, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Jonas, a lawyer representing the company Dunbar embezzled  
the money from, said they have collected 5,000 to 10,000 pages of 
documents concerning Dunbar's relationship with Irish players and 
the NCAA has not requested any information from them. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials have argued that the possible infractions  
were secondary. NCAA enforcement officials agreed, recommending in 
April the committee shouldn't view the case as major. But the 
infractions committee decided to review the case as a possible 
major violation. 
</P>
<P>
	To bolster their defense, the school has hired the law firm of  
Bond, Schoeneck &AMP; King. The firm, with an office near the NCAA in 
Overland Park, Kan., specializes in assisting colleges under 
investigation by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame has claimed Dunbar provided the benefits to players  
``in the context of personal relationships'' and not as a booster. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Smrt, the NCAA's enforcement director and one of the  
officials that recommended Notre Dame's infractions be ruled 
secondary, said it's rare for enforcement officials to change their 
minds after making a recommendation to the committee, even if it's 
overruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he wouldn't comment on Notre Dame's case directly, he  
said enforcement officials usually argue for their original 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Smrt said the committee could rule Notre Dame committed a major  
infraction but withhold serious punishment. If the committee rules 
the infractions major it could put the Irish on probation for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	That means any other violation would make Notre DAme eligible  
for harsh penalties -- a ban from national television or bowl games, 
loss of scholarships, recruiting restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Government Eases Anti-Baiting Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service eased its  
anti-baiting rules Thursday, saying migratory game birds can be 
shot over natural wetlands where grains have been deposited through 
normal upkeep such as mowing or the clearing of brush. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule change ``recognizes the need to allow the necessary  
management of these (wetland) areas ... while still providing 
hunting opportunities,'' the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised regulations ``give landowners the flexibility to  
maintain, develop, manage and hunt (in) wetland habitat essential 
for migratory birds,'' the agency said in announcing the new 
baiting regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits hunters from distributing grain or other  
food to attract migratory game birds for the purpose of shooting 
them. Hunters and property owners have complained that the 
prohibition has also been applied when seed is inadvertently left 
by routine upkeep of land including mowing, the clearing of brush, 
or tillage. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, landowners have been reluctant to perform these  
needed maintenance practices to wetland areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Rappaport Clark, the agency's director, said the revised  
regulations will provide incentives for landowners to maintain 
wetlands and, as a result, ``will provide additional habitat for 
birds and increase opportunities for hunting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wetland conservation on private lands is essential to the  
long-term survival and growth of waterfowl and other migratory bird 
populations,'' said Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also said the new rules will no longer consider as  
illegal baiting the ``inadvertent scattering of seed'' from 
standing crops when a hunter places decoys or retrieves downed 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised regulations also implemented a less restrictive  
definition enacted by Congress last year of when someone should be 
considered subject to the anti-baiting law. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously a person could be held liable even if he claimed he  
did not know an area had been baited. Under the new rules, a person 
can be prosecuted ``if the person knows or reasonably should know'' 
that an area was baited. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty for hunting over bait is a fine of up to $15,000 and  
six months in jail. Actual placing of bait can subject an 
individual to a fine of up to $100,000 and one year in jail.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Recalls Last Free Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- When Indonesians last held a free  
election, President Eisenhower was in the White House and the Cold 
War was in full bloom. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as now, there was ample enthusiasm for democracy. In 1955,  
Indonesia was a fledgling nation, the memory of an independence war 
against Dutch colonizers still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
	But the political experiment went awry: Governing coalition  
parties bickered and founding President Sukarno steered the nation 
on an authoritarian course. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia, facing parliamentary elections on Monday, is again a  
fragile country as it emerges from three decades of rigid rule 
under former President Suharto, Sukarno's successor. Elections took 
place then, but they were carefully manipulated in Suharto's favor. 
</P>
<P>

	Forty-four years ago, 83 parties and individuals registered for  
the parliamentary race. The debate was acrimonious and no group won

<P>
	Feith, an Australian who witnessed the 1955 election, said

	There were also fears of unrest ahead of this year's poll, which

	In contrast, Sukarno and his allies in the military were never

<P>
	Sukarno ended up strengthening his executive powers under a

</P>
<P>
	The dominant political figures in Indonesia today have their

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Close Higher; Dow Up 136.15 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices rose smartly on Wall Street Friday as  
traders were pleasantly surprised by the government's report that 
inflation and the economy aren't running rampant after all. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's monthly employment report helped temper  
investors' concerns that the Federal Reserve might soon raise 
interest rates to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargain-hunting that followed the recent selloff on Wall Street  
also contributed to Friday's gains, as the Dow Jones industrial 
average rose 136.15 to close at 10,799.84, adding to an 85-point 
gain on Thursday. For the week, the Dow was up 240.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The battered Nasdaq  
composite index rose 75.02 to 2,478.34, its fifth-largest point 
gain ever. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 28.21 to 1,327.75. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment  
rate dipped to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in May. But investors 
were particularly impressed by the fact that only 11,000 jobs were 
created last month, far below the 225,000 expected by economists 
and a sign that the economy is growing moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	Another indicator closely watched for signs of inflation,  
average hourly earnings, was up 3.6 percent in May compared to a 
year ago, only a slight acceleration from a 3.2 percent increase 
the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Both factors eased concerns among investors that the Fed will  
soon raise rates to slow an economy that is threatening to 
overheat. The central bank warned May 18 that it would raise rates 
if it determined that inflation was gaining momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors may feel like the worst news on that front has  
already occurred,'' said Bob Dickey, managing director of technical 
analysis at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's warning has created volatility on Wall Street in  
recent weeks, with investors fearing a rate hike would cut into the 
profits of major U.S. companies. But analysts suggested that the 
weeks between the Fed's initial hint and the June 29 meeting of its 
Open Market Committee are giving investors time to get used to the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also attributed Friday's gains to the relatively cheap  
prices that have resulted from the downturn on Wall Street in 
recent weeks. The Dow is down about 2.8 percent since hitting a 
record high on May 13, while the Nasdaq is down 6.6 percent since 
reaching its all-time high April 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday brought the Nasdaq its strongest gain since April 21 as  
investors swooped in looking for bargains. Cisco Systems, up 6 1/16 
to 114 7/8 and Yahoo!, up 12 1/16 at 147 7/16, led a wide rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these stocks have been hit really hard and there's  
some renewed interest in buying,'' Dickey said 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, America Online rose 12 to 117 3/4.  
AOL got a boost from a court ruling that AT&AMP;T must provide open 
access to its cable lines, a decision that should make it easier 
for Internet companies to compete for the business of offering 
high-speed access over cable lines. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, AT&AMP;T slipped 7/8 to 53 3/8. At Home, which has access to  
AT&AMP;T's cable properties, dropped 10 3/4 to 94 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial and bank stocks made some modest gains, as did  
consumer products issues like Procter &AMP; Gamble, which rose 3 1/8 to 
96 5/8 amid speculation it will soon announce a restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts suggested Friday's gains may be difficult to  
sustain as long as questions about interest rates hang over the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is still tepid and cautious about what the Fed will  
do,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 
836.66 million shares, compared with 868.80 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 10.32 to 634.52, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.04 to 780.98 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.35 to 442.33.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.45 percent.  
Germany's DAX index was up 1.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed closed down 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Sued Over Skytel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom is being sued by investors and may  
be facing a federal probe over whether it improperly concealed its 
plans to buy paging company Skytel Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	A class-action suit was announced late Thursday by a group of  
investors charging they made money-losing trades after MCI WorldCom 
made misleading statements. The suit alleges MCI WorldCom drove 
down the price of SkyTel's shares -- and the price tag for last 
week's deal -- by downplaying news it had reserved the Internet 
address ``www.skytelworldcom.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators, meanwhile, are reportedly investigating whether MCI  
WorldCom intentionally mislead investors with its statements 
regarding the Web address on May 25, three days before announcing 
the $1.3 billion purchase of Skytel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to ask MCI WorldCom  
to supply all documents related to the SkyTel negotiations to 
determine who knew what and when they knew it, The Wall Street 
Journal reported today, citing a person familiar with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom declined comment today on both the investor suit  
and the Journal report. An SEC official did not return a phone call 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of SkyTel rose as much as 16 percent to $21.87 1/2 on May 25  
after an Internet service named Company Sleuth reported that MCI 
WorldCom had reserved an Internet address combining the two 
companies' names, suggesting a merger could be in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom quickly played down the significance of that move,  
saying it routinely reserves domain names that might have value, 
and that the SkyTel-related registration was the work of an 
overzealous employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``From time to time, MCI WorldCom employees, sometimes acting on  
their own initiative, register domain names they believe may be 
potential targets of domain-name squatters. The action is not an 
indication of any official company intention,'' said the statement 
read that day by spokeswoman Barbara Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
	By the close of trading, SkyTel had closed with a 6 percent gain  
at $20.12 1/2, with MCI WorldCom compounding the confusion by first 
saying the registration had been withdrawn and later that night 
saying it had not. The merger agreement announced on May 28 valued 
SkyTel at about $21.25 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The investor group, represented by the New York law firm  
Bernstein Liebhard &AMP; Lifshitz, alleged that ``MCI was aware that 
many public shareholders of SkyTel would sell their SkyTel stock if 
they believed that market rumors of takeover talks between MCI and 
SkyTel were unfounded. Defendant's motive was to reduce the price 
MCI would have to pay to acquire SkyTel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said the SEC will try to determine if an executive  
decision had been made at MCI WorldCom to secure the Internet 
address and whether the employee had been directed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted that MCI WolrdCom could easily have  
declined to comment on the SkyTel situation, a common strategy used 
by companies in merger discussions and one that is endorsed by the 
SEC and the courts. But in choosing to respond publicly, the 
company was required to make a full, truthful statement, the 
Journal said, quoting a securities lawyer.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Recalls Last Free Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- When Indonesians last held a free  
election, President Eisenhower was in the White House and the Cold 
War was in full bloom. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as now, there was ample enthusiasm for democracy. In 1955,  
Indonesia was a fledgling nation, the memory of an independence war 
against Dutch colonizers still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
	But the political experiment went awry: Governing coalition  
parties bickered and founding President Sukarno steered the nation 
on an authoritarian course. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia, facing parliamentary elections on Monday, is again a  
fragile country as it emerges from three decades of rigid rule 
under former President Suharto, Sukarno's successor. Elections took 
place then, but they were carefully manipulated in Suharto's favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the uncertainty and political trends that shaped the old  
election remain alive today, but many of the destabilizing factors 
that undercut democracy do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four years ago, 83 parties and individuals registered for  
the parliamentary race. The debate was acrimonious and no group won 
a majority. Next week, a handful of the 48 parties in the race are 
expected to dominate.

<HEADLINE> Battle Against Fla. Fire Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSCEOLA NATIONAL FOREST, Fla. (AP) -- Casper Platero is in one of  
the most scenic forests in the country, but he can't see it for the 
smoke and can't breathe in the pine-scented air without getting a 
chest full of soot. 
</P>
<P>
	Platero, 20, is part of a cadre of American Indians fighting a  
64,000-acre fire covering parts of the Okefenokee Swamp, the 
Osceola National Forest and private land on the Florida-Georgia 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Out among the towering pines and spearlike palmettos, the Navajo  
from Canoncito, N.M., is getting his first taste of the sweaty, 
gritty, work. White smoke hangs thick in the air and the ground is 
hot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun because I am out in the wilderness,'' he says as he  
rolls up a water hose. ``And it's exciting, because you might not 
make it to see tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the same containment line are Indians from Oklahoma --  
Cherokees from Tahlequah, Kiowas from Anadarko, Chickasaws from Ada 
-- and Arapahos from Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Arch Wells, chief forester for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in  
Washington, D.C., said half of the wildfire emergency firefighters 
in the country are American Indians -- a long-standing tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chances are that their brothers did it, their fathers did it,  
their grandfathers did it,'' Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike full-time Forest Service employees, who receive overtime  
and hazardous duty pay, 20-person Indian crews are hired for a 
specific fire and paid about $10 per hour with no overtime. Their 
clothing, housing and meals are provided, as is health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 firefighters and a small air force of planes and  
helicopters have been working the Florida blaze around the clock 
since lightning set it off on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no one has been hurt and no structures have been  
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Brown, 37, has spent 19 springs and summers fighting  
fires, taking winter breaks doing concrete and carpentry work on 
the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent spring here in the Southeast and in the summer I go  
out West,'' said Brown, a Northern Arapaho. ``We just go where we 
are called. I like to see all these places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown spent part of last summer battling wildfires that swept  
through Florida for six weeks and now he is back. 
</P>
<P>
	Mac McCarthy, 23, runs a pump to supply water to firefighters. A  
Kiowa shield is painted on the side of his red truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got pretty scary last night,'' he said. ``We had to go  
through the swamp and put out some fires. There were several 
alligators, about 3 or 4 feet. I kept an eye on them.''

<HEADLINE> Stock Markets To Close Early Dec. 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major U.S. stock markets will close early on New  
Year's Eve as a precaution against any Year 2000 computer glitches, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market  
and the American Stock Exchange will end at 1 p.m. on Dec. 31. 
Traditionally, the markets only close early on two days of the 
year: the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the utmost confidence that our systems and the systems  
of those who use the markets have been remediated or will be in 
perfect shape for the millennium change,'' Richard Grasso, chairman 
of the NYSE, said Thursday. But, he added, ``I believe it's a 
prudent step'' to close early. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug could occur if computers programmed to recognize  
only the last two digits of a year assume it is 1900 instead of 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso made the comment after announcing the NYSE would not  
offer extended trading hours until the second half of 2000. Grasso 
said he didn't want to ``upset the apple cart'' by demanding more 
changes to the trading systems on top of Year 2000 efforts and 
plans to switch to stock prices to decimals from fractions.

<HEADLINE> Wrestling Star Sues WWF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Pro wrestling champion Sable is suing  
the World Wrestling Federation for $110 million, complaining it 
wanted her to participate in a lesbian storyline, expose her 
breasts on TV and appear in sexually degrading photos. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court, charges that  
professional wrestling has become increasingly ``obscene, 
titillating, vulgar and unsafe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known for her waist-length hair and scanty outfits, Sable, whose  
real name is Rena Mero, said the WWF stripped her of her 
championship belt by scripting her defeat in a televised ``Monday 
Night Raw'' match three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Her downfall, she claims, came after she repeatedly refused to  
have her gown torn off on national television, exposing her 
breasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry McDevitt, a lawyer for the WWF, said Mrs. Mero's  
allegations are absolutely untrue. ``It's the legal equivalent of a 
rabbit punch,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mero's lawsuit comes less than two weeks after the death of  
WWF wrestler Owen Hart. During a May 23 pay-per-view event, Hart 
fell more than 70 feet to his death while being lowered to the ring 
on a cable. 
</P>
<P>
	During her nearly three years with the WWF, Mrs. Mero went from  
valet for her real-life wrestling husband, Marc Mero, to the WWF 
women's champion. She recently was featured on a Playboy cover and 
in a photo spread, and has been getting guest roles on television. 
</P>
<P>
	In an upcoming TV Guide cover story, she said there is a  
difference between posing for Playboy and exposing herself in the 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the middle of a wrestling arena where they're serving  
alcohol and there are screaming fans -- including children -- in the 
front row, I don't feel like that is the proper place to be 
exposed,'' she said. ``Posing for Playboy for me was a classy and 
tasteful thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims negligence, breach of contract, unfair trade  
practices and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Put Nelson on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees put relief pitcher Jeff  
Nelson back on the disabled list Friday because of an elbow problem 
and made three other roster moves before starting a three-game 
series against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees optioned reliever Greg McCarthy to Triple-A  
Columbus, and recalled pitcher Todd Erdos and infielder Clay 
Bellinger from their top minor league affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellinger, sent down to Columbus on Tuesday, might serve as  
extra insurance for Chuck Knoblauch. The All-Star second baseman 
was forced to leave Wednesday night's game against Cleveland 
because of bruised ribs after being hit by a pitch from Jaret 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch was listed in the starting lineup for the opener of  
the interleague series against their crosstown rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson was pulled from Wednesday's game against Cleveland after  
he felt stiffness in his right elbow, and was put on the disabled 
list because of inflammation. He went on the DL on May 3 because of 
elbow inflammation and was activated May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson is 1-1 with a 5.74 ERA in 17 games. He was a valuable  
member of the World Series champions last year as a middelman, 
going 5-3 with three saves and a 3.79 ERA in 45 games. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy was claimed on waivers from Seattle on May 28. He  
reported to the Yankees three days later, but did not pitch. The 
left-hander was 0-1 with a 2.05 ERA at Triple-A Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellinger started the season with the Yankees and hit .120 in 10  
games. Sent down to the minors this week, he went 5-for-12 for 
Columbus before being recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Erdos also spent time with New York this season, albeit a brief  
stint. He was promoted from Columbus on May 20 and did not pitch 
before he was sent down the next day. The right-hander was 2-1 with 
a 5.97 ERA in 11 appearances, including six starts, in the minors.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Army Sergeant Sues CNN and Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Another U.S. Special Forces veteran has sued  
CNN and Time Inc., saying he was deceived into giving interviews 
for a story that accused U.S. commandos of using nerve gas to hunt 
down and kill defectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Hagen, a former Army Special Forces sergeant, sued CNN,  
Time Inc. and three producers as well as reporter Peter Arnett. He 
said he was told CNN producers could help him get medical treatment 
for his war-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took this brave war hero and made him look like a  
buffoon,'' said Hagen's lawyer, Kevin McLean. ``He was a hero, not 
a murderer and he has to restore his reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which does not specify a damage amount, was filed  
Thursday, a day after former Army Special Forces Lt. Robert Van 
Buskirk filed a defamation lawsuit in North Carolina seeking $100 
million in damages for the story, which was later retracted. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagen said he was never told the true nature of the story being  
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	``They asked to interview me about my medical problems and the  
problems I was having with the Veterans Administration,'' Hagen 
said. ``The whole family was ecstatic that finally we were going to 
get some help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said producers discussed his illnesses and shot footage of  
some 20 bottles of narcotic medications prescribed for him. But 
they also asked him questions about the nerve gas sarin and about 
orders for dealing with defectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagen said he told producers he knew nothing about sarin gas or  
its use. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for CNN and Time declined to comment on the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	The joint CNN-Time story telecast on June 7, 1998, claimed the  
military used sarin in Laos during Operation Tailwind, a mission to 
find defectors. Two U.S. defectors were supposedly killed in the 
attack, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was retracted after an internal investigation could  
not substantiate the allegations. Time and CNN, both owned by Time 
Warner, apologized for the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Two producers were fired and a third resigned over the story.  
Arnett, the lead reporter, was reprimanded and ultimately left the 
network.

<HEADLINE> Terrell Owens Signs With 49ers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wide receiver Terrell Owens became a San  
Francisco 49er again Friday, reportedly signing a one-year contract 
worth $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement capped lengthy negotiations among general manager  
Bill Walsh, director of football operations John McVay and Owens' 
agent, David Joseph, the San Francisco Chronicle reported in 
Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Owens is available for preseason minicamps, which  
continue next week in Santa Clara. He missed a three-day minicamp 
last month, saying he didn't want to risk injury without a 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``My agent's been in here for two weeks and has had some  
productive meetings with Walsh and McVay. They assured me that my 
(long-term) deal was almost finalized, so I told them I needed to 
get some work in,'' said Owens, 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll offer my services next week and hopefully we'll get  
something done real soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several 49ers officials did not immediately return calls by The  
Associated Press seeking comment Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	While the one-year deal was a formality, the salary was the  
required tender offer made to Owens, who was designated as the 
49ers' franchise player in February. Under the rules of the NFL's 
collective bargaining agreement, Owens was offered the average of 
the top five salaries for wide receivers for the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the 49ers not signed him to that minimum one-year tender  
offer by July 15, Owens would have been free to negotiate with 
other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's some assurance that I'll be a 49er,'' Owens said. ``This  
team is on the verge of some great things and like always we're 
trying to reach the Super Bowl. I've been close for, like, three 
years since I've been here. It would have been hard to part ways -- 
not only for me, but for the fans as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's a lot of weight off my back, and a lot of guys can  
quit asking me if I'm going to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci said that since Owens hit several career  
highs in 1998 -- 67 receptions for 1,097 yards and 14 touchdowns, 
including a 79-yard scoring catch -- he would have been a successful 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't help but think other teams (might have) made a run  
at him,'' Mariucci said. ``Physically, he's as good a receiver as 
you're going to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers' regular training camp runs July 26-August 17 in  
Stockton.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberates NYC Police Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Deliberations began today in the trial of four  
white police officers accused of depriving Haitian immigrant Abner 
Louima of his civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, both sides had agreed on one point:  
Officer Justin Volpe -- who pleaded guilty last week -- committed a 
heinous crime. Now the Brooklyn jury must decide if he acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let these defendants push us back to the day when police  
officers could beat people with impunity, and arrest people for no 
reason and lie about it to cover it up,'' prosecutor Loretta Lynch 
told jurors in her closing argument Thursday -- nine days after 
Volpe interrupted the trial to plead guilty to torturing Louima in 
a precinct bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, defense attorney Stephen Worth sought to keep the focus  
on Volpe by arguing that the case was solely about the former 
officer, whom he described as sick and depraved. 
</P>
<P>
	Worth's client, Officer Charles Schwarz, is charged with holding  
down Louima on the filthy floor of the bathroom while an enraged 
Volpe rammed a broken broom stick up the handcuffed prisoner's 
rectum, and threatened to kill him if he told anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe confessed he attacked Louima because he thought --  
mistakenly -- that he had punched him in a melee outside a 
nightclub. He said another officer he didn't identify was in the 
bathroom; Schwarz claims he wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz, 33, along with Thomas Wiese, 35, and Thomas Bruder, 33,  
also is charged with joining Volpe in beating Louima in a patrol 
car en route to the 70th Precinct stationhouse on Aug. 9, 1997. A 
fourth defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, 37, allegedly made false 
reports to cover up the assault on Louima and another Haitian man, 
Patrick Antoine.

<HEADLINE> Rivlin Resigns As No. 2 Fed Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The unexpected resignation of Federal Reserve  
Vice Chairman Alice Rivlin gives President Clinton two vacancies to 
fill at the nation's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	And some private economists believe Rivlin's departure increases  
the likelihood that Alan Greenspan will be asked by Clinton next 
year to stay on as Fed chairman for a fourth four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin, 68, announced Thursday that she would leave the Fed on  
July 16 in order to devote more time to her second job as chairman 
of the District of Columbia's financial control board, a post that 
Clinton appointed her to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am definitely not resigning as chair of the D.C. Financial  
Assistance Authority,'' Rivlin said in her resignation letter to 
Clinton. ``Indeed, I hope to spend more time and to be more 
effectively involved in the city than I have been able to be at the 
Fed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The control board was created by Congress in 1995 at a time when  
the District was on the brink of financial insolvency during the 
administration of former Mayor Marion Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years the city has regained its financial footing, and  
both Congress and the control board have relaxed their day-to-day 
supervision of local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement, Clinton praised Rivlin for ``helping  
usher in a new era of budget surpluses'' during her time as head of 
the administration's budget office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Anthony Williams said he looked forward to working with  
Rivlin ``to solidify our financial recovery and bring democracy to 
our nation's capital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin's departure means there will be two vacancies on the  
seven-member Fed board of governors. The administration has 
indicated that Carol J. Parry, an executive vice president of Chase 
Manhattan Bank, the country's third largest bank, is the 
front-runner for a vacancy that has existed since last June when 
Susan Phillips left the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Some private economists viewed the departure of the No. 2 Fed  
official as making it even more likely that Clinton will decide to 
re-nominate Greenspan when his current term expires in June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This increases the likelihood that Greenspan will stay on,''  
said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New 
York. Jones said that in his last year in office, Clinton will have 
trouble persuading the Republican-controlled Senate to accept 
anyone other than Greenspan for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan was first nominated for the Fed chairmanship by  
President Reagan in 1987 and has been re-appointed by Presidents 
Bush and Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the departure of Rivlin should have little effect  
on the Fed's interest rate decisions, given Greenspan's mastery at 
gaining consensus on the board for his policy moves. The Fed 
announced last month that it had changed its policy stance and is 
now leaning toward raising interest rates because of growing 
concerns about inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin said she would not participate in the Fed's next interest  
rate-setting meeting on June 29-30. Some analysts believe a rate 
hike could come at that time but others are not sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loss of her vote will have only a marginal impact on the  
next meeting and we still expect no increase in the interest rate 
target coming out of the June meeting,'' said Gary Thayer, chief 
economist for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin, who served as first the deputy and then the head of  
Clinton's Office of Management and Budget, was nominated by the 
president for the Fed post in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	She was seen as a deficit hawk inside the administration,  
helping push Clinton toward a more aggressive approach to reducing 
the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an enormous privilege to be part of the Clinton  
economic team and help put together the policies that turned that 
huge budget deficit into a surplus,'' Rivlin said in her letter to 
Clinton. ``We did the right thing and it worked!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin announced that in addition to devoting more time to her  
duties as chair of the control board, she will also return to the 
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.

<HEADLINE> GOP Consultant Predicts Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forget the polls and focus groups.  
</P>
<P>
	Republican consultant Ed Gillespie, working for GOP presidential  
hopeful John Kasich, says he can predict how Americans will vote in 
the 2000 presidential election. It's all in the name, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	His tongue-in-cheek assessment:  
</P>
<P>
	If your name begins with ``mayor,'' ``congressman'' or  
``governor'' you're with front-runner George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	If it begins with Ms., you're with Elizabeth Dole.  
</P>
<P>
	If it begins with ``reverend'' you're with religious activist  
Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	If your names ends with a Roman numeral, you're with millionaire  
Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	If it ends with a vowel, you're with Kasich -- a product of an  
ethnic Pennsylvania town. 
</P>
<P>
	If it ends with USN retired, you're with former Navy pilot John  
McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	If your name is spelled just like it sounds, you're with  
weak-spelling Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	If you've changed it, you're with Lamar (Lamar!) Alexander.  
</P>
<P>
	If you can trace it back to the American revolution, you're with  
Pat Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	If your name is Smith, you're with Sen. Bob Smith of New  
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Democrats, if your name ends with .com, you're with  
Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	And if it begins with ``Dr.'' and ends with ``J.,'' you're with  
Hall of Fame basketball player Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Gillespie: ``The essence to campaigning is to increase your  
name identification. This is a guidebook for the entire field.''

<HEADLINE> Army-Navy Game May Move to Baltimore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Army-Navy football game, will be played in  
Baltimore next year, The (Baltimore) Sun reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Naval Academy is expected to announce today that the game  
will be played on Dec. 2, 2000, at PSINet Stadium, home of the 
Baltimore Ravens, the newspaper said, quoting anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	That will mark the third time the game has been held in  
Baltimore, the first since 1944, the newspaper said. The 2000 game 
will be the 100th time the two teams square off. 
</P>
<P>
	For 50 of the past 54 years, the game has been play in  
Philadelphia, about midway between Annapolis, home of the U.S. 
Naval Academy, and West Point, N.Y., home of the Army counterpart. 
Philadelphia first hosted the game in 1899 and has done so 74 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	It also has been played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and Giants  
Stadium in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the railing gave way at Veterans Stadium under  
pressure from cadets, injuring nine and raising questions about 
safety in the aging facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Army and Navy have a contract to play at Veterans Stadium  
until 2002, an option in the contract will allow the game to be 
played elsewhere once more, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BAVINGTON, Pa. (AP) -- The bodies of two missing college students  
were found in a wooded area Friday, and police believe they were 
kidnapped during a burglary, robbed and shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the bodies were found, three people were charged with the  
robbery-related crimes. Police said two were suspected in the 
students' deaths. No charges were filed because police were holding 
out hope the victims were still alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and 100 volunteers including troopers on horseback picked  
through briar patches, waist-high grass and swamps along 11 miles 
of highway here for three days before finding the bodies of Aaron 
Land, 20, and Brian Muha, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were students at Franciscan University in Steubenville,  
Ohio, 15 miles west of here and a short distance from the 
Pennsylvania-West Virginia line. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday morning, Ohio authorities charged Terrell Rhaim  
Yarbrough, 18, of Pittsburgh and Nathan D. Herring, 18, of 
Steubenville, Ohio, with kidnapping, burglary and robbery. Both 
were being held on more than $2 million bond. 
</P>
<P>
	A third suspect, 16-year-old Brandon Young of Steubenville,  
Ohio, was charged in juvenile court with receiving stolen property. 
He was held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials will seek capital murder charges from a grand jury,  
mostly likely in Ohio, even though the victims were shot in 
southwestern Pennsylvania, said Stephen Stern, a prosecutor in 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe Land and Muha were kidnapped Monday from their  
apartment during a burglary, robbed and shot to death.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST ALLIS, Wis. (AP) -- CART will require tethers on the rear  
wheels of its Champ cars before the July 25 U.S. 500 at Michigan 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made Friday at the Milwaukee Mile, where  
practice began for Sunday's Miller Lite 225. 
</P>
<P>
	The tethers, called wheel energy absorbing restraints by CART,  
are attached to the chassis, keeping the wheel and broken 
suspensions from flying off during a heavy crash. 
</P>
<P>
	CART has required the devices on the front wheels since the  
Motorola 300 last Saturday in Madison, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	They were added in response to an accident May 1 at an Indy  
Racing League event in Concord, N.C. A wheel and suspension pieces 
flew into the stands, killing three fans and injuring eight others. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also at the U.S. 500 last July when a wheel and  
suspension pieces also killed three spectators and injured six 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL added the tethers -- made of a high-tech material -- to  
all four tires before last Sunday's Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	At Indy, the tethers worked in all but one case, with one rear  
tire rolling harmlessly away after Mark Dismore hit the wall. 
Several crashes produced no loose tires at the CART race. 
</P>
<P>
	Formula One adopted a tether system before the 1999 season and  
there have been no injuries outside the cars in any crash so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Anderson, team manager for the Target-Chip Ganassi Racing  
team, which has won the last three CART championships and is 
leading the current points, said the CART teams began by tethering 
the front tires because there was not enough material immediately 
available to do all four. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. 500 is the next oval race on the CART schedule.  
</P>
<P>
	In other CART safety moves, the pit speed limit has been reduced  
from 60 mph -- with a 5 mph leeway -- to a maximum of 50 for all CART 
events, and all crew members who go over the wall to service cars 
will be required to wear helmets, beginning with the June 27 road 
race in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TRACK DOWN:* Chip Ganassi, who will promote the inaugural  
Target Grand Prix on Aug. 22 at the new Chicago Motor Speedway, 
said Friday the first layer of asphalt has been laid for the 
1.1-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Montoya, who drives for Ganassi's CART team and is the  
series points leader, drove a Champ car on the unfinished track 
Thursday, ``just to check it out for bumps and make sure the 
transitions work and there are no dips or valleys out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lap record right now is 26.1 seconds,'' he added with a  
grin. That translates to 151.72 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganassi said the final layer of asphalt will be poured next  
week, with the official opening of the new track some time in July. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *INTERNATIONAL CAST:* Heading into Sunday's race, each of the  
top six drivers in the CART series is from a different country. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya is from Colombia, with runner-up Dario Franchitti from  
Scotland. Third place belongs to Michael Andretti of the United 
States, followed by Greg Moore of Canada and Christian Fittipaldi 
of Brazil, tied for fourth, and Adrian Fernandez of Mexico.

<HEADLINE> FBI Raids Don King's Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Federal agents raided the offices  
of boxing promoter Don King on Friday as part of an investigation 
into whether the IBF sold rankings and arranged fights for 
kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents entered the offices of Don King Productions with  
empty boxes. A boxing industry source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, told The Associated Press they were looking for records 
involving the International Boxing Federation, Don King Productions 
and Monarch Productions, a company run by King's son, Carl. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Newark, N.J., has been investigating the  
International Boxing Federation for several months -- even before 
the disputed draw in March between Evander Holyfield and Lennox 
Lewis, which prompted New York law enforcement agencies to start 
their own investigations of the IBF. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI would not confirm the raid at King's office in Deerfield  
Beach, about 40 miles north of Miami, was linked to the IBF 
investigation or if the search would be completed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can tell you is we are serving search  
warrants on his offices as part of an ongoing investigation,'' FBI 
spokesman Mike Faregas said. 
</P>
<P>
	King spokesman Greg Fritz did not immediately return a call for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for IBF president Bob Lee Sr., said Friday he knew  
nothing about the FBI raid and refused to say what he knew about 
King's possible involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 18, the Los Angeles Times quoted boxing promoters and  
managers as saying the sport's sanctioning bodies sometimes sell 
the rankings that lead to more lucrative bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported that witnesses have testified before the  
federal grand jury in New Jersey that some payments to the 
sanctioning bodies were made in cash, but that others were less 
obvious, such as those contained in overpayments of standard fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, HBO president Lou DiBella denied King's  
assertion that a rematch was set between Evander Holyfield and 
Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	And sources close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said one of the stumbling blocks was the possibility 
King could be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	DiBella said there were ``some problematic issues that need to  
be worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HBO has insisted King step aside as the fight promoter if he  
were to be indicted on charges stemming from a number of 
investigations, sources close to the negotiations told the AP. So 
far, King has refused such a clause in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Newark, federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all  
IBF records since 1982 on rankings and contracts for fights, as 
well as checks, invoices, expense forms and telephone records, its 
attorney has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors, citing grand jury secrecy, will not  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Krovatin, the lawyer for Lee, said he does not want to  
give ``any sort of credibility'' to rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boxing itself seems to be a sport that is awash in rumors and  
innuendo and false allegations and rivalries and jealousies and 
paybacks and those sorts of things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF and two other sanctioning groups -- the World Boxing  
Association and World Boxing Council -- set rules and rankings that 
play a large role in determining bouts. Boxers who defy the groups 
risk losing the chance to be declared a champion and earn large 
purses.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Extradition Hearing Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Spain's request to have former Chilean dictator  
Gen. Augusto Pinochet extradited for human rights abuses allegedly 
committed during his 17-year rule will be heard on Sept. 27, a 
magistrate ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a blow to Spanish investigators, judge Graham Parkinson said  
the charges against the 83-year-old Pinochet must be finalized by 
Aug. 31, in the interests of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the extradition proceedings are concerned, I take  
the view that we need to know the exact boundaries of this 
application,'' Parkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Brian Gibbins had argued that more time was needed to  
define the charges, saying it would be ``quite wrong of this 
court'' to impose limits on the Spanish investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an investigation that is continuing and the examining  
judge is continuing to question witnesses on a regular basis,'' 
Gibbins said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Julian Knowles, one of Pinochet's lawyers, asked the court  
to ``bring down the guillotine'' on the matter so that the defense 
would know exactly what case it needed to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said Pinochet's lawyers would have until Sept. 14 to  
submit questions about the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The full extradition hearing at the Bow Street Magistrate's  
Court is expected to last up to five days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London at the request of  
Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon, who wants to try the former 
Chilean leader for human rights abuses allegedly committed at the 
hands of his security forces during his 1973-90 regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, aspects of the case have been considered and  
reconsidered in the High Court and the House of Lords, Britain's 
highest court of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The law lords issued a ruling in March that dramatically limited  
the scope of the Spanish case against Pinochet, who remains under 
24-hour guard at a rented mansion southwest of London. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges ruled Pinochet could face charges of torture and  
torture conspiracy dating only after December 1988, when Britain 
ratified the International Convention Against Torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Secretary Jack Straw, the Cabinet minister who decides  
whether to pass extradition requests onto the British courts, ruled 
the next month that the remaining charges were sufficiently serious 
to allow the extradition process to carry on. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the High Court denied Pinochet permission to  
challenge Spain's extradition request. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people disappeared or were  
killed at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after he ousted 
Chile's elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende, in a bloody 
coup.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Plans 'Reinvigorating' Retreat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Concerned that the Security Council has  
been deadlocked for months on pressing world issues, 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan is taking action: He's bringing the 15 
council ambassadors to New Jersey for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day retreat at a lakeside conference center in Princeton  
will attempt to ``reinvigorate'' the work of the council and find 
new opportunities for action and agreement, U.N. spokesman Fred 
Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's rather nice sometimes to talk with ties off,''  
said British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock. 
</P>
<P>
	The retreat was to begin late Friday with addresses by David A.  
Hamberg, president of the Carnegie Corporation, a New York-based 
grant and research organization, and Samuel Huntington, professor 
of government at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamberg co-authored ``Preventing Deadly Conflicts,'' a 1997  
report by a special commission funded by Carnegie on the causes of 
conflicts and ways to prevent them that has become almost required 
reading at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington is best known for his 1996 book ``The Clash of  
Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order,'' which makes a case 
for nonintervention by the West in world conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Annan and the diplomats will enter into discussions  
on the role of the United Nations and the Security Council, and 
possible changes in both what the council does and how it does it. 
</P>
<P>
	Greater transparency in the council's work and more effective  
ways of enforcing its decisions, such as ``smart sanctions'' that 
spare innocent populations, will be among the ideas discussed, 
diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will give all the members of the council a chance  
to reflect, to reflect among themselves and away from the daily 
chores, the phone calls, and discuss how the council can be made 
more effective,'' Annan said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The council soon will have to reassert itself as it takes on a  
Kosovo peace plan, which was accepted Thursday by Yugoslavia. The 
council was marginalized during the conflict because of clashes 
among the permanent council members. 
</P>
<P>
	The council has also been unable to come up with a new policy  
toward Iraq. France, Russia and China are advocating a suspension 
of sanctions but the United States and Britain say they must remain 
until inspectors report Iraq is free of banned weapons.

<HEADLINE>  NTSB: Jet's Wing Flaps Didn't Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Wind-resisting wing panels used to slow  
down landing jetliners were not opened as American Airlines Flight 
1420 hurtled down a runway and crashed, killing nine people, 
federal investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	During a typical landing, the spoilers -- movable panels on the  
top of the wing -- are opened and thrust reversers are engaged to 
cut a plane's speed. 
</P>
<P>
	But information from the aircraft's flight data recorder shows  
that the spoilers did not deploy Tuesday night and that the thrust 
reversers turned off and on, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is whether the irregularities were due to  
mechanical problems or were the result of choices by the pilot, who 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be that the only person who knows the answer to that  
question is no longer with us,'' George Black of the National 
Transportation Safety Board said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said it is possible to land a plane without spoilers,  
adding he himself was once in a plane that safely landed with the 
spoilers closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The MD-82 jetliner landed as a thunderstorm raked Little Rock  
National Airport with hail, lightning and wind gusts of 75 mph. The 
plane skidded off the end of the runway, plunged over a stone 
embankment and was ripped open as it hit a metal walkway. The jet 
broke into three parts and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB staff members planned to escort victims' relatives to the  
site later today so they can see it for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the pilot was warned twice about dangerous  
wind shears and received more notice than usual of bad conditions 
as he brought the plane in for the landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were to interview the injured co-pilot today, and  
salvage crews were to begin removing parts of the plane for more 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
	The airplane was traveling at 165 mph when it landed, according  
to the data recorder, which included 27 to 28 seconds of 
information after the touchdown and 62 previous hours of data, 
Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most interesting finding from the recorder was the repeated  
cycling of the thrust reversers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a routine landing, jet engines are reversed until the plane  
is slowed to a reasonable speed. In this case, the data recorder 
showed that the thrust reversers cycled on and off twice. Then, 
eight seconds before the end of the recording while the engine was 
near idling, the left thrust reverser engaged but the right did 
not, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are facts. There has been no analysis done on this,''  
Black said. ``This is not a time to speculate on this data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spoiler system is customarily armed before landing so that  
the panels automatically pop up when the wheels touch the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines recently instituted a policy under which both  
the pilot and the co-pilot have to confirm that the spoiler lever 
has been put in the armed position. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet had been directed to land from the north because the  
airport was reporting southerly winds as the plane neared. But as 
the fierce storm moved in from the northwest, the pilot was instead 
ordered to approach from the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the cockpit voice recorder, a pilot commented twice  
that he had lost visual contact with the runway and noted that 
winds were at 35 mph with gusts up to 52 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	During the approach, air traffic controllers relayed regular  
updates, including word of winds up to 46 mph and two alarms for 
wind shears -- sudden down bursts that can rob a plane of its lift, 
Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of care, we think, by the controller was pretty  
good,'' Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black declined to say how a pilot should react given such  
information, stressing it is the pilot's call about whether to land 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Buschmann was an experienced pilot whom colleagues  
described as unlikely to take risks. He had been on the job for 13 1/2 
hours before the crash -- within the airline's maximum of 14 hours -- 
flying from Chicago to Salt Lake City and Dallas before Little 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators want to know whether the pilot's decision to land  
was influenced by a desire to end the long day and get the plane to 
its intended airport for the night to prevent delays the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane had about 2,400 gallons of fuel, enough to make it to  
Dallas or Nashville, Tenn., Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests Thursday also showed that the rain-slickened runway had  
proper grooves to prevent hydroplaning, and the tires and a brake 
were in good condition. According to skid marks, the plane touched 
down 2,000 feet from the start of the 7,200-foot runway, which 
Black said was about the proper place to begin a landing. 
</P>
<P>
	One passenger, Dave Ozmun, said the plane never seemed to get  
traction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could tell he was trying to work the brakes,'' he said.  
``Once we even left the runway, he was continuing to try to reverse 
the plane and try to protect the passengers as best he could. It 
was just impossible.'' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Oscar-winning expert responsible for the  
spectacular special effects in ``Titanic'' and the ``Star Wars'' 
films has gotten his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors George Lucas and James Cameron were on hand Thursday  
as special effects master Dennis Muren was honored. Muren has won 
nine Academy Awards -- eight for visual effects and one for 
technical achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not only honoring a great filmmaker, but we honor  
special effects as a true art form,'' said Lucas, director of the 
``Star Wars'' series. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred co-workers and fans saw Muren get star No. 2,137  
on Hollywood Boulevard. He's the first special effects expert to 
receive a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``This star is not just for me but for all the old special  
effects guys,'' Muren said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Tells Insurer To Halt Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese financial authorities ordered a life  
insurance firm to cease key business operations today after company 
auditors found it had effectively become insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent failure of Toho Mutual Life Insurance Co. comes as  
only the second collapse of a Japanese life insurer since World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency said an administrator will  
be appointed to oversee Toho Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, it instructed the insurer to stop lending and paying  
dividends and to accept more policy cancellations. Toho can 
continue to receive premiums and make non-dividend payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes about a year after GE Capital Services, a unit of  
General Electric Co., formed a joint venture which took over all 
new business from Toho along with its headquarters building in 
Tokyo and most of its sales staff. 
</P>
<P>
	But Toho continued as an independent entity responsible for  
overseeing existing policyholders' contracts and investment assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Toho said in a statement Friday that company auditors had  
determined that its liabilities effectively exceeded assets by 
$1.64 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was unable to cope with bad loans and losses related  
to securities and foreign exchange holdings, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, more and more clients have been canceling their  
policies since Toho posted its first-ever loss since World War II 
in the fiscal year that ended in March 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Toho's policyholders will be protected by a life insurance  
industry fund and will receive full payment on their policies 
through March 2001, the Financial Supervisory Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1997 the Japanese Finance Ministry ordered ailing  
Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co. to shut down, the first time in 50 
years that financial regulators forced an insurer to close.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Plans Exploratory Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking a big step toward a political race,  
Hillary Rodham Clinton said today she will form an exploratory 
committee in July to prepare for a possible campaign for a Senate 
seat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to open an exploratory committee in July,'' she  
said. ``And then I'll spend some time -- a lot of time -- in New York 
listening to people and I'm looking forward to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady made her comments in an interview on ABC's ``Good  
Morning America.'' Her statement confirmed what her top political 
adviser had said Thursday, that she would form an exploratory 
committee next month for the seat being vacated next year by 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. No first lady has ever run for 
public office. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's running for office. She's running,'' said James  
Carville, the political mastermind of Bill Clinton's 1992 
presidential victory. Carville, who met with Mrs. Clinton at the 
White House on Thursday, offered to help with her campaign but said 
he would not have an official staff role. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exploratory committee decision made, Mrs. Clinton must  
next ``start thinking about a timetable, thinking about people, 
putting a staff together. There's a gazillion things you have to 
do,'' Carville said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a race that could pit her against the Republican mayor of  
New York City, Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think exploring New York is a good thing,'' Giuliani said  
following a speech in Michigan, stressing that the first lady has 
never lived in New York. ``Maybe she should explore New York a 
little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I should say though, I have supreme confidence that the next  
senator from New York will be someone from the state of New York,'' 
the mayor added. 
</P>
<P>
	Formation of an exploratory committee will allow Mrs. Clinton to  
begin raising money for the race. That means she could begin paying 
for some of her travel to New York, for polling and other 
campaign-type expenses. She already has come under fire for making 
campaign-style trips to New York as first lady, and thus at 
taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Formation of such a committee will be seen in political circles  
as tantamount to a declaration of candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Ickes, who is heading up Mrs. Clinton's political  
operation, disclosed the exploratory committee plans after Rep. 
Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., called the first lady to tell her she would 
seek re-election to the House, leaving the Senate Democratic field 
open for Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her it seemed clear she was running. ... I wished her  
well,'' Lowey said. ``I told her I would support her 
enthusiastically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton issued a statement that said: ``Today Nita Lowey  
called me to say that she would be running for re-election to the 
House. I thank Nita for her support and I look forward to working 
with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also met Thursday with political consultant James  
Carville. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether they discussed the New York Senate race, the first  
lady's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said, ``They both have a love of 
politics, so it wouldn't surprise me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes, a former White House chief of staff to President Clinton,  
said Mrs. Clinton did not go into detail about her own political 
plans during the conversation with Lowey. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ickes added: ``I think you can discern that Hillary is going  
to press forward and she will be forming an exploratory committee 
in early July and just keep moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cautioned that formation of the committee did not necessarily  
mean Mrs. Clinton would seek the seat. ``This is one step at a 
time,'' Ickes said. ``The initial step forward is to form the 
exploratory committee and continue to talk to the people of New 
York.''

<HEADLINE> Funds? Don't Get 'Em While Hot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't get 'em while they're hot.  
</P>
<P>
	That's a thought to bear in mind when you go shopping for a  
mutual fund. News reports are filled these days with talk of ``hot 
funds'' -- the names that have been burning up the performance 
charts or just got a top rating from the research services. 
</P>
<P>
	But if you are seeking a long-term investment to pursue  
long-term goals, which is the mission that funds are best suited 
for, hot may be the last thing you want. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, you need to make sure you don't flame out before you  
reach your goal. Aesop's fable of the hare and the tortoise comes 
to mind, with its simple moral ``slow but steady wins the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experience shows that in the up-and-down world of the investment  
markets, the funds that look the hottest at any given time may be 
the ones in greatest danger of going stone cold. 
</P>
<P>
	In a few weeks from mid-April to late May, Internet and other  
high-technology stock funds demonstrated this principle in vivid 
style. Almost as fast as you could say ``log off!'', Dow Jones's 
index of Internet stocks plunged 32 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The tech tumble is by no means the only recent story of that  
kind. If you look back to 1997, you may recall that financial 
services funds and real estate funds were racking up some of the 
best performance numbers in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Then both turned in dismal showings in 1998. An average of  
financial services funds tracked by Lipper Inc. rose just 6.86 
percent, trailing the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 by more than 21 
percentage points. Real estate funds LOST more than 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the health and biotechnology group, a consistent  
winner in recent years until 1999. From Jan. 1 through mid-May this 
year, the Lipper health and biotech fund average lost 1.59 percent 
while many funds were posting double-digit gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too often, investors forget history,'' says the research firm  
of Wiesenberger in its monthly Mutual Funds Update. ``Many 
concentrate on the hot fund being touted for that month. However, 
last year's winner may be this year's loser and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to time the market and pick this year's or this month's  
investment-category darling does not pay off, but instead leads to 
high transaction costs and lost opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that's the case, how do you decide where to put your money?  
It's as much an art as a science, but most advisers agree that the 
best approach starts from a careful calculation of what you want to 
accomplish, rather than whatever message the markets seem to be 
transmitting at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Need long-term growth to cover tuition costs for your children  
and build a nest egg for your old age? Then consider a mixture of 
funds that stands a chance of staying on track as market moods keep 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with big bills coming due in the next year or two for  
something like college or a new home? Then minimize stock-market 
risk in your portfolio, regardless of whatever the market seems to 
be doing right now. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the time, risks can't be eliminated. But they can be  
managed by staying diversified, using bond or money-market funds to 
protect against the chance of a bear market in stocks, and 
different types of stock funds as a cushion against the modern 
phenomenon known as ``market rotation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April this year, large growth stocks suddenly lost favor, and  
value stocks just as abruptly became popular, in what Robert Pozen, 
chief executive at Fidelity Management in Boston, called ``one of 
the sharpest rotations that we've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to ride tides, rather than chasing waves -- to avoid  
the kind of day-trading mentality that has received so much 
attention of late. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very concerned about the impression some people have about  
day-trading,'' says Michelle Smith, managing director of the Mutual 
Fund Education Alliance, a Kansas City-based trade group of no-load 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that troubles me the most is the feeling that this  
is a game, that there is no risk. People get stars in their eyes.''

<HEADLINE> Boston's Portugal Won't Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston pitcher Mark Portugal, who strongly  
considered retirement so he could spend more time with his three 
children, decided Friday to remain with the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been my life for the last 18 1/2 years. It's given me  
everything I have,'' he said. ``You don't know how long you'll play 
this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal, 36, made his decision as he was driving to Fenway Park  
for Friday night's game against the Atlanta Braves. But when he 
arrived at the Red Sox clubhouse ``I was flip-flopping again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he talked to manager Jimy Williams.  
</P>
<P>
	``One of the questions I asked Jimy is if he wants me on his  
team. He said, `most definitely.' That was reassuring,'' Portugal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal is 3-3 with a 5.33 ERA in 10 starts and will be used as  
a reliever for now. He said that was fine with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darn right we want him back on this team. He can help us,''  
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Rapp will take Portugal's place in the starting rotation on  
Sunday against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last outing, Portugal allowed six runs and lasted three  
innings in Monday's 8-7 win over the Detroit Tigers. He left the 
ballpark in a hurry without talking to reporters. He said he 
apologized to teammates and Williams about his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ``angry, upset and confused'' at the time and, after  
talking with his agent, team officials and others since then, 
decided to remain active, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal was married 11 years before going through a divorce  
last season, when he went 10-5 with Philadelphia. His three 
children are Derek, 10, Jacob, 6, and Alexandra, 3. 
</P>
<P>
	His children live in nearby Barrington, R.I., one of the main  
reasons he signed with Boston as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came back here to spend more time with my children, but with  
the night games and the road schedule, at times it feels like I've 
been a Saturday afternoon father on homestands,'' Portugal said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason he decided to stay active was the pleasure his  
children get from seeing him play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came back because I love to play baseball and my kids love  
to see me play baseball,'' Portugal said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his ex-wife ``never acted in a malicious way'' and told  
him and their children that ``any time I can get away to see them, 
they're mine. When the kids get out of school in a couple of weeks 
I'm sure it'll be a lot easier to deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox have made some recommendations for him to deal with  
his problems and he's ``talking to people now,'' Portugal said. 
``I'll continue to talk to people through the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal first came to the majors in 1985 with Minnesota and  
played with Houston, San Francisco and Cincinnati before joining 
Philadelphia in 1997. His career record entering this season was 
102-83 with a 3.89 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a $2.7 million, one-year contract with the Red Sox, a  
deal that gives Boston a $3.3 million option with a $300,000 buyout 
for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal said there have been times this season when ``I was  
literally not in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Monday was one of those games,'' he said. ``I can't go out  
there and pitch like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had indicated to teammates this week that he was leaning  
toward retirement and still hadn't made a decision after meeting 
with general manager Dan Duquette and Williams on Thursday at 
Pawtucket, R.I., where the Red Sox played an exhibition game 
against their International League affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to go home and think about this from a father's  
perspective and from a baseball player's perspective,'' he said. 
``We all have problems and bad days at our job where we just want 
to toss it out the window. And sometimes we don't get a second 
chance to do what we love to do. It's been rough seas, but we've 
weathered the storm now.''

<HEADLINE>  NTSB: Jet's Wing Flaps Didn't Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Wind-resisting wing panels used to slow  
down landing jetliners were not opened as American Airlines Flight 
1420 hurtled down a runway and crashed, killing nine people, 
federal investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	During a typical landing, the spoilers -- movable panels on the  
top of the wing -- are opened and thrust reversers are engaged to 
cut a plane's speed. 
</P>
<P>
	But information from the aircraft's flight data recorder shows  
that the spoilers did not deploy Tuesday night and that the thrust 
reversers turned off and on, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is whether the irregularities were due to  
mechanical problems or were the result of choices by the pilot, who 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be that the only person who knows the answer to that  
question is no longer with us,'' George Black of the National 
Transportation Safety Board said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said it is possible to land a plane without spoilers,  
adding he himself was once in a plane that safely landed with the 
spoilers closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The MD-82 jetliner landed as a thunderstorm raked Little Rock  
National Airport with hail, lightning and wind gusts of 75 mph. The 
plane skidded off the end of the runway, plunged over a stone 
embankment and was ripped open as it hit a metal walkway. The jet 
broke into three parts and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB staff members planned to escort victims' relatives to the  
site later today so they can see it for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the pilot was warned twice about dangerous  
wind shears and received more notice than usual of bad conditions 
as he brought the plane in for the landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were to interview the injured co-pilot today, and  
salvage crews were to begin removing parts of the plane for more 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
	The airplane was traveling at 165 mph when it landed, according  
to the data recorder, which included 27 to 28 seconds of 
information after the touchdown and 62 previous hours of data, 
Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most interesting finding from the recorder was the repeated  
cycling of the thrust reversers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a routine landing, jet engines are reversed until the plane  
is slowed to a reasonable speed. In this case, the data recorder 
showed that the thrust reversers cycled on and off twice. Then, 
eight seconds before the end of the recording while the engine was 
near idling, the left thrust reverser engaged but the right did 
not, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are facts. There has been no analysis done on this,''  
Black said. ``This is not a time to speculate on this data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spoiler system is customarily armed before landing so that  
the panels automatically pop up when the wheels touch the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines recently instituted a policy under which both  
the pilot and the co-pilot have to confirm that the spoiler lever 
has been put in the armed position. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet had been directed to land from the north because the  
airport was reporting southerly winds as the plane neared. But as 
the fierce storm moved in from the northwest, the pilot was instead 
ordered to approach from the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the cockpit voice recorder, a pilot commented twice  
that he had lost visual contact with the runway and noted that 
winds were at 35 mph with gusts up to 52 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	During the approach, air traffic controllers relayed regular  
updates, including word of winds up to 46 mph and two alarms for 
wind shears -- sudden down bursts that can rob a plane of its lift, 
Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of care, we think, by the controller was pretty  
good,'' Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black declined to say how a pilot should react given such  
information, stressing it is the pilot's call about whether to land 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Buschmann was an experienced pilot whom colleagues  
described as unlikely to take risks. He had been on the job for 13 1/2 
hours before the crash -- within the airline's maximum of 14 hours -- 
flying from Chicago to Salt Lake City and Dallas before Little 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators want to know whether the pilot's decision to land  
was influenced by a desire to end the long day and get the plane to 
its intended airport for the night to prevent delays the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane had about 2,400 gallons of fuel, enough to make it to  
Dallas or Nashville, Tenn., Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests Thursday also showed that the rain-slickened runway had  
proper grooves to prevent hydroplaning, and the tires and a brake 
were in good condition. According to skid marks, the plane touched 
down 2,000 feet from the start of the 7,200-foot runway, which 
Black said was about the proper place to begin a landing. 
</P>
<P>
	One passenger, Dave Ozmun, said the plane never seemed to get  
traction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could tell he was trying to work the brakes,'' he said.  
``Once we even left the runway, he was continuing to try to reverse 
the plane and try to protect the passengers as best he could. It 
was just impossible.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up, Japanese Stocks Mixed / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged up against the yen today and the  
euro continued to draw investors's attention in Asian trading. 
Tokyo share prices were mixed in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.62 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.08  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but lower than its late New York 
level of 121.66 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 73.25  
points, or 0.45 percent, closing at 16,300.75 points. On Thursday, 
the index shed 190.49 points, or 1.16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved narrowly against the yen  
and the euro continued its slide on pessimism on Europe's economy 
and the possibility of peace in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro hit a record low against the dollar early in the Asian  
session today on aggressive selling by overseas funds, falling to 
$1.0270. It later settled into a range around $1.0300. In Tokyo 
trading, the euro was quoted at 125.29 yen, down from 125.95 yen 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overseas funds heavily sold the euro on the view that European  
economic fundamentals will remain poor,'' said a dealer at a 
European bank who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 121.44 yen and 121.75 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Nikkei average gained some ground on selective  
buying, but the market as a whole was mixed at the end of the day's 
trading. The market lacked fresh market-moving news, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players are waiting for incentives to trade shares,'' said  
Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders still hope that the government will map out additional  
steps to buoy Japan's economy, in its worst recession since World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 369  
million shares, compared with Thursday's turnover of 359 million. 
Advancers outnumbered decliners 636 to 528, with 124 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section edged down 1.16 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,316.53. 
The TOPIX finished down 9.08 points, or 0.68 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.6400 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6050 
percent, driving its price down to 97.93 yen from 98.23 yen.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Defends Best-Sellers Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Internet bookseller Amazon.com has asked a  
federal court to declare that it can continue to cite The New York 
Times' best-seller list in advertising discount prices, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com announced May 17 that it would offer 50 percent  
discounts on books on the Times' best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement today, Amazon.com said the Times demanded May 28  
in a letter that Amazon.com stop using the list for promotions, 
saying Amazon was infringing on the newspaper's copyright and 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com said it filed a request late Thursday in U.S.  
District Court here asking for declaratory relief that would allow 
it to continue to refer to the Times best-seller lists in promoting 
its discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The New York Times best-seller list is widely used in the  
book-selling industry as an indicator of the most popular books 
being bought nationwide,'' Amazon.com's release said. ``Book 
buyers, therefore, can easily use the list to make price 
comparisons on the best-selling books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com spokesman Bill Curry said the company's argument is  
that citing the Times' best-seller lists is ``fair use -- that it's 
data that is out there and it is fair use to say that something is 
a New York Times best seller in the same way you would say a movie 
won an academy award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com filed its court action as a last resort after  
discussions with the Times failed to reach an agreement, Curry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Amazon.com announced the discounts last month, it was  
quickly matched by the Internet booksellers Barnesandnoble.com of 
New York, and Borders.com of Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Fahle, a spokesman for Borders.com, said a letter asking  
his company to stop referring to the Times' best-seller list ``was 
faxed to us late last night. It's dated June 4. I'm assuming it's a 
letter similar to the one Amazon.com received.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fahle said the letter was from the Times legal department. ``We  
haven't decided what to do at this point,'' Fahle said. He said the 
company continues to refer to the Times' best-seller list online 
``just as we've done for years in our stores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Boyd, a spokesman for barnesandnoble.com, said his company  
had not gotten a similar letter. He said nytimes.com is an 
affiliate of barnesandnoble.com and sells books through 
barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sell through barnsandnoble.com. They earn a commission on  
all books sold through barnesandnoble.com as part of the affiliate 
relationship,'' Boyd said. He said the agreement with the New York 
Times allows barnesandnoble.com ``to use New York Times content 
according to their stipulations,'' including the New York Times 
best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
	Borders has no business arrangement with the Times, Fahle said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Times did not immediately return a telephone call for  
comment this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com claims to be the Internet's largest retailer of  
videos, music and books. It also has bought or is developing 
interests in a variety of online companies offering products and 
services such as pharmaceuticals, beauty aids, greeting cards, 
pets, groceries and auctions.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nathan S. Ancell, co-founder of the Ethan Allen  
furniture company and pioneer of the concept of selling furniture 
in room-style settings, died Monday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancell and his brother-in-law, Theodore Baumritter, started  
their company in the 1930s in Beecher Falls, Vt., out of a bankrupt 
furniture factory. Its headquarters was eventually moved to 
Danbury, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking the tradition of displaying furniture in rows of  
chairs, tables and beds, Ancell applied the ``gallery concept'' of 
showing furniture in coordinated settings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancell succeed Baumritter as chairman in 1970, handing over  
management to Farooq Kathwari in 1985. The company was bought by 
Interco Inc. for $150 million in 1980, and was sold to a management 
group led by Kathwari in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Gay Philanthropist Given Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bypassing Senate confirmation, President  
Clinton moved Friday to directly install gay San Francisco 
businessman James C. Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	The president invoked a provision of the Constitution allowing  
him to make such appointments during a congressional recess. 
Hormel, who will become the first openly gay U.S. ambassador, can 
serve in the diplomatic post through the current session of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	That means until the end of 2000, basically coinciding with the  
end of Clinton's term when all ambassadorial posts will be up for 
possible replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	The recess appointment drew criticism from a spokesman for  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and from Christian 
conservative groups but was praised by gay-rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, 66, an heir to the Hormel food fortune and a former dean  
at the University of Chicago Law School, was first nominated in 
October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious conservatives, criticizing his advocacy of gay rights,  
have strongly opposed the nomination. And Lott, who has likened 
homosexuality to alcoholism, kleptomania and sex addiction, refused 
to let the full Senate vote on the nomination even though the 
Foreign Relations Committee approved it 16-2 in late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., a leader of the opposition to the  
nomination, accused Clinton of ``utter contempt of the Senate and 
its role in the confirmation process.'' He called Hormel ``an 
inappropriate representative of our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``It came down  
to a couple of senators who thought that he shouldn't be ambassador 
because he's gay. And the president thinks that's wrong and 
discriminatory and that's why he moved ahead with the recess 
appointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the California philanthropist have always  
contended Hormel would win confirmation if the full Senate got a 
chance to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The denial of a confirmation vote by the Senate leadership, a  
vote he would have easily won, was nothing more than anti-gay 
discrimination,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the 
Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian 
political group. She called the appointment a ``bold move'' by 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott spokesman John Czwartacki criticized the appointment as ``a  
slap in the face,'' particularly to Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	Czwartacki cited what he said were Hormel's links with San  
Francisco's Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence -- drag queens who dress 
as nuns. Lott considers the group ``an extremist anti-Catholic 
group,'' Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Hormel doesn't support  
``any such group. The idea ... is outrageous and is false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents have said Hormel seemed to give support to the group  
during a gay-rights parade. Hormel supporters said his appearance 
at the same parade does not constitute specific support for the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The ambassadorial appointment to the small European country was  
possible only because Congress is in recess, not returning from its 
10-day Memorial Day break until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The process is rarely used for high-profile appointments since  
it generally annoys senators, who value their confirmation 
prerogatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used a similar, but not identical, process in early 1998  
to install Bill Lann Lee, a former NAACP attorney, as civil rights 
chief in the Justice Department after Senate conservatives blocked 
the nomination. Lee continues to serve in that capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the Traditional Values  
Coalition, a conservative Christian group, said, ``Recess 
appointments were not designed as subterfuge for appointing shady 
individuals to high office.'' She accused Hormel of being ``a 
purveyor of smut'' and of ``cheering on child molesters and 
transvestite nuns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another conservative religious group, the Family Research  
Council, said in a statement that Clinton had given Hormel ``a 
government-sanctioned platform'' to ``advance the gay agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's action drew support from California's two senators,  
both Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dianne Feinstein called Hormel's appointment ``long  
overdue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president did what I think the honorable thing was to  
break this log jam,'' said Feinstein, who added that she had known 
Hormel since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Boxer said the decision proves the country is  
unwilling to discriminate. ``The reason those holds were placed on 
Hormel ... was because he is a homosexual. That is the only reason. 
This country can't move in that direction.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A failed Japanese bank filed a criminal complaint  
with police and prosecutors on Friday, accusing its former 
executives of engaging in illegal business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., which was nationalized  
in October after being declared insolvent, acted in response to an 
internal probe begun after the resignation of top executives. 
</P>

	In addition to asking the authorities to move against the former  
officials, the bank also said in a statement that it would work to 
prevent a recurrence of the alleged violations by reforming its 
management structure.

<P>
	The statement did not name the former executives it was  
targeting or give details of the allegations against them. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit bank became the first Japanese bank to be  
nationalized since the end of World War II after financial 
authorities determined it had liabilities exceeding assets by about 
$2.79 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media have reported the bank may have broken Japan's  
Commercial Code by paying dividends even though it was racking up 
losses.

<HEADLINE> Snake Slips Into Couple's Car </HEADLINE>

<P>
	HURON, Ohio (AP) -- Ginny Slivka thought she'd spotted some rust  
on her car. Then, the rust moved. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out to be a 6-foot snake that had made a home inside  
the car, next to the driver's door. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of day earlier, her husband had seen the snake at a  
golf course. Using a golf club, he nudged it back into the woods -- 
or so he thought. 
</P>
<P>
	The snake apparently slipped into the car through the trunk and  
stayed there until Mrs. Slivka discovered it while running errands 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two firefighters helped bag the reptile, which wasn't believed  
to be poisonous. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Confusion Over State of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- European Union leaders added to  
confusion over the state of the euro today by first drawing up a 
statement saying they were ``not at all concerned'' about the 
currency's weakness, then deleting the passage from the final 
summit communique. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnaround came amid mounting criticism that EU authorities  
were contributing to the euro's slump against the dollar by sending 
mixed signals about the currency, which has slipped by more than 10 
percent since its adoption by 11 nations on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	EU officials said the phrase was dropped at Italy's request. No  
further details of why the draft statement was altered were 
immediately given. 
</P>
<P>
	Other changes were made to the draft statement's passages  
dealing with the EU economy, including one confirming the EU's 
resolve ``to secure market confidence in the stability of the euro 
by a consistent economic and financial policy geared to stability 
and reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EU officials said that passage was dropped at the request of  
France. 
</P>
<P>
	An EU official said the leaders agreed to delete the bulk of the  
language about the euro out of concern for its possible impact on 
the financial markets. He said they were concerned any written 
statement on the euro might be taken as a sign of undue concern by 
currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro lurched to new lows today of $1.0270 in Asian markets  
and $1.0313 in European trading. When the currency was launched on 
Jan. 1 it was trading at around $1.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes of a peace deal in Kosovo did little to raise the euro's  
fortunes, although German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder expressed 
confidence Thursday that the possible end to the conflict ``will 
also have positive effects on the currency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European traders said they were expecting more volatility in  
euro-dollar markets and don't exclude the possibility of another 
euro low before the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the euro's woes had not  
altered his aim of taking Britain into the single currency if the 
economic conditions are right. ``Our position remains exactly the 
same and I don't think you can judge it on the basis of 
fluctuations of the euro from this month to that,'' Blair told 
Britain's GMTV. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's slump has left Blair open to criticism from political  
opponents for not ruling out a switch from the pound to the euro.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Adopt Departure Countdowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airlines are starting to use strict boarding  
procedures to improve departure performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers are being told to be in their seats 10 minutes before  
takeoff. Five minutes beforehand, the cabin door is closed. At the 
scheduled departure time, the plane leaves the gates. 
</P>
<P>
	The two major U.S. carriers who have adopted or are adopting the  
policy say it will help them stick to their schedule. It also 
reflects the preferences of most passengers, who hate late 
departures, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being prepared to depart as soon as possible improves our  
position for takeoff clearance, which in turn improves the 
likelihood of an on-time arrival at our customer's destination,'' 
said Al Crellin, vice president of customer service for US Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways, the nation's sixth-largest airline and an East Coast  
mainstay, announced this week that it will adopt the ``10-5-take 
off'' policy on June 15. United Airlines, the largest U.S. carrier, 
initiated the move in April with a ``Time to Go'' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Hopkins, a United spokesman, said the airline acted after  
market research showed passengers wanted punctual flights. Since 
the policy took effect, passenger praise has far outweighed 
complaints, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines have an interest in the policy change, Hopkins  
conceded, since it helps ensure that passengers won't miss their 
connections -- necessitating re-booking -- and that planes will be 
ready for their next trip. Getting everyone seated early also 
clarifies how many first-class seats are available for upgrades and 
how many standby passengers can be accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
	There's one more payoff: Punctuality helps the airlines score  
well in on-time and quality ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is information the government collects and publishes, and  
it's a competitive factor in the airline industry, so everyone is 
paying attention to it,'' said David Fuscus, spokesman for the Air 
Transport Association, a trade group for major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines typically retain the right to cancel a seat assignment  
for anyone who hasn't checked in 20 minutes before the scheduled 
departure time. They also say that if passengers don't check in 10 
minutes beforehand, they lose their reservation and must take their 
chances as standbys. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers are being warned of the new policies with airport  
signs, notices in their frequent-flier mailers and mentions on 
airline Web sites. To ensure that the policy does not penalize 
passengers making connections, United last year expanded the time 
between its flights by five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this policy, you can get people out on time and without  
the anxiety of wondering if they'll have time to make their 
connection,'' said Hopkins, the United spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers seem pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been on a lot of flights where they've loaded up and then  
waited for late connections or folks dallying in the airport,'' 
said Dan Bartz of Milwaukee, who was waiting Friday at Washington's 
Reagan National Airport for a United flight to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Weber of Chicago, sitting beside Bartz, said she agreed,  
although she did not want to see connecting passengers punished. 
She used to live in Milwaukee and frequently had to make 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it were a matter of accommodating them by waiting a few  
minutes, I would be in favor of that, having been on both sides,'' 
Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
	So what happens to passengers who get to the gate just before  
their scheduled departure time? If the ramp is still there, they 
may get on, despite the new policy. But if it's been pulled back, 
they're probably out of luck, said Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want 179 people on a plane delayed because one  
person gets there at the last minute,'' he said.

	HOLLAND, Mass. (AP) -- An animal control commissioner who had  
been trying to get the town to build a better shelter for strays

<HEADLINE> Ron Polk Named Ga. Baseball Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Ron Polk, a four-time national baseball coach  
of the year, is returning to the dugout as coach at the University 
of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Polk, 55, accepted the job Thursday, ending a two-year  
sabbatical that followed his 22-year career at Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Georgia job came open, I asked myself, `Do you have  
one more challenge in you?''' he said. ``I said `yes.' This is 
where I want to be at this time in my life. I missed big-time 
working with the kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polk resigned in 1997 from Mississippi State after his sixth  
trip to the College World Series, citing ``coaching burnout'' as a 
factor. He stayed at Mississippi State as an associate athletic 
director and worked with the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with the national team rekindled his desire to coach,  
Polk said. He said he told a former Georgia player he would be 
interested in the Bulldogs' job, and that player contacted Georgia 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one question I had was, did Ron really want to go back  
into coaching?'' Georgia athletic director Vince Dooley said. ``I 
could see the fire in his eyes. Baseball has been his life. You 
could tell that he missed coaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia gave him a four-year contract that will pay him $80,000  
a year in base salary, Dooley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Polk succeeds Robert Sapp, who coached for three years at  
Georgia. The Bulldogs have been in a decline since 1990, when Steve 
Webber coached them to their only national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Sapp and Webber both coached under Polk at Georgia Southern.  
Polk started as a head coach there in 1972 and took the Eagles to 
the College World Series the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Polk's career record is 1,043-486, including 888-422 at  
Mississippi State, which went to the College World Series five 
times. He coached 12 future major leaguers.

<HEADLINE> Familiar Foes Fight To Unify Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Roy Jones Jr. and Reggie Johnson spent a  
lot of time this week saying nice things about each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The pleasantries are over and both say it could really get nasty  
when they meet Saturday night to unify the light heavyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who holds the WBC and WBA light heavyweight  
championships, and Johnson, the IBF titleholder, believe they have 
been pointed towards this match for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always known Reggie can fight and we've always wanted the  
same things,'' Jones said. ``It was only a matter of time before we 
had to see which one of us got what we wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters trained in Pensacola, Fla., early in their  
professional careers under the tutelage of Roy Jones Sr. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones Jr. said he grew uncomfortable with Johnson in his camp  
because he knew they would have to fight some day. His father's 
refusal to dump Johnson led to a split between the Joneses. But 
while they were together, their intense sparing sessions taught 
Johnson and Jones to respect each other's abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the mountains I've had to climb, and the hurdles I've  
had to get over, this is the biggest,'' Johnson said. ``Roy is a 
great boxer and I like him, but I'm coming to win this thing and 
win big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Jones weighed in at 174 pounds, Johnson at 171,  
</P>
<P>
	There hasn't been an undisputed light heavyweight champion since  
Michael Spinks relinquished the title in 1985 to successfully 
campaign for the IBF heavyweight championship against Larry Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Jones, a former IBF middleweight and super  
middleweight champion, won the WBC light heavyweight title in 1996, 
lost on a disqualification to Montell Griffin in 1997 and regained 
the title with a first-round knockout of Griffin later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones added the WBA title by outpointing Lou Del Valle last July  
18. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 32, a left-hander, won the WBA light heavyweight title  
in 1992 and lost it in 1993. After failing twice to regain it, he 
became IBF champion by knocking out William Guthrie in the fifth 
round on Feb. 6, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who will defend his titles for the fifth time in the last  
year-and-a-half, is a heavy favorite to grab his third 
championship. Even Johnson acknowledges his underdog role. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest fight of my life, and Roy's life too,''  
Johnson said. ``And I know what people expect. They call him the 
world's best boxer pound-for-pound, but I also know what I expect 
and I'm going to shock everyone. I can't predict a round. I can't 
say exactly how. But I know I'm going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones also sees Johnson as his biggest challenge, but believes  
Saturday's fight will be his biggest victory as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it I'll knock him down or not, but from round  
one to round 12, I'll be doing a job on him,'' Jones said.

<HEADLINE> Adjusted BCS Formula To Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DESTIN, Fla. (AP) -- The new formula for the Bowl Championship  
Series will be released later this month and its chairman said 
Friday there will be a few new wrinkles to the system that debuted 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most notably, it will likely include additional computer  
rankings to go with those compiled by Jeff Sagarin, The New York 
Times and Seattle Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will give it a broader diversity of information,'' BCS  
chairman Roy Kramer said. ``The more information you put in, the 
better information you get, in most cases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer said he was pleased with the formula that landed  
Tennessee and Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some football fans, however, felt alienated by a system that  
used complex math formulas -- nothing that could be done on a pad of 
paper at home -- to factor The Associated Press media poll, the 
coaches' poll, computer rankings, strength of schedule and overall 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer has steadfastly defended the system and says there are no  
plans to alter it dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Kansas State, UCLA, Florida and Ohio State all  
remained in contention for the top spot until late-season losses 
eliminated them. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee earned one spot in the Fiesta Bowl thanks to its  
undefeated record. The second spot came down to Florida State and 
Ohio State. The Seminoles got it because of a higher BCS ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the last four or five weeks of college football last  
year, we had as much excitement and interest as we had in many, 
many years,'' Kramer said. ``We heard one guy on the radio applying 
the BCS standings to the NFL. That was the ultimate compliment. It 
certainly enlivened every call-in show in the country. From that 
standpoint, it worked.''

<HEADLINE>  EU Summit Backfires Over Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Plans for a show of support from all 15  
European Union leaders to bolster confidence in the battered euro 
backfired Friday when an EU summit produced a flip-flop that only 
added to market uncertainties over the new currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In a baffling turnaround, the leaders first produced a draft of  
a joint statement which said they were ``not at all concerned'' by 
the euro's weakness against the dollar. They deleted the passage 
from the summit's final communique. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch came amid mounting criticism that EU officials were  
contributing to the euro's decline by sending mixed signals about 
the currency, which has slipped by more than 11 percent since its 
adoption by 11 nations on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	EU officials said the phrases were dropped at the request of  
Italy, France and Spain, who believed any written statement on the 
euro's slump would create an impression the leaders were overly 
worried by developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the council decides it doesn't want to discuss the euro in  
the document, there's nothing on the euro,'' Italian Prime Minister 
Massimo D'Alema told reporters. ``Bad information generates 
confusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other passages talking up the euro were also removed from the  
summit declaration, including one blaming the euro's frailty on 
differences in the business cycles between Europe and the United 
States that are ``likely to lessen over the course of this year and 
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also dropped a commitment ``to secure market confidence in  
the stability of the euro by a consistent economic and financial 
policy geared to stability and reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The euro lurched to new lows of $1.0270 in Asian markets and  
$1.0318 in late London trading, where it hit a new intraday low of 
$1.0296. The euro was worth $1.1668 when it first started trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes of a peace deal in Kosovo did little to raise the euro's  
fortunes, although German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder expressed 
confidence Thursday that a possible end to the conflict ``will also 
have positive effects on the currency.'' The euro responded 
Thursday by hitting a then-intraday record low of $1.0303 before 
rising to $1.0350 late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit muddle comes after markets punished recent  
conflicting signals from European officials about whether to shore 
up the euro, and a decision to allow Italy to overrun its budget 
deficit target despite repeated assertions that euro-zone nations 
must apply tight fiscal disciple. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the disadvantages of the euro, is that there's too many  
people talking,'' German Finance Minister Hans Eichel told 
reporters at the summit. ``This has to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the euro's woes had not  
altered his aim of taking Britain into the single currency if the 
economic conditions are right. ``Our position on the euro has not 
changed and will not change,'' Blair told a news conference at the 
summit. ``It is in Britain's interests that the euro succeeds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's plunge has left Blair open to criticism from  
political opponents for not ruling out a switch from the pound to 
the euro.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Police Close Two Firing Ranges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dangerous incident the cops are calling a  
``training mishap'' has prompted the District of Columbia to shut 
down two of its police department firing ranges. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey ordered the ranges closed 10 days  
after bullets from one of the facilities slammed into a residential 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen homes and three vehicles in Lorton, Va., were hit by  
submachine gun fire that came from the range at the Lorton 
Correctional Facility on May 24. No one was hurt, but some of the 
bullets came dangerously close to striking residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me it boiled down to a simple question: Would I feel  
comfortable with my own 12-year-old son playing in the backyard of 
one of the houses that was struck by the live fire from our range? 
It took me a nanosecond to know I would not,'' Ramsey said during a 
radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey called it a ``training mishap.'' He said officers were on  
their backs shooting up at targets at the time of the incident, and 
the angle of the shots caused the bullets to whiz over a dirt 
embankment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the police chief said the mistake indicated that  
safety procedures must be overhauled at the range, and he closed 
the facility temporarily. But on Thursday, Ramsey said the only 
solution was to close it permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced that as a precautionary measure, officers  
would no longer be allowed to use the outdoor range at the 
department's police academy in Southwest Washington, but would 
instead use the facility's indoor range. 
</P>
<P>
	``Open-air live-fire ranges and populated residential areas  
simply do not mix,'' Ramsey said.

<HEADLINE> National League Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- What a showdown it would have been: Matt Mantei,  
throwing 100 mph, against Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would have been nice,'' Mantei said. ``That's the  
situation you like to be in. Either I beat him with my best stuff, 
or he beats me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matchup never materialized because McGwire left Thursday  
night's game in the sixth inning with tightness in his lower back. 
Willie McGee, batting in his spot, grounded out against Mantei with 
two runners on to end the game, and the Florida Marlins beat the 
St. Louis Cardinals 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	In other NL games, San Francisco beat Philadelphia 7-4,  
Milwaukee defeated Houston 4-1 and Chicago tripped San Diego 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei threw three consecutive 99 mph fastballs in the ninth.  
His first pitch to Edgar Renteria hit 100, and the crowd roared 
when the speed registered on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard everybody cheering,'' Mantei said. ``I looked up and  
said, `100 mph? Damn!''' 
</P>
<P>
	But after Mantei retired the first two batters, Joe McEwing  
singled and took third on a single by Renteria. That brought up the 
No. 3 hitter in the order, normally McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would have been a good matchup,'' Marlins interim manager  
Fredi Gonzalez said. ``I would have left the dugout. I didn't want 
to see that one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, McGee stepped to the plate. He hit a sharp grounder  
down the third-base line, but Mike Lowell made a backhanded stop 
and threw to first for the game-ending out. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy made a great play,'' Cardinals manager Tony La Russa  
said. ``If he's not on the line, it's a tie game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei earned his sixth save in seven chances and lowered his  
ERA to 1.73. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was throwing hard, but who cares?'' Mantei said. ``Mike  
saved me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, who missed the start of the season following surgery for  
testicular cancer, also hit his first major league homer, a two-run 
blow in the seventh, to give Florida a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit a solo homer, his 17th, before leaving the game as a  
precaution. Mighty Mac said he expects to play tonight in Detroit, 
which is good news for the Cardinals because he's warming up with 
the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has nine homers in his past 14 games and needs one more  
to tie Stan Musial and Willie Stargell, who are 17th on the career 
list with 475. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis slugger's first-inning homer off Alex Fernandez  
landed in the upper deck and was estimated at 475 feet. He now has 
six career hits off Fernandez, and five of them are homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw me a curve,'' McGwire said. ``I don't think I'm going  
to see many more of those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has eight homers in 10 career games at Miami.  
</P>
<P>
	Lowell's first homer came with Florida trailing 2-1. Preston  
Wilson was hit by an 0-2 pitch leading off the seventh, and Lowell 
followed with a home run off Darren Oliver (4-3). 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitting a home run is always special,'' Lowell said, ``and  
that was a pretty big moment in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rookie was acquired last winter from the New York Yankees  
for three pitching prospects after they re-signed World Series MVP 
Scott Brosius. Lowell underwent surgery Feb. 21, started the season 
on the disabled list and joined the Marlins on May 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because I've been through cancer surgery and treatment,  
it makes a better story, but I try to separate it from baseball,'' 
said Lowell, 25. ``At this point, I'm just a young guy trying to 
prove myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Braden Looper (1-1), a former Cardinal, pitched two  
scoreless innings for his first major league victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver took a three-hitter into the seventh but couldn't get  
another out. He was charged with four runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made one mistake,'' he said, ``and that cost us the  
ballgame.'' 
</P>
<P>
                          *Cubs 7, Padres 2    	
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa homered for the second straight day and took over the  
NL lead with 19 as Chicago won for the sixth time in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who hit a major league record 20 home runs last June, has  
two this month and 15 home runs and 31 RBIs in his last 27 games. 
He hit a solo shot in the first off rookie Matt Clement (1-6), who 
then allowed Henry Rodriguez's three-run homer in a six-run second. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Tapani (5-2) allowed two runs and six hits in six innings  
at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Giants 7, Phillies 4    	
</P>
<P>
	Curt Schilling (8-3) failed to become the first pitcher with six  
straight complete games since Orel Hershiser in 1988, getting 
knocked out after seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Staked to a 4-1 lead after Philadelphia scored three in the  
sixth at Veterans Stadium, Schilling was rocked for four runs, four 
hits and a walk in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Kent was 2-for-5 with three RBIs, including a two-run  
single that tied it at 4 in the seventh. Ellis Burks drove in the 
go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Spradlin (1-1) was the winner, and Robb Nen got three outs  
for his NL-leading 16th save. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Brewers 4, Astros 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Dave Nilsson homered twice and doubled as Milwaukee avoided a  
three-game sweep at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Woodard (5-5) gave up one run and six hits in six innings.  
Shane Reynolds (7-5) allowed four runs and nine hits in 5 2-3 
innings to lose for the third time in four starts.

<HEADLINE> Springer Appears at Chicago Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Talk show host Jerry Springer appeared today  
before a Chicago City Council hearing, telling aldermen he knew 
little about the business arrangements behind his show and 
declining to disclose his salary. He said the ``roughhousing'' 
wasn't staged but should not be equated with a common street fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderman Edward Burke, a former policeman, called the hearing of  
the Police and Fire Committee. He said that if the fist fights, 
chair throwing and hair pulling on the controversial show are 
genuine, Chicago police should enforce the law, cuff the guests and 
haul them off to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	If it's staged, Burke suggested, ``The Jerry Springer Show''  
should be required to obtain a city entertainment license. The 
nationally syndicated show is taped in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	As the hearing got under way, some in the audience applauded  
Springer, a former mayor of Cincinnati, at times when he objected 
to some questioning, such as that about his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would you get into that? That's none of your business,''  
Springer told Burke. ``If you want some money, I'll loan you 
some.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't work for you, sir,'' he said. ``I really don't. ...  
I'm trying to be very respectful but you're not the boss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke had threatened to issue a subpoena but Springer appeared  
voluntarily. He said he was polite enough to show up when he heard 
about the hearing even though the alderman hadn't called him to 
invite him. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the violence on his show is staged or real, he  
responded, ``It looks real to me.'' He said there may have been 
some staged incidents over the years but that ``overwhelmingly, the 
show is real.'' He said the show attempted to portray any violent 
antics in a negative light. 
</P>
<P>
	Security on the show is provided by off-duty Chicago police  
officers. Burke says those officers are required by state statute 
to make arrests if they see violations of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer said it would be up to the discretion of an officer on  
what antics might merit arrest, adding, ``When people are 
roughhousing, most of the time we don't take them to jail.'' He 
noted that a fight in a studio, with security present, the 
participants known and the cameras rolling, was different from a 
fight an officer might confront ``on the street late at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The public gallery filled with dozens of Springer supporters  
applauded frequently. Alderman Dorothy Tillman told the gallery 
that they would be ejected from the meeting if the applause 
continued. However, it did little to quiet observers. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he didn't know a lot about such questions as the  
terms to the lease on the studio where the show is taped. He 
suggested Burke could have asked his producers directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are things I know a lot about, and there are things that  
are not my business,'' he said. ``I can't imagine Andy Griffith 
knew a lot about all the contracts and business arrangements of 
`The Andy Griffith Show.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're interested in making a show here, and just beat up  
our show, that's fine. But you know you can get those answers, 
don't you? ... You don't have to be asking me. You know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer agreed to eliminate the fighting on his show after  
numerous protests last year, but they returned when the show's 
ratings suffered.

<HEADLINE> Cabletron Gets New CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Cabletron Systems, a computer networking  
company, named a new chairman and chief executive on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Piyush Patel, 43, former chief executive of a technology company  
acquired by Cabletron last year, will succeed co-founder Craig 
Benson as chairman, chief executive and president, the company said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Patel said he wants to make Cabletron a leader in growing  
markets such as that for delivering voice, video and data. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cabletron has all the ingredients for future success,  
including an extremely loyal customer base, talented employees and 
award-winning technologies,'' Patel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patel formerly was chief executive of Yago Systems, a closely  
held technology company. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson, who is also 43, had left Cableton several years ago only  
to rejoin it as chairman and CEO last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised Patel for ``demonstrated technology leadership ... a  
customer focus and a West Coast entpreneurial spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the 1990s, Cabletron was a major player in the  
network hubs market, selling the powerful processors that link 
computers and related equipment into one local network. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Disabled Hiring Standards To Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is eliminating the federal  
government's stricter hiring and promotion standards for the 
mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	At an East Room awards ceremony today for private companies with  
exceptional track records in hiring people with disabilities, 
Clinton was announcing an executive order changing the civil 
service rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, White House officials said, was intended as a prelude  
to Tipper Gore's White House Conference on Mental Illness next 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The wife of the vice president, who has taken a higher policy  
profile in the White House since Al Gore began his presidential 
campaign in earnest, announced in January that the Office of 
Personnel Management would examine the government's 22-year-old 
hiring rules to eliminate barriers for the mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's executive order, officials said, would change civil  
service rules to ensure that people with psychiatric disabilities -- 
schizophrenia, paranoia and others -- are covered by the same hiring 
and promotion standards that apply to people with physical 
disabilities and the developmental disabilities that accompany 
mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House fact sheet, which estimated that more than 75  
percent of the psychiatrically disabled are unemployed, said the 
new action ``will level the playing field for individuals with 
psychiatric disabilities who are seeking employment and eliminate 
the institutional barriers that prevent them from bringing their 
enormous energy and talent to the work force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was also using the occasion today to press Congress,  
which returns to work next week after a Memorial Day recess, for 
action on the Work Incentives Improvement Act. The legislation, 
sponsored by Sens. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., and Edward M. Kennedy, 
D-Mass., would allow people with disabilities to keep their 
Medicare or Medicaid health coverage when they return to work.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Van Gundy Rips Pacers, Refs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- The Pacers are whiners and floppers and  
the referees aren't following the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	At least that's what New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said  
Thursday about the state of things in the Eastern Conference 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a great team, and I know they're trying to take over  
from Chicago,'' Van Gundy said, ``but they don't have to do it in 
the whining category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still upset over the officiating in Game 2, Van Gundy said the  
referees are not allowing his point guards to play defense against 
Indiana's Mark Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy also charged Rik Smits and Reggie Miller with taking  
cheap shots at his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the NBA has come to where the way you try to  
win in the playoffs is by whining. So they whined about 
everything,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks were called for 40 fouls in Game 2, including five in  
the first eight minutes of the game against point guards Charlie 
Ward and Chris Childs while defending Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played the same defense in Game 1 as we did in Game 2. For  
whatever reason, the game was called totally different,'' Van Gundy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he called NBA vice president Rod Thorn on  
Wednesday to discuss the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
	Particularly galling to the Knicks coach were the fouls called  
when the Pacers ran isolation plays for Jackson on which he used 
his rear end to back toward the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the NBA, you have a right as a defender to hold your  
ground. And in Game 2, that right was taken away from us. The 
offensive player doesn't have a right to drive his shoulder through 
your chest when you're holding a legal guarding position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to flop like they do, we're going to hold our  
ground,'' Van Gundy said. ``Either call the offensive foul -- and 
we're not even asking for that -- or just allow us to hold our 
ground and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy also made reference to Antonio Davis predicting that  
it would be the Pacers who would ``deliver the cheap shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And they did. (Rik) Smits took Chris Childs' head off on a  
drive, and two games in a row Reggie (Miller) has tried to forearm 
shiver Charlie on an away-from-the-basket cut. He's caught him in 
the throat twice, so we're not the team that's physical. They've 
got the physical ones.''

<HEADLINE> TV Works on Remote Control Ordering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- You're watching the football game and a  
pizza commercial comes on. You pick up the remote, pop open an 
on-screen menu and order a medium pepperoni. Thirty minutes later, 
the doorbell rings and it's time to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the dream of every couch potato -- and it may be getting  
closer to reality, thanks to a new interactive television 
technology called Wink that allows viewers to order products and 
get information through the cable boxes on top of their TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
	Wink programming is already available in Japan and is just  
making its way into the United States. Wink is now used in about 
120,000 homes in a handful of U.S. cities, and the California 
company that developed the technology hopes to expand its presence 
to 1.5 million households this summer in major cities including 
Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Wink got an important endorsement Friday when Microsoft Corp.  
said it would invest $30 million in the closely held company, 
joining other key investors like Paul Allen, a co-founder of 
Microsoft who has been amassing cable TV empire. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has its own interactive TV project, known as WebTV,  
which operates differently from Wink. As part of their arrangement, 
Microsoft and Wink will work together in developing common 
standards for interactive television, a collaboration that could 
help the fledgling technology spread. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not solving world hunger here, but we are offering  
American consumers an easy and free way to interact with their 
television using nothing more than their good old remote control,'' 
said Maggie Wilderotter, chief executive officer of Wink. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how it works: If you're watching a show or commercial  
that has Wink features, you'll see a little icon with a cursive 
letter ``i'' in the corner of the screen. Then you can click a 
button on your remote, and up pops a little window offering you 
options for more information about the show or commercial you're 
watching. It's a little like ordering a pay-per-view movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weather Channel is offering extra information on local  
forecasts. On The Tonight Show, details about Jay Leno's guests 
pops up. On CNN, the top headlines scroll past while the main 
report continues. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the Wink system has industry analysts interested, though  
they remain a little skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Bernoff, principal TV analyst at Forrester Research, said  
Wink has an advantage over potential competitors because its 
technology is already in place, and broadcasters and cable 
operators are cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawback, he says, is that the graphics viewers see are  
``extremely ugly'' -- simple text without the colorful and vivid 
pictures that viewers expect these days. ``Right now, what they're 
doing is a dress rehearsal,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``in the future, it wouldn't surprise me if there  
are millions of Wink users.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what the networks hope. ABC, NBC and CBS are all creating  
Wink pop-up notes on a handful of shows, starting off with a few 
hours of programming to see how it catches on. 
</P>
<P>
	Several advertisers, including Procter &AMP; Gamble, Clorox and  
Charles Schwab, are also trying out Wink features in commercials 
that allow viewers buy products or request free samples and 
informational materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, backed by about $55 million in investments, began  
being developed in 1993, and now is supported by about 85 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Wink managers said their major challenges have been developing  
cheap software, convincing advertisers, cable companies and 
networks to try it, and finding a way to process orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Wink chairman Brian Dougherty, who developed the system, said  
manufacturers pay only a few dollars per set-top box, and consumers 
pay nothing. ``The cable operator pays a little bit extra to put 
this box in, then has all these new interactive revenue streams,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other interactive television systems, Wink is free for  
consumers and isn't hooked up through telephone lines to the 
Internet. But analysts said Wink should expect competition from 
interactive systems also vying for viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlen Communications estimates that 15 to 20 percent of U.S.  
households will use some form of interactive TV services within the 
next eight to 10 years. By offering an inconspicuous and 
inexpensive technology, Wink hopes to get a big piece of that.

<HEADLINE> David Lander Has Multiple Sclerosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- David Lander, best known for playing Squiggy  
on the sitcom ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley,'' has multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lander was diagnosed with the often-crippling nerve disease 15  
years ago. He told The Associated Press on Thursday that he is 
revealing his illness now to help others with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just figured that if people can see me, and see that I'm  
working -- I guess I call it `fighting' M.S. -- maybe I can do some 
good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lander played Andrew ``Squiggy'' Squiggman on ``Laverne &AMP;  
Shirley'' during its 1976-83 run on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Lander, married and the father of a teen-age daughter, was  
diagnosed with the disease shortly after the series came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first two years were the toughest. I've been in remission  
most of the past 13 years,'' he said. ``The major way it affects me 
is called `drop foot' in which my knee will buckle. I have to go 
down stairs slowly, holding the railing, but so do a lot of people 
who don't have M.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Lander appeared on Rosie O'Donnell's talk show for a  
tribute to ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley'' star Penny Marshall. Lander also 
had a guest role on the HBO sports comedy ``Arli$$'' and is set to 
star in the musical ``Once Upon a Mattress'' in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has some physical work, but I'm not afraid to do it,''  
Lander said.

<HEADLINE> Gambling Commission Recommendations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Recommendations the National Gambling Impact Study Commission  
approved for its report to be submitted June 18: 
</P>
<P>
	--States should curb political donations from companies involved  
in the gambling business. 
</P>
<P>
	--Betting on college athletics -- part of legal sports betting in  
Nevada and Oregon -- should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
	--Only those 21 and older should be allowed to gamble. The  
minimum age in many states for playing the lottery or gambling on 
horses is now 18. 
</P>
<P>
	--States should dedicate a portion of casino tax revenue to  
problem gambling research, prevention, education and treatment; 
tribal governments should make similar contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	--State lotteries and other forms of government-sponsored  
gambling should discontinue aggressive marketing that targets 
impoverished neighborhoods or youth. 
</P>
<P>
	-The federal government should gather data annually on state  
lotteries, including demographic information on who plays. 
</P>
<P>
	--Indian tribes that run casinos should use some of the revenue  
as ``seed money'' to diversify their finances and reduce dependence 
on gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	--Governments should require ``gambling impact statements'' --  
akin to the environmental impact statements required of developers 
-- before approving new or additional casinos, slot machines or 
lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
	--Automated teller machines should be banned from the area where  
betting takes place at casinos or racetracks. 
</P>
<P>
	--States should not allow casino-style gambling to be introduced  
at horse tracks or other pari-mutuel facilities for the primary 
purpose of bailing them out financially or competing with other 
forms of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	--States should stop the proliferation of ``convenience  
gambling'' outlets, such as video gambling machines in neighborhood 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Cruises to nowhere'' that offer gambling should be prohibited  
unless states specifically allow them to operate.

<HEADLINE> Army-Navy Game Headed to Baltimore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- One of college football's top attractions, the  
Army-Navy game, will be played in Baltimore next year before 
returning to Philadelphia in 2001 and 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The 101st meeting between the service academies will be held  
Dec. 2, 2000 at PSINet Stadium. This year's game will be at 
Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy athletic director Jack Lengyel suggested that more games  
against Army will be played closer to Annapolis after the current 
arrangement expires in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``By then we'll have played four games at Jack Kent Cooke  
Stadium (home of the Washington Redskins). This will give us an 
opportunity to evaluate both stadiums for the future,'' Lengyel 
said. ``We want to serve our fans in this area, and we want to play 
on grass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Navy played Notre Dame last fall at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium and  
will use that facility for home games against Air Force in 1999, 
2001 and 2003. PSINet Stadium, home of the Baltimore Ravens, and 
Cooke Stadium have grass fields; Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia 
has artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
	PSINet Stadium, which seats 69,400, was the site of two college  
football games last year -- a University of Maryland game and the 
Morgan State homecoming game. 
</P>
<P>
	The game will be the third Army-Navy game in Baltimore and the  
first since 1944. All but six of the games since 1932 have been 
played in Philadelphia -- three of those shifts were due to World 
War II travel restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, nine Army cadets were injured when a railing at  
Veterans Stadium collapsed. Lengyel said that id not precipitate 
the move to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came here in 1988, we renegotiated the contract with  
Philadelphia, giving us three opportunities to move games. We've 
been to Giants Stadium (East Rutherford, N.J.) twice, and I felt it 
was important to have one game closer for our fans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia mayor Edward Rendell said city officials were not  
surprised at the move because the contract allows the service 
academies to shift venues every three years. The game was last 
played outside Philadelphia in 1997, and Rendell said the city 
would welcome the game back after its year in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell also thinks that with a new stadium for the Philadelphia  
Eagles planned, the city won't have a problem in securing a new 
contract for future Army-Navy games.

<HEADLINE> Dave Matthews Has Two Broken Ribs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Dave Matthews will be playing hurt --  
and probably with a new guitar -- when he performs a sold-out 
concert this weekend in this resort city. 
</P>
<P>
	The namesake of the Dave Matthews Band suffered two broken ribs  
in a bizarre grape-catching accident during some late-night 
horseplay in Boston last week, publicist Ambrosia Healy said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a silly accident,'' Ms. Healy said. ``They were  
throwing grapes and catching them in their mouths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Matthews fell back in his chair trying to catch a grape  
and landed on his guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	But the injury hasn't slowed him down, Ms. Healy said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was in pain, but he totally rocked,'' she said. ``He would  
never let something like this get in his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews will perform Saturday night at the Virginia Beach  
Amphitheater.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Louisiana Gov. McKeithen Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Gov. John McKeithen, a memorable  
stump speaker who worked to ease race relations and gave New 
Orleans the Superdome, died Friday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeithen died at Citizens Medical Center in his hometown of  
Columbia, said Dave Dixon, who worked with him on the Superdome 
project. He had been in declining health since undergoing heart 
surgery two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Foster ordered flags on all state buildings flown at  
half-staff Friday, and the state Senate paused to remember him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very interesting, very intriguing individual, the  
last great stump speaker and I am happy I had the privilege to know 
him,'' state Sen. John Hainkel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only was McKeithen known for his oratory skills, he was able  
to adapt them for the media age. He was the first to use television 
successfully in a Louisiana governor's campaign, becoming famous 
for his ``won't you he'p me'' ads looking directly into the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Big John, as he was called, served as governor from 1964 to  
1972. A hard-core Democrat, he appointed blacks to state government 
during the civil rights era and was remembered for his efforts to 
soothe racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	He was so popular in his first administration that the  
Legislature passed a law allowing a governor to succeed himself. 
The ban on serving two consecutive terms as governor had been 
enacted around 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	In his second term, however, he was drawn into a controversy  
over allegations of Mafia influence in his administration. No 
influence was ever proven to have reached McKeithen directly. 
</P>
<P>
	His administration drew both praise and criticism over the  
Superdome, which he helped start but was completed in 1975 after he 
had been out of office for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite major cost overruns, McKeithen later said the domed  
stadium had been worthwhile because it sparked economic development 
in the area. The Superdome is now home to the New Orleans Saints 
football team and the Sugar Bowl college football game. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeithen once said that he based many of his political  
decisions on lessons he learned from Gov. Earl Long, whose terms 
were 1948-52 and 1956-60. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Earl Long, I still believe in helping the poor and having  
the wealthy pay for it,'' he said. ``When I was growing up, we had 
two cars. We were the haves. My parents didn't realize we were the 
haves, but I did.''

<HEADLINE> Slayings Could Be By Serial Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The bodies of three women discovered in a  
city park over the past month have investigators looking into the 
possibility of a serial killer, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest victim, identified as a 17-year-old girl, was found  
Wednesday in the city's popular Forest Park. Her body was 
discovered about a quarter-mile from where the other bodies were 
found, that of a 28-year-old woman and a 26-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said all the women had backgrounds with drug-related  
arrests. None appeared to be a hiker or jogger in the heavily 
forested park and looked to have been killed elsewhere and dumped 
in the park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies' proximity to one another, and the similarity in the  
victims' backgrounds, led police to believe the killings are the 
work of the same person. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Charles Moose said there will be a special task force of  
12 detectives assigned to the cases. He said investigators have no 
suspects.

<HEADLINE> Judge Lets Penguins Out of Lease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A federal judge removed on Friday a major  
obstacle to the Pittsburgh Penguins' financial reorganization by 
canceling their lease with the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the Penguins ``our team,'' U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard  
Markovitz said he was invalidating the long-term lease in the best 
interest of the team and its many creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The lease was a major obstacle to reorganizing the team and  
could have driven it out of business. Mario Lemieux, the Penguins' 
center and potential new owner, had been unable to renegotiate the 
agreement with SMG Inc., the team's landlord at the publicly owned 
Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL had threatened to step in and close or move the team and  
was drafting schedules for next season with and without the 
Penguins. It is using the prospect of moving the team as leverage 
to push proceedings toward Lemieux, its preferred owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could move this team somewhere else, but this is a good  
hockey town as it is,'' Markovitz said. ``The last thing anyone 
wants, including the NHL, I think, is to terminate this franchise 
and sell all its pots and pans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SMG had argued to keep the lease until its expiration in 2007.  
Markovitz will decide on Monday the legal matter of whether the 
deal was a lease or an agreement, as the Penguins have alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rejection of the lease was really a foregone conclusion,''  
with federal law providing easy standards for the team to meet to 
escape the deal, said Daniel Shapira, the team's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG and Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh are competing with Lemieux to  
own the team. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG and team officials will negotiate through the weekend on a  
new lease. ``If we feed you all coffee and lock the men's room 
door, we'll get it done,'' Markovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz heard painstakingly detailed testimony Friday about  
the lease, which Penguins owner Howard Baldwin signed five years 
ago to get quick cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL has said it intends to either dissolve the franchise  
that started in the late 1960s; move it, perhaps to Portland, Ore., 
where billionaire and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen reportedly 
wants to run it, or sell off players such as Jaromir Jagr and Tom 
Barrasso piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins' creditors will vote June 24 on three plans: the  
NHL's, one submitted by Lemieux, the team's former star center to 
keep the team in Pittsburgh and a third plan submitted by SMG and 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last fall, the team has been operating with court  
protection from banks, bond holders, the league and former players 
such as Ron Francis and Luc Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
	The SMG-Fox plan includes Lemieux -- who is owed the most money  
by the Penguins of anyone -- as an owner but with a smaller stake 
and less control. 

</P>
<P>
	On Friday, SMG objected to characterizations of the lease as the  
worst in the NHL and the reason the team is failing. Shapira 
suggested high player salaries are a more likely cause. 
</P>
<P>
	William Daly, the NHL's vice president for legal affairs, agreed  
that salaries are a major problem. He said 20 teams in the 
then-26-team league -- including the Penguins -- lost money in 
1997-98 season, the most recent figures available. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said the Los Angeles Kings and Carolina Hurricane have  
troublesome leases like the Penguins' but will get out of them next 
year by moving. He said the Penguins lease costs 25 percent more 
than any other team that does not own its own rink. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins argued that the lease is more like a loan.  
</P>
<P>
	Breaking the lease lumps SMG in with unsecured creditors like  
businesses that supply the team with pucks and towels. That group 
that will get the least percentage of debt back once the case is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that makes it a lease is the use of the word  
`rent,''' Penguins attorney Robert Sable said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapira has suggested that if the lease was broken, SMG would be  
free to schedule wrestling, concerts or other events on days that 
had been reserved for Penguins home games. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins attorney Greg Cribbs said the Penguins made the request  
to break the lease with the assumption that a new deal would be 
struck with the same dates reserved. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how that issue would be resolved.

<HEADLINE>  Hispanics Upset With Astros Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Two television executives say they were told by  
Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane that the team doesn't market to 
Hispanics because they don't understand baseball, buy cheap seats 
and don't eat stadium food. 
</P>
<P>
	McLane denied making derogatory remarks about Hispanics before a  
dinner Thursday night honoring him with the Houston Advertising 
Federation's Trailblazer Award for community service. He described 
himself as ``angry and outraged'' about the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Camacho, vice president and general manager of KTMD-TV,  
and Rod Rodriguez, the station's sales manager, said they were 
offended by McLane's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked him why he doesn't market toward Hispanics,'' Camacho  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said it was hard to reach Hispanics because the game of  
baseball is strategy and skill and it's complicated and that's why 
more Hispanics don't go to Astros games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said if you gave them a basketball and told them to put the  
ball through the hoop, they can do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that baseball is a game of statistics and numbers and  
people like to follow baseball in the newspapers and Hispanics 
don't read newspapers and when Hispanics do go, they buy the cheap 
$2 seats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said he talked to six to eight people at a reception  
before the dinner but denied saying anything racially insensitive 
toward Hispanics, who represent 22 percent of the eight-county 
Houston area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of Hispanics who do come and are great  
supporters but not in the percentage that the population represents 
in Harris County,'' McLane said. ``There was never a disparaging 
remark pertaining to the cheap seats. That was never said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The food was never discussed. That just wasn't a part of the  
conversation that we had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, one of those who nominated McLane for the award, said  
he heard the same comments as Camacho. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said Hispanics don't understand the game of baseball, that  
it's a difficult game to follow with a lot of stats,'' Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said Hispanics don't read the newspapers. I looked at my  
general manager (Camacho) to see if he's really saying that. I told 
him I read newspapers. We grew up on baseball. It was our 
livelihood. Hispanics love the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said statistics were discussed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The statistics came up and I did comment that baseball is a  
very complex game,'' he said. ``But as far as comments that they 
didn't understand the stats or didn't read the stats is certainly 
something that was never discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros owner pointed out his team hires Hispanics and that  
the Astros broadcast their games in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am angry and outraged by the accusation that KTMD Channel 48  
Telemundo made last night,'' McLane said. ``The report was 
absolutely not true. I did not do an interview with the television 
station nor did I make any such statements to anyone in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me say it again: I did not make the remarks and I would  
not make the remarks reported by that television station. I will 
seek an apology from Telemundo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	KTMD is an affiliate of Telemundo. Camacho said McLane declined  
an on-camera interview because he doesn't speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a slap in the face for me,'' Rodriguez said. ``I had a  
lot of respect for the man, but not after last night to learn that 
his is so narrow-minded. It's sad, especially as much as I enjoy 
the game. I won't lose faith in the club but I feel sorry for all 
the Hispanic players on the team.''

<HEADLINE> Springer Appears at Chicago Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- To hear Jerry Springer tell it, he's been doing  
the country a favor by televising violence in all its unattractive 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody watches our show and thinks, 'Wow, that's behavior that  
I think everyone's going to love,''' Springer said Friday at a City 
Council committee hearing. ``You do away with that and we'll go 
back to violence on television being totally sanitized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer came to City Hall to answer aldermen's questions about  
``The Jerry Springer Show,'' and the rowdy guests the 
Chicago-produced program tends to attract. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer admitted there have been some staged incidents during  
the show's eight-year run. But ``overwhelmingly, the show is 
real,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderman Ed Burke, a former policeman, has said that if the  
violence is real, off-duty Chicago police officers who work for 
Springer should cuff guests who get out of hand and haul them off 
to jail. If it's fake, he says Springer should get an entertainment 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes vague, sometimes defiant, Springer held court amid  
cheering fans, hissing opponents and a block of as many as 20 TV 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew applause when he objected to some of Burke's questions,  
including one about how much money he makes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's none of your business,'' Springer replied.  
</P>
<P>
	When questioned about his producers allegedly bringing a banned  
felon into the country to appear on the show, Springer chose not to 
answer, saying, ``I've never been a member of the Communist 
party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's beautiful,'' yelled Jim Birmingham, a retired city  
worker and Springer fan who came to watch the hearing. ``Do it some 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though threatened with a subpoena, Springer came to the hearing  
voluntarily. But he said he thought the panel should be 
concentrating on more serious matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of difference in the violence that happens on  
the streets of Chicago and the roughhousing that takes place in our 
studio,'' Springer said, likening the fights on his show to brawls 
at a hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
	He said guests were free to file complaints against one another.  
The off-duty officers also have the discretion to make arrests -- 
and have done so on rare occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the syndicated show's distributor issued an order  
forbidding fights and replaced some scheduled episodes with tamer 
shows -- an agreement that Springer has already reneged on once. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Catholic priest who prompted the  
committee to take up the matter, said he plans to hold distributor 
Studios USA Network to that promise. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the aldermen tabled a resolution that would force  
officers to make arrests if real violence erupts. Alderman Dorothy 
Tillman called the hearing a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really sat here and tried to turn it into `The Jerry  
Springer Show,''' Tillman told her colleagues. Then she turned her 
comments to Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry, through it all, you won.''

<HEADLINE> 22-Year-Old Wants W.Va. Mayor Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRATT, W.Va. (AP) -- About all Wesley Nugent had in common with  
most of the people at the monthly town council meeting was senior 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent was a senior at West Virginia University. Most of his  
neighbors were senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent was there recently to introduce himself as a candidate  
for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	At 22, Nugent is Pratt's youngest ever candidate for chief  
executive, running in Tuesday's election against two of the 
community's oldest public servants: Mayor Paul Slack, 69, and 
former Mayor Gary Fields, 51. 
</P>
<P>
	His candidacy has created some much-needed excitement in this  
town of 640. 
</P>
<P>
	Win or lose, Nugent said he wants to show other young people  
that they can do something to help their hometowns in West 
Virginia's depressed coal regions instead of leaving the state to 
make a living. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can send a message against brain drain, it will be worth  
it,'' said Nugent, who has himself turned down job offers in 
Pittsburgh, Washington and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt and other coal country towns in West Virginia have been  
hit hard since the 1950s, first by the mechanization of coal 
mining, then by the closing of many of the mines once they were 
played out. A big round of closings took place in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Pratt's residents are retired or unemployed. Many of  
those who do work travel to places like Charleston, about 20 miles 
away, where they hold down low-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, there were nearly 208,000 Kanawha County residents.  
Seven years later, the county had lost nearly 4,000 people. The 
population drain is blamed on a lack of good-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, 62 percent of the WVU graduates who found work within  
six months had left the state. The trend is the same at other state 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent, who graduated last month with a degree in international  
studies, helped write successful grant proposals at WVU and wants 
to use those talents to land projects that can revitalize Pratt and 
create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent's campaign is a hot topic in Pratt, where neighbors share  
their opinions as they work in their yards or relax on their 
porches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competition is healthy,'' Steven McGraw said. Still,  
McGraw said he plans to vote for Fields, his neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Hastings, a lifelong Pratt resident, said: ``I have  
mixed feelings about that. You have to be experienced to be mayor 
or do anything else in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fields said he is glad to see Nugent is getting into politics in  
his hometown but added that the young man needs more experience. 
</P>
<P>
	And Slack, the current, two-term mayor, said he is confident he  
will be re-elected. But he added: ``I hope after the election he 
still is interested in serving the town. We need more people 
involved in our town.''

<HEADLINE> Distance Runners Push Stanford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- The men's field is chasing Stanford again on  
the final day of the NCAA track and field championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinal's distance runners had 37 points through Friday  
night as Stanford took the lead heading into today's final events 
with a total of 45 points. Last year, Stanford also led going into 
the last day, but Arkansas rallied in the sprints to capture its 
seventh straight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington State's Bernard Lagat won the 5,000-meter race in  
14:01.09, but right behind him was Brad Hauser of Stanford. His 
brother Brent finished fifth and Jason Balkman was eighth, giving 
Stanford 13 points in the event. Cardinal runners finished 1-2-3 in 
Wednesday's 10,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending women's champion Texas led with 31 points, but  
Southern Cal and UCLA were just three points behind. Southern 
Methodist had 25 points, followed by Georgia with 21, Pittsburgh 
20, Brigham Young 19 and Louisiana State 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The pace was relatively slow in the men's 5,000 meters, and when  
Lagat broke out with 800 meters to go, he knew the race was his. 
``In the last 800 meters, nobody can beat me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Hauser agreed. ``Bernard's got a great kick,'' he said.  
``He's very tough to catch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his teammates were happy with 13 points in the event.  
``It's as good as we could have expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford's Toby Stevenson added eight points with a second-place  
finish in the pole vault. He was the defending champion in the 
event, but Jacob Davis of Texas beat him on the final jump by 
clearing 18 feet, 2 3/4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson was ranked fourth coming into the event. ``Eight  
points is great. The more the better,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford has won three national championships, but the last was  
65 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey Bowers of Baylor won the women's triple jump at 45 feet,  
10 inches over Trecia Smith of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	John Capel of Florida led semifinal qualifiers at 200 meters  
with his 20.37 second clocking, slightly ahead of Coby Miller of 
Auburn. Capel also had the best time among the 100-meter finalists 
with a wind-aided 10.05. BYU's Leonard Myles-Mills qualified at 
10.08, slightly ahead of Terrence Trammell of South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Latasha Jenkins of Ball State had the best 200 qualifying time  
among the women, 22.22 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Trammell ran a brilliant leg as the Gamecocks won the 400-meter  
relay over Southern Cal in 38.92 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor's Bayano Kamani won the 400-meter hurdles in 48.58, and  
Missouri's Derrick Peterson won the 800-meter run in 1:46.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Matti Narhi of UTEP captured the javelin title with a throw of  
261-7. Georgia's Vigdia Gudjonadotti won the women's title at 
182-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas women won the 400 relay in 42.95 seconds. UCLA's  
Joanna Hayes won the 400-meter hurdles in 55:16. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrie Tollefson of Villanova won at 3,000 meters with a time  
9:26.51 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU's Claudine Williams won the 800-meter run in 2 minutes, 3.38  
seconds.

<HEADLINE>  Miller Says Knicks Are Whining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A war of words replaced the war on the  
basketball court Friday as the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers 
waited to resume the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after New York coach Jeff Van Gundy complained about the  
Pacers' play and the officiating, the Pacers responded by saying 
the Knicks should shut up and play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no whining on our part. Everything is coming from  
their camp,'' said Reggie Miller, accused by Van Gundy of taking 
cheap shots at the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy also accused Rik Smits of taking a cheap shot and  
claimed referees are not allowing his point guards to play defense 
against Indiana's Mark Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York coach said he had called NBA vice president Rod  
Thorn about the play in the opening two games in the best-of-7 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller wasn't impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they're going to call Rod Thorn and beg for calls, they  
need to look at themselves in the mirror. They're the ones that are 
doing all the hitting and the holding,'' Miller said. ``We're just 
trying to play basketball. ... It's too late in the season to be 
crying now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series is tied 1-1 with Game 3 in New York on Saturday. The  
Knicks will be without center Patrick Ewing, gone for the rest of 
the season with a partially torn Achilles tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have the advantage. They're the ones who won one here.  
We're trying to come into the Garden and win one,'' Miller said. 
``I don't understand where they're coming from. ... The good thing 
about is we play Saturday night and everything will resolve 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jalen Rose agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're a team that doesn't have to cry and whine. We're a team  
that is going to go out and play tough, give everything we have,'' 
Jalen Rose said. ``We have guys that are going to be aggressive, be 
physical. You have to be at this point of the season or you will be 
at home watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana coach Larry Bird said Van Gundy's comments were directed  
at officials. 
</P>

Obviously, he's not too happy right now. ... It's up to us to just 
go there and play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>

officiating for the rest of the series.

	``I don't know that officials get caught up in that too much.  
They're human, they do hear and see what is going on,'' he said.

weeks since it completed a sweep of Philadelphia in the semifinals 
May 23. 
</P>

	``I think it's been great for us,'' Bird said of the extensive  
time his team has had after the compacted 50-game schedule created 
after the NBA lockout ended. ``We got a lot of things accomplished. 
We put in some new stuff on the offensive end. We've had time to 
prepare and that should help us.''

<HEADLINE>  Miller Says Knicks Are Whining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A war of words replaced the war on the  
basketball court Friday as the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers 
waited to resume the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after New York coach Jeff Van Gundy complained about the  
Pacers' play and the officiating, the Pacers responded by saying 
the Knicks should shut up and play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no whining on our part. Everything is coming from  
their camp,'' said Reggie Miller, accused by Van Gundy of taking 
cheap shots at the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy also accused Rik Smits of taking a cheap shot and  
claimed referees are not allowing his point guards to play defense 
against Indiana's Mark Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York coach said he had called NBA vice president Rod  
Thorn about the play in the opening two games in the best-of-7 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller wasn't impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they're going to call Rod Thorn and beg for calls, they  
need to look at themselves in the mirror. They're the ones that are 
doing all the hitting and the holding,'' Miller said. ``We're just 
trying to play basketball. ... It's too late in the season to be 
crying now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series is tied 1-1 with Game 3 in New York on Saturday. The  
Knicks will be without center Patrick Ewing, gone for the rest of 
the season with a partially torn Achilles tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have the advantage. They're the ones who won one here.  
We're trying to come into the Garden and win one,'' Miller said. 
``I don't understand where they're coming from. ... The good thing 
about is we play Saturday night and everything will resolve 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jalen Rose agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're a team that doesn't have to cry and whine. We're a team  
that is going to go out and play tough, give everything we have,'' 
Jalen Rose said. ``We have guys that are going to be aggressive, be 
physical. You have to be at this point of the season or you will be 
at home watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana coach Larry Bird said Van Gundy's comments were directed  
at officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's trying to work the officials, which is good. It's all  
part of the game,'' he said. ``We say things how we feel. 
Obviously, he's not too happy right now. ... It's up to us to just 
go there and play basketball.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres Know About Stanley Cup Flops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Six players on the Buffalo Sabres know what  
a Stanley Cup final is like. And all six know what it's like to 
flop. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts, man,'' defenseman Jason Woolley, Buffalo's leading  
scorer in the playoffs, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley, Joe Juneau, Stu Barnes, Rhett Warrener, Alexei Zhitnik  
and Dominik Hasek have all been there. They understand the 
pressures, the distractions, the endless questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of those Sabres also know the embarrassment of being swept  
from hockey's showcase event. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley played for the Florida Panthers when they were swept by  
Colorado three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts a lot, and I don't want to have that feeling again,''  
Woolley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau was with the Washington Capitals when they were swept by  
Detroit last year. Barnes and Warrener played with Woolley when the 
Avalanche swept the Panthers in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek rode the bench behind Ed Belfour when Chicago was swept by  
Pittsburgh in 1992. Alexei Zhitnik played for the Los Angeles Kings 
when they were beaten in five games by the Montreal Canadiens in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the final, I think it was eight years ago or seven, I  
don't even know,'' Hasek said. ``I don't remember too much. I was 
the backup. This year is a totally different experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes.  
</P>
<P>
	Zhitnik says all six players will build on their experience for  
the final, which begins Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody's angry,'' Zhitnik said.  
</P>
<P>
	Zhitnik vows not to be embarrassed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This could be my last chance,'' said Zhitnik, a native of  
Ukraine. ``I know this game is going to be shown all around the 
world. My friends are going to watch at home. I'm going to be 
hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau scored Washington's winning goal to oust the Sabres in  
Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals last season. He was happy 
when Washington traded him to Buffalo on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to have a chance at it again,'' Juneau said. ``With  
all the injuries with Washington we didn't have a chance to repeat. 
That's why I feel very lucky that Washington let me go with a team 
that had a chance to go far in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff and assistant Mike Ramsey also were  
part of a Stanley Cup sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a little easier the second time around,''  
said Ruff, an assistant with Florida in 1996. ``You know you've got 
to keep your players focused and that there's a lot of media 
attention and a lot of things going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey played for the Red Wings when they were swept by the New  
Jersey Devils in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Having failed to grab it once, Zhitnik knows what it takes to  
capture the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kill to win,'' he said. ``Do anything possible -- score, block  
the shots, play physical, even if you're not a physical player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrener says Buffalo is bound to last longer than the 1996  
Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary because you know you're only going to get a couple  
shots at this thing,'' he said. ``I've been there once and I didn't 
make the most of it. I don't want to waste it this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley says there's a lot to handle both on and off the ice.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know exactly what I'm getting into, from the media exposure  
to focusing properly and handling the tickets and handling the 
family,'' he said. ``It's something that our young guys are going 
to have to pick up and learn real fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, maybe the biggest lesson to be learned from a crash  
in the Cup final is to forget it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be thinking about the past,'' Woolley said.  
``I'm not going to be thinking about the last time I was there. I'm 
just going to be going forward and trying to win this thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to cherish this. It's a very special moment.  
And to win, man, how cool that would be?''

<HEADLINE> Costs To Keep Congress Running </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Overall spending for the annual bill that finances Congress' own  
operations dropped when Republicans took control in 1995, but is 
growing beyond where it was under Democrats: 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 1995 (last year under Democratic control): $2.4 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 1996 (first year of GOP control): $2.2 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 1997: $2.2 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 1998: $2.3 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 1999: $2.4 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 2000: (according to Senate Appropriations Committee  
allocation): $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Money provided for House members' office salaries, mail, rent  
and other expenses has also grown. This account is called 
``members' representational allowances,'' and is set by a formula 
that includes number of postal customers in each district. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 1995: $351 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 1996: $361 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 1997: $363 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 1998: $380 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 1999: $385 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 2000 (House bill): $414 million.  
</P>
<P>
	According to the National Taxpayers Union, in 1997 -- the most  
recent year it has analyzed -- Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, spent more 
from his office account than any other representative, $1,022,807. 
The now-retired Rep. Bill Redmond, R-N.M., spent the least, 
$572,749. 
</P>
<P>
	Most House members, however, did not spend their entire office  
accounts. The taxpayers union study found that 79 House members 
spent at least 99 percent of their account. Rep. Bob Schaffer, 
R-Colo., spent the smallest portion, 62 percent.

<HEADLINE> FBI Raids Don King's Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Federal agents raided the offices  
of boxing promoter Don King on Friday as part of an investigation 
into whether the IBF sold rankings and arranged fights for 
kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents entered the offices of Don King Productions with  
empty boxes. A boxing industry source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, told The Associated Press they were looking for records 
involving the International Boxing Federation, Don King Productions 
and Monarch Productions, a company run by King's son, Carl. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Newark, N.J., has been investigating the  
International Boxing Federation for several months -- even before 
the disputed draw in March between Evander Holyfield and Lennox 
Lewis, which prompted New York law enforcement agencies to start 
their own investigations of the IBF. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI would not confirm the raid at King's office in Deerfield  
Beach, about 40 miles north of Miami, was linked to the IBF 
investigation or if the search would be completed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can tell you is we are serving search  
warrants on his offices as part of an ongoing investigation,'' FBI 
spokesman Mike Faregas said. 
</P>
<P>
	King spokesman Greg Fritz did not immediately return a call for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for IBF president Bob Lee Sr., said Friday he knew  
nothing about the FBI raid and refused to say what he knew about 
King's possible involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 18, the Los Angeles Times quoted boxing promoters and  
managers as saying the sport's sanctioning bodies sometimes sell 
the rankings that lead to more lucrative bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported that witnesses have testified before the  
federal grand jury in New Jersey that some payments to the 
sanctioning bodies were made in cash, but that others were less 
obvious, such as those contained in overpayments of standard fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, HBO president Lou DiBella denied King's  
assertion that a rematch was set between Evander Holyfield and 
Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	And sources close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said one of the stumbling blocks was the possibility 
King could be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	DiBella said there were ``some problematic issues that need to  
be worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HBO has insisted King step aside as the fight promoter if he  
were to be indicted on charges stemming from a number of 
investigations, sources close to the negotiations told the AP. So 
far, King has refused such a clause in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Newark, federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all  
IBF records since 1982 on rankings and contracts for fights, as 
well as checks, invoices, expense forms and telephone records, its 
attorney has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors, citing grand jury secrecy, will not  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Krovatin, the lawyer for Lee, said he does not want to  
give ``any sort of credibility'' to rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boxing itself seems to be a sport that is awash in rumors and  
innuendo and false allegations and rivalries and jealousies and 
paybacks and those sorts of things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF and two other sanctioning groups -- the World Boxing  
Association and World Boxing Council -- set rules and rankings that 
play a large role in determining bouts. Boxers who defy the groups 
risk losing the chance to be declared a champion and earn large 
purses.

<HEADLINE> Philly Stadium Cited for Liquor Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Veterans Stadium concession operators have  
been cited for allegedly serving beer to a minor, an offense that 
could result in the venue used by the Phillies and Eagles being 
fined or even losing its liquor license for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Liquor Control Board cited Veterans Stadium Associates  
for serving beer to a 17-year-old during the Phillies' April 12 
season-opener, board spokeswoman Bettina Bunting said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The board launched a probe after nearly a dozen Philadelphia  
high school students started a brawl that was broadcast on national 
television. Investigators talked to six youths identified from 
television clips, and each explained that the students had been 
drinking before the game in the parking lot and during the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from one juvenile who told police he bought  
beer from three different concession stands in Veterans Stadium, 
Bunting said. The youth will not be charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not saying it was only one minor. We only have concrete  
evidence that it was a juvenile,'' Bunting said. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties for the offense range from a $1,000 fine to loss of  
the liquor license for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium's parent company, Ogden Entertainment, said  
concession workers are trained to ask for proof of age from anyone 
under 30 who is buying beer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In more than 10 years of serving millions of fans, we have  
never had a report of this kind and therefore we take it very 
seriously,'' Ogden said in a statement. ``We pledge to maintain the 
strictest standards of responsible alcohol serving at the Vet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An administrative judge is expected to consider the charges in  
the next two months. If the license is revoked, Ogden must reapply 
for a liquor license after one year, Bunting said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Edward G. Rendell said he hoped a compromise could be  
reached, if the stadium is found guilty of serving beer to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's any other feasible controls we can put in ... you  
don't want to ban the sale of beer at a game,'' he said. ``A lot of 
people, of course, enjoy going to a game, having a hot dog and a 
beer, and they act very responsibly.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Emphasizes AOL-Netscape Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government witness in the Microsoft trial  
today offered what he said was ``a plausible suggestion'' to answer 
questions raised about how Netscape's top executive described under 
oath the declining health of his company because of its battle with 
the software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has used newly disclosed documents this week to argue  
that America Online Inc.'s recent purchase of Netscape 
Communications Corp. illustrates how competition in the high-tech 
industry is robust and federal intervention is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge urged the Justice Department's David Boies on Thursday  
to focus his questioning at least partly today on the AOL 
documents, saying there was ``some very interesting information in 
there that I hope for you to revisit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft used one such document to raise questions about the  
testimony last October from James Barksdale, Netscape's chief 
executive, who said under oath that Microsoft had crippled his 
ability to distribute Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	But weeks later, in a far healthier assessment, Netscape told  
its investment bankers its software was included on more than 
one-fifth of the machines sold by the nation's computer makers and 
given away by almost one-fourth of the 20 largest Internet 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape also told the bankers overseeing its $10 billion sale  
that computer makers were distributing its software for ``no 
compensation,'' and that consumers were downloading roughly 160 
million copies of the Web browser annually, according to the newly 
disclosed documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Fisher, an economist testifying for the government,  
said today that Netscape might have been telling bankers that its 
software was distributed by computer makers whose total sales 
account for more than one-fifth the nation's computers, but that 
its software was not necessarily included on all those models of 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher called that a ``plausible suggestion'' but acknowledged  
he didn't know how Netscape arrived at the figures it cited to its 
bankers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher also scoffed at Netscape's claims to its bankers about  
160 million downloads annually, citing one estimate that in 1998 
there were only 67.5 million computers in the United States 
connected to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``That number (160 million) is way too big,'' Fisher said,  
calling it ``totally, totally inconsistent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers contend that Microsoft wielded its influence  
among computer makers to discourage them from distributing 
Netscape's browser and, in some cases, paid Internet providers to 
give its own software to their subscribers rather than Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting those claims, Barksdale told the judge last October  
that computer makers and Internet providers represented more than 
half the total distribution for Web software in the industry, ``and 
we're basically out of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft charged that Netscape told its investment bankers  
more than twice as many new computers included its software than 
Barksdale had represented to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have seen numbers around -- this is a new PC shipped  
worldwide -- I believe it's around 10 percent,'' Barksdale testified 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
	But documents Microsoft cited in court Thursday, dated just  
weeks after Barksdale testified, showed Netscape telling its 
bankers, ``Estimate client on 22 percent of OEM (computer) 
shipments with minimal promotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said Thursday that he believed the numbers Netscape gave  
to its bankers might have been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the documents also appeared to contradict statements by  
AOL Chairman Steve Case and others, who maintained that AOL was 
more interested in buying Netscape's Web site than its Internet 
browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	Case told Microsoft lawyers last month under oath that AOL ``did  
not buy Netscape because of the browser business. We bought 
Netscape in some ways despite the browser business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a slide presentation from AOL's investment bankers last  
November repeatedly describes the company's upcoming plans for the 
Netscape browser, including a proposal to ``extend browser to be a 
more comprehensive desktop application ... with the goal of 
becoming user's de facto environment.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Portrayed as Clinton Clone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Electing Al Gore president in 2000 would be  
like giving President Clinton another four years in office, and 
that's something the nation ``can't afford,'' the head of the 
Republican National Committee says. 
</P>
<P>
	RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson spoke to a weekly public forum in  
Cleveland on Friday and focused his remarks on attacking Vice 
President Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson criticized Gore for strongly supporting Clinton during  
the president's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the vice president was part of an administration under  
which China stole nuclear weapons' secrets while the Clinton-Gore 
campaign took contributions tied to the Chinese military. And he 
accused Gore of being in the grip of teachers' unions on education 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson took a poke at Gore for embellishing his non-political  
jobs and life experiences while on the campaign trail. ``There's 
only one man in America with more life experience -- Forrest Gump,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the GOP as the party of ``lower taxes, less  
government, more freedom, stronger defense and better schools,'' 
Nicholson challenged Gore to set out his positions on tax cuts and 
military spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is that electing Al Gore means giving  
Bill Clinton a third term,'' Nicholson said. ``The American 
presidency can't afford it. The integrity and character of that 
office -- and of American leadership -- can't afford it, nor we, as 
taxpayers and citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Roger Salazar declined to respond directly to  
Nicholson's remarks but said he wasn't surprised the vice president 
was drawing Republican criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since they see the vice president as a strong candidate, they  
focus their attacks on him,'' Salazar said. ``They have nothing of 
substance to offer on their own. All they can offer are attacks.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Fortunes Suddenly Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The landscape was looking bleak for President  
Clinton. His poll ratings had slipped, NATO's resolve was being 
strained and the conflict with Yugoslavia seemed mired in 
stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's fortunes changed swiftly with Belgrade's agreement  
to a peace plan after 72 days of airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who beat impeachment, frustrated a Republican majority  
in Congress and helped send two Republican House leaders packing 
appears to have scored another political victory. Against long 
odds, he seems to have succeeded in defying both the critics and 
the conventional wisdom that you can't win a war merely with bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	For a president pursuing a legacy, it's a big boost.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been lucky,'' said Henry Graff, presidential  
historian at Columbia University. ``When I think of the things he's 
stepped into and the problems he's had -- he's a survivor. I think 
people will say he fought a war and didn't lose a single man. That 
has to be a plus in all the World Almanacs hereafter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the final verdict isn't in. Clinton himself questions  
whether Slobodan Milosevic really will keep his promise to withdraw 
all Serb forces from Kosovo and allow the return of hundreds of 
thousands of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics grumble about the cost of the airstrikes, the price tag  
for rebuilding Kosovo and the fact that Milosevic remains in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget surpluses that were eyed for tax cuts or social programs  
have been whittled down by billions of dollars. Clinton still is 
being second-guessed about his early decision not to use ground 
troops -- an announcement some say may have given Milosevic false 
hopes of surviving NATO's onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still don't know what the endgame is going to be,'' said  
Princeton political scholar Fred Greenstein. ``The endgame for 
George Bush on Iraq finally was that Saddam Hussein is still in 
power. What we now have at the very best will be a major occupying 
force that will make it possible for Albanians to get back into a 
ravaged area where the United States and Europe will subsidize 
them. And a Yugoslavia which had a horrendous economy to begin 
with, which now has its infrastructure destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton managed to cement a remarkable consensus in NATO  
that Milosevic must be stopped from his campaign of terror, 
violence and ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents and prime ministers who often quarrel about sensitive  
issues seemed amazed at times that their fraternity of 19 sovereign 
nations somehow held together. There was bickering about a ground 
invasion, differences over a naval blockade and suggestions for 
bombing pauses. But Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair 
kept their partners in line. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a guy who is said to be totally dictated by the polls, to  
be completely opportunistic, to lack spine, he did get involved in 
this one eventually,'' Greenstein said of Clinton. ``I think he 
comes out well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just an incredibly wily politician who is very good when  
he's on the defensive and not very good when he's got kind of a 
clear path ahead of him,'' Greenstein said. ``There is some luck 
here. He's sort of endlessly bouncing back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent end of the conflict is also a political blessing  
for Vice President Al Gore, hoping to win the Democratic 
presidential nomination next year and succeed Clinton in the White 
House. Gore would not have been helped if the air war had dragged 
on or -- worse yet -- American troops had invaded Kosovo and suffered 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	If peace holds, Clinton's poll ratings likely will recover. His  
job approval rating had slipped 10 points or more to the lower 50s 
amid concerns about bombing accidents, a ground invasion and the 
uncertainty of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether higher poll ratings give Clinton more clout is  
questionable, though, since his term is running out, the 2000 
campaign is approaching and many Republicans burned by impeachment 
revile him. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the apparent victory over Milosevic, they are not  
clinking champagne glasses at the White House. There is relief but 
also a deep sense of caution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you gloat,'' said Graff. ``It's caused too much  
civilian loss. It's cost so much money. It isn't a clear-cut 
victory. We didn't get Milosevic. It's very hard to gloat.''

<HEADLINE> BellSouth Testing Fiber-Optic Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- BellSouth is wiring 400 homes with a direct optic  
link, testing a super-fast, but costly ``fiber-to-the-home'' 
connection that may one day replace copper phone wires. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Internet and video service uses a new technology called  
passive optical networking developed by Lucent Technologies and Oki 
Electric Industry Co. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial will begin this fall in an Atlanta suburb and may be  
expanded to other BellSouth markets later, the regional phone 
company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In theory, the new link can carry data at 100 megabits per  
second -- up to 150 times faster than the copper phone-wire 
technology called DSL, or digital subscriber line, that BellSouth 
and other companies have been introducing around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based BellSouth will price the service at $59.95 per  
month, the same as it charges for DSL. 
</P>
<P>
	While BellSouth and other companies have already installed  
``fiber-to-the-curb'' systems shared by several homes, the new 
system will run into each home individually and doesn't require a 
power source between the network and the home. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is much more expensive, of course, but it enables  
significantly greater capability,'' said Rex G. Mitchell, an 
analyst for Banc of America Securities. ``This is good news. No one 
has done this yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth declined to disclose the cost of installing the  
fiber-optic line, but spokesman John Goldman said the price is 
expected to be as cheap as copper wire in two years as demand grows 
and technology improves. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone and cable companies have been scrambling to find ways  
to deliver faster Internet connections that can handle video and 
other data-heavy applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone can get DSL, which is usually sold at speeds  
ranging from 0.640 to 1.5 megabits per second, because the signal 
can't travel very far from a phone network switch before fading. 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore, the new fiber technology might help BellSouth compete  
with rivals like AT&AMP;T who are planning to use cable TV wires for 
Internet, telephone and television service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to gain some information and some experience,''  
BellSouth's Goldman said. ``Widespread deployment in the region is 
probably about two years away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to high-speed Internet access, BellSouth's new fiber  
link will feature 120 channels of digital video entertainment, 70 
channels of analog video, and 31 channels of digital audio service.

<HEADLINE> Judge Refuses $25M ADM Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Rebuking government prosecutors for a ``wholly  
deceptive'' argument, a federal judge ruled that two former Archer 
Daniels Midland Co. executives convicted of price-fixing will 
receive fines of no more than $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The fines will be far less than the $25 million the government  
had sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Andreas, on leave as ADM executive vice president, and  
Terrance Wilson, former head of the corn division, will be 
sentenced July 9 in a scheme to set high prices for the cattle feed 
additive known as lysine. Andreas, son of longtime ADM chief Dwayne 
Andreas, and Wilson were convicted last September. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking the $25 million fines, as well as prison time for  
Andreas, prosecutors said such punishment would reflect the amount 
of money ADM allegedly reaped in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning berated the Justice  
Department in a ruling Wednesday, saying it failed to prove how 
much lysine sales were affected by the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants had said a $25 million fine was too high, given  
the amount of lysine produced in the world during the price-fixing 
scheme. They sought proof for their argument from overseas lysine 
producers who allegedly participated in the price-fixing 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning said the government wrote letters to the overseas  
producers ``informing them that they were not obliged to produce 
documents'' for Andreas and Wilson. She called the government's 
action ``so incredible that it bordered on being ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also called the government's defense of the action ``wholly  
deceptive.'' Prosecutors had claimed that it was unclear whether 
foreign businesses could be required to cooperate with the U.S. 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the fine, federal prosecutors had sought three  
years in prison, the maximum allowable, against Andreas. Manning 
did not address prison time in her ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department spokeswoman would not comment on strategy  
following Manning's order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed with the judge's decision and we are  
prepared for the sentencing on July 9,'' spokeswoman Jennifer Rose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Whitacre, the mole who tape-recorded meetings where the  
price-fixing scheme was discussed, will also be sentenced July 9. 
His attorney is seeking a sentence concurrent with the nine-year 
term Whitacre is already serving for bilking ADM of $9 million 
while working as chief of the bioproducts division. Manning said he 
also faces a maximum $350,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Failed Japan Bank Files Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A failed Japanese bank filed a criminal complaint  
with police and prosecutors on Friday, accusing its former 
executives of engaging in illegal business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., which was nationalized  
in October after being declared insolvent, acted in response to an 
internal probe begun after the resignation of top executives. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to asking the authorities to move against the former  
officials, the bank also said in a statement that it would work to 
prevent a recurrence of the alleged violations by reforming its 
management structure. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement did not name the former executives it was  
targeting or give details of the allegations against them. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit bank became the first Japanese bank to be  
nationalized since the end of World War II after financial 
authorities determined it had liabilities exceeding assets by about 
$2.79 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media have reported the bank may have broken Japan's  
Commercial Code by paying dividends even though it was racking up 
losses.

<HEADLINE> Judge Lets Penguins Out of Lease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A federal judge removed on Friday a major  
obstacle to the Pittsburgh Penguins' financial reorganization by 
canceling their lease with the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the Penguins ``our team,'' U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard  
Markovitz said he was invalidating the long-term lease in the best 
interest of the team and its many creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The lease was a major obstacle to reorganizing the team and  
could have driven it out of business. Mario Lemieux, the Penguins' 
center and potential new owner, had been unable to renegotiate the 
agreement with SMG Inc., the team's landlord at the publicly owned 
Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL had threatened to step in and close or move the team and  
was drafting schedules for next season with and without the 
Penguins. It is using the prospect of moving the team as leverage 
to push proceedings toward Lemieux, its preferred owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could move this team somewhere else, but this is a good  
hockey town as it is,'' Markovitz said. ``The last thing anyone 
wants, including the NHL, I think, is to terminate this franchise 
and sell all its pots and pans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SMG had argued to keep the lease until its expiration in 2007.  
Markovitz will decide on Monday the legal matter of whether the 
deal was a lease or an agreement, as the Penguins have alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rejection of the lease was really a foregone conclusion,''  
with federal law providing easy standards for the team to meet to 
escape the deal, said Daniel Shapira, the team's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG and Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh are competing with Lemieux to  
own the team. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG and team officials will negotiate through the weekend on a  
new lease. ``If we feed you all coffee and lock the men's room 
door, we'll get it done,'' Markovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz heard painstakingly detailed testimony Friday about  
the lease, which Penguins owner Howard Baldwin signed five years 
ago to get quick cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL has said it intends to either dissolve the franchise  
that started in the late 1960s; move it, perhaps to Portland, Ore., 
where billionaire and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen reportedly 
wants to run it, or sell off players such as Jaromir Jagr and Tom 
Barrasso piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins' creditors will vote June 24 on three plans: the  
NHL's, one submitted by Lemieux, the team's former star center to 
keep the team in Pittsburgh and a third plan submitted by SMG and 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last fall, the team has been operating with court  
protection from banks, bond holders, the league and former players 
such as Ron Francis and Luc Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
	The SMG-Fox plan includes Lemieux -- who is owed the most money  
by the Penguins of anyone -- as an owner but with a smaller stake 
and less control. 

</P>
<P>
	On Friday, SMG objected to characterizations of the lease as the  
worst in the NHL and the reason the team is failing. Shapira 
suggested high player salaries are a more likely cause. 
</P>
<P>
	William Daly, the NHL's vice president for legal affairs, agreed  
that salaries are a major problem. He said 20 teams in the 
then-26-team league -- including the Penguins -- lost money in 
1997-98 season, the most recent figures available. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said the Los Angeles Kings and Carolina Hurricane have  
troublesome leases like the Penguins' but will get out of them next 
year by moving. He said the Penguins lease costs 25 percent more 
than any other team that does not own its own rink. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins argued that the lease is more like a loan.  
</P>
<P>
	Breaking the lease lumps SMG in with unsecured creditors like  
businesses that supply the team with pucks and towels. That group 
that will get the least percentage of debt back once the case is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that makes it a lease is the use of the word  
`rent,''' Penguins attorney Robert Sable said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapira has suggested that if the lease was broken, SMG would be  
free to schedule wrestling, concerts or other events on days that 
had been reserved for Penguins home games. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins attorney Greg Cribbs said the Penguins made the request  
to break the lease with the assumption that a new deal would be 
struck with the same dates reserved. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how that issue would be resolved.

<HEADLINE> Report: Rivers To Get $8M, 4 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Doc Rivers has reached agreement on a  
four-year, $8 million deal to become coach of the Orlando Magic, 
according to ESPN and the Orlando Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
	A team spokesman, however, said the club had not finalized  
anything with the former guard who played 13 NBA seasons and is now 
a television analyst. The Sentinel reported Rivers, 37, will sign 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still going through the coaching process,'' Joel Glass,  
the Magic's communications director, told The Associated Press when 
reached at home late Friday, adding that the team expects no 
announcement through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sentinel reported that because Rivers has no prior coaching  
experience, he is interested in hiring a veteran coach as his top 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the candidates under consideration, the newspaper said,  
are former Milwaukee Bucks and New Jersey Nets coach Dave Wohl, 
former Chicago Bulls assistant and Dallas Mavericks coach Jim 
Cleamons, and one-time Philadelphia 76ers coach Johnny Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sentinel also reported that as many as two of last season's  
four Magic assistants -- Brendan Suhr, Tom Sterner, Tree Rollins and 
Eric Musselman -- might be retained. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers would succeed Chuck Daly, who retired May 24, after  
leading the Magic to a tie for the second-best record in the 
Eastern Conference this season. The team was eliminated from the 
playoffs in the first round by Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> ADs Call Agents a Growing Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DESTIN, Fla. (AP) -- Nearly two years ago, it was Alabama, not  
Florida, handling a problem involving improper contact between 
sports agents and players. 
</P>
<P>
	It took the Crimson Tide about a month to investigate and  
dismiss star defensive lineman Michael Myers, just one game into 
his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of cementing his position as a sure first-round draft  
pick, Myers' stock plummeted. Because he didn't play the final four 
months of his senior season, Myers gained weight, lost his form and 
fell to the fourth round of the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	A lesson learned?  
</P>
<P>
	Not even close.  
</P>
<P>
	``I worry every day that we're going to get another call about  
another problem,'' said Alabama Athletic Director Bob Bockrath. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that we did the right thing. But I have no  
doubt that what we did won't change our situation in terms of the 
possibility of getting in trouble again. Anytime you have a top 
program with top athletes, you always run the risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sense of foreboding permeated the annual meeting of SEC  
athletic directors and coaches. The theme seems to be unanimous: 
agents on campus continue to pose a major problem, one the schools 
have little means of policing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It continues to grow each year and unfortunately, it's almost  
a clandestine operation,'' said SEC Commissioner Roy Kramer. ``It's 
almost like parasites grab onto these young people at a very early 
age, at a very early stage in their career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Florida, university police are investigating whether sports  
agent Tank Black illegally gave money to former Gators, including 
linebacker Johnny Rutledge and defensive linemen Jevon Kearse and 
Reggie McGrew. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Rutledge admitted he received $500 per month over  
the span of a year in exchange for a promise to sign with Black. 
</P>
<P>
	Black denies any wrongdoing. His attorney says Rutledge and  
Kearse initially told investigators they had not accepted money, 
but they were coerced into changing their stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Athletic Director Jeremy Foley said he has yet to hear  
of a solution to a decades-old problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue isn't just cropping up now and it's not just a  
problem at the University of Florida,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids knew the rules, the agents knew the rules. You can't  
have everybody under 24-hour guard. This is a very easy 
conversation to have, but what are the answers? What would you 
suggest?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foley said Florida reacted as soon as it learned of possible  
improper contact, notifying the SEC and NCAA and turning the 
investigation over to school police. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA and SEC agree that was the right thing to do.  
</P>
<P>
	``The brave thing about Florida is that they reported it right  
away,'' said SEC compliance officer Jim McCullough. ``But 
institutionally, how is any school going to handle something like 
this? I don't know if they can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama reported its case immediately, with fresh memories of  
how bad things can go when an agent issue is mishandled. In 1993, 
the NCAA placed the Crimson Tide on probation mishandling a case 
involving defensive back Antonio Langham. 
</P>
<P>
	Langham signed with an agent after Alabama's 1993 Sugar Bowl  
victory and played the next season. The NCAA said that when Alabama 
found out, it tried to cover up the case instead of coming clean. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Bockrath replaced Hootie Ingram as athletic director.  
</P>
<P>
	But a change in administration doesn't necessarily change the  
atmosphere on campus -- at the dormitories and apartments where 
agents and their runners connect with players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to get into the system, get to the athlete, the  
family, the roommate and find a way to corrupt them,'' Kramer said. 
``None of them do this with great sums of money. That's the sad 
part in many cases. It's just a few hundred dollars and they're 
there.''

	Last year, Alabama toughened its agent law, making agents

<HEADLINE> European Internet Connections Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Europeans are getting wired, with the number of  
household and business Internet connections nearly doubling last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dataquest Inc. reports 10 percent of Western European households  
were connected last year, up from five percent in 1997, according 
to today's edition of The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	About 36 percent of U.S. households were online at the end of  
1998, Dataquest says. 
</P>
<P>
	Business connections in Europe increased to 9.5 percent, up from  
five percent the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany led the way online both at home and work with 24  
percent, and the United Kingdom was second with 17 percent, the 
Journal reported. The fastest growth was in Russia, France and 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Online connections in Europe were boosted in part by increased  
activity among Internet service providers, Dataquest said. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose, Calif.-based market research company predicts  
cheap broadband services will continue to fuel growth in Europe, 
likely increasing Internet penetration in Western European 
households to 17 percent and in businesses to 16 percent by the end 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The critical point to attract mainstream advertisers and  
businesses to the Internet is about 20 percent, Dataquest senior 
analyst Petra Gartzen told the Journal.

<HEADLINE> James Brown Donates Gun-Lock Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- James Brown donated $4,000 so that his  
hometown could buy 1,000 gun locks and give them away to gun 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Godfather of Soul wrote the check after being approached by  
Mayor Bob Young, who said he got the idea after seeing the success 
of a gun lock giveaway in Hendersonville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not a hard sell at all because Mr. Brown is concerned  
about kids and he loves this community,'' Young said Thursday. 
</P>

its kind in the state.

<HEADLINE> Utilities Give Early Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Electric utilities provided preliminary  
figures Friday on toxic chemical releases from coal-burning power 
plants, but did not include information on mercury, a 
cancer-causing chemical that has been the subject of growing health 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Edison Electric Institute said reports from two-thirds of  
the coal-burning power plants showed 355,000 tons of toxic releases 
last year. About two-thirds of the total was hydrochloric or 
sulfuric acid, which pose little direct health concern when 
released into the air at low concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute, which represents investor-owned utilities, also  
said the coal plants released 64,000 tons of barium, 16,000 tons of 
manganese and 4,700 tons of nickel. Most of these heavy metals were 
found in ash usually disposed of in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning this year, the utilities must report to the  
Environmental Protection Agency toxic releases from coal- or 
oil-burning power plants. The EPA will include the information in 
its annual toxic inventory report next year. In all, more than 600 
chemicals are covered, but industry officials predict their plants 
will be involved with only a few dozen. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers provided Friday covered only seven chemicals because  
those were all that would be required of utilities at this time 
under the reporting thresholds currently in effect, said Paul 
Bailey, EEI's director for environment. Some of those thresholds, 
including the one for mercury, are likely to be reduced before the 
reporting is completed, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists criticized the industry group for not  
reporting mercury releases. It is believed that utilities account 
for about 50 tons of mercury emissions annually. Mercury is a 
persistent toxic chemical that is considered by many health experts 
to be dangerous at even low doses because it accumulates over long 
periods of time in fish and in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA does not require reporting on mercury emissions unless a  
plant releases more than 25,000 pounds. However, the agency is 
considering lowering the threshold to 10 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, seven northeast utilities, breaking with the  
rest of the industry, said they would favor the government setting 
federal limits on mercury releases from power plants as part of a 
program cutting nitrogen oxide and sulfur emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said release data on mercury was not included because no  
plant released more than 25,000 pounds of it, making it exempt 
under the current threshold from Toxic Inventory Reporting 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	While there may be large amounts of toxic chemicals released --  
386 million pounds of hydrochloric acid, for example -- the 
concentrations are ``below levels that present a public health 
concern,'' Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry group provided only aggregate numbers and no  
release data from specific plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also cited an EPA report to Congress last year that  
concluded the cancer risks from power plant releases is exceedingly 
low -- a chance of less than one in a million of an additional 
cancer during a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frank O'Donnell of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental  
group, accused the utilities of trying to ``control the spin'' on 
the toxic emissions issue and ``deceive the American public about 
the real impact of power company pollution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner, meanwhile, has made clear that  
the agency considers the potential health risk from persistent, 
bioaccumulative chemicals such as mercury as a significant area of 
concern. And the agency wants utilities to provide more information 
on releases of mercury and other toxic chemicals.

<HEADLINE> Jury Rules for Milton Berle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Uncle Miltie had to skip his day in  
court, but he still got the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury that heard a lawsuit against comedian Milton Berle on  
Thursday rejected a casino bellhop's claim that Berle hurt him with 
a playful punch to the genitals during a 1994 appearance here. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Cooke, a bellhop at Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, sued  
Berle in 1996, seeking $865,000 for what he said were permanent 
injuries. Berle allegedly threw the punch after Cooke told him he 
looked good for an 86-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
	A security guard, Glen McClain, testified in the 10-day trial  
that he saw Berle raise his hand at Cooke but said everyone present 
was laughing. Cooke continued to work after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Berle, 91, testified via videotape from his Beverly Hills home  
because he is in failing health. He said he didn't remember the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	After an hour of deliberations, the jury found that Berle had  
struck Cooke but that no damage was done and no compensation was 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	Modestino Carbone, an attorney for Berle, said the comedian was  
``delighted and felt vindicated that the jury saw through the 
sham.''

<HEADLINE> Father: Lindros To Sign One-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- There's no signature just yet, so for now  
the Philadelphia Flyers will have to settle for a handshake and an 
assuring phone call when it comes to Eric Lindros' contract status. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros, the star center's father and agent, said Friday  
his son would follow through on a handshake agreement with the club 
and sign a one-year, $8.5 million deal, plus incentives, that would 
prevent him from becoming a restricted free agent. The Lindroses 
called Flyers chairman Ed Snider this week about their decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it leads to a longer term deal the club hopes Lindros  
will sign remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just proceeding in getting (the one-year contract)  
finalized,'' Carl Lindros said. ``We just received a draft of the 
contract proposal on Wednesday and hopefully we can get it done in 
the next couple weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides reached the handshake deal in September after they  
were unable to agree on a five-year extension. At the time, Eric 
Lindros said the one-year deal would eliminate the distraction of 
having contract negotiations go on during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation had grown in the last month, though, with no  
movement detected in contract talks and a July 1 deadline looming 
for restricted free agency. If the team fails to get a contract 
done by then, they would have the right to match any offer Lindros 
receives from another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros said Friday that his son's decision affirms the  
``very vocal commitment'' he made with the team in September, but 
added that no timeline has been set to begin negotiations for a 
longer deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers officials could not be reached for comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't want a long-range deal, and that's the way they  
feel about it,'' Snider told The Philadelphia Inquirer. ``We're 
content with a one-year deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros declined to detail what incentives are included in  
the deal except to say that they were performance-based and 
team-oriented, such as if the Flyers won or reached the Stanley Cup 
finals. They are similar to incentives proposed by the team in 
their five-year contract offer last year, Lindros' father said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached just before Eric Lindros left on a  
long drive from his Toronto home to Florida for an appearance on 
the Children's Miracle Network Telethon. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros said Eric is progressing well in his recovery from  
the collapsed right lung that forced him to miss the last two weeks 
of the regular season and the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The center is experiencing muscle pain in his chest in the area  
where he was injured but doctors say pain is normal for the type of 
injury Lindros suffered and should go away in about six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros was officially cleared by team doctors last month to  
resume playing hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter for the muscle in his chest to regroup so  
he doesn't feel pain every time he turns,'' Carl Lindros said. 
``But the doctors say it's normal and he should be used to it by 
the time training camp opens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros is now undergoing normal off-season weight training and  
conditioning and will resume skating a few weeks before training 
camp begins in September.

<HEADLINE> President of Chicago School Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The president of the University of Chicago, who  
came under fire for plans to reduce the number of required courses 
and improve campus facilities, has announced that he will resign 
and return to teaching next year. Officials said his plans would go 
forward anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo Sonnenschein, 58, wrote in an open letter to students and  
faculty Thursday that he will teach economics at the university 
because ``it is time for another president, one who is less a 
symbol of change, to carry the momentum forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sonnenschein came to the university six years ago from  
Princeton, succeeding the retiring President Hanna Holborn Gray. He 
had put together a plan aimed at attracting the students who might 
normally favor schools seen as having a more diverse campus life, 
such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics at the high-minded university saw the changes as a  
plot to dumb-down an institution where more Nobel laureates -- 70 -- 
have taught, researched or studied than anywhere else in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonnenschein said the criticism had nothing to do with his  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have largely accomplished the things I set out to do,'' he  
said. ``I feel more than ever that because they stood up to 
scrutiny that they are the right things, and now time will tell how 
they work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alum Robert Stone, who founded Concerned Friends of the  
University to oppose Sonnenschein's changes, said he hopes the 
university's ``current misguided strategy can be re-evaluated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Howard Krane, chairman of the university's 45-member board  
of trustees, defended Sonnenschein's leadership and said ``we're 
not changing course'' on his plans for the school's future.

	NATO, Serb Military To Confer  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO, Serb and Russian military  
leaders were to meet Saturday to plan for the withdrawal of 
Yugoslavian forces from Kosovo. The meeting was to take plac at the 
Kosovo-Macedonia border. The Pentagon said allied bombing of 
Yugoslavia could end by Sunday if President Slobodan Milosevic 
keeps his promise on withdrawals. ``We will not stop until we see 
the beginnings of a rapid, complete, and verifiable withdrawal of 
those Serb forces,'' a NATO spokesman said in Belgium.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno praised Mexico's  
crime-fighting efforts Friday after a Cabinet-level meeting between 
the two nations. At annual meetings of the Binational Commission, 
the two sides promised further cooperation. The sessions, involving 
13 Cabinet officials from both countries, reached agreements on 
topics ranging from airline fares to splitting money seized from 
drug traffickers.

<P>
	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- A U.S. military truck went off a  
Haitian road and overturned Friday, killing two American soldiers 
and injuring 14 others, U.S. officials and witnesses said. The 
2 1/2-ton truck overturned about 8 miles from the Port-au-Prince 
airport. The vehicle from the U.S. support group in Haiti was 
headed to a ceremony celebrating the completion of a humanitarian 
construction project, said a Pentagon spokesman.

	Co-Pilot: Approach Was Fine  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The co-pilot of an American Airlines  
jetliner that crashed in Arkansas said Friday the approach appeared 
fine, but they could not stop on a rain-slickened runway. First 
Officer Michael Origel, recovering from a broken leg, spoke to 
investigators. The jet skidded off the runway, hit a bank of lights 
and crashed into a steel walkway. The plane broke into three 
pieces, killing eight passengers and the pilot.

<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- On the 10th anniversary of its crackdown on  
pro-democracy demonstrations, China kept a close watch Friday on 
Tiananmen Square. Police, on alert to prevent public mourning, 
arrested at least two people. Near the capital, more than 20 
relatives of five victims of the 1989 assault held a commemorative 
gathering under police guard. In Hong Kong, the only place in China 
where commemoration of the Tiananmen protests were allowed, 
thousands gathered for a candlelight vigil.

	Clinton Appoints Gay Ambassador  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bypassing Senate confirmation, President  
Clinton moved Friday to directly install gay businessman James C. 
Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. The president invoked a 
provision of the Constitution allowing him to make such 
appointments during a congressional recess. Hormel, 66, who will 
become the first openly gay U.S. ambassador, can serve in the 
diplomatic post through the end of 2000. He is an heir to the 
Hormel food fortune.

	Calif. Blocks Sale of Payroll Data  
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Citing privacy concerns, Gov. Gray  
Davis Friday blocked a law from taking effect that would have 
allowed the state to sell confidential payroll data to private 
lenders. The law allows a state agency to sell personal financial 
information to banks, car dealers and other lenders to help them 
verify an applicant's income, with the applicant's written 
permission. It was intended to expedite loan applications. The 
measure, signed by the former Republican governor, was designed to 
take effect later this year.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Stay Higher; Dow Up 45.91 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today after the government's  
employment report helped temper investors' concerns that the 
Federal Reserve might soon raise interest rates to slow the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargain-hunting after the recent selloff on Wall Street also  
contributed to today's gains. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was up 45.91 at  
10,709.60, adding to an 85-point gain on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher, including the Nasdaq  
composite index, which has been battered in recent weeks amid a 
sharp decline in technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that the nation's  
unemployment rate dipped back down to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall unemployment rate fell, investors were  
impressed by the fact that only 11,000 jobs were created last 
month, far below the 225,000 expected by economists. Another 
indicator closely watched for inflation, average hourly earnings, 
was up 3.6 percent in May compared to a year ago, only a slight 
acceleration from the 3.2 percent increase the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Both factors eased concerns among investors that the Fed will  
soon raise rates to slow an economy that is threatening to 
overheat. The central bank warned May 18 that it would raise rates 
if it determined that inflation was gaining momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	That warning created volatility on Wall Street in recent weeks,  
with investors fearing that a rate hike would cut into the profits 
of major U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report wasn't a doomsday scenario,'' said Bryan  
Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential Securities. ``But the 
market is still tepid and cautious about what the Fed will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also attributed today's gains to the cheap prices that  
have resulted from the downturn on Wall Street in recent weeks. The 
Dow is down about 4 percent since hitting a record high on May 13, 
while the Nasdaq is down more than 9 percent since reaching its 
all-time high April 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest gainers today included Cisco Systems, up 3 1/2 at 112  
5/16, and Yahoo!, up 4 9/16 at 139 15/16, in Nasdaq trading. On the 
New York Stock Exchange, America Online was up 1 3/16 at 106 15/16 
and Disney rose 1 5/8 to 30 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on  
the NYSE, where volume came to 549.15 million shares, down from 
566.32 million at the same time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 16.65 at 1,316.19, and  
the Nasdaq composite index was up 42.73 at 2,446.05. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 6.28 at 630.48, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 5.52 at 781.46.

<HEADLINE> Companies Recall Stairway Gates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A possible problem with some stairway gates is  
forcing a safety recall. 
</P>
<P>
	North States Industries Inc. is recalling about 3,200 of the  
gates because the lock can fail when the gate is shaken and could 
result in children falling down stairs, according to the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minneapolis-based company has received one report of the  
lock on the gate failing. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled gates -- intended for use with children from six  
months to 24 months of age -- are white plastic and a little over 2 
feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	Ames, Ann &AMP; Hope, Hambleton &AMP; Carr and Value City department  
stores sold the gates from March through April of this year for 
about $15. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should stop using these gates and return them to the  
store where purchased for a refund. They can also call the company 
at 800-848-8421 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. EDT Monday through 
Friday.

<HEADLINE>  Relatives View Ark. Jet Crash Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Federal investigators in the crash of  
American Airlines Flight 1420 visited a hospital Friday to 
interview injured passengers, while survivors and victims' 
relatives went to the end of a runway to see the plane's burned-out 
shell. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board wants to know what  
passengers saw, heard and smelled before and during the crash, 
which killed nine people, including the pilot. Among those on the 
interview list was the plane's first officer, Michael Origel, who 
broke his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty passengers remained hospitalized Friday, with four in  
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to get to as many people as we can get to now.  
Those who are in too bad a state, we'll come back and get them,'' 
said Robert Malloy of the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
	As investigators talked to survivors at University Hospital,  
eight charter buses drove down a Little Rock airport runway to the 
crash site. Survivors and relatives were given red and pink roses 
as they got off the buses. Some laid the flowers on a memorial made 
of hay bales. 
</P>
<P>
	They looked down on the crumpled MD-82 from a grassy hill at the  
end of the runway where the jet skidded in a thunderstorm Tuesday 
night, crashed into a metal walkway and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were tears. People as a group kind of consoled each  
other,'' said Jimmy Manus, whose wife and their two daughters 
survived the crash. ``They were glad they made the trip today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some hugged each other and held hands as they looked at the  
wreckage. Several wore neck braces, including one man in a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	``One woman broke down on her hands and knees. I was one of the  
crying ones. It was difficult, surprisingly difficult,'' said Jim 
Yates, a free-lance photographer who sometimes works for The 
Associated Press. His girlfriend had been on the plane. She chose 
not be there Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 investigators are trying to determine whether the  
pilot or the plane is to blame for mechanical quirks during the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	A flight data recorder indicates that the spoilers -- movable  
panels on the top of the wing -- did not open as usual to help slow 
down the plane. Also, the thrust reversers twice turned on and off, 
rather than remaining on until the plane slowed, said George Black 
of the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet landed just as a thunderstorm with hail and 75 mph gusts  
reached the airport. Investigators said the pilot was warned twice 
about dangerous wind shears and received more notice than usual of 
bad conditions as he brought the plane in. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the pilot could have had better information if the  
air traffic control tower had access to Doppler radar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only radar available for weather to the tower controller  
who was handling this flight was his surveillance radar -- the same 
radar he was using to control the airplanes,'' Black said. ``In 
other words, he did not have the advantage of the same sort of 
thing you and I can call up on our computer on the Internet and 
look at live Doppler radar.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Open Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Umbrellas were out and the practice  
areas for the U.S. Women's Open were less crowded than usual 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	No, it wasn't raining. The players were trying to escape the  
brutal heat that has plagued the first two rounds at Old Waverly 
Golf Club. Temperatures were in the low 90s, with high humidity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a large factor. It's starting to really steam  
up out there. It is going to make a difference,'' said Moria Dunn, 
who finished her 1-under 71 round just after noon Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace Park, the 20-year-old amateur champion who is turning pro  
after the Women's Open, didn't wear make-up Friday but others 
tried. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really thrown my makeup off. I've got to keep  
reapplying,'' co-leader Juli Inkster joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one player, Stefania Croce of Italy, wore long pants.  
</P>
<P>
	Many players carried umbrellas for shade. Most took advantage of  
ice-packed towels made available at some holes. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat is also making the golf course more challenging. The  
greens, softened by rain earlier in the week, got stiffer and 
quicker in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelli Kuehne, the first-round leader after an opening 8-under  
64, shot a 71 on Friday to fall one stroke back. The seven-stroke 
difference: 32 putts Friday after just 25 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOPEZ OUT:* This was supposed to be the best chance for Nancy  
Lopez to finally win that elusive U.S. Women's Open. But the LPGA 
Hall of Famer with 48 career victories didn't make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez shot a 5-over-par 149 at Old Waverly Golf Club, a course  
she helped open 11 years ago and plays yearly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely disappointed,'' Lopez said after a 1-over 73 on  
Friday. ``Now I can spend some time with my kids. There is always 
something good, but I would have liked to have been able to walk up 
18 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that this week I had an opportunity to play great golf  
and win the Open. I know this course, but my putter failed me 
yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez had two double bogeys during her opening-round 76.  
</P>
<P>
	Only LPGA career victories leader Kathy Whitworth, who won 88  
tournaments, has more wins without a U.S. Open title. Lopez ranks 
sixth in career wins. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OTHERS OUT:* In addition to Lopez, among the others who won't  
be around for the weekend rounds are Annika Sorenstam (2-over), 
1987 Open champ Laura Davies (2-over) and Jenny Chuasiriporn 
(7-over) 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenstam, who had seven top-10 finishes in her nine tournaments  
this year, missed the Open cut for the second time in three years 
since winning consecutive Opens in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuasiriporn was making her professional debut in the same major  
in which she forced a 20-hole playoff against Se Ri Pak last year. 
After going 3-under on her first nine holes Thursday, Chuasiriporn 
lost six strokes in three holes and never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BUMMED BAUER:* Duke sophomore Beth Bauer figured she needed a  
birdie on the 18th to have any chance of making the cut. Those 
hopes vanished when USGA official Tom Meeks told her in the 18th 
fairway she had been assessed a two-stroke penalty for slow play. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly shaken, Bauer made a bogey and then left Old Waverly in  
tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's group, which included Kelli Kuehne and Jill McGill, was  
behind from the start. One rules official warned them on the third 
hole, and they were put on the clock after the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's infraction came on the par-3 17th, when she played her  
three shots in 139 seconds. The limit under USGA rules is 30 
seconds per shot plus 10 seconds for the hole, meaning Bauer was 
allotted 100 seconds for No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	She appealed to Meeks that while she took 46 seconds to hit her  
tee shot, she had to back off the ball and wait for the gallery -- 
nearly all of them following Kuehne -- to stop moving. 
</P>
<P>
	But her worst offense was on the green. Bauer took 57 seconds  
for her final shot -- a 3-foot putt for par. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I agree with the call, but it's not my place to  
say,'' Kuehne said. ``I don't feel like she took forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PAK'S DEFENSE:* Pak, the defending U.S. Women's Open champion,  
is in contention, only four strokes off the lead at 6-under 138. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yeah, I'm pretty happy today ... no bogeys, you know,''  
Pak, the 21-year-old South Korean, said after a second-round 70. 
``Halfway to go, I have lot chance yet. I'm fine. I'm pretty 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pak hasn't had a top-10 finish in 11 events this year. She  
hasn't won since last July, when she followed her 20-hole playoff 
victory in the Open with two more victories. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HEATHER'S HEAVEN:* The seventh hole at Old Waverly Golf Club is  
known as ``Heather's Heaven'' in memory of LPGA golfer Heather 
Farr, who died in 1993 of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Farr joined Lopez, course designer Jerry Pate and PGA player Ben  
Crenshaw in the first foursome to officially play Old Waverly when 
the course opened 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a life-sized statue of Farr was dedicated near the  
tee box of the par-3 hole that features a flowing creek through the 
fairway and an elevated green. The statue is a likeness of Farr 
swinging a golf club.

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Crash-Landings Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a story about the June 1 crash of an  
American Airlines plane in Little Rock, Ark., The Associated Press 
reported that First Officer Michael Origel had less than 200 flight 
hours. In fact, he had only that much time with American, but 
nearly 4,000 flight hours in the Navy and with an air charter 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The same story said that because he was a chief pilot, Capt.  
Richard Buschmann did not have much recent time in the cockpit. 
While Buschmann did not fly a normal schedule because of his 
management duties, he flew more than the typical chief pilot 
because he was also a check pilot, ensuring the proficiency of 
other pilots, said American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith.

<HEADLINE> Gore Portrayed as Clinton Clone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The head of the Republican National Committee  
said Friday that electing Al Gore president in 2000 would be 
tantamount to giving President Clinton a third term and that 
America ``can't afford it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a weekly public forum here, RNC Chairman Jim  
Nicholson attacked Gore for strongly supporting Clinton during the 
president's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Democratic vice president was part of an  
administration that accepted campaign contributions tied to the 
Chinese military as China stole nuclear weapons' secrets. He also 
accused Gore of being in the grip of teachers' unions on education 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the GOP as the party of ``lower taxes, less  
government, more freedom, stronger defense and better schools,'' 
Nicholson challenged Gore to set out his positions on tax cuts and 
military spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is that electing Al Gore means giving  
Bill Clinton a third term,'' Nicholson said. ``The American 
presidency can't afford it. The integrity and character of that 
office -- and of American leadership -- can't afford it, nor we, as 
taxpayers and citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Roger Salazar declined to respond directly to  
Nicholson's remarks but said he wasn't surprised the vice president 
was drawing Republican criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since they see the vice president as a strong candidate, they  
focus their attacks on him,'' Salazar said. ``They have nothing of 
substance to offer on their own. All they can offer are attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said that it was fair for the Republicans to target  
Gore, the Democratic front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the vice president,'' he said. ``He flies around the  
country in Air Force Two, campaigning, creating new programs, 
buying constituencies around the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson made only passing mention of Gore's Democratic  
opponent, Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson made his challenge to Gore on taxes and defense  
spending in response to remarks made last week by House Minority 
Leader Richard Gephardt. 
</P>
<P>
	While discussing how to raise money for more education spending,  
Gephardt was quoted as saying, ``You've got to have a combination 
of taking it out of the defense budget and raising revenue. We can 
argue about how to do that, closing loopholes or even raising taxes 
to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt spokeswoman Sue Harvey said Friday that the congressman  
only meant to emphasize the importance of education, and to stress 
that it should be a priority as the federal government figures out 
what to do with budget surpluses.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Gets Confirmation Hearings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke's nomination as U.S.  
ambassador to the United Nations got a boost Friday when Sen. Jesse 
Helms scheduled long-delayed confirmation hearings in the Foreign 
Relations Committee for this month. 
</P>
<P>
	But Helms, the committee chairman, said in a statement the  
veteran diplomatic troubleshooter will come before the panel 
burdened with ``much ethical baggage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Holbrooke has some explaining to do, and I and other  
senators will want to hear from him on a number of matters,'' Helms 
said in announcing four hearings starting June 17 -- two on ethical 
matters, one on U.N. reform, one on the conflict in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, a former assistant secretary of state, was architect  
of the 1995 Dayton, Ohio, peace accords that ended the war in 
Bosnia. He currently is vice president of the investment bank 
Credit Suisse First Boston and continues to serve the Clinton 
administration as a special troubleshooter on the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton first announced Holbrooke's nomination in June  
1998 but did not submit it until February because it was bogged 
down in internal administration investigations into allegations 
that Holbrooke violated lobbying and ethics laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investigations continued even after the nomination was  
submitted. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiries dealt largely with Holbrooke's private-sector  
contacts with former State Department colleagues and with speaking 
fees he received. Holbrooke paid $5,000 to settle civil charges 
that he broke lobbying regulations but without an admission of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke supporters contend the ethics investigations were  
triggered by anonymous Holbrooke detractors within the State 
Department and the committee's delay since February also has been 
deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's statement, Helms said, ``I must confess that I  
cannot recall another cabinet-level nomination sent to this 
committee with so much ethical baggage attached to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said ``the time has  
come'' for the Senate to move forward on Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is an exceptionally gifted diplomat. It's time for a  
hearing. It's time to get him in the U.N.,'' Lockhart said. ``You 
know, this country needs his kind of ability at the U.N., and we're 
going to continue pressing to get that done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms said he has not decided whether to support the nomination  
but promised ``fair hearings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He promised his committee will ``thoroughly examine all of the  
ethics charges against Mr. Holbrooke, as well as his role and 
responsibility for this administration's misguided policy of 
appeasing Slobodan Milosevic,'' the Yugoslav president. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms scheduled a secret hearing on the ethics allegations for  
June 17, to be followed by an open hearing on the same subject 
later in the day. He set June 22 hearing on U.N. reform and a final 
one on June 24 on U.S. policy in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Unions End Strike at Shipbuilder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASCAGOULA, Miss. (AP) -- The remaining unions striking against  
Ingalls Shipbuilding approved a new contract Friday, ending a 
three-week strike at Mississippi's largest private employer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pascagoula Metal Trades Council, an umbrella bargaining  
group for members of various unions, approved the contract Friday, 
but did not release its vote numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Council, which represents 6,500 workers, including pipe  
fitters, welders and other skilled trades, represented the last of 
the 11 unions to approve the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 733,  
which represents about 1,200 of Ingalls' 11,500 workers became the 
first of the striking unions to ratify the contract Thursday on a 
286-175 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The small, independent unit of the International Association of  
Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 1133, which started the 
strike, also voted for the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to resuming normal operations on Monday  
morning and to working with our employees over the life of this 
contract to continue enhancing Ingalls' reputation,'' said Den 
Knecht, Ingalls vice president of public and industrial relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike began May 16, idling thousands of workers at the  
shipyard that builds destroyers for the Navy and other large 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Local 733 leaders said the new contract offers improvements to  
pay scales and insurance costs that had doomed a deal last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingalls, a builder of Navy destroyers, is a division of Litton  
Industries Inc., which controls a number of aerospace, defense and 
electronics businesses.

<HEADLINE> Claiming Races to Edge of Greatness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The filly was the talk of horse racing. The colt  
wasn't even a murmur in February. 
</P>
<P>
	But now it's Charismatic, the colt who twice ran in claiming  
races, who can become the first Triple Crown champion in 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, however, remains a very interesting  
conversation piece. She takes on the role of spoiler when she makes 
her debut against colts in the 1 1/2-mile classic on Saturday in the 
Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	It might not end up as a two-horse race, but going in it's a  
two-horse story. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unique,'' said Bob Baffert, Silverbulletday's trainer.  
``It's like a heavyweight title match. You've got the 3-year-old 
filly against the 3-year-old colt who won the two big races this 
spring. It's for serious bragging rights. ... This should be on 
pay-per-view, and I want a piece of the action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday was the third early favorite at 4-1.  
Charismatic, 31-1 in the Derby and 8-1 in the Preakness, was 2-1. 
Menifee, runner-up in the Derby and Preakness was 7-2. Menifee is 
trained by Elliott Walden, trainer of Victory Gallop, who foiled 
Real Quiet's Triple Crown bid by a nose in the 1998 Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday was the champion 2-year-old filly last year when  
she won six of seven starts, including the Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
Fillies. This year she is unbeaten in five starts. Eleven of the 12 
starts have been in stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, on the other hand, twice ran in claiming races --  
the first time as a 2-year-old. Much has been made of his second 
claiming start, for a $62,500 price, because it was only four 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Zito, trainer of Belmont starters Adonis and Stephen Got  
Even, put that Feb. 11 race at Santa Anita in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always get a great line from the $2 bettors, who are the  
heart and sole of racing,'' Zito said. ``I was leaving the track 
one day and I heard a bettor say, `Charismatic was never a claimer, 
Wayne just ran him in a claiming race.' I think that's the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, bought for $200,000 as a weanling by Bob and  
Beverly Lewis, was put in the claiming race by Lukas in an effort 
to boost the strapping chestnut colt's confidence. Luckily, no one 
claimed him, but Bob Lewis said he would not have minded if someone 
had because the colt didn't appear to be worth the investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises own Silver Charm, who failed to become the first  
Triple Crown champion since Affirmed in 1978 by finishing second in 
the 1997 Belmont. Silverbulletday is owned by Mike Pegram, owner of 
Real Quiet. Both colts are trained by Baffert. 
</P>
<P>
	The claiming race turned out to be Charismatic's second win in  
nine starts when the first-place finisher was disqualified, The 
colt then finished second in his next two starts, then fourth in 
the April 3 Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas then decided the colt that Bob Lewis calls a chow hound  
needed to be kept busy because he holds his weight. So in the next 
six weeks, Charismatic won the Lexington at Keeneland, the Kentucky 
Derby and Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic had to beat 18 other 3-year-olds in the Derby and 13  
in the Preakness. Saturday's 12-horse field will be the second 
biggest of the 26 horses that had a chance to win the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest was 13 when Canonero II finished fourth in 1971. The  
biggest field for any of the 11 successful Triple Crown bids was 
eight when Seattle Slew won in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``One reason I think a lot of people are going at him is they  
think he's got to throw in a bad one,'' Baffert said. `People are 
thinking maybe he'll go backward. He's run hard. If anything, the 
son of a gun is going forward. That's what makes him such an 
incredible horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A victory by Charismatic at Belmont Park would be worth $600,000  
from the $1 million purse and a Visa-sponsored $5 million bonus for 
sweeping the three races. That would boost Lukas' career earnings 
to more than $200 million and probably clinch Horse of the Year for 
the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	A win by Silverbulletday certainly would put her in the lead for  
Horse of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said he thinks Silverbulletday has kept fresh this year  
because she won her races easily, and that should benefit her in 
the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand, she has not been pressured,'' he said.  
``That's the gray area as far as Silverbulletday is concerned. When 
she makes that move it's not going to be a 3-year-old filly who 
will run 30 yards with her, but four or five colts who will grab 
her by the throat. She will have to pass the test. If she does, 
Bob, Beverly, Chris (Antley, the jockey) and I will shake their 
hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The field in post-position order: Teletable, John Velasquez;  
Vision and Verse, Herbert Castillo Jr.; Silverbulletday, Jerry 
Bailey; Charismatic, Chris Antley; Pineaff, Sidney LeJeune Jr.; 
Lemon Drop Kid, Jose Santos; Patience Game, Kent Desormeaux; 
Adonis, Jorge Chavez; Prime Directive, Mike Smith; Menifee, Pat 
Day; Stephen Got Even, Shane Sellers; and Best of Luck, Jean-Luc 
Samyn.

<HEADLINE> Malone Wins Bittersweet MVP Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone felt a need to defend his  
second Most Valuable Player award. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know my points were down and my rebounds were down, but the  
people who voted looked at more than just that,'' said Malone, who 
also received the award in 1997. ``This is an award for the whole 
player, for the defensive player and for the team leader. It's not 
just the numbers that show up in the newspaper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Utah Jazz forward had another banner individual  
year that was marred by setbacks in other areas, especially his 
failure to win the NBA title that has eluded him throughout his 
14-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	He knows that failure will define his career as much as the two  
MVP trophies, 11 All-Star selections, two Olympic gold medals and 
his eventual place among the league's career scoring leaders. He is 
currently fourth, and could easily be second within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course you'd give all of this up for a championship, but  
that's not possible,'' he said Thursday. ``I just have to be happy 
with doing the best job I possibly can for my team and for myself. 
That's what I really have to play for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone averaged 23.8 points in 1999, his lowest since 1986-87,  
his second year in the league. His rebounding average was down to 
9.4, lowest since his rookie year in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	But Malone almost always came through for the Jazz during the  
regular season, when they tied San Antonio for the league's best 
record. He led Utah in scoring for the 13th straight year and 
continued to be the Jazz's focal point on both offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone edged fellow big men Alonzo Mourning of Miami and Tim  
Duncan of San Antonio in the voting by 118 North American media 
members. Malone received 827 points and 44 first-place votes to 
Mourning's 773 points and 36 first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone became the ninth player in league history to win the MVP  
award twice. It comes at the conclusion of a 12-month span in which 
Malone wrestled Dennis Rodman on pay-per-view, started a 
short-lived talk radio show, vowed to never again play for the Jazz 
and then returned, all but promising to finish his career in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	He then led the Jazz to a league-best 37-13 record, but his team  
sputtered down the stretch and was eliminated from the playoffs in 
the second round by the Portland Trail Blazers, Utah's earliest 
exit since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole year was weird, so to top it off with this was  
really special,'' Malone said. ``I didn't like the way I played in 
the playoffs, but I'm getting the award Saturday, and I'm not 
giving it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone is the first MVP in nine seasons to fail to take his team  
to at least the conference finals. Magic Johnson's Los Angeles 
Lakers also were upset in the second round of the playoffs in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individual awards are nice because they come with the  
territory, but you play this game for a championship,'' Malone 
said. ``Everybody knows we're disappointed with what happened, but 
this could start the healing process on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, the second-year big man many thought deserved the award  
after a tremendous late-season surge, finished third in the voting 
with 740 points and 30 first-place votes. Philadelphia's Allen 
Iverson finished fourth, followed by Phoenix's Jason Kidd, the 
Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal and Sacramento's Chris Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone grinned when asked if he would trade the MVP trophy for a  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, because I have another one,'' he said. ``I'd trade the  
one from '97. This one is different, but it's still bigger for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone also was chosen by the league's coaches for the  
all-defensive first team, was third in the league in scoring, 11th 
in field-goal percentage (.493) and 14th in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	In one memorable week in April, Malone went 12-for-12 from the  
field in a victory over the Lakers, scored a season-high 38 points 
in beating Golden State and hit three free throws with six-tenths 
of a second left to beat Phoenix by a point. His coach, Jerry 
Sloan, called it the finest week of Malone's career. 
</P>
<P>
	His first MVP award, for which he beat out Michael Jordan, was  
considered by many to be a lifetime achievement award for a 
brilliant career. Jordan then led the Bulls to the first of two NBA 
Finals wins over the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have people talking about this one, too,''  
Malone said. ``Some guys in the last couple of weeks have been 
taking their shots, but they're going to have to swallow really 
hard now.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Predict NYC Storm Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- New York City could suffer huge storm surges as  
often as every several years if the sea rises as expected during 
the coming century, scientists said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven-foot surges, which are now predicted once every 100 years,  
would be expected every 40 years at best and every 4-5 years at 
worst, according to the scientists' preliminary results. 
</P>
<P>
	Such surges could break through barrier islands and flood  
low-lying parts of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and other 
places around the metropolitan area, according to Cynthia 
Rosenzweig, a NASA researcher who heads a team studying the 
potential impact of climate change on the New York City area. Much 
of Manhattan is within 10 feet of sea level. 
</P>
<P>
	The sea level will rise 1 to 3 feet by the year 2090 under  
different possible scenarios driven by such forces as polar melting 
caused by global warming, according to Vivien Gornitz, a Columbia 
University geologist on the study team. 
</P>
<P>
	The study team is made up of officials and scientists from  
government and the private sector. It is a regional spinoff of a 
government-sponsored study on how vulnerable the country is to 
climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were released in Boston at a metting of the  
American Geophysical Union, a scientific society. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 7 million people live in New York City, with 19.6  
million in the metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
	By the year 2090, the number of 90-degree days in the area is  
predicted to reach 28 to 81 a year, according to the group's early 
findings. There are just 13 such days now. But hundreds of people 
can die of heat-related conditions in a New York City summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The final report on New York is due out in a year.

<HEADLINE> Report: Rivers To Get $8M, Four Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Doc Rivers has reached agreement on a  
four-year, $8 million deal to become coach of the Orlando Magic, 
according to ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	The network said the contract is guaranteed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're still going through the coaching process,'' Joel Glass,  
the Magic's communications director, told The Associated Press when 
reached at home late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Rivers hasn't been signed and that the team expects to  
have no announcement through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Sentinel had reported in its Friday editions that  
Rivers met two days with Orlando officials and would be hired as 
coach on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, who played 13 years in the NBA, is a basketball analyst  
working with Turner Sports, and has spent much of the past month 
working NBA playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers would be the second youngest coach in the league, behind  
New York's Jeff Van Gundy. Both are 37. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic job opened when Chuck Daly, the coach for the last two  
seasons, retired after a 40-year career in pro and college 
coaching.

<HEADLINE> Failed Japan Bank Files Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A failed Japanese bank filed a criminal complaint  
with police and prosecutors on Friday, accusing its former 
executives of engaging in illegal business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., which was nationalized  
in October after being declared insolvent, acted in response to an 
internal probe begun after the resignation of top executives. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to asking the authorities to move against the former  
officials, the bank also said in a statement that it would work to 
prevent a recurrence of the alleged violations by reforming its 
management structure. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement did not name the former executives it was  
targeting or give details of the allegations against them. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit bank became the first Japanese bank to be  
nationalized since the end of World War II after financial 
authorities determined it had liabilities exceeding assets by about 
$2.79 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media have reported the bank may have broken Japan's  
Commercial Code by paying dividends even though it was racking up 
losses.

<HEADLINE> Ex-U.S. Immigration Aide Is Accused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A former U.S. immigration inspector was accused  
Friday of stealing and selling immigration documents in Mexico that 
were used at least twice by drug smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel A. Goodrum, 37, was indicted by a federal grand jury on  
fraud and conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrum, who lives in Chula Vista, worked as an inspector for  
the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the San Diego 
District Office where he had access to a safe containing immigrant 
registration cards, known as green cards. 
</P>
<P>
	The cards had been confiscated from drug smugglers and were  
supposed to be destroyed. The indictment charges Goodrum stole 14 
of the cards while working at the office between March 1995 to 
August 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrum would then give the green cards to his brother-in-law,  
who sold them in the Mexican border city of Tijuana for $200 to 
$1,000, Wheat said. The brother-in-law was not indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	On at least two occasions, individuals arrested for trying to  
smuggle marijuana into the United States used the stolen green 
cards when trying to cross the border, Assistant U.S. Attorney 
Michael G. Wheat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrum resigned after learning he was under investigation,  
officials said. Conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of five years 
in prison, as does fraudulent use of immigration documents.

<HEADLINE>  Florida Girl Wins Spelling Bee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The national spelling title within her reach,  
Nupur Lala drew on her natural curiosity about words and her 
parents' drilling. A little prayer might have clinched the crown 
for the 14-year-old from Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth-grader correctly spelled ``logorrhea'' on Thursday to  
win the 72nd annual Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee, which 
awarded her $10,000, encyclopedias, two airline tickets and 
computer software. 
</P>
<P>
	``Logorrhea'' means pathologically excessive and often  
incoherent talkativeness. 
</P>
<P>
	Nupur, who last year was eliminated in the third round, beat out  
248 competitors, ages 9 to 15. This year, she aced several words, 
including ``nociceptor,'' ``trianon,'' and ``bouchon,'' before 
winning in the 12th round. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time she was very determined,'' said her father, Parag  
Lala, a University of South Florida computer science professor. 
</P>
<P>
	The secret to her success?  
</P>
<P>
	``With every word I was getting closer to the championship, and  
that kept me going. I was just praying I would get a word that I 
knew,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did.  
</P>
<P>
	Her parents helped, too, spending time on word drills. Nupur  
also has an affinity for word sleuthing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would read different books and whenever I found a word I  
didn't know, I would write it down and look it up later,'' Nupur 
said as she clutched her gold trophy cup after a victory leap. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was a future spelling bee word, I would know it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Nupur, who plays violin, swims and serves on the student council  
at her middle school, beat David Lewandowski, a 14-year-old 
eighth-grader from Schererville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	David, who wins $5,000, cringed after misspelling ``opsimath,''  
a word describing a person who learns late in life. He misspelled 
it as ``o-p-s-o-m-a-t-h'' instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't expect to make it as far,'' said David, who  
had placed 39th in last year's bee. ``I was still trying to do my 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	April DeGideo, 13 of Ambler Pa., and George Abraham Thampy, 11,  
of Maryland Heights, Mo., tied for third. April misspelled 
``terrene,'' which means relating to life. George was stumped by 
``kirtle,'' a term for a man's above-the-knee tunic. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the contest, other youngsters were stumped by  
``obtenebrate,'' ``revictualment,'' ``banns'' and ``muumuu.'' Geoff 
Misek, 13, of Goodrich, Mich., who spelled the word for the 
brightly colored Hawaiian dress as ``m-u-m-u,'' was eliminated in 
the fourth round with 55 others. 
</P>
<P>
	The contestants, most sponsored by their local newspapers, all  
won regional bees to qualify. Nupur was sponsored by The Tampa 
Tribune and David by The Times of Munster, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyra Davies said she did not feel too bad about spelling  
``roleo'' as ``r-o-l-l-e-o'' and getting out in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a lot of fun,'' said the 13-year-old from  
Lexington, Ky. ``I would have had to guess at a lot of these words, 
anyway.''

<HEADLINE> First Lady Moves Closer to N.Y. Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton apparently is  
planning some political fireworks of her own for right around 
Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
	While no sitting first lady has ever run for public office, her  
top political adviser said Thursday that Mrs. Clinton intends to 
form an exploratory committee in early July to prepare for a 
possible run for the New York Senate seat being vacated next year 
by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a race that could pit her against the Republican mayor of  
New York City, Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think exploring New York is a good thing,'' Giuliani said  
following a speech in Michigan, stressing that the first lady has 
never lived in New York. ``Maybe she should explore New York a 
little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I should say though, I have supreme confidence that the next  
senator from New York will be someone from the state of New York,'' 
the mayor added. 
</P>
<P>
	Formation of an exploratory committee would allow Mrs. Clinton  
to begin raising money for the race. That means she could begin 
paying for some of her travel to New York, for polling and other 
campaign-type expenses. She already has come under fire for making 
campaign-style trips to New York as first lady, and thus at 
taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Formation of such a committee would be seen in political circles  
as tantamount to a declaration of candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Ickes, who is heading up Mrs. Clinton's political  
operation, disclosed the exploratory committee plans after Rep. 
Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., called the first lady to tell her she would 
seek re-election to the House, leaving the Senate Democratic field 
open for Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her it seemed clear she was running. ... I wished her  
well,'' Lowey said. ``I told her I would support her 
enthusiastically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also met Thursday with political consultant James  
Carville. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether they discussed the New York Senate race, the first  
lady's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said, ``They both have a love of 
politics, so it wouldn't surprise me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes, a former White House chief of staff to President Clinton,  
said Mrs. Clinton did not go into detail about her own political 
plans during the conversation with Lowey. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ickes added: ``I think you can discern that Hillary is going  
to press forward and she will be forming an exploratory committee 
in early July and just keep moving forward.'' Ickes later said he 
meant to say that Mrs. Clinton intends to form a committee in July. 
</P>
<P>
	He cautioned that formation of a committee did not necessarily  
mean Mrs. Clinton would seek the seat. ``This is one step at a 
time,'' Ickes said. ``The initial step forward is to form the 
exploratory committee and continue to talk to the people of New 
York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not announcing an exploratory committee and the actions  
taken by Congresswoman Lowey today do not affect Mrs. Clinton's 
decision-making process,'' Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowey, who earlier had said she would not run for the Senate  
seat if Mrs. Clinton wanted to, said Thursday that she had not 
bothered to ask the first lady if she was really running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the law of diminishing returns had set in. It's clear  
to me she was running and it was time for me to move on,'' Lowey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton issued a statement that said: ``Today Nita Lowey  
called me to say that she would be running for re-election to the 
House. I thank Nita for her support and I look forward to working 
with her.''

<HEADLINE> Unemployment at 29-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unemployment edged down to 4.2 percent last  
month, returning to a 29-year low and helping workers who 
historically have had a harder time finding jobs. Black 
unemployment hit a record low, and jobless rates for teen-agers and 
adult women fell to the lowest levels in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the drop in unemployment, there was only a tiny increase  
of 11,000 jobs in the nation's payrolls in May -- a sharp slowdown 
from 343,000 jobs created in the previous month and the weakest 
showing since a decline in January 1996, the Labor Department said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures show that the economic expansion, the longest in  
peacetime history, has given the country a low overall unemployment 
rate while aiding minority groups, who traditionally lag behind in 
economic gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of unemployed blacks fell to 7.5 percent last month,  
the lowest level since the government began tracking this statistic 
in 1972 but still far above the 3.7 percent unemployment rate for 
white Americans. In April, the black unemployment rate was 7.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate for teen-agers, meanwhile, dipped to 12.6  
percent while the rate for adult women fell to 3.6 percent, both 
30-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Combined with the continued strong overall economic growth,  
low long-term inflation and continued rising wages, we are widening 
the circle of opportunity for more Americans,'' President Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.2 percent jobless rate in May matched March's level.  
Before that, unemployment last touched 4.2 percent in February 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists agree that the record length of the expansion, now in  
its ninth year, and its accompanying tight labor market help spread 
prosperity to groups that have traditionally had higher 
unemployment rates than white males. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economic prosperity and low unemployment are a boon to those  
groups who have been faring the worst in the job market,'' said 
Bill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock in Boston. ``When the 
unemployment rate goes down, employers break old barriers and get 
more creative in their hiring and training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said the strong economy, coupled  
with an increase in the minimum wage and an earned income tax 
credit, are ``making work more attractive. And as we do that, we 
have more of a magnet, if you will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some employment gains for women, she said, can be attributed to  
women moving off welfare and into the work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts offered mixed views on whether May's tiny 11,000  
jobs-creation performance really signified a slowdown in the 
nation's economic growth or was a statistical fluke. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, which had grown increasingly jittery over  
worries that too-rapid growth would prompt the Federal Reserve to 
boost interest rates, took heart from Friday's report. The Dow 
Jones industrial average closed at 10,799.84, up 136.15 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ``indicates that the economy remains on a path of  
solid, noninflationary growth,'' said Janet Yellen, chairman of the 
Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of showing a decrease in jobs demand, the small gain in  
payroll jobs could reflect that employers are having trouble 
finding qualified people in the tight labor market, some analysts 
said. Others noted that while May's jobs increase was tiny, the 
April figure had been revised up sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department also said that average hourly earnings, a  
closely watched indicator for inflation, rose by 3.6 percent in May 
compared to a year ago, just a slight move upward from the previous 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists remained split on whether the new employment  
information would make it more or less likely that the central 
bank's Federal Open Market Committee at its next meeting on June 
29-30 will start raising interest rates to slow the economy and 
keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	``This report should not dissuade the Fed from tightening at the  
June 30 meeting, despite the soft headline report of just 11,000 
new jobs,'' said First Union economist David Orr. 
</P>
<P>
	But Merrill Lynch's Bruce Steinberg disagreed. The weak 11,000  
jobs figure ``should be sufficient to keep the Fed on hold'' at the 
June 30 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before today, a tightening was almost considered to be a done  
deal. Now there is a little more doubt,'' said economist Joel 
Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. Still, he believes odds favor a 
June 30 rate increase.

<HEADLINE>  Miller Says Knicks Are Whining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A war of words replaced the war on the  
basketball court Friday as the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers 
waited to resume the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after New York coach Jeff Van Gundy complained about the  
Pacers' play and the officiating, the Pacers responded by saying 
the Knicks should shut up and play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no whining on our part. Everything is coming from  
their camp,'' said Reggie Miller, accused by Van Gundy of taking 
cheap shots at the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy also accused Rik Smits of taking a cheap shot and  
claimed referees are not allowing his point guards to play defense 
against Indiana's Mark Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York coach said he had called NBA vice president Rod  
Thorn about the play in the opening two games in the best-of-7 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller wasn't impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they're going to call Rod Thorn and beg for calls, they  
need to look at themselves in the mirror. They're the ones that are 
doing all the hitting and the holding,'' Miller said. ``We're just 
trying to play basketball. ... It's too late in the season to be 
crying now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series is tied 1-1 with Game 3 in New York on Saturday. The  
Knicks will be without center Patrick Ewing, gone for the rest of 
the season with a partially torn Achilles tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have the advantage. They're the ones who won one here.  
We're trying to come into the Garden and win one,'' Miller said. 
``I don't understand where they're coming from. ... The good thing 
about is we play Saturday night and everything will resolve 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jalen Rose agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're a team that doesn't have to cry and whine. We're a team  
that is going to go out and play tough, give everything we have,'' 
Jalen Rose said. ``We have guys that are going to be aggressive, be 
physical. You have to be at this point of the season or you will be 
at home watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana coach Larry Bird said Van Gundy's comments were directed  
at officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's trying to work the officials, which is good. It's all  
part of the game,'' he said. ``We say things how we feel. 
Obviously, he's not too happy right now. ... It's up to us to just 
go there and play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose didn't think Van Gundy's complaints would change the  
officiating for the rest of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that officials get caught up in that too much.  
They're human, they do hear and see what is going on,'' he said. 
``At this point of the season you have veteran crews and guys who 
have been around the block, so they're going to call the game the 
way they see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game will only be the third one for Indiana in two  
weeks since it completed a sweep of Philadelphia in the semifinals 
May 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been great for us,'' Bird said of the extensive  
time his team has had after the compacted 50-game schedule created 
after the NBA lockout ended. ``We got a lot of things accomplished. 
We put in some new stuff on the offensive end. We've had time to 
prepare and that should help us.''

<HEADLINE>  Sabres Know About Stanley Cup Flops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Six players on the Buffalo Sabres know what  
a Stanley Cup final is like. And all six know what it's like to 
flop. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts, man,'' defenseman Jason Woolley, Buffalo's leading  
scorer in the playoffs, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley, Joe Juneau, Stu Barnes, Rhett Warrener, Alexei Zhitnik  
and Dominik Hasek have all been there. They understand the 
pressures, the distractions, the endless questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of those Sabres also know the embarrassment of being swept  
from hockey's showcase event. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley played for the Florida Panthers when they were swept by  
Colorado three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts a lot, and I don't want to have that feeling again,''  
Woolley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau was with the Washington Capitals when they were swept by  
Detroit last year. Barnes and Warrener played with Woolley when the 
Avalanche swept the Panthers in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek rode the bench behind Ed Belfour when Chicago was swept by  
Pittsburgh in 1992. Alexei Zhitnik played for the Los Angeles Kings 
when they were beaten in five games by the Montreal Canadiens in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the final, I think it was eight years ago or seven, I  
don't even know,'' Hasek said. ``I don't remember too much. I was 
the backup. This year is a totally different experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes.  
</P>
<P>
	Zhitnik says all six players will build on their experience for  
the final, which begins Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody's angry,'' Zhitnik said.  
</P>
<P>
	Zhitnik vows not to be embarrassed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This could be my last chance,'' said Zhitnik, a native of  
Ukraine. ``I know this game is going to be shown all around the 
world. My friends are going to watch at home. I'm going to be 
hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau scored Washington's winning goal to oust the Sabres in  
Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals last season. He was happy 
when Washington traded him to Buffalo on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to have a chance at it again,'' Juneau said. ``With  
all the injuries with Washington we didn't have a chance to repeat. 
That's why I feel very lucky that Washington let me go with a team 
that had a chance to go far in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff and assistant Mike Ramsey also were  
part of a Stanley Cup sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a little easier the second time around,''  
said Ruff, an assistant with Florida in 1996. ``You know you've got 
to keep your players focused and that there's a lot of media 
attention and a lot of things going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey played for the Red Wings when they were swept by the New  
Jersey Devils in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Having failed to grab it once, Zhitnik knows what it takes to  
capture the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kill to win,'' he said. ``Do anything possible -- score, block  
the shots, play physical, even if you're not a physical player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrener says Buffalo is bound to last longer than the 1996  
Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary because you know you're only going to get a couple  
shots at this thing,'' he said. ``I've been there once and I didn't 
make the most of it. I don't want to waste it this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley says there's a lot to handle both on and off the ice.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know exactly what I'm getting into, from the media exposure  
to focusing properly and handling the tickets and handling the 
family,'' he said. ``It's something that our young guys are going 
to have to pick up and learn real fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, maybe the biggest lesson to be learned from a crash  
in the Cup final is to forget it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be thinking about the past,'' Woolley said.  
``I'm not going to be thinking about the last time I was there. I'm 
just going to be going forward and trying to win this thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to cherish this. It's a very special moment.  
And to win, man, how cool that would be?''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Invests $30M in Wink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. announced a $30 million  
investment in Wink Communications Inc., a company that uses its 
technology to add interactive capabilities to televisions and 
telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	Wink, based in Alameda, Calif., will provide enhanced tools for  
broadcast and cable television networks and advertisers using 
Microsoft's WebTV, the companies said in a statement released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wink's Response Network Services collects viewer responses  
generated from interactive commercials and programming. Viewers can 
request information or order products from advertisers with a click 
of their remote controls. Those requests are then processed to 
Wink's data center. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined offerings of Wink and Microsoft aim to accelerate  
the wide adoption of interactive television, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies agreed to promote content and commerce based on a  
standard format, called Advanced Television Enhancement Forum. 
Content based on the ATVEF specification can be delivered by analog 
and digital lines, satellite and cable systems, digital television 
or personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives Redmond-based Microsoft a 10 percent-stake in  
Wink, The Wall Street Journal reported in today's editions.

<HEADLINE>  Florida Girl Wins Spelling Bee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The national spelling title within her reach,  
Nupur Lala drew on her natural curiosity about words and her 
parents' drilling. A little prayer might have clinched the crown 
for the 14-year-old from Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth-grader correctly spelled ``logorrhea'' on Thursday to  
win the 72nd annual Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee, which 
awarded her $10,000, encyclopedias, two airline tickets and 
computer software. 
</P>
<P>
	``Logorrhea'' means pathologically excessive and often  
incoherent talkativeness. 
</P>
<P>
	Nupur, who last year was eliminated in the third round, beat out  
248 competitors, ages 9 to 15. This year, she aced several words, 
including ``nociceptor,'' ``trianon,'' and ``bouchon,'' before 
winning in the 12th round. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time she was very determined,'' said her father, Parag  
Lala, a University of South Florida computer science professor. 
</P>
<P>
	The secret to her success?  
</P>
<P>
	``With every word I was getting closer to the championship, and  
that kept me going. I was just praying I would get a word that I 
knew,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did.  
</P>
<P>
	Her parents helped, too, spending time on word drills. Nupur  
also has an affinity for word sleuthing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would read different books and whenever I found a word I  
didn't know, I would write it down and look it up later,'' Nupur 
said as she clutched her gold trophy cup after a victory leap. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was a future spelling bee word, I would know it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Nupur, who plays violin, swims and serves on the student council  
at her middle school, beat David Lewandowski, a 14-year-old 
eighth-grader from Schererville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	David, who wins $5,000, cringed after misspelling ``opsimath,''  
a word describing a person who learns late in life. He misspelled 
it as ``o-p-s-o-m-a-t-h'' instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't expect to make it as far,'' said David, who  
had placed 39th in last year's bee. ``I was still trying to do my 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	April DeGideo, 13 of Ambler Pa., and George Abraham Thampy, 11,  
of Maryland Heights, Mo., tied for third. April misspelled 
``terrene,'' which means relating to life. George was stumped by 
``kirtle,'' a term for a man's above-the-knee tunic. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the contest, other youngsters were stumped by  
``obtenebrate,'' ``revictualment,'' ``banns'' and ``muumuu.'' Geoff 
Misek, 13, of Goodrich, Mich., who spelled the word for the 
brightly colored Hawaiian dress as ``m-u-m-u,'' was eliminated in 
the fourth round with 55 others. 
</P>
<P>
	The contestants, most sponsored by their local newspapers, all  
won regional bees to qualify. Nupur was sponsored by The Tampa 
Tribune and David by The Times of Munster, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyra Davies said she did not feel too bad about spelling  
``roleo'' as ``r-o-l-l-e-o'' and getting out in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a lot of fun,'' said the 13-year-old from  
Lexington, Ky. ``I would have had to guess at a lot of these words, 
anyway.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Worries / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices retreated Friday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors took to the sidelines to 
await new weather forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices seesawed throughout the session as market participants  
sought direction from government and private weather forecasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were worried that hot, dry weather in parts of the Midwest  
could damage early-planted crops and that rainy weather in other 
parts could delay final plantings for spring wheat and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the weather does not appear to be as hot as  
originally believed and that conditions should be nearly ideal for 
continued planting and growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service after trading had ended called for  
continued above-normal temperatures in many Midwest growing regions 
over the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also failed amid ideas weather over the weekend  
would be idea for early winter wheat harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 4 1/4 cents to $2.56 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 2 1/2 cent to $2.20 3/4 a bushel; July oats fell 2 3/4 cents to 
$1.23 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans fell 1 cent to $4.64 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .13 cent to 64.90 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose 1.40 cents to 76.77 cents a pound; June lean 
hogs rose .98 cent to 52 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .38 
cent to 53.45 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Relatives View Ark. Jet Crash Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Federal investigators visited a  
hospital today to interview survivors of American Airlines Flight 
1420, while other survivors and relatives, some carrying flowers, 
gathered at the crash site to see the crumpled plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was kept about 100 yards from the MD-82, which crashed  
on landing late Tuesday at Little Rock National Airport, killing 
nine people and injuring 83. 
</P>
<P>
	As eight charter buses rolled along Runway 4R to the site,  
National Transportation Safety Board investigators went to the 
city's University Hospital, where six survivors remained 
hospitalized. They also planned to visit other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to get to as many people as we can get to now.  
Those who are in too bad a state, we'll come back and get them,'' 
the NTSB's Robert Malloy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators want to know what passengers saw, heard and  
smelled before and during the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those the investigators hoped to see was First Officer  
Michael Origel, who suffered a broken leg. The pilot, Capt. Richard 
Buschmann, died when the plane slammed into a steel tower near the 
bank of the Arkansas River during a storm. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport, relatives hugged each other as they viewed the  
wreckage. One woman got on her hands and knees and cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivor Bonnie Montgomery sent her boyfriend, Jim Yates, to  
view the site for her, and he figured out which seat she had. 
``Where she was sitting was just burned to hell,'' he said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the group of about 300 had been given bouquets of red  
and pink flowers. Other bouquets and wreaths were placed near the 
crash site. One woman with a neck brace was being aided as she 
walked; a man with a similar brace was in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	After the initial phase of the investigation focused on bad  
weather at the time of the crash, the NTSB said it learned that 
wind-resisting wing panels used to slow down landing jetliners were 
not opened as Flight 1420 hurtled down a runway and crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	During a typical landing, the spoilers -- movable panels on the  
top of the wing -- are opened and thrust reversers are engaged to 
cut a plane's speed. 
</P>
<P>
	But information from the aircraft's flight data recorder shows  
that the spoilers did not deploy Tuesday night and that the thrust 
reversers turned off and on, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is whether the irregularities were due to  
mechanical problems or were the result of choices by the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be that the only person who knows the answer to that  
question is no longer with us,'' George Black of the National 
Transportation Safety Board said Thursday night. Black said it is 
possible to land a plane without spoilers, adding he himself was 
once in a plane that safely landed with the spoilers closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The MD-82 jetliner landed as a thunderstorm raked the airport  
with hail, lightning and wind gusts of 75 mph. The plane skidded 
off the end of the runway, plunged over a stone embankment and was 
ripped open as it hit a metal walkway. The jet broke into three 
parts and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the pilot was warned twice about dangerous  
wind shears and received more notice than usual of bad conditions 
as he brought the plane in for the landing.

<HEADLINE> Two Charged With Insider Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former junior investment banker for Salomon  
Smith Barney picked up information anywhere he could find it to 
engineer an insider trading scheme that earned him and a former 
boss at another company $750,000 in profits, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal charges were filed by prosecutors Thursday against  
Kevin Kirkbride, 30, of Manhattan and Richard Ference, 51, of 
Greenwich, Conn. If convicted, each could face prison terms 
exceeding 10 years, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Kirkbride gained information through work  
assignments, the firm's computer system, by peeking through 
documents left on desks, copiers and printers at Salomon and by 
eavesdropping on conversations of fellow employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by federal  
prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission portrayed 
Kirkbride and Ference as a team of insider traders who violated 
strict rules against profiting from secret knowledge of companies 
involved in mergers or acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	During a two-year period ending in March, Kirkbride allegedly  
stole confidential information about 13 potential and actual 
mergers involving Salomon clients, including Tyco International 
Ltd. and Hughes Electronics Corp. At the time, he was an associate 
in Salomon's Large Cap Investment Banking Division. 
</P>
<P>
	He then disclosed it to Ference, a vice president of the New  
York office of the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Trust Co. who was his 
friend and former supervisor when both men worked at the bank, 
prosecutors said. Ference then bought securities of the companies 
that were targets of potential mergers and acquisitions by Salomon 
clients, prosecutors charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair allegedly agreed to each share a third of the profits  
with another third being set aside to pay taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	To cover up the scheme, the pair agreed that payments from  
Ference to Kirkbride would be made only in cash and in person and 
that envelopes in which Ference enclosed the cash payments would be 
thrown away, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ference also allegedly gave Kirkbride two prepaid calling cards,  
telling him to call from pay telephones and not to call him from 
Salomon's offices or from his residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the pair received about $750,000 in illegal  
profits and that Ference holds more than $1.2 million in stock 
illegally bought based on inside information. The SEC, in civil 
claims outlined in its own court papers, sought the forfeiture of 
all illegally bought securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a release, prosecutors said Salomon Smith Barney fully  
cooperated. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Salomon Smith Barney said Kirkbride was no  
longer employed by the firm and authorities were notified as soon 
as the scheme was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are serious allegations and we fully support the U.S.  
attorney's and SEC's vigorous pursuit of the matter. We will 
continue to cooperate fully with the authorities,'' the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message left with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Trust  
Co. was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Kirkbride and Ference were not immediately  
successful. Phone messages were left at residences listed under 
their names.

	GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) -- A human rights group on Friday  
urged the Defense Ministry to help locate the remains of scores of 
Guatemalans who military records indicate were detained or killed 
by soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Mutual Support Group, marking the organization's  
10th anniversary, displayed photographs of the victims during a 
protest in front of the home of Defense Minister Gen. Hector 
Barrios Celada. 
</P>
<P>
	The group wants to know what happened to 183 people who,  
according to records published last month, were illegally detained 
and in many cases executed by the military between 1983 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrios has expressed doubts about the veracity of the records.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mutual Support Group was formed in 1984 by Nineth  
Montenegro, now a congresswoman, whose husband disappeared during 
Guatemala's 36-year war between leftist rebels and government 
forces. Peace accords ended the conflict in 1996.

	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Opposition lawmakers called Friday  
for an investigation into connections between Costa Rica's ruling 
party and a Mexican businessman accused of high-level drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. intelligence report described Carlos Hank Gonzalez and  
his sons as ``a significant criminal threat to the United States,'' 
newspapers said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Hank Gonzalez, one of the most prominent members  
of Mexico's ruling class, denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez has tried to  
distance himself from Hank Gonzalez since lawmakers criticized him 
for meeting the billionaire at a ranch in Mexico in May 1997, when 
Rodriguez was campaigning for office. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez has called the meeting a mistake and said he had no  
knowledge of the allegations against Hank Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition lawmakers want the Legislature's commission on drug  
trafficking to examine Hank's business links in Costa Rica and 
determine whether he had or maintains connections with members of 
the ruling Social Christian party.

<HEADLINE> U. of Chicago President Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The president of the University of Chicago,  
accused of dumbing down the curriculum with his plans to reduce the 
number of required courses, is resigning to make way for someone he 
says will be ``less a symbol of change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an open letter to students and faculty, Hugo Sonnenschein  
said ``I have come to feel that it is time for another president, 
one who is less a symbol of change ... to carry the momentum 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sonnenschein's resignation, announced Thursday, takes effect in  
June 2000. He will continue to teach economics at the university 
where he arrived at six years ago from Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
	His resignation follows criticism from some that he attempted to  
create a ``U. of C. Lite'' when the faculty voted last year with 
his support to reduce the number of classes in its core curriculum 
from 21 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
	New dormitories, more opportunities for study abroad and a $35  
million athletic center with a pool and fitness center were other 
changes that raised questions. 
</P>
<P>
	With the changes came newspaper stories and testimonials from  
alumni. Many stories were critical of the changes being wrought 
inside the 107-year-old institution. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials say the changes are here to stay.  
</P>
<P>
	``The university is on a course and it's not going to change  
that course,'' Humanities Dean Philip Gossett said of the 
university's changes in its curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said Sonnenschein wrongly took the brunt of criticism for  
initiating the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is the faculty -- not the president -- voted in these  
changes,'' Gossett said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a small group within the university who were outvoted by  
their colleagues decided to take their arguments to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who opposed the changes, however, say Sonnenschein's  
supporters -- not them -- are in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Krane, the outgoing chairman of the university's  
45-member board of trustees, said in a letter to the university 
community that the board continues to support Sonnenschein's 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who had lobbied against Sonnenschein were jubilant over  
his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've really succeeded and now I think we can go home,'' said  
university alumnus Robert Stone, who led efforts to stop the 
changes Sonnenschein helped put in motion.

	TOKYO (AP) -- They are likely to skip breakfast, spend more than  
an hour commuting to work, sleep less than five hours and barely 
chat with their spouse. 
</P>
<P>
	True to their reputations as workaholics, Japanese in and around  
Tokyo tend to live hectic, busy lives with little free time, 
according to a survey by a major watchmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 368 people was carried out by Citizen in March and  
released this month to update a similar study done 25 years ago. No 
margin of error was given. 
</P>
<P>
	Possibly the most surprising finding was that ``silent  
marriages'' seem to be on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years ago, no one said they didn't talk at all with  
their spouses. In the new study, however, one in 10 fell into that 
category. Those who spent more than two hours a day chatting with 
their spouses totaled just 6 percent. Twenty percent said they 
spent about 30 minutes on marital dialogue a day, while 31 percent 
spent 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Citizen didn't ask the respondents the reasons for their  
answers, so it was unclear whether the couples were too busy to 
talk with each other or simply not interested, said company 
spokesman Kazunori Takeyama. 
</P>
<P>
	Commuting time seems to have increased over the years, according  
to the survey. Forty-two percent now spend more than an hour 
commuting -- up from 30 percent a quarter of a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results also showed fewer people read the newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years ago, those who didn't read their morning paper  
at all totaled 25 percent. That has surged to 52 percent, it found, 
and only 4 percent now spend a half-hour or more reading their 
dailies, down from 14 percent 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-one percent said they finished their breakfast in 10  
minutes, while 23 percent gulped it down in five minutes. Fourteen 
percent skipped it entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	Sleep also suffered.  
</P>
<P>
	Only 8 percent of the respondents said they got eight hours of  
sleep or more. About 23 percent got five hours or less of sleep, 
while 50 percent settled for six hours.

<HEADLINE> Teen Says Gunmen Paid for Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The girlfriend of one of the two  
Columbine High gunmen said that they gave her money to buy three 
weapons at a gun show but that she had no idea of the bloodbath 
they were planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish that I had questioned more. I wish now that I hadn't  
gone with them, that I would have said, `I feel uncomfortable, 
maybe you could find someone else,''' Robyn Anderson, 18, said in 
an interview broadcast Friday on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In what ABC said was her first interview since the massacre,  
Miss Anderson said she bought two shotguns and a rifle for Dylan 
Klebold and Eric Harris at a gun show in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, used the three weapons and a  
semiautomatic pistol when they stormed their high school April 20, 
killing 12 fellow students and a teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been brought against Miss Anderson. Under  
Colorado law, an 18-year old without a felony record can legally 
furnish minors with rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes, 22, a computer programmer, is charged with supplying  
the pistol and could get six years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	During the interview, Miss Anderson said she and Klebold were  
good friends who attended the prom together the weekend before the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she assumed Klebold and Harris wanted the guns for  
hunting or for a collection. The interview did not say how much she 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't really seem odd I guess, for them to want guns, so  
... it was just in their personality trait, I guess, it was just 
something that they enjoyed, I guess, found interesting,'' she 
said. ``I didn't really have any reason to believe that they would 
do anything with them, you know, that they would commit such a 
crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``I never could have seen it coming.''  
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks before the prom, Klebold asked her about the date of  
the event, as if he ``had something else, you know, going on after 
that,'' Miss Anderson said. ``That's the only thing I can think of 
that really kind of says, you know, that he had other plans.''

<HEADLINE> Is It Over for Term Life Bargains? / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When it comes to life insurance, now may be the  
best time to buy a term policy; that is, if some industry forecasts 
prove accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of actuaries and brokers believe this is the last year  
in which long-term price guarantees will be available at current 
low rates, thanks to regulations earmarked to go into effect after 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	After that time, they say, fewer term policies will be offered  
with rates locked in for 10, 20 or 30 years, and those still 
providing such guarantees will cost significantly more than they do 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, what we have is a price war going on among  
companies. It's the best time in history to buy; rates are low,'' 
said Byron Udell, president of AccuQuote (www.accuquote.com), a 
life insurance quote service based in Northbrook, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, rates for level-premium term policies have fallen  
dramatically in recent years due to increased competition among 
carriers and the wide availability of insurance-quote services on 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A $500,000 guaranteed term policy for a preferred 40-year-old  
nonsmoking man cost around $995 annually in 1994, while today it's 
around $425, according to Udell. 
</P>
<P>
	All that could change when Valuing Life Insurance Model  
Regulation, aka Regulation XXX, is adopted by the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The Triple X rule change, approved by the National Association  
of Insurance Commissioners in Kansas City, Mo., requires insurance 
companies to maintain higher reserves on term policies with premium 
guarantees longer than five years. Industry regulators had been 
concerned that insurers were not setting aside enough money to pay 
future claims, which puts them at risk for failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Triple X still has to be approved by individual states, and the  
earliest it could take effect would be Jan. 1, the date proposed by 
the NAIC. By late May, no state had officially adopted the ruling, 
although several states have conditionally approved it,according to 
the NAIC and industry experts. (New York has had its own version of 
Triple X in place for some time.) 
</P>
<P>
	Udell and some others believe the higher-reserve rule will force  
carriers to raise their rates on level-premium term policies or 
discontinue those types of policies altogether. He says he's 
certain Triple X will be in place by next year. ``All the carriers 
are preparing for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What Triple X is going to provide is a series of defective  
products ... with no guarantees,'' Udell said, adding that rates on 
such products initially may be low but will be steadily raised over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's an example of what could happen, according to one  
insurer's formula, he said: A $500,000 policy for a 40-year-old 
nonsmoking man would cost around $420 a year and be guaranteed at 
that level for three years, then rise to as much as $2,780 after 
the third year, $4,045 in 10 years and as much as $9,240 in 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, many insurance agents have been urging their clients to  
buy now and lock in a cheap rate or risk such a scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry experts, though, say the salespeople are using  
Triple X merely as a marketing ploy. No one truly knows what will 
happen after Triple X, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a scare tactic. It's a nice convenient sales  
gimmick to get people to buy insurance,'' said Joseph Belth, editor 
of The Insurance Forum, an industry newsletter published in 
Ellettsville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if any states are going to adopt it (Triple X)  
... (and) if it goes into effect, we don't know what effect it will 
have because we don't know for certain how companies will react to 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Hunt, life insurance actuary for the Consumer Federation  
of America, a Washington-based consumer group, agreed that the 
reaction from some in the industry may be a bit overblown. However, 
he suggested those who might be in the market for term insurance 
buy it now anyway since rates are generally low. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to know how this will affect consumers,'' he said.  
``What we don't know is how pricing actuaries and their management 
will respond in an environment where intense competition will still 
prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of households opt for term life insurance because of  
its affordability -- it's about a third to a quarter the cost of 
permanent policies, called whole or universal life. Whole life 
generally offers level premiums for as long as the policy is 
maintained, and a cash value is accumulated over time. Term 
policies pay out when the insured party dies and have no cash 
value.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jackson's Son Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Jackson's 2-year-old son is improving  
under medical treatment in a New York City hotel, contrary to 
reports he was close to death after suffering a seizure, the 
toddler's Los Angeles doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many reports have circulated in Europe and the United States  
that are completely fictitious with regard to virtually all of the 
medical facts of Prince's illness,'' Dr. Allen L. Metzger said 
Thursday of Prince Michael Jackson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Metzger last saw the child in Los Angeles about two weeks ago  
and has been consulting with the New York doctors since the child 
became ill over the weekend. Jackson was in New York with Prince. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no neurological disease. Such seizures can occur when  
a child's temperature is too high or goes up too quickly,'' Metzger 
said, adding the child is ``showing slow and significant 
improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of the child's illness surfaced during a benefit concert  
in Modena, Italy, where Jackson had been scheduled to appear. Opera 
star Luciano Pavarotti choked back tears as he told the audience 
Tuesday that Jackson's son might be dying and asked people to pray 
for the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Morrish, an executive with Sony Records, Jackson's  
label, also gave dire reports at the concert. He said that Prince 
had ``lost consciousness, and his legs and arms were paralyzed 
because of a high viral fever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's wife, Deborah Rowe Jackson, responded angrily to the  
reports by telling a Los Angeles television station her son was 
``fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Multiple attempts to reach Jackson's spokesman by phone have  
been unsuccessful.

<HEADLINE> Writers Clash on Movie Impacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Leading screenwriters clashed Friday  
over how much responsibility they should take for the possible 
effects that movie violence has on society. 
</P>
<P>
	At a seminar titled ``Guns Don't Kill People ... Writers Do,''  
Brian Helgeland, writer and director of the ultraviolent Mel Gibson 
film ``Payback,'' said writers should answer only to themselves and 
not adhere to a code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't know how to respond to a code or a consensus as to  
what's responsible and what isn't acceptable. That is only for me 
to answer in my own work,'' said Helgeland, who also co-wrote 
``L.A. Confidential'' and ``Nightmare on Elm Street 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But William Mastrosimone, who wrote the HBO movie ``The Burning  
Season'' and the CBS miniseries ``Sinatra,'' said Helgeland's 
perspective was ``very dangerous'' and ``extremist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to look to ourselves and acknowledge the effect we  
have in the world,'' said Mastrosimone, contending that studies 
clearly show a cause-and-effect relationship between entertainment 
violence and people's real-life behavior. He did not cite any 
particular studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day event is sponsored by the Writers Guild  
Foundation, an education and advocacy group made up of members of 
the Writers Guild of America, the union for TV and movie 
screenwriters. 
</P>
<P>
	The event comes as lawmakers go on the attack against movies,  
television, music and video games following the school massacre in 
Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Congress have taken Hollywood to task,  
suggesting that the film industry has contributed to a culture of 
violence through the bloody images. 
</P>
<P>
	Callie Khouri, the Academy Award-winning writer of ``Thelma &AMP;  
Louise,'' said the issues are more complicated than simply blaming 
one segment of society. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was surprised when audiences applauded a scene in  
her movie in which one of the female lead characters shoots a man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hoped for a stunned reaction from audiences and realization  
that the character just sealed her fate,'' said Khouri. ``I was 
terrified and I realized that I can't control how my work is 
perceived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Valenti, the Washington lobbyist for the top Hollywood  
studios -- and the man who has taken most of the heat from Congress 
-- assured writers that he would fight for the First Amendment. But 
he said he also will call on Hollywood filmmakers to take personal 
responsibility and cut gratuitous parts from their works. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should look at their creative work and say, `Is this the  
best that I can do?'' Valenti said. ``Is there something here that 
is gratuitous as I define it?'''

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Defends Best-Sellers Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Internet bookseller Amazon.com has asked a  
federal court to declare that it can continue to cite The New York 
Times' best-seller list in advertising discount prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon, the No. 1 Internet bookseller, announced May 17 that it  
would offer 50 percent discounts on books on the Times' best-seller 
list. On May 28, the Times demanded in a letter that Amazon stop 
using the list for promotions, saying Amazon was infringing on the 
newspaper's copyright and trademark, Amazon said in a news release 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times did not immediately return calls for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Amazon filed a request late Thursday in U.S. District Court here  
asking for a ruling that would allow it to continue to refer to the 
Times best-seller lists in promoting its discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The New York Times best-seller list is widely used in the  
book-selling industry as an indicator of the most popular books 
being bought nationwide,'' a company statement said. ``Book buyers, 
therefore, can easily use the list to make price comparisons on the 
best-selling books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon spokesman Bill Curry said the company's argument is that  
citing the Times' best-seller lists is ``fair use -- that it's data 
that is out there and it is fair use to say that something is a New 
York Times best seller in the same way you would say a movie won an 
Academy Award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon filed its court action as a last resort after discussions  
with the Times failed to reach an agreement, Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Amazon announced the discounts last month, it was quickly  
matched by the No. 2 Internet bookseller, barnesandnoble.com and 
No. 3 Borders.com. Spokesmen for both companies said they had not 
received any similar letters from the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes and Noble has a business arrangement with the Times under  
which people who read a book review on the Times' Web site and want 
to buy the book can click a link and order the book from 
barnesandnoble.com. Barnes and Noble spokesman Ben Boyd said the 
deal provides the Times a commission on books sold that way and 
lets barnesandnoble.com use Times content, including the 
best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
	Borders has no such arrangement with the Times, but Borders  
spokesman Rich Fahle said the company refers to the Times' 
best-seller list online ``just as we've done for years in our 
stores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No date for a hearing of Amazon's case has been set.

<HEADLINE> MCI Faces Suit Over Merger Denials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sometimes it's best not to say anything -- not  
only when there's nothing nice to say, but also when you're simply 
not sure what to say. 
</P>
<P>
	That advice holds especially true for public companies that are  
beholden to stock market investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Confronted last week with a news leak that boosted the share  
price of a company it was trying to buy, MCI WorldCom might have 
done best to keep its corporate mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the normally savvy long-distance phone company is  
facing a lawsuit and a possible government probe charging that it 
misled investors on May 25 in trying to avoid paying a higher price 
for Skytel Communications, a leading provider of paging services. 
</P>
<P>
	In one legal sense, it doesn't really matter whether MCI  
WorldCom is innocent of intentional wrongdoing, experts said 
Friday: The company bumbled just by responding publicly to the news 
that it had reserved the Internet domain name 
``www.skytelworldcom.com'' to use as a Web address. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like people, public companies have a right to remain  
silent. But the moment they break that silence about their business 
dealings, companies are bound by a 1988 Supreme Court ruling 
requiring truthful and continuous disclosures to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prevailing wisdom is to say, `We don't comment on rumors  
or potential transactions,''' said Sanford Krieger, a partner at 
the New York law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver &AMP; Jacobson. ``Once 
a company decides to interject, they have a duty to keep the market 
current in a timely fashion. It's like a conveyor belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of SkyTel rose as much as 16 percent to $21.87 1/2 on May 25  
after Company Sleuth, an Internet news service, reported the 
registration of the Skytel-related domain name, suggesting a merger 
with MCI WorldCom could be in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of miscues, MCI WorldCom first issued a statement  
downplaying the significance of the move, then said it had 
withdrawn the registration, and then said it hadn't. Three day's 
later, MCI WorldCom announced that it was buying SkyTel for about 
$1.3 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial statement was particularly vague: ``The action is  
not an indication of any official company intention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to speculators who horde Web addresses in hopes of  
selling them for profit, the statement also said, ``From time to 
time, MCI WorldCom employees, sometimes acting on their own 
initiative, register domain names they believe may be potential 
targets of domain-name squatters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of trading that day, SkyTel had closed with a 6  
percent gain at $20.12 1/2. The merger agreement ultimately announced 
on May 28 valued SkyTel at about $21.25 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit announced Thursday, investors charged they made  
money-losing trades based on the May 25 statements by MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators, meanwhile, are investigating whether MCI  
WorldCom meant to mislead investors, The Wall Street Journal 
reported Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to ask MCI WorldCom  
to supply all documents related to the SkyTel negotiations to 
determine who knew what and when they knew it, the Journal said, 
borrowing the legendary phrase from the Watergate investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps MCI WorldCom has learned its lesson quickly, refusing  
comment Friday on both the investor suit announced Thursday and the 
Journal report. The SEC also declined comment, adding that it never 
confirms or denies the existence of an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	But regardless of whether MCI WorldCom meant no harm, the  
company's actions did hurt investors who used the announcements to 
steer their trading decisions, said Krieger. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, since MCI WorldCom was already the biggest reseller of  
Skytel paging services before the merger talks began, the domain 
name registration needn't have been related to a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's conceivable that there was no causable connection between  
the registration of that name and the acquisition talks,'' said 
Krieger. ``It's possible that somebody was talking about some kind 
of joint venture. They may have been talking about dozens of forms 
of affiliations. But that doesn't get them off the hook.''

<HEADLINE> Airlines Adopt Departure Countdowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attention, passengers! Better be in your seats  
10 minutes before takeoff. The cabin door is going to close five 
minutes later. And this plane will take off on time -- no matter 
what. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the policy adopted by two major U.S. airlines, with  
others expected to follow suit, reflecting preferences of most 
passengers -- who hate late departures -- and of carriers eager to 
stick to their schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being prepared to depart as soon as possible improves our  
position for takeoff clearance, which in turn improves the 
likelihood of an on-time arrival at our customer's destination,'' 
said Al Crellin, vice president of customer service for US Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, the nation's sixth largest and an East Coast  
mainstay, announced this week that it will adopt the ``10-5-take 
off'' policy on June 15. United Airlines, the largest U.S. carrier, 
initiated the move in April with a ``Time to Go'' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Hopkins, a United spokesman, said the airline acted after  
market research showed passengers wanted punctual flights. Since 
the policy took effect, passenger praise has far outweighed 
complaints, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines have an interest in the policy change, Hopkins  
conceded, since it helps ensure that passengers won't miss their 
connections -- necessitating re-booking -- and that planes will be 
ready for their next trip. Getting everyone seated early also 
clarifies how many first-class seats are available for upgrades and 
how many standby passengers can be accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
	There's one more payoff: Punctuality helps the airlines score  
well in on-time and quality ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is information the government collects and publishes, and  
it's a competitive factor in the airline industry, so everyone is 
paying attention to it,'' said David Fuscus, spokesman for the Air 
Transport Association, a trade group for major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines typically retain the right to cancel a seat assignment  
for anyone who hasn't checked in 20 minutes before the scheduled 
departure time. They also say that if passengers don't check in 10 
minutes beforehand, they lose their reservation and must take their 
chances as standbys. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers are being warned of the new policies with airport  
signs, notices in their frequent flier mailers and mentions on 
airline Web sites. To ensure that the policy does not penalize 
passengers making connections, United last year expanded the time 
between its flights by five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this policy, you can get people out on time and without  
the anxiety of wondering if they'll have time to make their 
connection,'' said Hopkins, the United spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers seem pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been on a lot of flights where they've loaded up and then  
waited for late connections or folks dallying in the airport,'' 
said Dan Bartz of Milwaukee, who was waiting Friday at Washington's 
Reagan National Airport for a United flight to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Weber of Chicago, sitting beside Bartz, said she agreed,  
although she did not want to see connecting passengers punished. 
She used to live in Milwaukee and frequently had to make 
connections. 
</P>

	``If it were a matter of accommodating them by waiting a few  
minutes, I would be in favor of that, having been on both sides,'' 
Weber said.

<P>
	So what happens to passengers who get to the gate just before  
their scheduled departure time? If the ramp is still there, they 
may get on, despite the new policy. But if it's been pulled back, 
they're probably out of luck, said Hopkins.

person gets there at the last minute,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Davis Brings Laughs to Sex and City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hope springs eternal for Charlotte York.  
</P>
<P>
	It's an endearing trait that sets her apart from her three  
Manhattan gal-pals in ``Sex and the City,'' HBO's delicious adult 
comedy returning for a second season Sunday at 9 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte, like her chums, recognizes the unalienable right of  
every thirtysomething single woman to life, liberty and the pursuit 
of carnal happiness. But she alone holds another truth to be 
self-evident: Prince Charming is just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	A Smith College graduate and a dealer of fine art, Charlotte is  
the series' designated randy romantic, its Park Avenue Pollyanna, 
its goody-two-shoes straight from a Ferragamo fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as played by Kristin Davis, she is a delightful  
counterpoint to Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), the corporate lawyer who 
argues a convincing case against the opposite sex; Samantha (Kim 
Cattrall), the liberated PR exec whose spin on men is, they're her 
toys; and Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), the self-described 
``sexual anthropologist'' who writes a newspaper column about the 
way-cool singles scene while engaging in an on-again, off-again 
affair with a businessman known only as Mr. Big (Chris Noth). 
</P>
<P>
	``Sex and the City'' was developed by Darren Star (``Beverly  
Hills 90210,'' ``Melrose Place''). But it was conceived in the New 
York Observer, a zesty, often acerbic Manhattan weekly whose ``Sex 
and the City'' column was written by Candace Bushnell, Carrie's 
real-life progenitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrie is the show's interpretative narrator. But as she and her  
sisters hit the clubs, the shops, the sack, then the neighborhood 
diner to sort things out, it is Charlotte who serves as the 
viewer's surrogate. Her finishing-school inhibitions and 
cheerleader gusto mirror our own mixed reactions to the fun and 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis sparkles. For one thing, she radiates Charlotte's brand of  
hopefulness. Naturally. And how convenient! To play anything but 
hopeful (long-term, anyway) would require ``too much acting,'' she 
explains with a little frown. 
</P>
<P>
	On ``Seinfeld'' a couple of years ago, Davis portrayed the  
loving girlfriend whose toothbrush, unbeknownst to her, Jerry 
knocked into the toilet. Afterward, fearing the worst, he couldn't 
bring himself to kiss her. In a better apartment with a 
higher-income cad, this is the kind of relationship Charlotte could 
easily suffer on ``Sex and the City'' -- and recover from, with her 
hope intact. 
</P>
<P>
	But week in, week out on ``Melrose Place'' a few seasons back,  
acting got to be too much for Davis as the devious, histrionic 
Brooke Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``On `Melrose Place,' the women characters were all really mean  
to each other,'' she notes. ``So it was nice to get `Sex and the 
City,' where the four women are all friends and that's a given, and 
everything else revolves around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Charlotte is a Connecticut preppy, Davis readily admits to  
equivalent status from below the Mason-Dixon line: She is a 
Southern belle from Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Does she, like Charlotte, believe in romance?  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah. Sure! I've had it,'' Davis declares. ``It's a while ago  
at this point, but I've had it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A picture-perfect brunette with enormous brown eyes and a  
dazzling smile, the 34-year-old Davis is dressed simply in gray 
slacks and a pink T-shirt, with a matching rose-quartz beaded 
bracelet. Rose quartz, she volunteers, ``is for love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Kristin Davis, the only ``Sex and the City'' actress  
currently unattached, has dealt herself out of the dating game. 
She's just too busy, too nomadic. 
</P>
<P>
	Take the past year, for example. Between her work in the first  
``Sex'' season in Manhattan and her return for this year's 18 
on-location episodes, the Los Angeles resident parked herself in 
Toronto to co-star with Rob Lowe in the NBC miniseries ``Atomic 
Train.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When are you going to find time to go meet people to date?''  
Davis poses. ``And where do you go? I don't know!'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the suggestion that her current series tells how to go about  
this very thing, she bursts out laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you kidding?! It's a textbook course on how NOT to!''  
</P>
<P>
	She's right, of course. ``Sex and the City'' is riotously  
instructive, but only as a social satire, as a cautionary fable. As 
that, it's wickedly on-target. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing about our show really makes sense,'' Davis says with  
been-there authority. ``There does seem to be a certain level of 
freaky behavior going on with men over 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem really great on the outside.''  
</P>
<P>
	Then, for an example of how a man's behavior can suddenly go  
south, she turns to the season's first episode: Charlotte is 
perplexed that her otherwise-wonderful boyfriend is constantly, er, 
adjusting himself in public. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get it!'' Charlotte frets to her friends at the diner.  
``He's from a good family. He went to Brown! Why is he DOING 
that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a funny question with this swift response from Davis: ``You  
have to be very careful,'' she warns other women. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopefully.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Lindros Signs One-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers star Eric Lindros signed  
a one-year, $8.5 million contract, as he had promised to do in a 
handshake agreement a year ago, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros signed the deal in Toronto on Thursday before starting a  
long drive to Florida this weekend for the Children's Miracle 
Network Telethon, his father told The Philadelphia Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to proceed on the one-year deal and not pursue a  
long-term contract,'' said Carl Lindros, the player's father and 
agent. ``Eric made a commitment before the season and after the 
season and was very vocal about that commitment, and we're going to 
move ahead on that basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is the same money as last season, with new incentives,  
Carl Lindros said, refusing to elaborate. In the past, the Flyers 
captain has agreed to incentives tied to team performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers chairman Ed Snider said he was pleased that Lindros would  
return, but said he hadn't seen the signed deal yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sent him a contract last week and haven't gotten it back  
yet,'' Snider said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers had until July 1 to sign Lindros, or he would have  
become a restricted free agent, meaning the Flyers would have the 
right to match offers from any other team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros missed the final seven games of the regular season and  
the playoffs while recovering from a collapsed right lung. He still 
has ``muscular pain'' in the area where the incisions were made to 
drain fluid from his chest, but that shouldn't interfere with his 
recovery, Carl Lindros said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a good summer, Eric is in training, and he  
really looks forward to training camp,'' Carl Lindros said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros had 40 goals and a team-leading 93 points in 71 games  
this season.

<HEADLINE> Local Police Ratings Vary by Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Armand Andry isn't surprised that federal  
statistics show blacks are more likely to be dissatisfied with 
police than whites -- he's shocked the numbers aren't higher. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of 12 cities released by the Justice Department on  
Thursday showed that 24 percent of black Americans -- nearly one in 
every four -- are unhappy with their local police, compared with 
about 10 percent of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe how low it is,'' said Andry, an attorney in  
suburban Oak Park who represents several black clients who say they 
were discriminated against by police. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, the nation's third-largest city with 2.8 million  
people, 39 percent of the population is black. The survey said 31 
percent of blacks were dissatisfied with Chicago police, compared 
with 11 percent of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey comes amid renewed attention on allegations of police  
discrimination and brutality against minorities. Recent fatal 
shootings of blacks by police in Los Angeles and New York -- and 
increasing concern that minority drivers are being targeted by 
police in ``racial profiling'' -- have exacerbated already strained 
minority relations with police. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the survey showed figures were 23 percent of blacks  
were not satisfied with police, compared with 11 percent of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the figures were closer together -- 25 percent for  
blacks, 19 percent for whites. In Los Angeles, 18 percent of blacks 
were dissatisfied, compared with 11 percent of whites, according to 
the survey, which covered more than 9,000 households, including 
about 700 in each city. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the survey news was bad.  
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 85 percent of residents surveyed said they were  
satisfied with local police. Twelve percent said they were 
dissatisfied and 3 percent said they were very dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics were included as either black or white in the survey  
based on their individual preference. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest black-white difference was in Knoxville, Tenn.,  
where 37 percent of blacks said they were dissatisfied with police 
compared with 9 percent for whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Three black men died in confrontations with Knoxville police  
during a seven-month period in 1997, enraging the black community 
and leading Mayor Victor Ashe to create a citizen panel to review 
complaints against officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many black Americans clearly believe they are treated  
differently from whites, said Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, 
who announced the results of the survey in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	R. Eugene Pincham, a Chicago attorney and former judge who often  
defends accused traffic offenders, claims that all of his black 
clients were targeted because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Surely, this isn't news,'' Pincham said of the survey. ``All  
you have to do is go to traffic court any day of the week and see 
the people lined up two abreast in a line a half a block long. And 
99 percent of them are black. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, are you trying to tell me blacks folks don't know how to  
drive as well as whites?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pincham might have a point, said David Harris, a law professor  
at the University of Toledo in Ohio who wrote a report on racial 
profiling released by the American Civil Liberties Union this week. 
The report said the war on drugs has significantly increased the 
number of traffic stops based on race throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody breaks traffic laws,'' Harris said. ``One cop told  
me the driver has not been born that can go more than three blocks 
without violating some state driving law. It's not a question of 
what offense they're going after, it's a question of who they're 
going after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If racial profiling is widely prevalent in Chicago, police  
complaint records don't reflect it, police spokeswoman Lauri 
Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results of the survey, while not the best, are far from  
discouraging,'' Sanders said. ``But we've not heard of that in our 
office of professional standards, or in internal affairs. Of 
course, we get complaints. But not about racial profiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Profiling, in general, is a key component of police work,  
Sanders said, because officers regularly search for suspects based 
on their physical appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to say the whole concept of what we do can be labeled as  
racial profiling is wrong,'' she said. ``At the same time, we 
certainly feel that any officer who stops someone based solely on 
their skin complexion or gender is plain wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the ACLU's report, many people of color refer to  
racial profiling as ``driving while black or brown'' or DWB. 
</P>
<P>
	Andry bristles at the use of the terms racial profiling or DWB  
to describe alleged mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's making something sound sophisticated that isn't  
sophisticated at all,'' he said. ``Why dignify something with a 
high-tech sounding label when it's just garden-variety racial 
prejudice?''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton 'Anxious' To End Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today ``I am anxious to  
end the bombing'' against Yugoslavia but not until NATO has proof 
that Slobodan Milosevic is complying with the alliance's terms for 
a Kosovo peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was encouraged by Yugoslavia's acceptance of an  
international peace plan but is cautious because of Milosevic's 
record of broken promises over 6 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will feel much better about this when we have evidence that  
there is a real withdrawal of Serb forces and when we are moving 
in,'' the president said in an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saying that NATO will keep up its bombing campaign -- targets  
across Serbia were struck today -- Clinton said, ``I think it's 
important that we continue the military action against the military 
targets until we have some evidence that there are more than words 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to know that the military forces are withdrawing,'' he  
said, ``and we want to have the timetable for our people going in. 
We want to have a militarily verifiable withdrawal of the troops 
and an agreement about the introduction of the international 
force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said those steps ``could come quite soon.''  
</P>
<P>
	He said Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, the European Union  
envoy for the Kosovo crisis, gave the Serbs a proposal providing 
for military-to-military contacts that are to occur ``in the next 
several hours, probably early tomorrow. ... Then we would could 
proceed pretty quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, I'm anxious to end the bombing but I want to know  
that our objectives have been achieved,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he did not believe the war-crimes indictment  
against Milosevic was discussed as part of the peace deal. He also 
said Milosevic's staying in office was not part of NATO's terms. 
``That question is left open,'' Clinton said. ``He is subject to 
the jurisdiction of the international war-crimes tribunal which 
means that if he comes within the jurisdiction of any country that 
is cooperating with the United Nations, they would have an 
obligation to turn him over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the administration said the vanguard of American  
peacekeeping troops is prepared to move into Kosovo ``within days'' 
alongside their heavily armed NATO allies after verifying a 
promised Serb withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a military-to-military relationship established,  
at least for the purpose of going over the details and the 
mechanics and logistics of what would need to be worked out in the 
event that there is intent to fully comply with this,'' Defense 
Secretary William Cohen told reporters at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said the  
peace terms included a rapid timetable for withdrawal of Yugoslav 
forces. Once Milosevic begins acting on the agreement, he has 48 
hours to unplug his air defense system and seven days to remove his 
troops from Kosovo, Berger said on ABC's ``Nightline'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a fairly good idea of what is there,'' Berger  
said. ``And I think again we have adequate means to verify his 
compliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just hours after Milosevic agreed to the peace plan, worked out  
with American, Russian and European shuttle diplomacy, Clinton and 
his top military advisers discussed peacekeeping options. During 
the White House meeting, the president and the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff also talked about other NATO contingencies, including the use 
of ground forces if diplomacy fails, although there's no NATO 
consensus for a ground invasion, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is prepared to move its initial forces  
within days of a peace agreement,'' Cohen said. ``The president 
briefly discussed other ground force options, but there were no 
decisions that were made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO bombing will continue unabated until Serb forces withdraw.  
</P>
<P>
	After 72 days of U.S.-led airstrikes, which, according to NATO  
estimates, inflicted more than 10,000 Yugoslav casualties and 
destroyed hundreds of artillery pieces, armored personnel carriers 
and tanks, Milosevic capitulated to NATO demands for a withdrawal 
of Serb forces from Kosovo and safe passage home for refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace agreement, if it sticks, would be a major triumph for  
Clinton after weeks of criticism that the bombing campaign had not 
brought an end to Serb aggression or a solution to the plight of 
hundreds of thousands of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Key members of Congress were skeptical about Milosevic's  
agreement. ``We are, after all, dealing with an indicted war 
criminal who is not exactly renowned for his good faith,'' said 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a senior member of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic must be driven from power, vertically or  
horizontally,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who chairs the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House  
International Relations Committee, said he was ``cautiously 
optimistic,'' adding: ``The proof will be in the implementation of 
the agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a member of the Senate Appropriations  
subcommittees on defense and foreign operations, said: ``While this 
seems to be a positive development, the details of any proposed 
agreement will have to be scrutinized and the implementation 
verified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met in Helsinki today  
with Ahtisaari and talked by phone with Russian mediator Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, who carried the plan to Milosevic earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald told reporters that until the  
allies have better proof of Serb intentions, retreating Serb troops 
would be vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until there's agreement, they're a military target,'' Wald  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said NATO peacekeeping troops  
could begin arriving in Kosovo within a few days of a final peace 
deal. NATO planned to put about 50,000 troops in the Serbian 
province to reestablish order and guard the returning ethnic 
Albanian refugees, including 800,000 who have fled since March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the NATO troops needed already are in the  
region, including in Macedonia and Albania, where they're helping 
with refugee work. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of about 7,000 U.S. troops committed for a peacekeeping  
force in the disputed Balkan province likely would come from Army 
units already stationed in Europe, the Pentagon said.

of Serb forces from Kosovo and safe passage home for refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace agreement, if it sticks, would be a major triumph for  
Clinton after weeks of criticism that the bombing campaign had not 
brought an end to Serb aggression or a solution to the plight of 
hundreds of thousands of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Key members of Congress were skeptical about Milosevic's  
agreement. ``We are, after all, dealing with an indicted war 
criminal who is not exactly renowned for his good faith,'' said 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a senior member of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic must be driven from power, vertically or  
horizontally,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who chairs the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House  
International Relations Committee, said he was ``cautiously 
optimistic,'' adding: ``The proof will be in the implementation of 
the agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a member of the Senate Appropriations  
subcommittees on defense and foreign operations, said: ``While this 
seems to be a positive development, the details of any proposed 
agreement will have to be scrutinized and the implementation 
verified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met in Helsinki today  
with Ahtisaari and talked by phone with Russian mediator Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, who carried the plan to Milosevic earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald told reporters that until the  
allies have better proof of Serb intentions, retreating Serb troops 
would be vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until there's agreement, they're a military target,'' Wald  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said NATO peacekeeping troops  
could begin arriving in Kosovo within a few days of a final peace 
deal. NATO planned to put about 50,000 troops in the Serbian 
province to reestablish order and guard the returning ethnic 
Albanian refugees, including 800,000 who have fled since March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the NATO troops needed already are in the  
region, including in Macedonia and Albania, where they're helping 
with refugee work. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of about 7,000 U.S. troops committed for a peacekeeping  
force in the disputed Balkan province likely would come from Army 
units already stationed in Europe, the Pentagon said.

<HEADLINE> Outburst Interrupts Ocalan Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IMRALI ISLAND, Turkey (AP) -- The trial of Kurdish rebel leader  
Abdullah Ocalan was interrupted today when a veteran of Turkey's 
rebel conflict removed his prosthetic leg and held it up in the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief recess to restore calm, Judge Turgut Okyay  
adjourned the hearing until Tuesday and asked prosecutors to 
prepare for their closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is my human right,'' shouted Naim Karapacik, who lost  
his leg after stepping on a mine during an anti-rebel offensive in 
northern Iraq in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Another veteran, Mahir Akcelik, took the leg and asked: ``Who  
will account for this leg?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protest came after a lawyer defending Ocalan complained that  
families of rebels killed in the conflict hadn't been invited to 
the trial, while representatives and families of thousands of 
soldiers slain had been. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement caused an angry uproar among the families and  
their lawyers, and the judge ordered four of the lawyers out of the 
courtroom before calling the recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is widely expected to end with a death sentence for  
Ocalan, whom Turkey holds responsible for all 37,000 deaths in the 
15-year-old Kurdish conflict. Although Turkish courts continue to 
issue the death sentence, no one has been executed in the country 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan, testifying behind a bulletproof glass enclosure, has  
asked throughout the trial that the court spare his life so he 
could devote himself to ending fighting between Turkey's military 
and his Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan has also invited his rebel group to hold a ``peace  
conference'' should the government respond to his call for peace. 
The government has rejected talks with the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey rules out any concessions to its minority Kurds in their  
drive for autonomy in the southeast, seeing it as a threat that 
would split the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of more than 2,500 victims -- including some  
Kurds -- have attended the proceedings since the trial opened on 
this prison island on Monday. Ocalan's supporters said Thursday the 
trial was turning into a show for the families, who have been 
attending court carrying pictures of their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's lawyers boycotted Thursday's hearing, complaining that  
Turkey was not doing enough to protect them from a public angered 
by their attempts to save the guerrilla leader. 
</P>
<P>
	They agreed to attend today's hearing when authorities promised  
to find them new accommodations after they were mobbed by hostile 
crowds at the hotel where they are staying.

<HEADLINE> Tribute Planned for Jimmy Carter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMERICUS, Ga. (AP) -- Former President Carter will celebrate his  
75th birthday by attending a show in his honor in a renovated old 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
	A tribute to Carter is planned for Oct. 1 at the Rylander  
Theatre, which was built in 1921, three years before he was born in 
nearby Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxine Reese of Plains, an organizer of the tribute, said an  
elaborate production is planned inside the theater, with a birthday 
cake lighting outside on the street afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very exciting, and it is being organized by friends  
and neighbors,'' she said. ``That's the way Jimmy has always done 
things. This tribute is not just because we love him, but because 
we respect him as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many details of the production are secret.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some of it will be a surprise to him. Some, a surprise to us  
all. But I assure you, it will be a fabulous tribute to the 
Rylander and to Jimmy, both worthy historic figures,'' said Sen. 
Max Cleland, D-Ga.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Charities Cleared by State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts' attorney general has found no  
wrongdoing in Red Sox CEO John Harrington's financial stewardship 
of the team's charitable foundations. 
</P>
<P>
	The state looked into the matter after a March report in the  
Boston Herald that said Harrington made large contributions from 
the foundation he oversees to charities with whom he and another 
trustee, William Gutfarb, had personal connections. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper also claimed that much smaller donations were made to  
organizations preferred by the late team owners, Tom and Jean 
Yawkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Tom Reilly, who oversees investigators in the  
state's Division of Charities, said a study of the Yawkeys' wills 
show that Harrington has wide discretion in allocating funds, and 
did nothing improper. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt the trustees have operated within the parameters'' of  
the foundation guidelines, Reilly said in Friday's Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly said he did not investigate Harrington's operation of the  
team itself or his role within the Jean B. Yawkey Trust, which owns 
the team, because the trust is a private business. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as we like to think (of the Red Sox) as a public  
institution, they are a private business,'' Reilly said. ``It's a 
private trust just like you or I could set up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly also said that the fees paid to the Boston Trust  
Management Corporation, a for-profit company formed by Harrington 
and Gutfarb to run the Yawkeys' charitable foundations, were 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's recent request for a new stadium that would require  
taxpayer funds does not mean the trust's business should be made 
public, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Shea, a spokesman for the team, declined to comment on  
Reilly's findings.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week mixed  
Friday, with many investors staying on the sidelines ahead of the 
release of U.S. economic data that could indicate the direction of 
inflation in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indonesia, shares surged ahead of Monday's parliamentary  
elections amid local speculative buying and suspected government 
support for state-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the buying came from local investors who are  
expecting the election to go smoothly after a generally peaceful 
campaign that ended on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	More skeptical market observers said there were signs of the  
government bolstering the market through buying in state-owned 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index closed up 24.809  
point, or 4.2 percent, to 612.378. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 73.25  
points, or 0.45 percent, closing at 16,300.75 points. On Thursday, 
the index shed 190.49 points, or 1.16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average gained some ground on selective buying, but  
the market as a whole was mixed at the end of the day's trading. 
The market lacked fresh market-moving news, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders still hope that the government will map out additional  
steps to buoy Japan's economy, in its worst recession since World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.62 yen in late  
afternoon trading, up 0.08 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but 
lower than its late New York level of 121.66 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine shares slumped on heavy foreign selling ahead of the  
release of key economic data in the United States later Friday, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index, or PSE Index,  
fell 27.81 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,354.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower after four days of gains.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,  
fell 56.07 points, or 0.5 percent, closing at 12,415.54. On 
Thursday, the index had edged up 12.97 points, a 0.1 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices opened higher in reaction to overnight  
gains on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 
85.80 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 10,663.69. 
</P>
<P>
	But profit-taking in the afternoon pushed the Hang Seng index  
into negative territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the release of  
U.S. economic data. The U.S. Federal Reserve has warned that it 
will raise interest rates if it determines that inflation has crept 
into the booming U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed, with the key index soaring 2.5  
percent as investors snapped up blue-chip stocks in reaction to the 
brightening outlook for the country's economic recovery. The Korea 
Composite Stock Price Index rose 19.29 points to 797.50. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly higher. The benchmark  
Weighted Stock Price Index rose 17.53 points, or 0.23 percent, to 
7,590.44. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed little changed. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index slipped 0.03 point to 2,129.04. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower ahead of the  
release of key U.S. employment data. The All Ordinaries Index 
closed at 2929.3, down 12.3 points, or 0.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Share prices closed lower in moderate trading. The  
benchmark Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, fell 
4.70 points, or 0.6 percent, to 739.80. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower. The benchmark Straits  
Times Index fell 13.73 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,928.37. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: The key index closed little changed. The Thailand SET  
Index edged up 0.42 points to 476.47.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Gov. Helping Bush in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLIVE, Iowa (AP) -- Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, who had  
pondered running for president himself, opened George W. Bush's 
Iowa campaign office Friday, saying the Texas governor is the one 
candidate ``who can lead and who can win,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson brought along a busload of Bush's Wisconsin supporters  
to Iowa, where precinct caucuses launch the presidential nominating 
season. ``We're all together, we're going to win this thing,'' he 
said. ``I support George W. Bush because he's the best candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Bush is ahead in most polls, he faces significant  
challenges in campaigning for Iowa's leadoff caucuses. His first 
trip to the state doesn't come until next week, and not opening a 
campaign office until Friday underscores the reality that rivals 
have been running hard for months and, in some cases, years. 
</P>
<P>
	The office opening drew many of the state's Republican  
establishment. ``I've just seen tremendous enthusiasm for Governor 
Bush as a candidate,'' said Rep. Greg Ganske. All four of the 
state's Republican congressmen have endorsed Bush, reflecting a 
national trend. More than half of congressional Republicans and GOP 
governors have endorsed Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, the nation's senior governor, became only the latest  
Republican governor to back Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``People all over this state want someone they can follow who  
can lead and who can win,'' said Thompson. ``He's able to 
articulate that and he's charismatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has scheduled his first campaign trip to the state June 12.  
</P>
<P>
	Plans for future appearances are vague, however, and Bush aides  
said they've made no decision about how hard they will campaign for 
a straw poll scheduled in August, another high-profile event. 
</P>
<P>
	Former cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole has served notice she  
won't cede the limelight to Bush. She's scheduled a ``major policy 
speech'' in Des Moines on June 12 that aides hope to contrast with 
Bush's photogenic fund-raising sessions.

	NATO May End Bombing Sunday  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said today that NATO could end  
its bombing of Yugoslavia as soon as Sunday if Serb military 
authorities cooperate with the alliance's plan for the withdrawal 
of troops from Kosovo. President Clinton said today, ``I am anxious 
to end the bombing'' against Yugoslavia, but not until NATO has 
proof that Slobodan Milosevic is complying with the alliance's 
terms. NATO kept up the bombing campaign today, striking an 
airfield near Belgrade and tanks in Kosovo. 

</P>
<P>
	NATO, Yugoslav Generals Speak  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO generals today initiated talks  
by telephone with their Yugoslav counterparts, a day after Slobodan 
Milosevic's government accepted an international peace plan. 
Generals from the two sides will meet face-to-face tomorrow on the 
border between Macedonia and Kosovo to discuss the technicalities 
for a withdrawal, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said. The West promised 
no letup in the allied bombings until there is a verifiable 
withdrawal of 40,000 Serb force members from Kosovo and more than 
855,000 ethnic Albanian refugees are then allowed to return home. 

</P>
<P>
	2 Arrested for Tiananmen Protests  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Mourners and protesters today commemorated those  
killed 10 years ago in China's crackdown on the Tiananmen Square 
pro-democracy demonstrations. Police, on alert to prevent public 
mourning, arrested at least two people. Most people, however, went 
about their normal activities. Hundreds turned out, as always, to 
watch soldiers lower the red national flag on the square at the end 
of the day. Dozens of uniformed and plainclothes officers kept 
watch. Police briefly detained at least five foreign journalists 
and confiscated their film. 

</P>
<P>
	First Lady Closer to Senate Run  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- ``I'm going to open an exploratory committee in  
July,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today. Forming the 
committee will allow Mrs. Clinton to begin raising money to travel 
to New York, conduct polls and hire staff -- all forming the nucleus 
of a Senate campaign. In political circles, formation of such a 
committee is tantamount to a declaration of candidacy, making Mrs. 
Clinton the nation's first first lady to seek public office. 

</P>

	Unemployment Falls to 4.2 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate dipped back  
down to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in May even though the growth 
of payroll jobs was the smallest in more than three years. 
Unemployment among blacks fell to the lowest level on record while 
the jobless rates of teen-agers and adult women hit 30-year lows, 
the Labor Department said. Even with the drop in unemployment, the 
total number of payroll jobs rose by just 11,000 in May, a sharp 
slowdown from the 343,000 jobs created in April.

	ANC May Achieve Two-Thirds Majority

give the party sweeping powers. The country's largest black 
newspaper, The Sowetan, joined opposition politicians in urging the 
ANC to be judicious with its overwhelming mandate. Final results

<HEADLINE> Boy Kills Brother Over Video Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A 5-year-old boy shot his brother to  
death following an argument over a video game, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Pitka, 7, died Thursday after his brother shot him once  
in the head with a .22-caliber rifle that had been left loaded in 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Trooper spokesman Greg Wilkinson said one adult, a friend of the  
family, was in the house at the time of the shooting but was 
sleeping. The brothers' 3-year-old sister was home. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys had been fighting over who got to play with a video  
game, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkinson said the younger boy, whose name was not released,  
will not be charged. But charges may be brought against adults in 
the case, he said.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Seeking To Use Book List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon.com wants the same privilege its major  
online competitor barnesandnoble.com has in using the New York 
Times' best-seller list to advertise book discounts, and has gone 
to court to obtain it. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 28, the Times demanded in a letter that Amazon.com stop  
using the list for promotions, saying the online retailer was 
infringing on the newspaper's copyright and trademark, Amazon.com 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com is asking U.S. District Court here for an order that  
would allow it to continue to use the list. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 3 online bookseller, Borders.com, also has received a  
similar letter from the Times but has not decided what to do, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times released a statement Friday saying it has no objection  
to identifying given books as ``New York Times Bestsellers'' or to 
the discounting of books on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Times said Amazon.com's ``re-publication of The New York  
Times Best Sellers List on its Web site without our permission 
constitutes an unlawful use of our property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said the Internet book-seller has made some revisions  
to its practices, ``but that is inadequate. Unless Amazon.com 
obtains a license from The Times, they must among other things, 
stop devoting a separate area on its site to the list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com announced May 17 it would offer 50 percent discounts  
on books on the New York Times list. Its offer was quickly matched 
by the No. 2 Internet bookseller, barnesandnoble.com of New York, 
and No. 3 Borders.com of Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com spokesman Bill Curry said the company's position is  
that using the Times' best-seller list is ``fair use -- that it's 
data that is out there and it is fair use to say that something is 
a New York Times best seller in the same way you would say a movie 
won an academy award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesmen for barnesandnoble.com said the company has not  
received a similar request from the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Boyd, a barnesandnoble.com spokesman, said Friday the Times  
is an affiliate of barnesandnoble.com and sells books through its 
Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	``They earn a commission on all books sold through  
barnesandnoble.com as part of the affiliate relationship,'' Boyd 
said. He said the agreement with the Times allows 
barnesandnoble.com ``to use New York Times' content according to 
their stipulations,'' including the Times' best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Fahle, a spokesman for Borders.com, said the company's  
stores have made reference to the best-seller list without 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Borders.com has no business arrangement with the  
Times similar to the affiliation with barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> British, Singapore Airlines Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- British Airways said Friday it has accused  
Singapore Airlines of patent infringement in the design of first 
class sleeper beds, and both companies have initiated legal 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to take this lying down,'' British Airways  
spokeswoman Louise Evans said in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Evans said British Airways ``invested millions'' in its  
flying bed and would fight to protect the design. ``Our Singapore 
lawyers wrote to Singapore Airlines asking them to stop infringing 
our patent,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that Singapore Airlines responded with a writ, and BA  
countered with its own legal order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We unveiled our innovative, award-winning flying bed for our  
first class customers in 1996,'' Ms. Evans said. She described the 
flat, 6-foot-6-inch (2 meter) bed as setting ``a new industry 
benchmark'' and added that ``it is protected by patents in many 
countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore Airlines introduced its first class ``bed in the sky''  
last September as part of a $300 million upgrade of its first and 
business classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore Airlines issued a faxed statement saying British  
Airways' claims of patent infringement were groundless and legal 
proceedings against BA had begun in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have patented our own first class seatbeds in Singapore and  
have been advised by our legal counsel in Singapore and Britain 
that we have not infringed the BA patent,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	It added that the two sides have agreed to meet and discuss the  
matter.

<HEADLINE> TV Exec Wears `I am a Liar' Sign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A former TV station executive who rigged a  
contest so that his mother-in-law would win a pickup truck was 
given 60 days in jail, fined $10,000 and ordered to wear a sign 
declaring him to be ``a liar, a coward and a thief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Edward Trostle, 41, former promotions manager at KNWS, was  
convicted of organized criminal activity. He was sentenced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Mark Kent Ellis ordered Trostle to attend the  
Sept. 25 football game between Rice University and the U.S. Naval 
Academy while wearing a sign that says: ``I am a liar, a coward and 
a thief. I rigged the Channel 51 contest so my mother-in-law would 
win the pickup truck and give it to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $27,000 truck was given away during a Rice football game in  
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of six finalists were drawn at random from entry forms  
submitted at Chevrolet dealerships. The grand prize went to the 
finalist who selected the key that started the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Russel Turbeville said Trostle had stuffed some of  
the dealership boxes with the name of his mother-in-law, Pamela 
Jones, and some of his friends, and later told Ms. Jones which key 
to select. 
</P>
<P>
	Police got an anonymous tip that the contest had been rigged,  
and arrested Ms. Jones after she had picked up the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Trostle's wife pleaded guilty Thursday to theft for her part in  
the scam and got two years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges against Ms. Jones were dropped because she had  
cooperated with police.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 41.48 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today after the government's  
employment report helped temper investors' concerns that the 
Federal Reserve might soon raise interest rates to slow the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargain-hunting after the recent selloff on Wall Street also  
contributed to today's gains. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 41.48 at  
10,705.17, adding to an 85-point gain on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher, including the Nasdaq  
composite index, which has been battered in recent weeks amid a 
sharp decline in technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that the nation's  
unemployment rate dipped back down to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall unemployment rate fell, investors were  
impressed by the fact that only 11,000 jobs were created last 
month, far below the 225,000 expected by economists. Another 
indicator closely watched for inflation, average hourly earnings, 
was up 3.6 percent in May compared to a year ago, only a slight 
acceleration from the 3.2 percent increase the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Both factors eased concerns among investors that the Fed will  
soon raise rates to slow an economy that is threatening to 
overheat. The central bank warned May 18 that it would raise rates 
if it determined that inflation was gaining momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	That warning created volatility on Wall Street in recent weeks,  
with investors fearing that a rate hike would cut into the profits 
of major U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report wasn't a doomsday scenario,'' said Bryan  
Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential Securities. ``But the 
market is still tepid and cautious about what the Fed will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also attributed today's gains to the cheap prices that  
have resulted from the downturn on Wall Street in recent weeks. The 
Dow is down about 4 percent since hitting a record high on May 13, 
while the Nasdaq is down more than 9 percent since reaching its 
all-time high April 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest gainers today included Cisco Systems, up 3 5/8 at 112  
7/16, and Yahoo!, up 5 3/16 at 140 9/16, in Nasdaq trading. On the 
New York Stock Exchange, America Online was up 2 3/4 at 108 1/2 and 
Disney rose 1 1/2 at 30 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
NYSE, where volume came to 318.07 million shares, up from 323.09 
million at the same time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 14.46 at 1,314, and the  
Nasdaq composite index was up 50.77 at 2,454.09. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 4.55 at 628.75, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.82 at 778.76.

<HEADLINE> Congress Examines Olympic Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Olympic officials have turned over 18  
boxes of financial records to congressional investigators examining 
the city's winning bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Three staff members for a subcommittee of the House Commerce  
Committee were escorted to Olympic offices Thursday and given 
immediate access to the records, which are only a fraction of the 
1,400 boxes of documents chronicling the Atlanta Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, said  
investigators most likely will want to see all Olympic records, 
including any files purged from the boxes by lawyers for the 
Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, which contends it owns the 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	While the GAAF will not prevent the investigators from looking  
at all records, it wants to ``direct'' their review, spokesman Lee 
Echols said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be directing them, pointing out where they can find  
the information they are looking for,'' Echols said. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee received a report this week from Billy Payne  
and Andrew Young, the foundation's cochairmen, detailing some of 
the enticements they used in winning the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation hoped the report would satisfy the investigators,  
but the details of expensive gifts, excessive travel and lavish 
receptions only piqued their interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just scratching the surface,'' Upton said after reading  
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation is keeping the records closed to public scrutiny  
and is battling Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker and The 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution in court to keep them private.

<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Like so many drivers on the Winston Cup  
circuit, two-time Daytona 500 champion Sterling Marlin is looking 
to win at Dover Downs International Speedway for the first time in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he's 0-for-26 on the track known at The Monster  
Mile, Marlin figures there are small victories within repeated 
defeats. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them is to reclaim his body, something the affable  
Tennessean hopes to do again Sunday after the MBNA Platinum 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``The G-forces pull everything to the left, including everything  
in your body,'' said Marlin, who failed to qualify Friday and must 
get in the race in the second round on Saturday. ``If you really 
wanted to have some fun, you'd forget the cars at the end of the 
race and do a leftside-rightside weight on the drivers instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody who drives in the race limps for two days until the  
blood gets back to your right leg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dover Downs, where narrow straightaways give way to 24 degrees  
of banking in very tight turns, shares with Darlington Raceway and 
Bristol Motor Speedway the distinction of being the most demanding 
tracks on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its a tough place to race,'' Marlin said. ``Shoot, one lap  
around the place can be tough. ``But to do it 400 times ...'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COOLED OFF:* Over a three-year period, Rusty Wallace and then  
Jeff Gordon were unbeatable at Dover Downs International Speedway. 
But times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace won the fall race in 1993, then took both Dover events a  
year later. Gordon then became the dominant Dover driver, winning 
in the fall of 1995 and twice the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither has won since at the Monster Mile.  
</P>
<P>
	Gordon starts 14th Sunday in the MBNA Platinum 400. Wallace will  
go from the eighth position on the 43-car grid. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COMPETITION TIGHTER:* Very little guesswork went into  
predictions prior to races last season. Just take your choice -- 
Jeff Gordon or Mark Martin -- and you had a shot at picking the 
winner. Between them, they prevailed in 20 of 33 races. Gordon won 
a record-tying 13. 
</P>
<P>
	But 1999 is a new dawn of competition on the Winston Cup  
circuit. There have been seven winners -- Terry Labonte, Rusty 
Wallace, John Andretti, Dale Earnhardt, Gordon, Dale Jarrett and 
Jeff Burton -- in the last seven races. 
</P>
<P>
	With Martin winless since the second race of the season and MBNA  
Platinum 400 polesitter Bobby Labonte not yet on the board, and 
both always major players at Dover, the run has a good chance to 
continue. The record for most different winners in succession in a 
season is nine, last achieved in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIT STOPS:* Ricky Rudd, seeking to set extend his modern NASCAR  
record of winning at least once in 17 consecutive seasons, and Bill 
Elliott top the active drivers with four victories each at Dover. 
... Both Richard Petty and Bobby Allison won seven times at the 
Monster Mile. ... Darrell Waltrip, twice a victor at Dover, hasn't 
visited the winner's circle anywhere in 207 races. ... Kyle Petty 
got the most recent of his eight career victories in this race in 
1995. But last year is one he'd like to forget at Dover. He crashed 
in the spring race and wound up 42nd. In September, an engine went, 
relegating him to 41st. Race winners Dale Jarrett and Mark Martin, 
as well as Jeff Gordon, Bobby Labonte and Jeremy Mayfield finished 
in the top seven in both Dover races last year. ... Pontiac has but 
three victories in 58 races since The Monster Mile became a NASCAR 
stop in 1969. ... Corrie Stott, former crew chief for Sterling 
Marlin, has become team manager for Derrike Cope. ... Casey Atwood 
was moved from 19th to last in the 43-car MBNA 200 field after 
NASCAR said it discovered his team was using fuel that didn't meet 
specs.

</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Keeping up the pressure, NATO war  
planes struck targets across Serbia today even as alliance generals 
began talks with their Yugoslav counterparts about withdrawing from 
Kosovo. French President Jacques Chirac said today that NATO will 
now refocus its air campaign ``to strictly military objectives.'' 
Russia and the West continue to disagree on the makeup of a 
peacekeeping force for Kosovo, but the differences can likely be 
worked out without imperiling the plan, U.S. Deputy Secretary of 
State Strobe Talbott said today. NATO plans to put 50,000 armed 
troops into Kosovo to keep the peace, including about 7,000 U.S. 
forces.

1420 while the victims' relatives went to the end of an airport 
runway to see the crumpled plane. The relatives were kept about 100 
yards from the MD-82, which crashed on landing late Tuesday night 
at Little Rock National Airport. Nine people were killed and 83 
were injured. After the initial phase of the investigation focused 
on bad weather at the time of the crash, the NTSB said it learned 
that wind-resisting wing panels used to slow down landing jetliners 
were not opened as Flight 1420 hurtled down a runway and crashed.

China's crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy 
demonstrations. Police, on alert to prevent public mourning, 
arrested at least two people. One was whisked away by police after 
he raised a slogan-daubed white umbrella and walked beneath a 
portrait of Mao Tse-tung. White is the color of mourning for 
Chinese. Later, eight police officers tackled a young man in a 
white T-shirt reading ``Down with corruption'' as he threw leaflets 
on the plaza. Tiananmen Square was closed, encircled by a high

<HEADLINE> Shareholders Back Laura Ashley's Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The floral prints and bright summer clothes on the  
racks at Laura Ashley stores offer little hint of the company's 
grim struggle to stave off insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
	The British retailer, which made its name selling English  
country fashions and furnishings, recently won a crucial reprieve 
when bankers agreed to let it continue borrowing so long as it sold 
off its unprofitable chain of U.S. stores. 
</P>
<P>
	But while shareholders approved the sale Thursday, enabling  
Laura Ashley to write off $34.4 million in debt, the retail chain 
must still try to recover from years of losses and chaotic 
management, including seven chief executives in 10 years. Its 
survival will depend on the company's finding a fashion direction 
that grabs shoppers the way Laura Ashley clothes did more than a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's difficult to overestimate the scale of the  
problem here,'' says Richard Hyman, chairman of the London retail 
consultancy Verdict Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone can come along and turn around Laura Ashley, it  
will be one of the most incredible turnarounds I'll have seen in my 
time in the industry,'' Hyman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Ashley found success in the 1970s selling women's clothes,  
bedding and other home furnishings. But it has suffered a string of 
reversals, starting with the sudden death of its founder, designer 
Laura Ashley, in 1985 just before the company issued its first 
publicly traded shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite prospering during Britain's retail boom in the late  
1980s, the company had trouble adapting to changing tastes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Laura Ashley brand was very specific to a certain era, and  
things have moved forward tremendously since that time,'' says 
Matthew McEachran of the brokerage Investec Henderson Crosthwaite. 
</P>
<P>
	After rallying in 1996, Laura Ashley's stock price began a long  
slide from a peak of 210 pence, or $1.30, to its current level of 
13.5 pence, or 21.8 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, the chain has fought to stay in business by cutting  
costs and trying to broaden its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Ashley reported an annual pretax loss of 16.7 million  
pounds, or $26.7 million, for the year ending January 1999, 
compared to a 25.5 million pound, or $40.8 million, loss the year 
before. Almost all of the latest loss is attributable to its U.S. 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Ashley began selling in the United States during a wave of  
aggressive expansion in the 1980s and early 1990s. But its business 
here has suffered for years, and the company is now selling 106 
North American stores to a group supported by Malayan United 
Industries, the Malaysian firm that last year injected 44 million 
pounds or $70 million into Laura Ashley in exchange for a 40 
percent stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Company secretary Stephen Cox has said that despite a lengthy  
search for a buyer, the management buyout team was the only one 
that made a formal offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, announced April 28, leaves Laura Ashley with some 300  
stores in Britain and continental Europe and an additional 200 
franchised and licensed stores in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Its cash flow should benefit further from shareholders' approval  
on Thursday of a 25.9 million pound, or $41.4 million, rights 
issue, which lets them buy new stock at a discounted price. 
</P>
<P>
	Money from the rights issue will allow the company to pay back  
its banks, cover the costs of selling its North American business 
and finance its remaining operations, according to Kwan Cheong Ng, 
who earlier this year became Laura Ashley's latest chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if it succeeds in shoring up its finances, Laura Ashley  
still must find a way to make its goods attractive to a new 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think their product range is not focused. I think it's  
expensive for what it is, and it's not distinctive. It's hard to 
see who Laura Ashley is aiming at,'' said Hyman, the London-based 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition, meanwhile, is getting tougher in all of the  
company's product lines. 
</P>
<P>
	At its store on Oxford Street, downtown London's busiest  
shopping avenue, a dozen women browsed recently among merchandise 
ranging from straw hats and lavender frocks to armchairs and 
ceramic tiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Ludlow, 51, was visiting from the suburb of Barking,  
Essex. She said she has long associated the Laura Ashley brand with 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she said, the shop's cotton T-shirts and linen pants were  
60 percent more expensive than comparable clothes at a Marks &AMP; 
Spencer department store across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bit of a difference when you have to count your  
pennies,'' Ludlow said, leaving the store toting only her purse.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Partners Make Cocaine Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials said Friday they and  
international authorities had seized more than 11 tons of cocaine 
in six incidents in the Caribbean during the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	They estimated that the seizures prevented 103 million  
street-level doses from reaching the United States, the Caribbean 
Islands, Europe and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two largest and most recent cases, the HMS Marlborough,  
carrying U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement detachments, boarded the 
China Breeze and the Castor. 
</P>

	The China Breeze, a Panamanian-registered merchant ship, was  
boarded May 27 south of Puerto Rico. Hidden amid the cargo and 
behind concealed panels were 8,800 pounds of cocaine, the 11th 
largest seizure in maritime history, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Castor, also a Panamanian-registered ship, was boarded May  
31 north of Venezuela. It had 8,687 pounds of cocaine aboard, the 
12th largest seizure on record. 
</P>
<P>
	The ships were being escorted to Galveston, Texas, and Miami for  
continued investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, British Defense Secretary George Robertson said:  
``One drug bust of four tons of cocaine is good. Two in one week is 
even better. And we will not give up here. We will continue to 
catch the people who deal in drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interdiction efforts were carried out by Britain's Royal  
Navy, as well as the U.S. Coast Guard, Navy, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, FBI and Customs Service and Puerto Rico's Forces 
United for Rapid Action.

	The organizations were operating as part of the maritime  
component of the president's National Drug Control Strategy, 
supervised by Barry McCaffrey, head of the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Enforce Crew Rest Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American Airlines pilots union said Friday  
it had been told by the head of the Federal Aviation Administration 
that the agency will begin strictly enforcing crew rest regulations 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came three days after an American Airlines jet  
crashed on landing in Little Rock, Ark., at the end of a long day 
for the two-person flight crew, although the FAA said the decision 
was not related to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, airline pilots cannot fly more than eight  
hours in a 24-hour period. They also must be able to rest for eight 
hours in that same span. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the crew that crashed, the pilots had been on  
duty 13 1/2 hours, near American's 14-hour duty limit and within three 
hours of when they would have had to start their FAA-mandated rest 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots claim airlines routinely violate the tenor of the rest  
rules, especially with backup crews. They can be on standby status 
for days without being told when they should rest. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a reserve pilot might awaken at 7 a.m. and not be  
told until 8 p.m. of a flight assignment beginning at 10 p.m. The 
pilot might then be expected to complete his allotted eight hours 
of flying time over a 10-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
	In such a case, the pilot would be awake for 27 consecutive  
hours. Within 24 hours, he should have received eight hours of 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of compliance has become an industrywide problem and  
a major cause of pilot fatigue that is seriously compromising 
aviation safety,'' said Capt. Richard Rubin, a spokesman for the 
Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 9,600 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration announced in 1995 that it  
intended to resolve the dispute over crew rest. It proposed a rule 
allowing up to 10 hours of flight time, but within a 14-hour duty 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	During ``duty'' time, crews may not be flying, but they may be  
at the airport, checking in for a flight or on a layover. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA proposal would have done three things: given airlines  
two more hours of flight time, given pilots unions a defined duty 
period and given passengers the benefit of having crews who receive 
a 10-hour off-duty period -- two hours more than the current rest 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Various factions balked at the proposal, and in February a  
rule-making body told the FAA there was no consensus within the 
aviation community on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, FAA Administrator Jane Garvey met with  
representatives of the Allied Pilots Association. They came away 
saying she told them the agency would publicize its intent to 
enforce the existing rules next week and begin doing so at the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesmen would say only that Garvey had met with the union.  
They referred reporters to a statement on the agency's Web site, 
which stated that the FAA ``will soon place a notice in the Federal 
Register stating its intent to enforce the current regulations 
until a new proposed rule is developed and made part of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the statement was affected by the crash, FAA  
spokesman Eliot Brenner said: ``The meeting had been scheduled for 
at least two weeks.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton makes it official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Asssociated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- Hillary Rodham Clinton made it official Friday: She  
will begin raising money to travel to New York, conduct polls and 
hire staff -- all forming the nucleus of a Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to open an exploratory committee in July. And then  
I'll spend some time -- a lot of time -- in New York listening to 
people and I'm looking forward to that,'' Mrs. Clinton announced 
almost offhandedly at the end of an ABC ``Good Morning America'' 
broadcast on youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In political circles, formation of such a committee is  
tantamount to a declaration of candidacy, making Mrs. Clinton the 
nation's first first lady to seek public office for herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's running for office. She's running,'' said James  
Carville, the political mastermind of Bill Clinton's 1992 
presidential victory and an informal adviser to Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	At the helm of Mrs. Clinton's political operation, Harold Ickes  
said her decision -- not yet cemented in stone but in a state of 
``high mull'' -- is driven by a commitment to public service and a 
realization that ``in order to be effective in public service, you 
need a platform, a structure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be sort of a wandering minstrel. She herself likes  
structure,'' Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of her announcement, a group called Conservatives  
for Effective Leadership alerted reporters that it was creating a 
new political action committee -- complete with direct-mail campaign 
and mass-media advertising -- to oppose any ``Hillary for Senate'' 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has she ever introduced a piece of legislation, run a business  
or even served on her local school board? The answer is no,'' said 
radio talk show host and CEL president Gary Nolan. ``She is only a 
leader to those liberals that confuse words with action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers to the first lady, a Yale-trained lawyer who led her  
husband's efforts in Arkansas to reform the state's schools and in 
the White House to overhaul health policy, said she is prepared for 
a political brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a race that could pit her against the no-holds-barred  
Republican mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has sugar coated how tough this will be for her,'' said  
media adviser Mandy Grunwald, a veteran of Bill Clinton's 
presidential campaign who is likely to enlist in Mrs. Clinton's 
Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``She knows, she's been told and she's proceeding,'' Grunwald  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exploratory committee, which can raise money within federal  
contribution limits of $1,000 per individual and $5,000 for a 
political action committee, is meant to quiet a bubbling 
controversy over Mrs. Clinton's testing-the-waters trips through 
New York under the guise of official business on the taxpayers' 
dime. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't need to wander into that thicket,'' said Democratic  
political consultant Jim Duffy, who estimated that Mrs. Clinton 
will need to raise between $20 million and $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's got to be very careful. They need to raise money and put  
it in the bank so this conflict-of-interest thing doesn't become a 
problem,'' Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's political team plans to be prepared to begin  
collecting money almost as soon as she forms the committee. Ickes 
said her first trip on the committee's tab will come in early July. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to say when she establishes the exploratory  
committee she will be in position to ask people almost immediately 
for contributions,'' Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Mrs. Clinton be making fund-raising calls herself?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know yet. That is still very much in flux,'' Ickes  
said. ``Typically what happens in these things is she will contact 
people and ask them for support and have somebody else come in 
behind her and actually ask for the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, the Schenectady County Democratic Committee  
became the first county organization in New York to endorse -- by 
unanimous approval of about 100 local party leaders -- the first 
lady as a Senate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Carville, who met with Mrs. Clinton at the White House earlier  
Thursday, said he will help with her campaign, but said he would 
not have an official staff role. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exploratory committee underway, Mrs. Clinton must next  
``start thinking about a timetable, thinking about people, putting 
a staff together. There's a gazillion things you have to do,'' 
Carville said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointing up the juggling act Mrs. Clinton will have to master,  
those gazillion things will wait until she completes a 
long-planned, two-week trip later this month through Europe and the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will slow her down a little bit,'' said Grunwald, who  
nonetheless contended it is a political plus for Mrs. Clinton to 
remind New Yorkers now of her international reputation as an 
advocate for women and children.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Relese WR Brian Blades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Veteran Brian Blades, second only to Hall  
of Famer Steve Largent among Seattle Seahawks receivers, was 
released by the team Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blades, 33, said he hoped to sign with another club.  
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks also announced the signing of veteran wide receiver  
Charles Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Blades, the team's top draft choice in 1988, is second in club  
history with 581 receptions for 7,620 yards, with 17 100-yard 
games. He played in 156 games with 122 starts and ranks fourth on 
the team with 34 receiving touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Blades set a team record with 81 receptions in 1994. He was a  
unanimous all-rookie selection in 1988 and a Pro Bowl selection in 
1989, when he also was named the team's Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
	Blades had five 70-catch seasons and topped 1,000 yards four  
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan joins the Seahawks after three seasons with Miami, two  
with Green Bay and one with the Los Angeles Raiders, when he was on 
injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Jordan played in three of Miami's first four games  
before going on the injured reserve list the rest of the season 
with a groin injury.

<HEADLINE> Civil War Descendant Sues Appraiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The great-great-grandson of a general who  
ordered a bloody failed Civil War charge that forced the 
Confederacy from Gettsyburg told a jury Friday a respected antiques 
dealer swindled him out of the general's valuable keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
	George Pickett V said he was fooled into selling a trunk full of  
items to Russ Pritchard, a frequent guest on PBS' ``The Antiques 
Road Show,'' for one-tenth their value. 
</P>
<P>
	Pritchard paid Pickett $87,500 for the keepsakes, which included  
Confederate Gen. George Pickett's map of Gettysburg, parts of his 
uniform, a lock of his hair and several hundred original Civil War 
documents and letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, Pritchard sold the items for $870,000 to the  
city of Harrisburg for its planned National Civil War Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was swindled. We'd rather have our things back,'' Pickett  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Pickett's charge across a mile of open field ended with  
half of his 15,000 troops killed, captured, or injured, ending the 
Battle of Gettysburg and driving Confederate troops out of the 
North for the rest of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickett contends Pritchard duped him by posing as a Harrisburg  
representative and purposely underappraising the items so he could 
make a significant profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Pritchard, of American Ordnance Preservation Association in Bryn  
Mawr, denies the allegations. Both he and the city are defendants 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Pritchard said Pickett himself set the price, and also received  
a computer, a copier, and a surfing trip to Costa Rica in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kapelsohn and the city's attorney, Jeffrey McCarron, said  
Pickett should have been more responsible in finding out what the 
antiques were worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jo Roycroft Pickett, Pickett's wife, acknowledged that  
they should have gotten more information, she said she was swayed 
by a letter from the mayor of Harrisburg that stated Pritchard was 
an official representative of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I trusted Russ Pritchard,'' she said. ``We thought we had an  
expert from the city.''

<HEADLINE> Familiar Foes Fight To Unify Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- It's the biggest bout, biggest payday and  
toughest fight either Roy Jones Jr. or Reggie Johnson has ever had. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them will step out of the ring tonight with a unified  
light heavyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a battle, the real thing,'' Johnson said.  
``This is the chance we've both been waiting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who holds the WBC and WBA light heavyweight  
championships, and Johnson, the IBF titleholder, believe they have 
been pointed towards this match for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always known Reggie can fight and we've always wanted the  
same things,'' Jones said. ``It was only a matter of time before we 
had to see which one of us got what we wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There hasn't been an undisputed light heavyweight champion since  
Michael Spinks relinquished the title in 1985 to successfully 
campaign for the IBF heavyweight championship against Larry Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Jones, a former IBF middleweight and super  
middleweight champion, won the WBC light heavyweight title in 1996, 
lost on a disqualification to Montell Griffin in 1997 and regained 
the title with a first-round knockout of Griffin later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones added the WBA title by outpointing Lou Del Valle last July  
18. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 32, a left-hander, won the WBA light heavyweight title  
in 1992 and lost it in 1993. After failing twice to regain it, he 
became IBF champion by knocking out William Guthrie in the fifth 
round on Feb. 6, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The anticipated $5 million purse for tonight's HBO headliner  
will be the biggest of Jones' career. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who will defend his titles for the fifth time in the last  
year and a half, is a heavy favorite to grab his third 
championship. Even Johnson acknowledges his underdog role. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest fight of my life, and Roy's life too,''  
Johnson said. ``And I know what people expect. They call him the 
world's best boxer pound-for-pound, but I also know what I expect 
and I'm going to shock everyone. I can't predict a round. I can't 
say exactly how. But I know I'm going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones also sees Johnson as his biggest challenge, but believes  
tonight's fight will be his biggest victory as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can't outbox me,'' Jones said. ``So he'll be going for a  
knockout. If he presses me too much, it won't last long. I'll 
finish him.''

<HEADLINE> Charlie Sanders Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Former Detroit Lions tight end and coach  
Charlie Sanders was released on bond after being charged with 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Oakland County sheriff's deputies arrested Sanders, 52,  
about 11:45 p.m. Wednesday at his home after his wife Georgianna 
called 911, Lt. Robert Smith said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who is 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, punched his wife in the  
forehead, then bit her lip, police and prosecutors told The Oakland 
Press of Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was cooperative with the arresting officers, Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	District Court Magistrate Marie Soma arraigned Sanders on the  
misdemeanor charge, punishable by up to 93 days in jail, and 
scheduled a June 10 pretrial hearing. A condition of Sanders' 
$1,000 personal bond was that he have no contact with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' attorney Steven Cabadas called the matter a family  
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't any domestic violence,'' Cabadas said. ``It's a  
matter the family wants to resolve by themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders played for the Lions from 1968-1977 and remains third on  
the club's all-time list with 336 receptions. He was on the 
coaching staff for eight years and rejoined the Lions as a scout in 
1998.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Close Higher; Dow Up 136.15 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices rose smartly on Wall Street today as  
traders were pleasantly surprised by the government's report that 
inflation and the economy weren't running rampant after all. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's employment report helped temper investors'  
concerns that the Federal Reserve might soon raise interest rates 
to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargain-hunting that followed the recent selloff on Wall Street  
also contributed to today's gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was up 136.15 to close at  
10,799.84, adding to an 85-point gain on Thursday. For the week, 
the Dow was up 240.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher, including the Nasdaq  
composite index, which has been battered in recent weeks amid a 
sharp decline in technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 28.17 to 1,327.71, and the Nasdaq  
composite index was up 60.72 to 2,464.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,838 up, 1,118 down and 602 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 689.91 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
716.15 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 10.32 to 634.52, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.04 to 780.98 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.35 to 442.33.  
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that the nation's  
unemployment rate dipped back down to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent 
in May. But investors were particularly impressed by the fact that 
only 11,000 jobs were created last month, far below the 225,000 
expected by economists, a sign that the economy is growing 
moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	Another indicator closely watched for signs of inflation,  
average hourly earnings, was up 3.6 percent in May compared to a 
year ago, only a slight acceleration from a 3.2 percent increase 
the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Both factors eased concerns among investors that the Fed will  
soon raise rates to slow an economy that is threatening to 
overheat. The central bank warned May 18 that it would raise rates 
if it determined that inflation was gaining momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors may feel like the worst news on that front has  
already occurred,'' said Bob Dickey, managing director of technical 
analysis at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's warning has created volatility on Wall Street in  
recent weeks, with investors fearing a rate hike would cut into the 
profits of major U.S. companies. But analysts suggested that the 
weeks between the Fed's initial hint and the June 29 meeting of its 
Open Market Committee are giving investors time to get used to the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also attributed today's gains to the cheap prices that  
have resulted from the downturn on Wall Street in recent weeks. The 
Dow is down about 4 percent since hitting a record high on May 13, 
while the Nasdaq is down more than 9 percent since reaching its 
all-time high April 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq posted its strongest gain since April 21, led by  
Cisco Systems and Yahoo! On the New York Stock Exchange, America 
Online and Disney were among the biggest gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these stocks have been hit really hard and there's  
some renewed interest in buying,'' Dickey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts suggested that today's gains may be difficult to  
sustain as long as questions about interest rates hang over the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is still tepid and cautious about what the Fed will  
do,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential 
Securities.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Get Ready for Trip Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Discovery's astronauts shifted their  
attention Friday to the trip home after spending nearly a week 
getting the international space station ready for its first 
permanent occupants next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The space shuttle is due back on Earth around 2 a.m. Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Discovery unlatched itself from the international space station  
Thursday evening after six days of linked flight. The seven 
astronauts unloaded 2 tons of gear, made electronic repairs and 
installed mufflers to reduce noise from clattering fans.

<HEADLINE> 'Clang' Is Sound Blazers Make </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- For the first time this season, boos  
rained down on the Portland Trail Blazers instead of the red and 
black confetti that has followed so many victories at the Rose 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers were so awful in an 85-63 Game 3 loss to the San  
Antonio Spurs on Friday night that they didn't even bother to argue 
with the catcalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess if I was a fan and I paid my good money, and I watched  
basketball like that, I would have booed too,'' said Blazers point 
guard Damon Stoudamire, who scored two points on 1-of-12 shooting. 
``I didn't play worth a damn tonight, and they have every right to 
boo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers led 26-22 after the first quarter, and for the first  
half looked in good shape to win the game and pull within 2-1 for 
the series. But an eight-point third quarter turned a mediocre 
night into a historically bad one. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland made an NBA playoff record-low 19 baskets and shot only  
25 percent. The 63 points were second-worst in league postseason 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a matter of quitting,'' backup point guard  
Greg Anthony said. ``I think maybe the spirit was killed at times. 
A lot of that has to go to the San Antonio Spurs. But it's just 
unfortunate that this game was played the way it was from our 
perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire heard a few boos before the game even started, from  
fans angry over his complaints this week over what he sees as a 
lack of playing time in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Stoudamire said he would never forget the  
times he's sat out crucial minutes in favor of Anthony. He also 
said at times he's regretted his decision to sign a seven-year, $81 
million contract extension to stay in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Considering) the timing of what I said this week, I'd  
probably take it back,'' Stoudamire said Friday night. ``That 
looked as if it was one of the reasons why the team was not as 
focused tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite shooting under 30 percent in the first half, Portland  
trailed just 40-38 to start the third quarter. But just when the 
Blazers needed a surge, they got a slump instead. 
</P>
<P>
	A hook shot by Sabonis pulled the Blazers within 48-46 with 6:56  
to go in the quarter. From there, Portland missed its last nine 
shots of the quarter, and the Spurs went on a 16-0 run for a 64-46 
lead entering the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers had shown a tendency to flatline on offense. In Game  
1 of the conference semifinals against Utah, Portland scored just 
five points in the fourth quarter of an 83-73 loss, the fewest 
points ever in a postseason quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing the Blazers had working was Rasheed Wallace, but  
his productivity was limited by foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace appeared to be off to a charmed night on the first  
possession. With the shot clock running down, Wallace tracked down 
a loose ball and, in the same motion, swished a 23-footer at the 
horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace scored 14 points of his 22 points in the first half on  
5-of-7 shooting, but he played only 14 minutes because he picked up 
his second foul with 6:35 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	When Wallace wasn't shooting his high jumpers or dunking, the  
Blazers were inept. The rest of the team shot just 6-of-30 in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Power forward Brian Grant was held to five points on 0-for-5  
shooting, and guard Isaiah Rider had 10 points, missing eight of 11 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace's fourth foul came on the offensive end with 9:53 left  
in the third. At the time, Portland trailed only 44-42. When he 
came back, with 3:02 left, the Blazers were down 56-46. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, Sheed is the only one playing well,'' Rider said.  
``The rest of us are not matching his intensity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony didn't mince words about the Blazers' chances.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not kid ourselves,'' he said. ``We have a lot of wounds  
that we have to lick, and a lot of pride that we have to rebuild.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Stays Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Ailing Philippine Airlines avoided  
possible closure Friday by meeting a deadline imposed by creditors 
for obtaining a capital infusion of $200 million, government 
regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority owner Lucio Tan deposited the money in an airline bank  
account, the Securities and Exchange Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines' creditors had insisted that the new equity be  
raised by Friday as a condition for approval of the company's 
rehabilitation plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have fulfilled the final condition,'' PAL president Avelino  
Zapanta said. ``We have raised $200 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airline has been unable to repay its debt of more than $2.2  
billion because of crippling labor disputes and an ill-timed fleet 
purchase program, launched shortly before Asia's financial crisis 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new investment, Tan's stake in the Philippine flag  
carrier dropped to 53.6 percent from 70 percent and the 
government's fell to 4.26 percent from 15 percent, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the new money came from Tan, one of the Philippines'  
richest businessmen. A Hong Kong investment company with close 
links to Tan, Top Wealth Enterprises Ltd., provided $70 million. 
Two Philippine companies -- Maxell Holdings Corp. and Richmark 
Holdings Corp. -- provided the balance, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell and Richmark are owned by close business associates of  
Tan, according to Jaime Bautista, Tan's financial adviser and a 
former senior PAL executive. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL's rehabilitation plan calls for deep cuts in the airline's  
work force and fleet. Without the new capital, PAL could have been 
forced to liquidate its assets to settle its debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan's relations with PAL's unions have been rocky. Top Wealth  
Enterprises agreed to invest only if PAL workers promised not to 
strike for 10 years, Tan said. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL said Thursday that more than 60 percent of its 8,000 workers  
have accepted the no-strike demand in exchange for stock. Some 
union leaders, however, oppose the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 union members picketed briefly Friday at the SEC  
against layoffs and the strike ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapanta said the size of job cuts will largely depend on the  
divestment of non-core holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no ``widespread retrenchments,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	From a payroll of 15,000 at the time of the pilots' strike, the  
carrier's workforce has fallen to just over 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapanta said talks with Deutsche Lufthansa AG on the German  
airline taking a consulting role in helping manage PAL are 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's still very much up in the air,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	PAL is Asia's oldest airline. On March 15, 1941, it carried five  
passengers from Manila to Baguio in the northern Philippines on its 
maiden flight. It became the first Asian airline to cross the 
Pacific on July 31, 1946.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Tax Assessor Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- A county tax assessor is being sued by  
residents who say he refused to give them property tax reductions 
solely on the grounds that they couldn't speak English well enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Julio and Carmen Telleria, a Dominican Republic-born husband and  
wife, and Byong-Rye Ahn, a native of South Korea, sued Madison 
County Tax Assessor Wayland Cooley, claiming he refused to give 
them tax breaks because they could not conduct the transaction in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit contends Cooley is rude and prejudiced toward  
foreigners, and it quotes him as saying they should not have the 
same rights as ``us here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trial of the case was set for next week, but it was delayed so  
the judge could consider a request to dismiss the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooley, 83, has said the property law manual doesn't say  
anything about requiring him to have an interpreter on hand. He 
denies being rude, but thinks immigrants should learn to speak 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I can't understand is why people don't learn the language  
of the country in which they live,'' he has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit contends that the Tellerias are paying about $450 too  
much each year in taxes, and Mrs. Ahn is paying about $400 too much 
because of Cooley's refusal to grant reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama law requires applicants to take an oath swearing to the  
accuracy of information about their property. The plaintiffs 
contend Cooley won't vouch for the accuracy of the oath if it isn't 
taken in English, even if an interpreter is present. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, lawyers for Cooley said that his English-only  
policy was designed ``to prevent potential fraud.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the euro Friday in an  
unusual turn as traders helped the new European currency rebound 
from yet another record low. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the yen as fresh U.S. government data  
underscored the strength of the country's economy. Unemployment 
figures returned to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in May although 
payroll jobs increased but a fraction of what was expected. In late 
New York trading, the dollar rose to 122.22 yen from 121.66 yen 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in late New York trading Friday, the euro rose to $1.0362  
from $1.0343 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, during Asian trading, the euro fell to its lowest point  
yet, $1.0270, as overseas funds sold the currency aggressively with 
the thought that European economic fundamentals would remain 
distressed. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, data released later Friday showed that industrial  
production fell as did business confidence in the economies of the 
11 countries the euro represents. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, European Union leaders created confusion as they  
ended a meeting in Cologne, Germany Friday with a communique that 
dropped specific draft language supporting the euro. The euro 
continued hovering above its lows. 
</P>
<P>
	But later traders engaged in short covering, where they bought  
back euros they had dumped earlier in a bet the euro would fall 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just started coming up,'' said Grant Wilson, a foreign  
exchange vice president at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, as he 
explained that traders were afraid to go home for the weekend 
without having euros in their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a curious reaction after what we saw this morning,''  
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.5310 Swiss  
francs from 1.5402 and to 1.4702 Canadian dollars from 1.4759. The 
British pound rose to $1.6103 from $1.6064. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries that have switched to the  
euro no longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a 
fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8875 German marks, down from 1.8911; 6.3291 French francs, down 
from 6.3412; and 1,869.16 Italian lire, down from 1,876.17.

<HEADLINE> NYSE Delays Extending Trading Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Stock Exchange will delay extending  
its trading hours until next year at the earliest, its chairman 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Grasso said the board of the world's biggest stock  
exchange would wait first to make sure stock traders smoothly 
handled two challenges -- the Year 2000 computer bug and the planned 
shift to reporting stock prices in decimals rather than fractions. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline for the move to decimals is at the end of the  
second quarter of 2000, more than a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso said the board felt it was prudent to make sure the  
public would be confident in the stock market before moving to add 
either morning or evening trading hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the National Association of Securities Dealers, which  
governs the Nasdaq Stock Market, approved a plan to extend trading 
from the current 9:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Eastern time schedule. A second 
session of the day would likely start at 5:30 p.m. and end at 9 
p.m. or 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Frank Zarb, chairman and chief executive of the  
NASD, said he expected the changes to take effect around September, 
after a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
discussions with industry leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has been urging restraint, proposing a delay until next  
year so that the securities industry would not be extending hours 
at the same time it is confronting Y2K and the shift to 
decimalization.

<HEADLINE> Hispanics Upset With Astros Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Two television executives say they were told by  
Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane that the team doesn't market to 
Hispanics because they don't understand baseball, buy cheap seats 
and don't eat stadium food. 
</P>
<P>
	McLane denied making derogatory remarks about Hispanics before a  
dinner Thursday night honoring him with the Houston Advertising 
Federation's Trailblazer Award for community service. He described 
himself as ``angry and outraged'' about the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Camacho, vice president and general manager of KTMD-TV,  
and Rod Rodriguez, the station's sales manager, said they were 
offended by McLane's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked him why he doesn't market toward Hispanics,'' Camacho  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said it was hard to reach Hispanics because the game of  
baseball is strategy and skill and it's complicated and that's why 
more Hispanics don't go to Astros games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said if you gave them a basketball and told them to put the  
ball through the hoop, they can do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that baseball is a game of statistics and numbers and  
people like to follow baseball in the newspapers and Hispanics 
don't read newspapers and when Hispanics do go, they buy the cheap 
$2 seats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said he talked to six to eight people at a reception  
before the dinner but denied saying anything racially insensitive 
toward Hispanics, who represent 22 percent of the eight-county 
Houston area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of Hispanics who do come and are great  
supporters but not in the percentage that the population represents 
in Harris County,'' McLane said. ``There was never a disparaging 
remark pertaining to the cheap seats. That was never said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The food was never discussed. That just wasn't a part of the  
conversation that we had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, one of those who nominated McLane for the award, said  
he heard the same comments as Camacho. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said Hispanics don't understand the game of baseball, that  
it's a difficult game to follow with a lot of stats,'' Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said Hispanics don't read the newspapers. I looked at my  
general manager (Camacho) to see if he's really saying that. I told 
him I read newspapers. We grew up on baseball. It was our 
livelihood. Hispanics love the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said statistics were discussed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The statistics came up and I did comment that baseball is a  
very complex game,'' he said. ``But as far as comments that they 
didn't understand the stats or didn't read the stats is certainly 
something that was never discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros owner pointed out his team hires Hispanics and that  
the Astros broadcast their games in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am angry and outraged by the accusation that KTMD Channel 48  
Telemundo made last night,'' McLane said. ``The report was 
absolutely not true. I did not do an interview with the television 
station nor did I make any such statements to anyone in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me say it again: I did not make the remarks and I would  
not make the remarks reported by that television station. I will 
seek an apology from Telemundo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	KTMD is an affiliate of Telemundo. Camacho said McLane declined  
an on-camera interview because he doesn't speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a slap in the face for me,'' Rodriguez said. ``I had a  
lot of respect for the man, but not after last night to learn that 
his is so narrow-minded. It's sad, especially as much as I enjoy 
the game. I won't lose faith in the club but I feel sorry for all 
the Hispanic players on the team.''

<HEADLINE>  Security Tight in Tiananmen Square </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- With small acts of defiance, mourners and  
protesters on Friday commemorated those killed 10 years ago in 
China's crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy 
demonstrations. Police, on alert to prevent public mourning, 
arrested at least two people. 
</P>
<P>
	One, a middle-aged man, was whisked away by police after he  
raised a slogan-daubed white umbrella and walked beneath a portrait 
of communist revolutionary Mao Tse-tung that hangs on Tiananmen 
Gate. White is the color of mourning for Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember the 10th anniversary of the student movement,'' read  
one slogan. Above it were the Chinese characters for ``Democracy 
Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An officer grabbed the umbrella and, with the help of a  
plainclothes officer, took the protester away. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, eight police officers tackled a young man in a white  
T-shirt reading ``Down with corruption'' as he ran onto the Avenue 
of Eternal Peace after throwing leaflets on the plaza. They pushed 
him into a car and drove away. Only his shoe was left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Police tried to prevent bystanders from picking up the leaflets,  
which criticized pervasive official corruption -- a key complaint of 
the 1989 protests. It was signed ``Beijing university student.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people, however, went about their normal activities.  
Hundreds turned out, as always, to watch soldiers lower the red 
national flag on the square at the end of the day. Dozens of 
uniformed and plainclothes officers, some carrying walkie-talkies 
hidden in newspapers, kept watch. Police briefly detained at least 
five foreign journalists and confiscated their film. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin  
said the United States has asked China to make a full accounting to 
relatives of those killed and release people serving sentences for 
participating peacefully in the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S.-China relations will not reach their full potential until  
China brings its human rights practices into compliance with its 
obligations under international human rights instruments,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiananmen Square was closed, encircled by a high metal wall  
while workers laid new paving stones. State-run television opened 
the noon newscast with a report on the seven-month-long 
reconstruction project. Footage showed workers and normal traffic 
flow around the square. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese army began attacking crowds in central Beijing late  
on June 3, 1989. Troops and tanks reached the square before dawn on 
June 4, forcing the last demonstrators to leave -- and ending seven 
weeks of protests that had drawn as many as 1 million people to 
Tiananmen Square and inspired demonstrations in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people killed is unknown. The government has never  
given a credible account, but many hundreds are believed to have 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders ordered extra vigilance this year to prevent  
anyone from using the anniversary to stir up anger over rising 
unemployment and widespread corruption. At least 130 dissidents 
were questioned in recent weeks and 42 were in police custody over 
the anniversary, according to the Hong Kong-based Information 
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those taken in the latest roundup was Liu Feng, a  
Protestant detained Friday on his way to meet friends to pray for 
those who died in the assault, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wan An Cemetery, near Fragrant Hills on the western outskirts  
of the capital, more than 20 relatives of five victims of the 
assault held a commemorative gathering. Police guarded the entrance 
and a sign in English and Chinese said, ``No correspondents 
accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, mourners said they took the boxed ashes of three of  
the victims from vaults and put them on the grave of another, Yuan 
Li, a 28-year-old doctoral student shot in the throat. They laid 
flowers on the tomb, sprinkled wine on the ground, stood in silence 
and said a few words of remembrance. A strip of paper placed atop 
the tomb said: ``Mourn the victims of June 4th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It has already been 10 years since June 4, but the government  
ignores this incident. As the living, we feel we have to stand 
up,'' said You Weijie, whose husband died after being shot in the 
pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
	She and Huang Jinping, who also lost her husband, rode bicycles  
past the spots near Tiananmen Square where their spouses were shot. 
On the front of one bike basket, they hung the ``mourn the victim'' 
paper strip that had been on the tomb, a defiant act given the 
thick police presence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the only strip of China where commemoration of the  
Tiananmen protests was allowed, thousands of people gathered Friday 
for a candlelight vigil to mourn those killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Songs glorifying the students blared from speakers. A banner  
reading ``June 4: 10th year'' hung from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to let the children know about June 4. It is a very big  
event in Chinese history. I hope they can learn about it and 
remember,'' said Anthony Chow, a pastor, who attended the memorial 
with his wife and three young children, aged 4 to 11.

<HEADLINE>  Security Tight in Tiananmen Square </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- With small acts of defiance, mourners and  
protesters on Friday commemorated those killed 10 years ago in 
China's crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy 
demonstrations. Police, on alert to prevent public mourning, 
arrested at least two people. 
</P>
<P>
	One, a middle-aged man, was whisked away by police after he  
raised a slogan-daubed white umbrella and walked beneath a portrait 
of communist revolutionary Mao Tse-tung that hangs on Tiananmen 
Gate. White is the color of mourning for Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember the 10th anniversary of the student movement,'' read  
one slogan. Above it were the Chinese characters for ``Democracy 
Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An officer grabbed the umbrella and, with the help of a  
plainclothes officer, took the protester away. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, eight police officers tackled a young man in a white  
T-shirt reading ``Down with corruption'' as he ran onto the Avenue 
of Eternal Peace after throwing leaflets on the plaza. They pushed 
him into a car and drove away. Only his shoe was left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Police tried to prevent bystanders from picking up the leaflets,  
which criticized pervasive official corruption -- a key complaint of 
the 1989 protests. It was signed ``Beijing university student.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people, however, went about their normal activities.  
Hundreds turned out, as always, to watch soldiers lower the red 
national flag on the square at the end of the day. Dozens of 
uniformed and plainclothes officers, some carrying walkie-talkies 
hidden in newspapers, kept watch. Police briefly detained at least 
five foreign journalists and confiscated their film. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin  
said the United States has asked China to make a full accounting to 
relatives of those killed and release people serving sentences for 
participating peacefully in the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S.-China relations will not reach their full potential until  
China brings its human rights practices into compliance with its 
obligations under international human rights instruments,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiananmen Square was closed, encircled by a high metal wall  
while workers laid new paving stones. State-run television opened 
the noon newscast with a report on the seven-month-long 
reconstruction project. Footage showed workers and normal traffic 
flow around the square. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese army began attacking crowds in central Beijing late  
on June 3, 1989. Troops and tanks reached the square before dawn on 
June 4, forcing the last demonstrators to leave -- and ending seven 
weeks of protests that had drawn as many as 1 million people to 
Tiananmen Square and inspired demonstrations in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people killed is unknown. The government has never  
given a credible account, but many hundreds are believed to have 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders ordered extra vigilance this year to prevent  
anyone from using the anniversary to stir up anger over rising 
unemployment and widespread corruption. At least 130 dissidents 
were questioned in recent weeks and 42 were in police custody over 
the anniversary, according to the Hong Kong-based Information 
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those taken in the latest roundup was Liu Feng, a  
Protestant detained Friday on his way to meet friends to pray for 
those who died in the assault, the group said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Father: Lindros To Sign One-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- There's no signature just yet, so for now  
the Philadelphia Flyers will have to settle for a handshake and an 
assuring phone call when it comes to Eric Lindros' contract status. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros, the star center's father and agent, said Friday  
his son would follow through on a handshake agreement with the club 
and sign a one-year, $8.5 million deal, plus incentives, that would 
prevent him from becoming a restricted free agent. The Lindroses 
called Flyers chairman Ed Snider this week about their decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it leads to a longer term deal the club hopes Lindros  
will sign remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just proceeding in getting (the one-year contract)  
finalized,'' Carl Lindros said. ``We just received a draft of the 
contract proposal on Wednesday and hopefully we can get it done in 
the next couple weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides reached the handshake deal in September after they  
were unable to agree on a five-year extension. At the time, Eric 
Lindros said the one-year deal would eliminate the distraction of 
having contract negotiations go on during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation had grown in the last month, though, with no  
movement detected in contract talks and a July 1 deadline looming 
for restricted free agency. If the team fails to get a contract 
done by then, they would have the right to match any offer Lindros 
receives from another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros said Friday that his son's decision affirms the  
``very vocal commitment'' he made with the team in September, but 
added that no timeline has been set to begin negotiations for a 
longer deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers officials could not be reached for comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't want a long-range deal, and that's the way they  
feel about it,'' Snider told The Philadelphia Inquirer. ``We're 
content with a one-year deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros declined to detail what incentives are included in  
the deal except to say that they were performance-based and 
team-oriented, such as if the Flyers won or reached the Stanley Cup 
finals. They are similar to incentives proposed by the team in 
their five-year contract offer last year, Lindros' father said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached just before Eric Lindros left on a  
long drive from his Toronto home to Florida for an appearance on 
the Children's Miracle Network Telethon. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros said Eric is progressing well in his recovery from  
the collapsed right lung that forced him to miss the last two weeks 
of the regular season and the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The center is experiencing muscle pain in his chest in the area  
where he was injured but doctors say pain is normal for the type of 
injury Lindros suffered and should go away in about six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros was officially cleared by team doctors last month to  
resume playing hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter for the muscle in his chest to regroup so  
he doesn't feel pain every time he turns,'' Carl Lindros said. 
``But the doctors say it's normal and he should be used to it by 
the time training camp opens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros is now undergoing normal off-season weight training and  
conditioning and will resume skating a few weeks before training 
camp begins in September.

</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- George Washington Bentley, the last surviving  
founder of The American Legion, died Friday. He was 101. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Bentley was awarded the Legion of Honor, the highest  
medal of the French government, for his service in France during 
World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	Bentley was assigned to the U.S. Army Engineers Purchasing  
Office in France from June 1918 to October 1919 and saw an ad about 
a meeting to discuss forming an organization of wartime veterans. 
Bentley attended the three-day Paris meeting with more than 1,000 
others in March 1919 at which The American Legion was formed. 
</P>
<P>
	All the attendees are considered founders because they took part  
in forming the organization. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Peter Brough    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Peter Brough, a radio star who attracted a British  
audience of millions in the 1950s as the ventriloquist who brought 
puppet Archie Andrews to life, died Thursday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	The radio show ``Educating Archie'' served as a launching pad  
for many comics and actors, most notably Julie Andrews, a regular 
on the British Broadcasting Corp. show as a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Brough was a favorite of the royal family, playing at Royal  
Variety Performances and organizing the Windsor Castle staff ball 
for many years. 
</P>
<P>
	After performing for King George VI and the princesses Elizabeth  
and Margaret, the trio asked for the dummy's head to be taken off 
while they had a good look at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Brough retired from show business in the 1960s and went on to  
run a textile business.

                          *Zachary Fisher    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Zachary Fisher, a developer and Russian  
immigrant whose lifelong interest in the U.S. military led him to 
convert an abandoned aircraft carrier into an acclaimed naval 
museum, died Friday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher was honored by presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan  
for his philanthropic efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's avocation was the U.S. military, and his interest  
peaked after hearing of plans to consign the historic USS Intrepid 
to the scrapyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher started a foundation to save the Intrepid in 1978. Four  
years later, the battle-scarred carrier was home to the Intrepid 
Air Sea Space Museum, which is now the world's largest navel 
museum. It remains docked in the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, President Clinton awarded Fisher the Medal of Freedom  
for his efforts on behalf of the military. He also donated millions 
of dollars to the children of military personnel killed in the line 
of duty, starting with the survivors of the Marines killed in 
1983's Beirut barracks bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher also founded the Fisher Houses -- 28 mansions built on the  
grounds of military hospitals across the country as inexpensive 
housing for relatives of patients.

</P>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Wil Quick, a journalist known for his  
anti-smoking advocacy, died Wednesday after suffering a heart 
attack on May 25. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Quick, also known for his passion for civil rights, genealogy,  
the military and the Republican Party, was a reporter and editor at 
the Milwaukee Sentinel from 1960 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking irritated his eyes and gave him a headache. By the 1970s  
-- long before the nation was in its anti-smoking mode -- he was in 
full pursuit of cigarette, pipe and cigar users. 
</P>
<P>
	He filed city ordinance complaints against a Sentinel  
sportswriter and a Milwaukee Journal associate editor for smoking 
in company elevators. 
</P>
<P>
	Quick joined the Wisconsin Initiative on Smoking and Health  
shortly after its founding a decade ago and had a major role in 
expanding the number of smoke-free Wisconsin restaurants listed in 
a dining guide from 65 to the current 1,460. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked at newspapers in Dayton, Ohio, Huntington, W.Va., and  
Three Rivers, Mich., before joining the Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, two sons and two daughters.

<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Gov. John McKeithen, a memorable  
stump speaker who worked to ease race relations and gave New 
Orleans the Superdome, died Friday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only was McKeithen known for his oratory skills, he was able  
to adapt them for the media age. He was the first to use television 
successfully in a Louisiana governor's campaign, becoming famous 
for his ``won't you he'p me'' ads looking directly into the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Big John, as he was called, served as governor from 1964 to  
1972. A hard-core Democrat, he appointed blacks to state government 
during the civil rights era and was remembered for his efforts to 
soothe racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	His administration drew praise and criticism over the Superdome,  
which he helped start but was completed in 1975 after he had been 
out of office for three years.

Press Houston correspondent Max Skelton, died Wednesday. She was 
78. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Skelton was a former manager of the Press Club of Houston.  
</P>
<P>
	She was a graduate of the nursing program at Houston's Methodist  
Hospital in 1941 and was a second lieutenant in the Army Nurse 
Corps during World War II. She also conducted the Houston 
Chronicle's Goodfellows program for several years. 
</P>

	Her husband established the AP Houston bureau in 1947. He  
retired in 1982 after 35 years with AP and died in 1992.

<P>
	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- Hilda Mae Snoops, the longtime friend of  
former Gov. William Donald Schaefer who served as his official 
state hostess and unofficial first lady, died Friday. She was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Charles Snoops who introduced his wife to Schaefer, a  
childhood friend. After the Snoops divorced in 1962, Mrs. Snoops 
became Schaefer's companion. The two never married. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Schaefer was elected governor in 1986, the divorced  
mother of three took on a much more visible role. Mrs. Snoops, who 
called herself the ``first friend,'' was often at Schaefer's side 
at public and social events. 
</P>
<P>
	Her main task was to oversee the governor's mansion, and she was  
widely criticized for changes she made even though they were mostly 
privately funded. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her first acts was to renovate the mansion's public  
rooms, ripping out expensive restoration undertaken by Patricia 
Hughes, the wife of Schaefer's predecessor, Harry Hughes. Mrs. 
Hughes' use of styles representing different periods of Maryland 
history drew national acclaim, but Mrs. Snoops rejected them as too 
cold and museum-like.

business life who wrote or edited more than 50 books and hundreds 
of articles, died Wednesday from brain cancer. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobel began teaching history at Hofstra University in 1956 after  
serving in the Korean War. He joined Hofstra's faculty in 1957, and 
stayed there until his retirement in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobel wrote on topics ranging from the economic philosophy of  
President Calvin Coolidge to the influence of junk-bond financier 
Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
	His last book, ``When Giants Stumble,'' was recently released.  
Sobel completed the book as he underwent cancer treatments.

women during the growth of American feminism, died Friday of Lou 
Gehrig's disease. She was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Whitney increased Glamour's circulation by 1 million after

<HEADLINE> Clinton on Guns: Blame Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A testy President Clinton, with pointed finger  
and pounding fist, rejected suggestions today that he fumbled a 
golden opportunity to stand tough for gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweeping restrictions he would like to see -- including a  
mandate that people ``register guns like they register cars'' -- 
will take years to enact, he said, because he is hamstrung by a 
Republican Congress ``out of touch with the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and his wife, Hillary, aimed their  
anti-youth-violence campaign at family breakfast tables nationwide 
today, appearing on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' with 40 
teen-agers -- some from schools made infamous by shootings last year 
-- for a live brainstorming session. 
</P>
<P>
	Anchor Charlie Gibson opened the broadcast from the White House  
Roosevelt Room with a separate interview with the president. The 
journalist quoted an unnamed Clinton ally as saying the president, 
after the Littleton, Colo., school massacre, ``had a chance to roar 
and he meowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His eyes narrowed and his finger pointed accusingly, Clinton  
replied: ``Look, let's join the real world here. You want to have 
an honest conversation, let's have an honest conversation. I am the 
first president who ever took on the NRA. I got my party in 
Congress to stand with me on the Brady bill. ... Now wait a minute, 
you talk about roaring and meowing -- then I came forward with this 
legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton pounded his left fist into his right palm.  
</P>
<P>
	``For you to say I shouldn't take what I can get and instead I  
should ask for things that I am absolutely positive will be 
defeated in the Congress is quite wrong,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president narrowly won Senate passage last month of a  
limited bill requiring mandatory background checks for all 
transactions at gun shows and child-safety locks on all new 
handguns, then lost a fight to have the House follow suit before 
its Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration believes it has agreement with House  
Republicans for two measures beyond what the Senate did: background 
checks for explosives sales and increasing from 18 to 21 the legal 
age for owning handguns and assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton has -- as a matter of political practicality, he said  
-- deferred until later the battle for more controversial gun 
controls, such as a mandatory three-day waiting period for all 
handgun purchases and limiting gun purchases to one per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said today that the House Republican leadership delayed  
a gun vote until after the holiday recess in order to give the 
National Rifle Association time to lobby and water down the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it clear I want to do this in sequence. I think this is  
going to take years. The Congress is out of touch with the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the president's one-on-one interview in the Cabinet  
Room, he and Mrs. Clinton sat down with students from Littleton, 
Springfield, Ore., West Paducah, Ky., Conyers, Ga., and other areas 
for an uninterrupted discussion of youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	After 45 minutes, the Clintons agreed to scrap their schedules  
and stretch it another 10 minutes. ``We can stay longer,'' the 
first lady said. ``I want to hear from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One student, Albert Smith, questioned the president skeptically.  
``How spectacular is this legislation and why will it make a 
difference?'' Another student in the discussion was Missy Jenkins, 
who was paralyzed from the waist down on Dec. 1, 1997, when a 
classmate opened fire inside her West Paducah high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, with apologies for pulling ``the nosey mother  
routine,'' beseeched kids to ask questions and demand safe 
surroundings. ``If you guys are going to a party make sure there 
are no guns around,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady also asked students to speak out for tougher gun  
controls. ``There's no reason why a lot of you who are about to be 
or are already 18 can't let your voices be heard too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons saw ``Good Morning America'' and its estimated 7  
million viewers as a ripe opportunity, White House spokesman Jake 
Siewert said. ``The Clintons can talk directly to families as they 
get ready for another school day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the president ordered a joint investigation

<HEADLINE> Hearing Held on Notre Dame Booster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Notre Dame expects it will be at least four  
weeks before the NCAA decides whether to penalize the school 
because a former booster gave financial help to at least a dozen 
football players. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's Committee on Infractions held a closed hearing  
Friday. A decision is expected in July or August. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA is investigating whether Kimberly Dunbar's relationship  
with players broke a rule stipulating that schools and their 
representatives cannot provide an athlete or a relative or friend 
of an athlete a benefit not authorized by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records show Dunbar, who is serving a four-year prison  
sentence after pleading guilty to embezzling more that $1.4 million 
from her former employer in South Bend, provided players, their 
families and friends with more than $35,000 in gifts and trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame spokesman Dennis Moore said the school responded to  
the NCAA in a ``forthright and complete'' manner. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said Notre Dame has disbanded the Quarterback Club, a  
group of boosters whose members included Dunbar. The school has 
held assistant coaches accountable for athletes' academic and 
personal development, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA has already established that Dunbar became a  
representative of the university in June 1995 when she joined the 
Quarterback Club. Court records show she purchased gifts and trips 
for several players after that date, including presents for players 
with whom she had personal relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were Jarvis Edison, with whom she has a child. She  
took him, fellow player Allen Rossum and Rossum's girlfriend on a 
$10,000 trip to Las Vegas in 1997 to see the Evander Holyfield-Mike 
Tyson fight. She also took then-boyfriend Derrick Mayes to Las 
Vegas in 1995, paying for his $1,836 ticket and a $756 stay at the 
Luxor, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Jonas, a lawyer representing the company Dunbar embezzled  
the money from, said they have collected 5,000 to 10,000 pages of 
documents concerning Dunbar's relationship with Irish players, and 
the NCAA has not requested any information from them. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials have argued that the possible infractions  
were secondary. NCAA enforcement officials agreed, recommending in 
April the committee shouldn't view the case as major. But the 
infractions committee decided to review the case as a possible 
major violation. 
</P>
<P>
	To bolster their defense, the school has hired the law firm of  
Bond, Schoeneck &AMP; King. The firm, with an office near the NCAA in 
Overland Park, Kan., specializes in assisting colleges under 
investigation by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame has claimed Dunbar provided the benefits to players  
``in the context of personal relationships'' and not as a booster. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Smrt, the NCAA's enforcement director and one of the  
officials that recommended Notre Dame's infractions be ruled 
secondary, said it's rare for enforcement officials to change their 
minds after making a recommendation to the committee, even if it's 
overruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he wouldn't comment on Notre Dame's case directly, he  
said enforcement officials usually argue for their original 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Smrt said the committee could rule Notre Dame committed a major  
infraction, but withhold serious punishment. If the committee rules 
the infractions as major, it could put the Irish on probation for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	That means any other violation would make Notre Dame eligible  
for harsh penalties -- a ban from national television or bowl games, 
loss of scholarships or recruiting restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Italy's ENI Gets New Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Renato Ruggiero, former head of the World Trade  
Organization, was named chairman of Italy's state-controlled energy 
holding company, ENI, today, succeeding incumbent Guglielmo 
Moscato, whose term is expiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The company shareholders' assembly also named Vittorio Mincato  
as its chief executive for another term. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian treasury, which owns 36.3 percent of ENI, must  
confirm the selections, but it is largely expected to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	A career diplomat in the Italian foreign service, Ruggiero also  
served as foreign trade minister between 1987 and 1991. His 
two-year stint as director general of the WTO ended April 30.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank, Bankers Trust United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The merger between Germany's Deutsche  
Bank and U.S.-based Bankers Trust has been completed, creating the 
world's largest commercial financial institution, officials said 
today. Together, Germany's biggest bank and the eighth largest in 
the United States have assets of about 1.55 trillion German marks 
($820 billion), as of March 31, and a workforce of some 95,000. The 
final step in completing the merger was taken this week when 
finance authorities in Canada and New Jersey approved the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, approval was obtained from New York banking  
authorities, European Union cartel officials in Brussels and 
Washington, D.C., and Bankers Trust stockholders, a bank statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Bankers Trust constitutes the biggest  
takeover of a U.S. financial institution by a foreign bank. The 
institution is be larger than UBS AG of Switzerland, currently the 
largest bank, and the recently formed Citigroup Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the merger came initially from Jewish  
organizations because of questions regarding Deutsche Bank 
restitution payments to victims of the Holocaust. After signs of a 
compromise on these questions, New York authorities gave their 
blessing, Deutsche Bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are leading in all important areas of financial services  
worldwide,'' Breuer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, agreed to last November, is the largest takeover of  
a U.S. institution thus far by a foreign financial concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank is paying $10.1 billion for the deal, which will  
be financed partly through a capital increase of $3.16 billion, the 
bank said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Blocks Sale of Payroll Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Citing privacy concerns, the governor  
on Friday blocked a law from taking effect that would have allowed 
the state to sell confidential payroll data to private lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The law allows a state agency to sell personal financial  
information to banks, car dealers and other lenders to help them 
verify an applicant's income, with the applicant's written 
permission. It was intended to expedite loan applications. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, signed by the former Republican governor, was  
expected to take effect later this year after a review period. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, agreed with privacy rights  
groups that said the law would allow systematic privacy violations 
and could result in the unauthorized distribution of sensitive 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The state ``has a responsibility to protect the privacy of its  
citizens. The wholesale distribution of such information on the 
open market, in my view, would violate that trust and the privacy 
of those individuals,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis ordered the director of the Employment Development  
Department not to sell personal information, saying the law gives 
the director such discretion. The leeway also allows the governor 
to block the sale if he chooses, Davis' office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Programs allowing the sale of financial information are  
operating in Iowa, Minnesota, North Carolina and Texas and one is 
being implemented in Pennsylvania. Legislatures in Florida, Indiana 
and Oregon authorized such systems in recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> Embarassing Microsoft E-Mail Detailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of watching its executives  
confronted in court with hard-to-explain e-mails, Microsoft spent 
Friday listening to more recent embarrassing electronic messages. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its trial strategy in fighting antitrust allegations,  
Microsoft wants to show the judge that one of its Internet software 
rivals, Netscape Communications Corp., wasn't illegally crippled 
during its battle with Microsoft's Windows computer operating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department lawyer David Boies cited an e-mail  
exchange within Microsoft earlier this year -- months after its 
antitrust trial began -- that suggested even some Microsoft 
employees don't believe that Netscape remains a robust competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``What data can we find right away that shows Netscape browser  
share is still healthy?'' spokesman Greg Shaw wrote to two other 
Microsoft employees earlier this year. ``It would help if you could 
send me some reports showing their market share healthy and 
holding. This is for press purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw got this response from Robert Bennett, a Windows product  
manager: 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the analysts have pretty much come to the same  
conclusion, which is that (Netscape) share is declining and 
(Microsoft's) is gaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be proactively telling people that (Netscape)  
share is doing well -- we are winning because we have better 
technology -- if we show them maintaining/gaining share then we 
contradict that point,'' Bennett wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson laughed as Boies  
read the e-mails in court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Franklin Fisher volunteered from the witness stand  
that, ``This document speaks for itself rather louder than most.'' 
Fisher testified all week for the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had other problems with e-mail in the courtroom  
Thursday, when a company lawyer, Michael Lacovara, sought to 
portray the popular upstart Linux operating system as a potential 
threat to the dominance of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara introduced e-mail that Microsoft executive David Cole  
wrote last week, titled ``Linux is beating Windows.'' He included 
sales figures showing that at two West Coast electronics chains, 
Linux is outselling Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies indicated he was dubious because the e-mail was written so  
recently, and the judge seemed to agree. Jackson called the 
document a ``self-serving, out-of-court declaration'' but allowed 
Lacovara to enter it as evidence in the case.

<HEADLINE> Energy Futures Rise; Cocoa Soars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Energy futures rose sharply Friday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid reports key world oil producers were doing a better 
job of keeping crude off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, cocoa soared a second day, while coffee fell  
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude jumped amid estimates that the Organization of the  
Petroleum Exporting Countries in May improved compliance with an 
agreement to slash production of more than 2 percent of the world's 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts estimate that the 10 OPEC countries working to cut  
production met 72 percent of their goal from an April 1 baseline, 
up from 65 percent a month earlier. Compliance stood at 89 percent 
when compared to a February 1998 baseline. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimates helped support ideas the oil producers are serious  
about trying to prop crude prices, which rose sharply after they 
announced an agreement in March but have since drifted lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting crude and unleaded gasoline prices was news that  
Conoco Inc. had shut a 50,000 barrel-a-day gas-making unit at a 
Louisiana refinery. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown is the latest in a spate of gasoline production  
cutbacks. Producers in Europe and the United States in recent weeks 
have curtailed production as the cost of buying more expensive 
crude made it less profitable to refine it. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown comes with U.S. gasoline inventories up 2 percent  
from a year ago and about 8 percent above the five-year average, 
according to the American Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for July delivery rose 58 cents to $17.32 a barrel; July  
unleaded gasoline rose 1.51 cents to 50.11 cents a gallon; July 
heating oil rose 1.56 cents to 41.29 cents a gallon; July natural 
gas rose 4.3 cents to $2.440 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures jumped a second day on the Board of Trade of the  
City of New York as cocoa shipments slowed to a trickle, suggesting 
a glut may begin to fade in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures on Thursday posted their biggest gains in nearly  
nine years, recovering from recent six-year lows, as cocoa traders 
and exporters reported fewer arrivals of beans at ports in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa grower, in the week ended  
May 30 shipped an estimated 7,540 metric tons, down by nearly half 
the week's previous 14,280 metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana, another large grower, also is expected to run out of  
shipments soon, providing supply-side relief to a market that has 
been pressured by a bumper world crop and weaker world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	July cocoa rose $35 to $1,058 a ton.  
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures fell sharply on the New York Board of Trade after  
meteorologists predicted the chance for frost in Brazil, the 
world's largest grower, is slim in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices have seesawed in recent days as speculators bet  
Brazil cannot make it through a third winter without a damaging 
frost. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil produces mainly robusta beans, which are not certified  
for delivery against New York futures contracts. But many roasters 
mix those beans with high-quality arabica beans for gourmet blends, 
and record production last year left the world flush with supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	July arabica coffee fell 3.05 cents to $1.20 a pound.

<HEADLINE> NFL Suspends Leon Lett Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys Pro Bowl defensive tackle  
Leon Lett was suspended indefinitely by the NFL on Friday for 
violating the league's substance-abuse policy for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can confirm that he has been suspended indefinitely,'' NFL  
spokesman Joe Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne refused to discuss the details of Lett's case other than  
to say the lineman can reapply for admission to the league in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	The length of the suspension will be determined by NFL  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue based on evaluations of Lett's progress 
by officials in the league's substance-abuse program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys were notified of the suspension on Friday. Spokesman  
Rich Dalrymple released a statement declining comment on behalf of 
the team ``because of the confidential nature of the NFL's 
substance testing policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports that Lett might be facing another league suspension have  
been circulating for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett, 30, has been enrolled in the NFL's substance-abuse program  
since 1995. He was suspended four games in 1995, for the last three 
games of 1996 and the first 13 of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 season was his first complete one since 1994 and, as in  
that season, he made the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett's agent, Jim Steiner, could not be reached Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6, 300-pound Lett went from seventh-round draft pick  
from Emporia State in 1991 to Pro Bowl starter by 1994. Nicknamed 
``The Big Cat,'' Lett used size, speed and strength to become a 
standout in the middle of a solid defensive line, both as a 
run-stopper and pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 51 tackles, four sacks, 20 quarterback pressures and a  
team-high seven tackles for losses last season. His presence was 
considered a big reason the Cowboys' run defense improved from 24th 
in 1997 to 12th in 1998.

	Unemployment at 29-Year Low  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unemployment edged down to 4.2 percent last  
month, returning to a 29-year low and helping workers who 
historically have had a harder time finding jobs. Black 
unemployment hit a record low, and jobless rates for teen-agers and 
adult women fell to the lowest levels in three decades. Despite the 
drop in unemployment, there was only a tiny increase of 11,000 jobs 
in the nation's payrolls in May -- a sharp slowdown from 343,000 
jobs created in the previous month and the weakest showing since a 
decline in January 1996, the Labor Department said.

	Stocks Close Higher; Dow Up 136.15  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices rose smartly on Wall Street today as  
traders were pleasantly surprised by the government's report that 
inflation and the economy weren't running rampant after all. The 
government's employment report helped temper investors' concerns 
that the Federal Reserve might soon raise interest rates to slow 
the economy. Bargain-hunting that followed the recent selloff on 
Wall Street also contributed to today's gains. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed up 136.15 at 10,799.84, adding to an 
85-point gain yesterday. For the week, the Dow was up 240.10. 
Broader stock indicators were also higher, including the Nasdaq

sharp decline in technology stocksa. It was up 60.72 to 2,464.04

	Stock Markets To Close Early Dec. 31  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major U.S. stock markets will close early on New  
Year's Eve as a precaution against any Year 2000 computer glitches, 
officials said. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq 
Stock Market and the American Stock Exchange will end at 1 p.m. on 
Dec. 31. Traditionally, the markets only close early on two days of 
the year: the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. Richard 
Grasso, chairman of the NYSE, said yesterday he expects its systems 
and those of users of the markets to be in perfect shape for the 
change, but think the early close is a prudent step.

U.S. financial institution by a foreign bank. The new institution 
is be larger than UBS AG of Switzerland, currently the largest 
bank, and the recently formed Citigroup Inc.

	Duty-Free Shopping Ending in Europe  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Duty-free shopping within the European  
Union will almost certainly end June 30, after EU leaders failed to 
agree today on a reprieve for the popular travelers' perk. A 
last-ditch appeal from British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his 
French counterpart, Lionel Jospin, failed to muster the required 
unanimity within the 15-nation bloc when Denmark and the 
Netherlands refused to agree. EU nations all agreed nine years ago 
to end tax-free sales of liquor, cigarettes, perfume and other 
luxury goods for travelers on ferries and planes between EU 
nations. Duty-free sales will still be allowed for travel outside 
the EU.

	Shareholders Back Laura Ashley's Plan  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The floral prints and bright summer clothes on the  
racks at Laura Ashley stores offer little hint of the company's 
grim struggle to stave off insolvency. The British retailer, which 
made its name selling English country fashions and furnishings, 
recently won a crucial reprieve when bankers agreed to let it 
continue borrowing so long as it sold off its unprofitable chain of 
U.S. stores. But while shareholders approved the sale yesterday, 
enabling Laura Ashley to write off $34.4 million in debt, the 
retail chain must still try to recover from years of losses and 
chaotic management, including seven chief executives in 10 years.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom is being sued by investors and may  
be facing a federal probe over whether it improperly concealed its 
plans to buy paging company Skytel Communications. A class-action 
suit was announced late yesterday by a group of investors charging 
they made money-losing trades after MCI WorldCom made misleading 
statements. Regulators, meanwhile, are reportedly investigating 
whether MCI WorldCom intentionally mislead investors with its 
statements regarding the Web address on May 25, three days before 
announcing the $1.3 billion purchase of Skytel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Holds Off on Euro Food Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a precautionary measure, the Department of  
Agriculture is keeping all imports of chickens, pork and any 
byproducts from the European Union off the American market. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made Thursday after EU officials began  
destroying those items for fear they could be laced with a 
cancer-causing dioxin. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's Food and Safety Inspection Service said it was  
acting in response to information received from the Belgian 
government when it decided to place a hold on chicken and pork. The 
department could not say how many pounds of imported goods the 
action involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are precautionary steps,'' said Mark Mina, acting  
administrator for the inspection service. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the European Union called for the destruction of  
Belgian chickens, eggs and any byproducts that could contain a 
cancer-causing dioxin. The Belgian government also issued a 
slaughter ban on pigs, fearful that many of them have also been 
infected by the same contaminated animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department, which has not ordered any  
recall of products on store shelves, said it is reviewing products 
imported since January to determine if additional action is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork imports from the EU to the United States totaled $245  
million in 1998. The United States imported virtually no poultry 
meat from the EU during that period, said USDA spokesman Andy 
Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's executive commission ordered the measure after a  
meeting of veterinary experts and lashed out at Belgium for moving 
too slowly when the European consumer could be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal broke last week when a television station reported  
that dioxin-laced fat was used to make poultry feed. Dioxin is a 
carcinogenic byproduct in the manufacture of some herbicides and 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU decision forces EU nations to destroy any poultry, eggs,  
or byproducts from some 400 suspect farms in Belgium produced from 
Jan. 15 to June 1.

<HEADLINE>  Hingis Seeks First French Open Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Pressure? What pressure? For Steffi Graf,  
Saturday's French Open women's final is just another tennis match. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she is playing for a Grand Slam title for the first  
time in almost three years, Graf has won this clay-court 
championship five times before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I obviously feel that I don't have to prove anything,'' Graf  
said. ``I don't have the feeling that I have to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the case for her 18-year-old and No. 1-ranked  
opponent, Martina Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	She is determined to win at Roland Garros and become only the  
ninth woman -- and the first since Graf -- to triumph at each Grand 
Slam singles stop. 
</P>
<P>
	It should be a tight final, a clash of generations if not of  
styles. Both Graf and Hingis are big hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	But, while Hingis doesn't have any clear weaknesses, Graf -- in  
her first Grand Slam final since the 1996 U.S. Open -- will look to 
take advantage of her greater athletic ability and speed, and 
attack the Swiss player's unexceptional serve. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis will be wary of Graf's renowned forehand. But the  
29-year-old German's tendency to run around her backhand could 
leave her out of position -- and exposed to Hingis' accurate ground 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, who has won seven Grand Slam doubles titles, is happier  
at the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steffi has a powerful baseline game,'' Hingis said. And in  
addition to Graf's forehand, ``her slice backhand is very deep and 
low. You can't do much out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, holder of 21 Grand Slam titles, is 6-2 against Hingis  
lifetime, but Hingis won their only previous match on clay -- in the 
1996 Italian Open -- and their most recent meeting -- this year at 
the Pan Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	After terrible luck with injuries, Graf is storming back.  
</P>
<P>
	A win against Hingis would leave her one shy of Chris Evert's  
record of seven French Open singles titles. She already has equaled 
Evert's record of nine finals appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf will move to No. 3 in the rankings next week, her best  
placing for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	And if she beats Hingis, Graf would be the first woman in open  
history to defeat the top three players in the same event, already 
eliminating second-seeded Lindsay Davenport and No. 3 Monica Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, looking to add to her fifth Grand Slam win in Australia  
this year, has had a much easier route to the final, facing only 
one seeded player, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she has been in outstanding form here, not dropping a set  
so far, and is eager to overcome the disappointment of her surprise 
French Open final defeat two years ago to Iva Majoli. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis admits that she underestimated Majoli in that match.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have learned to play smarter now,'' she said. ``The last two  
or three years I felt worse. Now I am feeling better. That is the 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis added that she is happier facing Graf than Seles, and  
hopes that the German will have stage fright on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``With her absence in the last two years I hope she will be a  
little bit nervous,'' Hingis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's reply? ``I won't.''

<HEADLINE> Beanie Babies Frenzy Hits Freeway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Talk about a rush for Beanie Babies.  
</P>
<P>
	Some Atlanta motorists risked life and limb Thursday evening to  
grab the popular stuffed animals when they spilled onto Interstate 
285 during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The ostrich Teenie Beanie Babies likely were headed for a  
McDonald's restaurant when they escaped their carrier, surmised 
Phil Taylor, a supervisor for the state's motorist assistance 
agency. The fast food chain is featuring a series of ``Teenie'' 
versions of the toys, including ``Stretchy the Ostrich,'' in its 
kids' meals these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said he saw at least six or seven motorists leaning from  
their cars to scoop up the Beanie Babies with one hand while they 
kept rolling with the other hand on the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	He and another officer removed about 30 stuffed animals from the  
freeway, two lanes of which were covered with Beanie Babies road 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials aren't sure which vehicle dropped the stuffed animals  
or how many were snatched by motorists.

<HEADLINE> Roy Meltdown Costs Avalanche Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The man often called the best money goalie in  
playoff hockey came up bankrupt on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Roy gave up three goals on the first 12 shots he faced  
during Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, leading to a 4-1 
Dallas Stars victory over the Colorado Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars now will face the Buffalo Sabres in Game 1 of the  
Stanley Cup finals starting Tuesday night in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy's poor performance in career Game 7s now threatens to  
tarnish an otherwise gold-plated playoff reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss dropped Roy's career record in deciding seventh games  
to 2-4. A similar Roy collapse came during last season's 
first-round series against the underdog Edmonton Oilers, who scored 
four times on just 17 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night, Roy gave up four goals on the first 19 shots.  
</P>
<P>
	He was 20-of-25 Friday, and didn't look like the all-time  
winningest playoff goalie with three Stanley Cups to his credit 
during an abysmal performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough taking this because I know I'm towards the end of  
my career and there's not many chances left,'' Roy said. ``These 
were two great teams that played against each other. It was so 
close we could easily be in the Stanley Cup final.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not after Roy's meltdown, which began on Dallas' second shot of  
the night. 
</P>
<P>
	With only Sandis Ozolinsh back to defend, Joe Nieuwendyk  
streaked up the left side and slid the puck to Jamie Langenbrunner, 
who shot it past Ozolinsh and Roy as the Stars went ahead 1-0 at 
8:25 of the first. Roy had been leaning the wrong way when the 
tepid shot passed by him. 
</P>
<P>
	On Mike Keane's first goal at 11:13 of the second, Roy was  
beaten between the legs by his former teammate's wrist shot from 
the low slot. In spite of a clear look at Keane, Roy was again 
caught out of position. It was the 10th shot he had faced. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they put us down 2-0, I knew we were in trouble,  
especially the way they play tight defense,'' Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
	About four minutes later, Keane faked twice to draw Roy to the  
ice before sliding the puck into an open net to make it 3-0. It was 
Dallas' 12th shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy's mistake in the third period made it 4-0. Wandering out of  
the net to play the puck, Roy mishandled it as he sent it up the 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The puck came to Jere Lehtinen, who slammed it into the open net  
from the circle at 6:18. Roy barely got back in time to get his 
stick on it. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the costly errors, Roy's teammates blamed themselves  
instead of the goalie -- the same man who took his own teammates to 
task publicly for failing to crank up the offense during Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't give Patty too much help. I think if we'd have  
played a little better defense in front of him, it would have made 
a difference,'' forward Adam Deadmarsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley defended Roy obliquely.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a team sport and we rely on everyone,'' Hartley said.  
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the ice, Ed Belfour was nearly flawless.  
Belfour's 18-save performance gave him his second trip to the Cup 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's much maligned and it's really unfair because anybody  
who's watched the playoffs all year has seen Eddie at his best and 
he's come through in big times,'' Stars forward Brett Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
	He led a Chicago Blackhawks drive to the finals in 1992, but  
dropped four straight games to the eventual champion Pittsburgh 
Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour's mental errors during the conference finals last year  
were often blamed for the Stars' series loss against the Detroit 
Red Wings.

<HEADLINE> Importer Settles Sex Harassment Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A beverage importer who marketed the German  
liqueur Jagermeister by using models to promote it in bars and 
restaurants has agreed to pay $2.6 million to settle a sexual 
harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced the  
deal -- touted as the largest such settlement in New York state 
history -- with Sidney Frank Importing Co. and its subsidiary, All 
State Promotions Inc., on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission plans to divide the settlement among Sidney Frank  
employees across the country who believe they were harassed. So 
far, women have come forward from Texas, California, New York, 
South Carolina, Massachusetts, Florida and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Two former ``Jagerettes'' appeared Thursday on behalf of the 100  
or so women who claimed they were grabbed, groped and even licked 
by company President Sidney Frank, as well as by customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``His idea of being a team player, of making the (boss) happy,  
was submitting to his sexual advances,'' said 28-year-old Patrice 
Chase of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank was not named personally as a defendant in the case, but  
was he was accused in court papers of grabbing and kissing 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In the settlement, the company denied any wrongdoing, but agreed  
to make changes in the way it handles future complaints.

<HEADLINE> Three Ring Captures Acorn Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three Ring, who finished last in the Kentucky  
Derby, withstood a foul claim on Friday to capture the $200,000 
Acorn Stakes by a head at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jerry Bailey, Three Ring won for the third time in  
five starts this year. She was the odds-on favorite in the Grade I 
race for 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Better Than Honour was tough in the stretch but settled for  
second in the eight-horse field. Madison's Charm was another 
half-length back in third. 
</P>
<P>
	After the horses crossed the finish line, Better Than Honour  
jockey Richard Migliore said Three Ring interfered in the final 
furlong. 
</P>
<P>
	A review showed Three Ring drifting out under Bailey's  
left-handed whip. The filly apparently bumped Better Than Honor and 
forced her wide, but the stewards deemed the jostling insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida-bred filly previously scored decisive victories  
against her own sex in Gulfstream Park's Grade II Bonnie Miss and 
Davona Dale stakes. She finished 19th in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring carried 121 pounds, as did all the starters. She  
covered the mile in 1:36 on a fast track to earn $120,000 for owner 
Barry Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
	The Acorn is the first leg of the New York Racing Association's  
Triple Tiara series for 3-year-old fillies. The other legs are the 
Mother Goose Stakes on June 26 and the Coaching Club American Oaks 
on July 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring returned $3.80, $2.90 and $2.60. Better Than Honour  
paid $5.10 and $4.20 and Madison's Charm showed at $4.20. 
</P>
<P>
	In the co-feature, the $82,075 Fashion Stakes for 2-year-olds,  
More Than Ready won by a head and is unbeaten in three career 
starts. The odds-on choice carried 119 pounds and was ridden by 
John Velazquez. 
</P>
<P>
	Diablo's Addition was second in the field of six, finishing 5 3/4  
lengths ahead of Bevo. 
</P>
<P>
	More Than Ready went five furlongs in :57 to earn $49,245 for  
owner James Scatuorchio. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner returned $3.30, $2.50 and $2.10. Diablo's Addition  
paid $6.40 and $2.10 and Bevo showed at $2.10.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Bonilla Upset by Waiver Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Saying the New York Mets could ``ship me to  
Alaska'' if they wanted to get rid of him, Bobby Bonilla reacted 
angrily Friday to a report the team had put him and fellow 
outfielder Brian McRae on waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I want to stay here? Ask me if I care,'' Bonilla said  
before the opener of a three-game interleague series against the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can ship me to Alaska if they want. They can send me home  
tomorrow if they like,'' he said. ``I'll watch the boys play from 
my house. I might even buy a season ticket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Friday that both players had been  
placed on waivers by the Mets earlier this week. If any team 
claimed them, the Mets would have automatically lost them. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets general manager Steve Phillips declined to say whether  
Bonilla and McRae had been put on waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to comment on the report,'' Phillips said.  
``There's nothing to tell them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said he had not been told of such a move.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't know,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla, 36, began the night batting only .160 with four home  
runs and 14 RBIs. Put on the disabled list in May because of a 
bruised knee, Bonilla is making $5.9 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	McRae, 31, began the day batting .262 with five homers and 17  
RBIs. In his first at-bat of the night at Yankee Stadium, he hit a 
solo home run off David Cone in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	McRae, who recently criticized Valentine's lineups, did not  
appear as bothered as Bonilla by the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in the big leagues long enough that nothing  
surprises me anymore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' outfield situation this season has been complicated by  
the impressive play of young Roger Cedeno and Benny Agbayani. Along 
with Rickey Henderson in left field, the Mets have five players 
vying for three starting spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Major leaguers are routinely placed on waivers, often to make it  
possible to trade them. The first time a player is put on waivers 
during each waiver period, a team retains the right to pull him off 
waivers if another club claims him. Teams do not have that 
opportunity the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and Valentine both said they did not plan to address  
the situation with Bonilla and McRae. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said his biggest problem was finding enough playing  
time for his outfielders. Bonilla served as the designated hitter 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough spot,'' Valentine said.

<HEADLINE> Springer Appears at Chicago Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- No chairs flew across the room. But the air was  
filled with plenty of sarcastic remarks and ``oohs'' from the crowd 
as Jerry Springer took the hot seat at City Hall on Friday to 
answer what seemed a simple question. 
</P>
<P>
	Is the violence -- the eye-pokings, the hair-pulling and all-out  
brawls -- on his controversial TV show staged or real? 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks real to me,'' a shrugging Springer told a hearing of  
the city council's Police and Fire Committee. He admitted there had 
been some staged incidents during the Chicago-based show's 
eight-year run. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``overwhelmingly, the show is real,'' he told the City  
Council, whose members are called aldermen. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderman Ed Burke, a former policeman, has said that if the  
violence is real, off-duty Chicago police officers who work for 
Springer should cuff show guests who get out of hand and haul them 
off to jail. If it's fake, he says Springer should get an 
entertainment license. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes vague, sometimes defiant -- and always ducking  
responsibility for anything other than his duties as the talk 
show's host -- Springer held court in what more often resembled one 
of his own shows than a formal hearing. All the ingredients were 
there -- cheering fans, hissing opponents and a bank of about 20 TV 
cameras, including at least one from ``The Jerry Springer Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the three-hour hearing began, Springer drew applause when he  
objected to some of Burke's questions, including one aimed at his 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's none of your business,'' Springer said.  
</P>
<P>
	When questioned about his producers allegedly bringing a banned  
felon into the country to appear on the show -- Springer chose not 
to answer. He then leaned toward the microphone with a grin and 
sniped, ``I've never been a member of the communist party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's beautiful,'' yelled Jim Birmingham, a retired city  
worker and Springer fan who came to watch the hearing. ``Do it some 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though threatened with a subpoena, Springer came to the hearing  
voluntarily. But he said he thought the committee should be 
concentrating on more serious matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of difference in the violence that happens on  
the streets of Chicago and the roughhousing that takes place in our 
studio,'' Springer said, likening the fights on his show to brawls 
at a hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
	He said guests were free to file complaints against one another.  
The off-duty officers also had the discretion to make arrests -- and 
have done so on rare occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke, who played several fight scenes from Springer's ``Best of  
...'' videotape for the hearing, implied that the brawls on the 
show were no different than domestic fights that led to more than 
17,000 arrests in Chicago in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer balked at the comparison. He said his show might even  
curb violence because it shows it in all its unattractive glory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody watches our show and thinks, `Wow, that's behavior that  
I think everyone's going to love ... ,'' Springer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have to clean up his act anyway.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the syndicated show's distributor issued an order  
forbidding fights and replaced some scheduled episodes with tamer 
shows -- an agreement that Springer has already reneged on once. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Catholic priest who prompted the  
committee to take up the matter, said he plans to hold distributor 
Studios USA Network to that promise. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the aldermen tabled a resolution that would force  
officers to make arrests if the violence were deemed real. Alderman 
Dorothy Tillman called the hearing a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really sat here and tried to turn it into `The Jerry  
Springer Show,''' Tillman told her colleagues. Then she turned her 
comments to Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry, through it all, you won.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's election campaign came to  
a chaotic end Friday when troops fired warning shots at 
rock-throwing mobs attacking supporters of the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
	All sides must now observe a two-day cooling-off period before  
Monday's crucial balloting for a new Parliament -- Indonesia's 
freest election in 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golkar Party, which dominated the political landscape for  
decades under former authoritarian President Suharto, made a 
last-ditch attempt Friday to reverse poor poll showings and 
overcome a series of fizzled rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10,000 people showed up for the rally in the city center,  
but that was a fraction of the throngs that have turned out for 
opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri's party. Before long, 
simmering anti-Golkar resentment boiled over in at least three 
parts of the capital, Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobs, including many Megawati supporters, threw rocks and set  
motorcycles and a bus on fire. They chased Golkar supporters and 
stripped off their yellow T-shirts, burning them along with Golkar 
flags. 
</P>
<P>
	``Long live Mega! We hate Golkar!'' cried one activist, Budi  
Rachmad. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge rallies organized by Megawati have showed widespread  
support for the daughter of Indonesia's charismatic founder, 
President Sukarno, who died in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, once banned by  
Suharto, has formed a coalition with two other opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of riot police armed with batons and shields were sent  
to trouble spots and soldiers fired warning shots over the heads of 
about 2,000 people in eastern Jakarta. Some soldiers fired directly 
into the crowd, but officers at the scene said they were using 
blanks. 
</P>
<P>
	State radio reported five injuries, including two children.  
</P>
<P>
	Calm returned to the areas about an hour later after a heavy  
thunderstorm swept through the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting also broke out in central Java between supporters of  
the Muslim-based United Development Party and the National 
Awakening Party, who have clashed in several towns. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Friday's clashes, the campaign turned out to be more  
peaceful than expected. Some ethnic Chinese, who have been targeted 
in past unrest, and foreigners have fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in their party colors, singing songs and chanting  
slogans, many of the supporters of the 48 parties appeared 
overjoyed by the prospect of an open election. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Suharto, who resigned last year amid riots and student  
protests, only three parties were allowed to participate in 
elections that many critics claimed were rigged. 
</P>
<P>
	Golkar chairman Akbar Tanjung said Thursday that the party has  
abandoned its role as an instrument of authoritarian rule and was 
dedicated to democratic reform and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the record of President B.J. Habibie, who has legalized  
political parties and freed many political prisoners since 
Suharto's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Golkar has named Habibie, Suharto's hand-picked successor, as  
its presidential candidate when the new Parliament helps choose a 
new leader later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjung predicted that Golkar would win 30 percent to 40 percent  
of the vote Monday. But opinion polls have shown Golkar with far 
less support.

<HEADLINE> Man Admits Embezzling $1.4M Book Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A debt collector for Penguin Books USA Inc.  
admitted in court Friday that he and the company's former 
collections manager embezzled $1.4 million from the publishing 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerome F. Bedell, the collection agent, has been cooperating  
with federal investigators and the company since it uncovered the 
scheme 2 1/2 years ago, and has paid back the more than $900,000 he 
received, said his lawyer, Donald R. Belsole. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his cooperation, Bedell, 57, of Morristown, could still  
face several months in prison on the single conspiracy charge, as 
well as a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gain or loss from the 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguin has maintained the manager, Christina Galatro, hid  
stolen payments from bookstores by extending unauthorized discounts 
to book retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	To cover losses from the embezzlement, discounts and potential  
legal settlements, Penguin parent Pearson P.L.C., the British media 
conglomerate, two years ago took a $163 million pretax charge 
against 1996 earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal prompted the American Booksellers Association to  
examine whether Penguin's discount practices constituted favoritism 
with bookselling chains. Penguin settled the case with a $25 
million payment to the group, which represents independent 
booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
	A Penguin spokesman, Michael Gross, said the company would have  
no comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left for representatives of the booksellers' group were  
not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Galatro was also scheduled to plead guilty Friday but  
canceled. ``She's just not available today,'' said her lawyer, 
Chris S.M. Franzblau, who said she still intends to plead guilty to 
federal criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Penguin employee also helped steal the money, according  
to court papers, but was not named by Bedell. Lawyers declined to 
identify the person. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Galatro is still contesting a Penguin lawsuit charging that  
she and her husband, Stanley, used her cut of the embezzlement -- 
more than $400,000 -- to finance cruises to Alaska, Europe and the 
Caribbean as well as other trips and purchases of antiques and 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	Franzblau said Mrs. Galatro, of Freehold, was released from  
civil liability in her termination agreement and that Penguin still 
owes her $300,000 in severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguin in June 1997 disclosed the embezzlement when it  
announced its suit against Mrs. Galatro. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell operated Associated Collection Bureau Inc. in Morristown  
beginning in 1976; it changed its name to Associated Companies Inc. 
in 1994 and moved to nearby Parsippany. He has since sold the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Galatro, a Penguin employee since 1980, became manager of  
its collections department in Bergenfield in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	She and Bedell embezzled by two methods, according to Bedell:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Starting in spring 1992, Mrs. Galatro assigned delinquent  
accounts to Bedell for collection, for which he would get up to 25 
percent as his fee. Instead of returning the money he garnered to 
Penguin, Bedell kept it. Mrs. Galatro made false entries at Penguin 
to make it appear the accounts were uncollectable. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mrs. Galatro stole more than 45 checks from Penguin customers,  
totaling more than $1 million, from November 1995 to January 1997. 
She gave them to Bedell, who cashed them. 
</P>
<P>
	She received her share through an American Express credit card  
Bedell gave her and paid for her purchases, he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell is to be sentenced Aug. 30 by U.S. District Judge John C.  
Lifland, but that could be delayed, depending on when Mrs. 
Galatro's plea is taken.

<HEADLINE> Jury Mulls Case Against Ill. Lawmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- A jury deliberated charges today in the  
conspiracy trial of five lawmen accused of railroading a man for 
the slaying of a 10-year-old girl, after defense attorneys said the 
man's testimony was riddled with lies. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments Thursday, several jurors chuckled as  
attorney Brian Telander ridiculed Rolando Cruz for contradictions 
in his story and admitted lies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy lied so much that his name should be Pinocchio, not  
Rolando,'' Telander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz claimed he never made an incriminating statement to  
detectives in the 1983 rape and bludgeoning death of 10-year-old 
Jeanine Nicarico of Naperville, who was abducted from her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Terry Ekl suggested to jurors that Cruz may  
well have been involved in the crime, or at least talked to someone 
who was. He cited a litany of statements in which Cruz told 
authorities details of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Special prosecutor William Kunkle argued that Cruz, who spent  
nearly a decade on death row before he was freed, had been 
railroaded. A history of questionable actions, nonexistent reports 
and evolving statements prove the four DuPage County sheriff's 
deputies and an ex-county prosecutor lied and concocted evidence 
against Cruz, Kunkle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorities ignored evidence that another man may have  
committed the crime alone because it conflicted with their 
overzealous pursuit of Cruz, Kunkle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors began deliberations in the cases of four defendants late  
Thursday and resumed work today. Judge William A. Kelly will decide 
the fate of the other defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz was acquitted in 1995 at his third trial, when a dramatic  
change in testimony by one of the deputies. The new testimony cast 
doubt on the contention that Cruz gave two sheriff's detectives 
incriminating details in a statement describing a ``dream'' or 
``vision'' about the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	No police report was ever made on Cruz's alleged statement, and  
Kunkle contends the detectives made it up. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice  
and conspiracy to commit official misconduct. The deputies face 
additional charges, including perjury.

<HEADLINE>  Astros Owner Denies Making Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane cut short his  
vacation Friday to deny telling two TV executives his team doesn't 
market to Hispanics because baseball is too complex for them to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Camacho, vice president and general manager of KTMD-TV,  
and KTMD sales manager Rod Rodriguez said McLane made derogatory 
remarks about Hispanics before a dinner honoring him with the 
Houston Advertising Federation's Trailblazer Award for community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked him why he doesn't market toward Hispanics,'' Camacho  
said. ``He said it was hard to reach Hispanics because the game of 
baseball is strategy and skill and it's complicated and that's why 
more Hispanics don't go to Astros games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said if you gave them a basketball and told them to put the  
ball through the hoop, they can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho added that McLane said baseball is a game of statistics  
and numbers ``and people like to follow baseball in the newspapers 
and Hispanics don't read newspapers and when Hispanics do go, they 
buy the cheap $2 seats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros released a statement in which McLane described  
himself as ``angry and outraged'' about the accusations. McLane 
then ended his South Texas vacation to face reporters in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was important to be here and correct a statement  
that was not true and that has been manipulated,'' he said. ``I 
feel badly that this has been taken so much out of context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My statement was, in general terms, that of all major league  
sports, the most complicated is baseball. I say that to all types 
of groups. ... You can take a basketball and get anyone to 
understand that game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho, whose station aired a report on the alleged offending  
remarks Thursday night, attended the McLane news conference and 
said KTMD stands by its story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have witnesses who heard what he said,'' Camacho said. ``We  
are telling the truth. It's not a he said-she said. It's he 
said-they said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said his team hires Hispanics and that the Astros  
broadcast their games in Spanish. After his 45-minute news 
conference, he went on the air during the Astros-Minnesota Twins 
radio broadcast to make his point directly to fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig defended McLane, calling him  
``honorable'' and ``sensitive.'' Selig dismissed the remarks by the 
TV executives as ``slander'' and said McLane has the ``full support 
of everyone in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said he talked to six to eight people during a reception  
before the dinner but denied saying anything racially insensitive 
toward Hispanics, who represent 22 percent of the eight-county 
Houston area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of Hispanics who do come and are great  
supporters, but not in the percentage that the population 
represents in Harris County,'' McLane said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a disparaging remark pertaining to the cheap  
seats. That was never said. The food was never discussed. That just 
wasn't a part of the conversation that we had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, one of those who nominated McLane for the award, said  
he heard the same comments as Camacho. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said Hispanics don't read the newspapers,'' Rodriguez said.  
``I looked at my general manager (Camacho) to see if he's really 
saying that. I told him I read newspapers. We grew up on baseball. 
It was our livelihood. Hispanics love the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLane acknowledged that statistics were discussed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The statistics came up and I did comment that baseball is a  
very complex game,'' he said. ``But as far as comments that they 
didn't understand the stats or didn't read the stats is certainly 
something that was never discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	KTMD is an affiliate of the Spanish-language network Telemundo.  
Camacho said McLane declined an on-camera interview because he 
doesn't speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a slap in the face for me,'' Rodriguez said. ``I had a  
lot of respect for the man, but not after last night to learn that 
he is so narrow-minded. It's sad, especially as much as I enjoy the 
game. I won't lose faith in the club but I feel sorry for all the 
Hispanic players on the team.''

<HEADLINE>  Astros Owner Denies Making Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane cut short his  
vacation Friday to deny telling two TV executives his team doesn't 
market to Hispanics because baseball is too complex for them to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Camacho, vice president and general manager of KTMD-TV,  
and KTMD sales manager Rod Rodriguez said McLane made derogatory 
remarks about Hispanics before a dinner honoring him with the 
Houston Advertising Federation's Trailblazer Award for community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked him why he doesn't market toward Hispanics,'' Camacho  
said. ``He said it was hard to reach Hispanics because the game of 
baseball is strategy and skill and it's complicated and that's why 
more Hispanics don't go to Astros games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said if you gave them a basketball and told them to put the  
ball through the hoop, they can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho added that McLane said baseball is a game of statistics  
and numbers ``and people like to follow baseball in the newspapers 
and Hispanics don't read newspapers and when Hispanics do go, they 
buy the cheap $2 seats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros released a statement in which McLane described  
himself as ``angry and outraged'' about the accusations. McLane 
then ended his South Texas vacation to face reporters in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was important to be here and correct a statement  
that was not true and that has been manipulated,'' he said. ``I 
feel badly that this has been taken so much out of context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My statement was, in general terms, that of all major league  
sports, the most complicated is baseball. I say that to all types 
of groups. ... You can take a basketball and get anyone to 
understand that game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho, whose station aired a report on the alleged offending  
remarks Thursday night, attended the McLane news conference and 
said KTMD stands by its story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have witnesses who heard what he said,'' Camacho said. ``We  
are telling the truth. It's not a he said-she said. It's he 
said-they said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said his team hires Hispanics and that the Astros  
broadcast their games in Spanish. After his 45-minute news 
conference, he went on the air during the Astros-Minnesota Twins 
radio broadcast to make his point directly to fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig defended McLane, calling him  
``honorable'' and ``sensitive.'' Selig dismissed the remarks by the 
TV executives as ``slander'' and said McLane has the ``full support 
of everyone in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said he talked to six to eight people during a reception  
before the dinner but denied saying anything racially insensitive 
toward Hispanics, who represent 22 percent of the eight-county 
Houston area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of Hispanics who do come and are great  
supporters, but not in the percentage that the population 
represents in Harris County,'' McLane said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a disparaging remark pertaining to the cheap  
seats. That was never said. The food was never discussed. That just 
wasn't a part of the conversation that we had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, one of those who nominated McLane for the award, said  
he heard the same comments as Camacho. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said Hispanics don't read the newspapers,'' Rodriguez said.  
``I looked at my general manager (Camacho) to see if he's really 
saying that. I told him I read newspapers. We grew up on baseball. 
It was our livelihood. Hispanics love the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLane acknowledged that statistics were discussed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The statistics came up and I did comment that baseball is a  
very complex game,'' he said. ``But as far as comments that they 
didn't understand the stats or didn't read the stats is certainly 
something that was never discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	KTMD is an affiliate of the Spanish-language network Telemundo.  
Camacho said McLane declined an on-camera interview because he 
doesn't speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a slap in the face for me,'' Rodriguez said. ``I had a  
lot of respect for the man, but not after last night to learn that 
he is so narrow-minded. It's sad, especially as much as I enjoy the 
game. I won't lose faith in the club but I feel sorry for all the 
Hispanic players on the team.''

<HEADLINE> Dudley To Start for Knicks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chris Dudley will start at center for the New  
York Knicks in place of Patrick Ewing when the Eastern Conference 
finals against the Indiana Pacers resumes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy announced his choice Friday, the third  
straight day without a game in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, this is the simplest,'' Van Gundy said of his decision  
to start the slow-footed, offensively challenged Dudley. ``You can 
get guys in as early as you want, you can change early if that's 
what you need to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley started 16 games during the regular season, four  
alongside Ewing and 12 when Ewing was out with Achilles tendinitis. 
In the 12 games without Ewing, the Knicks went 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Patrick's been out in the past, that's how we've been,''  
Van Gundy said. ``We've had some good wins, some tough losses. 
We'll start the same, and everyone will stay in their same 
pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means Latrell Sprewell, the team's leading scorer, will  
continue to come off the bench in the first and third quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks used the third day of rest to go over what they need  
to do better now that they don't have Ewing. Doctors discovered a 
slight tear in Ewing's Achilles' tendon on Wednesday and declared 
him out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston, Sprewell, Larry Johnson and the two point guards,  
Charlie Ward and Chris Childs, will need to contribute more 
offensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like Patrick was averaging 20 shots a game,'' Houston  
said. ``We had a lot of balance before Patrick went out, so it's 
going to change, but it's not going to change to the point where 
certain people are going to take 10 or 20 more shots per game and 
overextend themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game will only be the third for Indiana in two weeks  
since it completed a sweep of Philadelphia in the semifinals May 
23. For the Knicks, it will be their third in 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been great for us,'' coach Larry Bird said of the  
extensive practice time his team has had. ``We got a lot of things 
accomplished. We put in some new stuff on the offensive end. We've 
had time to prepare and that should help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks are expecting to see improved offensive production  
from Rik Smits, now that his chances of getting into foul trouble 
while guarding Ewing have been reduced. Van Gundy would not say 
whether Dudley would start with the defensive assignment on Smits, 
or whether he will continue handing that task to Kurt Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy also warned that the Knicks cannot overlook the  
contributions of Dale and Antonio Davis, both of whom have hurt the 
Knicks offensively during this series. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you go into the game trying to avoid foul trouble, you  
can't be effective. We've got to be aggressive, tenacious and 
passionate, but we also have to be smart,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they've been a much better road team in the playoffs  
than they have at home. They were up 30-27 (after one quarter) at 
Milwaukee, 28-22 at Philly and 31-17 at Philly, and we have to be 
ready. No one plays better on the road,'' Van Gundy said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's NTT Gets Philippine Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph  
and Telephone Corp. announced Friday that it will take a 15 percent 
stake in Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. 
</P>
<P>
	NTT said it will exchange all of its shares in Philippine  
cellular phone operator Smart Communications Inc. for new common 
shares in PLDT. NTT will pay out a further $386 million for new 
PLDT stock. 
</P>
<P>
	NTT has a 37 percent share in Smart Communications, while Hong  
Kong's First Pacific Co. -- PLDT's main shareholder -- has a 6 
percent share in Smart. Smart will become a wholly owned subsidiary 
of PLDT. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will give PLDT an 80 percent share of the cellular  
market in the Philippines. PLDT has 60 percent to 70 percent of the 
international telecommunications market and 60 percent of the 
fixed-line market. 
</P>
<P>
	Smart currently has a 50 percent share of the cellular market.  
</P>
<P>
	Masanobu Suzuki, NTT executive vice president, said the tie-up  
with PLDT will give NTT access to both cellular and international 
phone services as Japan's telecommunications market is deregulated.

<HEADLINE>  Spurs Want Road Perfection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Something has to give tonight between San  
Antonio and Portland in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs haven't lost on the road in the playoffs. The Trail  
Blazers are 5-0 at home in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The game is much more important to the Blazers, who are down 2-0  
after a pair of close losses in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven teams have come back to win a seven-game series after  
losing the first two games. No team has come back from a 3-0 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland coach Mike Dunleavy, in an effort to put the situation  
in a less pessimistic light, said that what has happened so far is 
simply what was supposed to happen -- the home team won. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect us to hold serve and go back to San Antonio 2-2,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs know they didn't play particularly well in their two  
home victories. The Blazers have outscored San Antonio from the 
field and outrebounded them. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we've won two games,'' Tim Duncan said. ``Whether that be  
luck or whatever else, we're still up 2-0, and we have the 
opportunity to do a great thing in this third game and try to put 
it away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan finished third in the league MVP voting made public on  
Thursday, and he seemed hardly to care because the two who finished 
above him, Karl Malone and Alonzo Mourning, are out of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather be right here right now, I'll tell you that,''  
Duncan said. ``I'm very happy with the position that I'm in right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan gives himself an average grade so far in the Western  
Conference finals, even though he's averaged 22 points and 11.5 
rebounds and is shooting 61.5 percent from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Average for him,'' teammate Sean Elliott said, ``but above  
average for anybody else. He can probably play better, but you've 
got to give credit to Portland, too. That's their defensive 
scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Spurs were preaching teamwork, sacrifice and  
cohesiveness, the Blazers were weathering Damon Stoudamire's 
ill-timed outburst. The Portland point guard is unhappy about 
sitting in the fourth quarter in favor of Greg Anthony. Stoudamire 
lashed out at the situation after practice on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get over it, but I'm never going to forget it,'' he said  
in a wide-ranging conversation that also included a jab at his 
persistent critics in Portland, where he grew up and was a high 
school star. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy, who earned NBA coach of the year honors for dealing  
with such problems on a deep, talented and young team, downplayed 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The comments don't bother me. The timing of it at this point  
maybe does a little bit,'' Dunleavy said. ``But it's nothing that 
major. I don't think it's going to affect the way he plays. It's 
not going to affect the way I coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day layoff has not erased the pain of Elliott's tip-toe  
3-pointer that beat Portland 86-85 Monday in Game 2, a game the 
Blazers led by as many as 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``To wait this long, it eats at you,'' Jim Jackson said, ``but  
you know you have a chance for it to set in and hurt, because you 
know you gave a game away, or maybe two away, and you've got to 
have a time period where you sit there and think about it, about 
the little things you did wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series has shown a marked contrast between the high emotion  
of the fragile Blazers and the even, uncomplaining keel of the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're an older group,'' Elliott said. ``We've been through  
situations in our careers where maybe we were unhappy with our 
playing time or we were unhappy with the number of shots we got. 
But we're beyond that now. Guys here aren't trying to star in 
commercials. We're trying to win. We don't have a lot of time left 
on these legs, so we're trying to get it done now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Elie, who played on two championship teams in Houston,  
senses that special something on this team, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a confident group. We've got a lot of trust in each  
other,'' he said. ``That's what I like. A guy can miss all day, but 
if he's open, you get him the ball. That's what this team has been 
about all year, trusting each other, sharing the ball. We've got a 
bond right now that's hard to explain. We feel good about each 
other.''

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Election Charges Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- A judge threw out charges Friday against  
two top aides to Gov. Paul Patton and two union leaders, ruling 
that the campaign finance laws they allegedly violated were 
unconstitutionally vague. 
</P>
<P>
	The four had been accused of taking part in a scheme to  
circumvent spending limits during Patton's 1995 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton, traveling in Japan, said the dismissal of the charges  
was ``welcome news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charges were thrown out against Andrew ``Skipper'' Martin,  
Patton's chief of staff; Danny Ross, the governor's liaison for 
labor; Lon Fields, former president of a Teamsters local in 
Louisville; and Robert Winstead, the local's current president. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged that the Teamsters carried Ross on the union  
payroll so that the campaign would not have to pay his salary, and 
that the campaign, the union and other labor groups illegally 
coordinated their spending for a get-out-the-vote effort that 
proved decisive in the Democrat's narrow victory over Republican 
Larry Forgy. 
</P>
<P>
	But state Circuit Judge William W. Trude Jr. ruled that the  
campaign finance law's definitions of three terms -- contribution, 
independent expenditure and ``knowingly'' -- were too broad and 
vague. The General Assembly has already amended the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Ben Chandler, whose office brought the  
indictment, said he has not decided whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor had refused to suspend Martin or Ross. He said he  
is now ``even more convinced'' that none of the four violated 
``either the letter or the spirit of Kentucky's campaign finance 
laws as I understand them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross' lawyer,Phillip Shepherd, said the old definitions ``made  
it impossible for anyone who was independently supporting a 
candidate to communicate with a campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``That just runs squarely afoul of the First  
Amendment.''

<HEADLINE> NYSE Delays Extending Trading Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Balancing investors' desire for late-night stock  
trading with the need to maintain its integrity, the New York Stock 
Exchange has agreed to extend trading hours -- but not until next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Grasso, chairman of the NYSE, said that before the  
world's biggest stock market expands its hours it wants first to 
ensure there are no glitches with the year-2000 computer bug and 
the switch to reporting stock prices in decimals instead of 
fractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were unanimous this morning in our view that nothing should  
happen, at the Big Board at least, until the millennium change and 
decimalization have been accomplished,'' Grasso said Thursday 
afternoon. That would put off extending the trading day until the 
middle of 2000, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	The go-slow decision came a week after the Nasdaq Stock Market  
voted to begin extending its hours into the evening as soon as this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	By adding to its hours, the New York Stock Exchange will be  
taking a big step away from its roots on Wall Street, where traders 
in 1792 first gathered along a curb to buy and sell government 
bonds and bank stocks. In today's fast-paced markets, many 
companies and employees in the financial world will have to 
scramble to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, financial markets around the world are moving toward  
'round-the-clock trading and electronic trading businesses are 
offering added competition online to the U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	With U.S. markets' current hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern  
time, investors on the West Coast get shut out after lunch. Between 
20 percent to 25 percent of online trades by individual investors 
are placed after hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies they trade are also becoming more global. As AT&AMP;T,  
IBM and others expand their operations overseas, they gain 
investors in different markets. And vice versa: two weeks ago, the 
NYSE said it would list shares of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp., which 
controls about 10 percent of the U.S. car market. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NYSE's plans, an evening session would come first,  
followed shortly by the addition of an early morning session. 
Investors will only be able to trade 500 of the exchange's 3,088 
stocks during the extra hours. 
</P>
<P>
	For Wall Street firms and employees, the longer hours will be  
nothing short of a revolution. And some workers worry they won't 
have much time for family dinners or tucking the kids into bed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love what I do, but there's a limit to everything,'' said  
Marty Prinz, president of EDI Financial Inc., a brokerage in 
Dallas. ``Where do you draw the line for sacrificing? ... Most of 
the brokers don't get to spend much time with family while their 
kids are growing up, and I think this will help estrange family 
situations even more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prinz said he worried that the extra hours he'll put in  
supervising night trades could force him to give up time with his 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``You miss out on some of the things that they do in school,''  
he said. ``I think there will be frustrations created by that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prinz and his colleagues may get their first taste of it this  
fall if Nasdaq adds a second, evening session. The extended session 
would start at 5:30 p.m. and end at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. Eastern time. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq would not comment Thursday on the NYSE's decision to take  
the go-slow approach. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Frank Zarb, who heads Nasdaq, said last week, ``We are  
calling on the industry to do the right thing, to coordinate and be 
responsible and move in unison so the investor can be properly 
protected in the new world of extended hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, which regulates U.S. markets, has voiced concerns about 
extending hours before the end of the year and the transition to 
decimal-quoted stock prices. The SEC declined to comment Thursday 
on the NYSE's decision but called attention to Levitt's earlier 
statements that the industry needs to place investor protection 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Stock Exchange also plans to expand its hours.  
But like the NYSE, it intends to wait until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Frucher, chairman of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, said  
waiting until next year makes sense: ``This will provide the 
industry the time to look at the ramifications of extended hours. 
We want people to deal with their finances as investments and not 
look at the stock market as a gambling casino.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Mexico Court Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department welcomed a ruling by  
Mexico's supreme court that a man suspected of being a top drug 
trafficker can be extradited to the United States to face charges 
if he is arrested by Mexican police. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling involves Miguel Caro Quintero, said to control a  
large portion of drug trafficking along Mexico's northwestern 
border with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ability to hit the leadership of these drug-trafficking  
organizations is critical to the success of our joint strategy,'' 
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bringing such criminals to justice in Mexico and in the U.S.  
is of paramount importance,'' he said. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	Duncan gives himself an average grade so far in the Western  
Conference finals, even though he's averaged 22 points and 11.5 
rebounds and is shooting 61.5 percent from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Average for him,'' teammate Sean Elliott said, ``but above  
average for anybody else. He can probably play better, but you've 
got to give credit to Portland, too. That's their defensive 
scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Spurs were preaching teamwork, sacrifice and  
cohesiveness, the Blazers were weathering Damon Stoudamire's 
ill-timed outburst. The Portland point guard is unhappy about 
sitting in the fourth quarter in favor of Greg Anthony. Stoudamire 
lashed out at the situation after practice on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get over it, but I'm never going to forget it,'' he said  
in a wide-ranging conversation that also included a jab at his 
persistent critics in Portland, where he grew up and was a high 
school star. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy, who earned NBA coach of the year honors for dealing  
with such problems on a deep, talented and young team, downplayed 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The comments don't bother me. The timing of it at this point  
maybe does a little bit,'' Dunleavy said. ``But it's nothing that 
major. I don't think it's going to affect the way he plays. It's 
not going to affect the way I coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day layoff has not erased the pain of Elliott's tip-toe  
3-pointer that beat Portland 86-85 Monday in Game 2, a game the 
Blazers led by as many as 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``To wait this long, it eats at you,'' Jim Jackson said, ``but  
you know you have a chance for it to set in and hurt, because you 
know you gave a game away, or maybe two away, and you've got to 
have a time period where you sit there and think about it, about 
the little things you did wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series has shown a marked contrast between the high emotion  
of the fragile Blazers and the even, uncomplaining keel of the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're an older group,'' Elliott said. ``We've been through  
situations in our careers where maybe we were unhappy with our 
playing time or we were unhappy with the number of shots we got. 
But we're beyond that now. Guys here aren't trying to star in 
commercials. We're trying to win. We don't have a lot of time left 
on these legs, so we're trying to get it done now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Elie, who played on two championship teams in Houston,  
senses that special something on this team, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a confident group. We've got a lot of trust in each  
other,'' he said. ``That's what I like. A guy can miss all day, but 
if he's open, you get him the ball. That's what this team has been 
about all year, trusting each other, sharing the ball. We've got a 
bond right now that's hard to explain. We feel good about each 
other.''

<HEADLINE> British, Singapore Airlines Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- British Airways said Friday it has accused  
Singapore Airlines of patent infringement in the design of first 
class sleeper beds, and both companies have initiated legal 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to take this lying down,'' British Airways  
spokeswoman Louise Evans said in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Evans said British Airways ``invested millions'' in its  
flying bed and would fight to protect the design. ``Our Singapore 
lawyers wrote to Singapore Airlines asking them to stop infringing 
our patent,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that Singapore Airlines responded with a writ, and BA  
countered with its own legal order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We unveiled our innovative, award-winning flying bed for our  
first class customers in 1996,'' Ms. Evans said. She described the 
flat, 6-foot-6-inch (2 meter) bed as setting ``a new industry 
benchmark'' and added that ``it is protected by patents in many 
countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore Airlines introduced its first class ``bed in the sky''  
last September as part of a $300 million upgrade of its first and 
business classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore Airlines issued a faxed statement saying British  
Airways' claims of patent infringement were groundless and legal 
proceedings against BA had begun in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have patented our own first class seatbeds in Singapore and  
have been advised by our legal counsel in Singapore and Britain 
that we have not infringed the BA patent,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	It added that the two sides have agreed to meet and discuss the  
matter.

<HEADLINE> Nucor CEO Resigns Amid Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Nucor's chief executive abruptly resigned after  
being passed over for the company chairmanship and clashing with 
top management over whether the nation's No. 2 steel-maker should 
invest in non-steel ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	John Correnti resigned Thursday after days of company meetings,  
including one Wednesday with the Charlotte-based steelmaker's board 
of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman David Aycock, 68, who received the job as Nucor's  
chairman on Jan. 1 following the retirement of company founder Ken 
Iverson, will serve as CEO until Correnti's successor is chosen. 
Aycock retired as Nucor president in 1991, but remained as a 
director until his elevation to chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Correnti) and the board had a little different ideas on the  
direction of the company for the future,'' Aycock said. ``The board 
wants to at least evaluate opportunities in industries or 
businesses that are not steel or steel products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Correnti, 52, acknowledged there were philosophical differences.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have different ideas about corporate strategy and  
how to move the company forward,'' he said. ``This (resignation) is 
a personal decision concerning the future direction of the 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson-Humphrey analyst Doug Moffat said he was dismayed by  
the moves, and cut his rating on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aycock had been out of the company for a long time. I was  
concerned when he came back in as chairman. Obviously, they 
clashed, and Correnti is out,'' Moffat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aycock, 68, became Nucor's chairman on Jan. 1, following the  
retirement of company founder Ken Iverson. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Aycock said he asked Iverson to leave because the  
company needed to ``start thinking about succession. All up and 
down the line, I didn't feel the company made enough effort with 
succession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years prior to his 1996 appointment as chief executive,  
Correnti had been Iverson's heir apparent. Correnti was with 
Nucor's bigger rival U.S. Steel for 11 years before joining Nucor 
in 1980. He succeeded Aycock as president in 1991, and became chief 
executive in 1996. During that time, Nucor's sales nearly tripled, 
from $1.5 billion in 1991 to $4.15 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Nucor, after dropping more than 8 percent Thursday,  
fell 56 1/4 cents to $46.43 3/4 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> European Internet Connections Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Europeans are getting wired, with the number of  
household and business Internet connections nearly doubling last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dataquest Inc. reports 10 percent of Western European households  
were connected last year, up from five percent in 1997, according 
to today's edition of The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	About 36 percent of U.S. households were online at the end of  
1998, Dataquest says. 
</P>
<P>
	Business connections in Europe increased to 9.5 percent, up from  
five percent the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany led the way online both at home and work with 24  
percent, and the United Kingdom was second with 17 percent, the 
Journal reported. The fastest growth was in Russia, France and 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Online connections in Europe were boosted in part by increased  
activity among Internet service providers, Dataquest said. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose, Calif.-based market research company predicts  
cheap broadband services will continue to fuel growth in Europe, 
likely increasing Internet penetration in Western European 
households to 17 percent and in businesses to 16 percent by the end 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The critical point to attract mainstream advertisers and  
businesses to the Internet is about 20 percent, Dataquest senior 
analyst Petra Gartzen told the Journal.

	Today is Saturday, June 5, the 156th day of 1999. There are 209  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On June 5, 1968, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was shot and mortally  
wounded just after claiming victory in California's Democratic 
presidential primary. Gunman Sirhan Bishara Sirhan was immediately 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1723, economist Adam Smith was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1783, Joseph and Jacques Montgolfier publicly demonstrated  
their hot-air balloon in a 10-minute flight over Annonay, France. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1794, Congress passed the Neutrality Act, which prohibited  
Americans from enlisting in the service of a foreign power. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1883, economist John Maynard Keynes was born in Cambridge,  
England. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1917, about 10 million American men began registering for the  
draft in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1933, the United States went off the gold standard.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1940, the Battle of France began during World War II.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1947, Secretary of State George C. Marshall gave a speech at  
Harvard University in which he outlined an aid program for Europe 
that came to be known as ``The Marshall Plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, war erupted in the Mideast as Israel raided Egyptian  
military targets. Syria, Jordan and Iraq entered the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, Egypt reopened the Suez Canal to international  
shipping, eight years after it was closed because of the 1967 war 
with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: In one of the most remembered images of China's  
crushed pro-democracy movement, a lone man stood defiantly in front 
of a line of tanks in Beijing until friends pulled him out of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: President Clinton headed across the English  
Channel aboard the USS George Washington, en route to the 50th 
anniversary commemoration of D-Day in Normandy. At least 264 
Indonesian villagers in East Java were killed by an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: A strike at a General Motors parts factory near  
Detroit closed five assembly plants and idled workers nationwide; 
the walkout lasted seven weeks. Volkswagen AG won approval to buy 
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars for $700 million. However, BMW later 
purchased the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo.

<HEADLINE> Relatives View Ark. Jet Crash Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Federal investigators in the crash of  
American Airlines Flight 1420 visited a hospital Friday to 
interview injured passengers, while survivors and victims' 
relatives went to the end of a runway to see the plane's burned-out 
shell. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board wants to know what  
passengers saw, heard and smelled before and during the crash, 
which killed nine people, including the pilot. Among those on the 
interview list was the plane's first officer, Michael Origel, who 
broke his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one passengers remained hospitalized Friday, with four in  
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to get to as many people as we can get to now.  
Those who are in too bad a state, we'll come back and get them,'' 
said Robert Malloy of the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
	As investigators talked to survivors at University Hospital,  
eight charter buses drove down a Little Rock airport runway to the 
crash site. Survivors and relatives were given red and pink roses 
as they got off the buses. Some laid the flowers on a memorial made 
of hay bales. 
</P>
<P>
	They looked down on the crumpled MD-82 from a grassy hill at the  
end of the runway where the jet skidded in a thunderstorm Tuesday 
night, crashed into a metal walkway and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were tears. People as a group kind of consoled each  
other,'' said Jimmy Manus, whose wife and their two daughters 
survived the crash. ``They were glad they made the trip today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some hugged each other and held hands as they looked at the  
wreckage. Several wore neck braces, including one man in a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	``One woman broke down on her hands and knees. I was one of the  
crying ones. It was difficult, surprisingly difficult,'' said Jim 
Yates, a free-lance photographer who sometimes works for The 
Associated Press. His girlfriend had been on the plane. She chose 
not be there Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 investigators are trying to determine whether the  
pilot or the plane is to blame for mechanical quirks during the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	A flight data recorder indicates that the spoilers -- movable  
panels on the top of the wing -- did not open as usual to help slow 
down the plane. Also, the thrust reversers twice turned on and off, 
rather than remaining on until the plane slowed, said George Black 
of the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
	An American Airlines official, speaking on the condition of  
anonymity, said the plane's co-pilot was responsible for engaging a 
switch to activate the spoilers. 
</P>
<P>
	The panels flip up when the back wheels started turning on  
touchdown or, if they didn't engage then, when the forward wheels 
began bearing weight as the plane's nose came down. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet landed just as a thunderstorm with hail and 75 mph gusts  
reached the airport. Investigators said the pilot was warned twice 
about dangerous wind shears and received more notice than usual of 
bad conditions as he brought the plane in. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB said visibility was down to 1,600 feet -- less than a  
half-mile -- at the time of the accident. At that visibility, 
American Airlines pilots were not to land if crosswinds exceeded 10 
knots, or 11.5 mph, the airline official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the pilot could have had better information if the  
air traffic control tower had access to Doppler radar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only radar available for weather to the tower controller  
who was handling this flight was his surveillance radar -- the same 
radar he was using to control the airplanes,'' Black said. ``In 
other words, he did not have the advantage of the same sort of 
thing you and I can call up on our computer on the Internet and 
look at live Doppler radar.''

<HEADLINE>  Malaysia Touts Its New Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's government unveiled its  
massive new capital Friday, touting it as the salvation for the 
country's battered economy and a shining example of its grand 
vision for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Putrajaya, a garden metropolis about three-fourths the size of  
Manhattan, aims to eventually house 330,000 government workers. But 
it is far from complete now. Dozens of high-rise complexes are 
dwarfed by fields of red mud and surrounded by cranes and dump 
trucks at the site, 22 miles south of Kuala Lumpur. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials were exultant.  
</P>
<P>
	``The continued development of Putrajaya has helped the  
country's economy to recover,'' said Azizan Zainal Abidin, 
president of the project's developer, Putrajaya Holdings. 
``Putrajaya has helped the (construction) industry from collapsing 
altogether.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Azizan echoed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's call for  
Malaysia to spend its way out of recession, telling reporters on a 
state-sponsored tour that the situation could be corrected only by 
prodding Malaysia's economy, which contracted 6.7 percent last year 
after decades of galloping growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has allotted more than $526 million to build  
schools, health care facilities and public amenities in Putrajaya 
over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Azizan hedged on the city's total cost, saying he could not give  
a figure until all the plans had been made. Another Putrajaya 
official estimated the company has spent up to $1.3 billion already 
to develop the first of three phases. 
</P>
<P>
	The scale of the project is grandiose.  
</P>
<P>
	As a visitor is waved past the gate and driven along Protocol  
Road, futuristic street lamps become more elaborate near Mahathir's 
green-domed offices in the city center. 
</P>
<P>
	The brownstone edifice with green glass windows is the size of  
several city blocks and surrounded by artificial mangrove lakes. 
Mahathir and his staff are supposed to move in by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahathir's palatial residence, just five minutes' drive away, is  
also topped by a green dome and built at a cost of $4.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition leaders, including his former deputy Anwar Ibrahim,  
claim the actual cost for the complex was at least 10 times that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prime minister envisaged all this 15 years ago,'' Azizan  
said as he walked the gabled corridors of the pink-domed Putra 
mosque, which claims to have one of the world's tallest minarets at 
380 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The mosque for 15,000 worshippers will house a museum for rare  
copies of the Koran, Islam's holy book. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimate it will take another 15 years for Mahathir's  
vision to be fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're building this for our future generations,'' Azizan said.  
``It's our heritage. It must be of the character that the next 
generation will be proud of.''

generation will be proud of.''

<HEADLINE> Pooch Pulled From Storm Sewer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSINEE, Wis. (AP) -- A terrier that likes to sniff around  
drainage pipes fell into a storm sewer and wandered for four days, 
traveling about two miles in tunnels before children heard its 
barking. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanie Xiong, 4, and her brother, Dominic, 3, were dropping  
rocks into a manhole cover near their home when they heard the 
barks Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came up to me and told me there was a dog in the sewer  
and I thought, `No way,''' said Kou Xiong, their father. 
</P>
<P>
	Xiong removed the cover and rescued the dog. Later, the  
2-year-old West Highland White, named Reggie White after the former 
football star, was reunited with its owner, Pat Rondeau. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried all the way up to the humane society. I was so  
excited,'' Mrs. Rondeau said Friday. ``He didn't smell bad. He was 
really dirty but in very good shape. Apparently he had water. Who 
knows what he munched on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the dog vanished after somehow sliping through a  
drainage culvert and falling into the sewer near her home.

<HEADLINE> Gay Nominee Gets Recess Appointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defying Senate Republican leaders, President  
Clinton today announced he was installing gay San Francisco 
philanthropist James Hormel in a temporary position as ambassador 
to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton gave Hormel a ``recess appointment,'' taking advantage  
of a provision in the Constitution that allows a president to 
bypass the regular confirmation process during a congressional 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, who will become the first openly gay U.S. ambassador,  
will be able to serve until Jan. 3, 2001. A recess appointment is 
effective without Senate confirmation until the end of the next 
session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a clearly qualified ambassadorial candidate who  
enjoyed strong support from the foreign policy community,'' said 
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``This came down to a couple of 
senators who thought that he shouldn't be ambassador to Luxembourg 
becuase he's gay. And the president thinks that's wrong and 
discriminatory and that's why he moved ahead and did the recess 
appointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel was first nominated to the post by Clinton in October  
1997 and again this past January. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate conservatives have continued to oppose the  
nomination, even though supporters long have claimed that Hormel 
has more than enough votes if the nomination could ever come to a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, 66, an heir to the Hormel food fortune and a former dean  
at the University of Chicago Law School, has been a member of the 
U.S. delegation to the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva and 
had previously been confirmed by the Senate to serve on the U.S. 
delegation to the U.N. General Assembly session in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative senators forcefully opposed the ambassadorial  
nomination, complaining of Hormel's advocacy of gay-rights issues 
and his financial support for gay-rights causes. Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., refused to move the nomination, even 
though it had been approved in 1997 by the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a Lott spokesman, called the recess appointment  
``a slap in the face to Catholics everywhere,'' citing Lott's 
concern about Hormel's support for groups critical of the Catholic 
church and other organized religions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights  
Campaign, a gay-rights group, called the appointment a ``bold 
move'' by Clinton. ``The denial of a confirmation vote by the 
Senate leadership, a vote ... (Hormel) would have easily won, was 
nothing more than anti-gay discrimination,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment was made through a constitutional device that is  
available if a nomination is made while Congress is in recess. 
Congress returns from a 10-day Memorial Day recess on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced the nomination with a short statement that  
listed Hormel's qualifications but made no mention of the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used a similar, but not identical, process in early 1998  
to install Bill Lann Lee, a former NAACP attorney, as civil rights 
chief in the Justice Department after Senate conservatives blocked 
the nomination. Lee continues to serve in that capacity.

<HEADLINE> Sick Tarantula Gets Top-Notch Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CATONSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A CAT scan is set for Friday on a  
patient with a habit of showing her fangs and shooting barbed hairs 
from her rump. The patient, Goliath tarantula No. 79011, is 
suffering from an infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a robust, loose personality,'' said Sandy Barnett,  
senior herpetologist at The National Aquarium in Baltimore. ``I 
really hope we can help her out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giving a CAT scan to a spider is not a regular event, but this  
spider is special and worthy of saving say those who know her. 
</P>
<P>
	Although not rare, her value is in what she can teach doctors  
about the medical care of tarantulas in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the largest spider species in the world, No. 79011  
underwent a CAT scan Friday to check on a nasty infection oozing 
from her side. The prognosis wasn't good. Doctors are planning to 
perform a lifesaving operation next week to try to save the 
eight-legged creature. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 79011, weighing in at a hefty 2 1/2 ounces, is the size of a  
salad plate, has dark brown hair, and a turret of eyes atop a flat 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	She also has an abscess the size of a quarter that is causing  
her loose fluid. Instead of walking on the tips of her toes like a 
ballerina, she's down at the heel -- a sure sign of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``They use water pressure to keep their legs up,'' Ms. Barnett  
said. ``This one is walking a little flat-footed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An antibiotic ointment had no effect and another technique,  
punching a hole in her side to drain the infection, could kill her, 
said Dr. Brent Whitaker, the aquarium's director of animal health 
who is to perform the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Herring, a veterinary radiologist who donated his  
expertise, said the images Friday looked worse than when first 
taken last month. The abscess looks to be contained within the 
spider's body cavity, making it possible to perform surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	During the procedure, the same artificial skin used in human  
surgery will be used to create a covering over the abscess. The 
abscess can then be drained and more artificial skin can be used to 
seal the drain hole, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ian Walker, a veterinary intern at the aquarium who hopes to  
assist Whitaker, said his biggest fear is that he could break into 
the body cavity by mistake, causing her powder blue blood to leak 
out uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will probably lose the animal anyway if we don't try,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tarantula, which comes from South American rain forest, is  
worth all the effort, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't discriminate,'' he said. ``All of our animals get  
topnotch care.''

<HEADLINE> Embarassing Microsoft E-Mail Detailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of watching its executives  
confronted in court with hard-to-explain e-mails, Microsoft spent 
Friday listening to more recent embarrassing electronic messages. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its trial strategy in fighting antitrust allegations,  
Microsoft wants to show the judge that one of its Internet software 
rivals, Netscape Communications Corp., wasn't illegally crippled 
during its battle with Microsoft's Windows computer operating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department lawyer David Boies cited an e-mail  
exchange within Microsoft earlier this year -- months after its 
antitrust trial began -- that suggested even some Microsoft 
employees don't believe that Netscape remains a robust competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``What data can we find right away that shows Netscape browser  
share is still healthy?'' spokesman Greg Shaw wrote to two other 
Microsoft employees earlier this year. ``It would help if you could 
send me some reports showing their market share healthy and 
holding. This is for press purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw got this response from Robert Bennett, a Windows product  
manager: 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the analysts have pretty much come to the same  
conclusion, which is that (Netscape) share is declining and 
(Microsoft's) is gaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be proactively telling people that (Netscape)  
share is doing well -- we are winning because we have better 
technology -- if we show them maintaining/gaining share then we 
contradict that point,'' Bennett wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson laughed as Boies  
read the e-mails in court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Franklin Fisher volunteered from the witness stand  
that, ``This document speaks for itself rather louder than most.'' 
Fisher testified all week for the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had other problems with e-mail in the courtroom  
Thursday, when a company lawyer, Michael Lacovara, sought to 
portray the popular upstart Linux operating system as a potential 
threat to the dominance of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara introduced e-mail that Microsoft executive David Cole  
wrote last week, titled ``Linux is beating Windows.'' He included 
sales figures showing that at two West Coast electronics chains, 
Linux is outselling Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies indicated he was dubious because the e-mail was written so  
recently, and the judge seemed to agree. Jackson called the 
document a ``self-serving, out-of-court declaration'' but allowed 
Lacovara to enter it as evidence in the case.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Falls to 4.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate dipped back  
down to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in May even though the growth 
of payroll jobs was the smallest in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment among blacks fell to the lowest level on record  
while the jobless rates of teen-agers and adult women hit 30-year 
lows as the strong U.S. economy continued to boost all economic 
groups, the Labor Department said in today's report. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the drop in unemployment, the total number of payroll  
jobs rose by just 11,000 in May, a sharp slowdown from the 343,000 
jobs created in April and the weakest showing since an outright 
decline in January 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, which is hoping a healthy economy will  
convince voters to keep a Democrat in the White House next year, 
insisted that the slowdown in job creation merely depicted an 
economy shifting from red-hot growth to a more sustainable pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a phase now ... from sizzle to simmer, but it's  
still hot. It's still a good economy,'' Labor Secretary Alexis 
Herman told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, which had grown increasingly jittery over  
worries that too-rapid growth would prompt the Federal Reserve to 
boost interest rates, took heart from today's report. The Dow Jones 
industrial average was up 60 points at midday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts said the small gain in payroll jobs may reflect  
that employers are having trouble finding qualified people in the 
current tight labor market. Others noted that while May's increase 
in jobs was tiny, the April figure had been revised up sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists remained split on whether recent reports make  
it more or less likely that the central bank will start raising 
interest rates to slow the economy and keep inflation under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Kasriel, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago,  
said he was still looking for a rate increase at the Fed's next 
meeting on June 29-30 because the drop in the unemployment rate, 
along with other reports showing strong consumer demand, are making 
Fed policy-makers uneasy about rising inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that unemployment fell is the important message here  
along with the bump up in average hourly earnings,'' Kasriel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report showed that average hourly earnings, a closely  
watched indicator for inflation, rose by 3.6 percent in May, 
compared to a year ago, a slight uptick from the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.2 percent jobless rate in May matched the March level, a  
29-year low. Unemployment last touched 4.2 percent in February 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The current economic expansion, the longest in peacetime  
history, has given the country a low overall unemployment rate and 
has also aided minority groups, who traditionally lag behind in 
economic gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said today that the unemployment rate for blacks  
fell to a record low of 7.5 percent in May, down from 7.7 percent 
the previous month. This was the lowest unemployment level for 
blacks since the government began tracking this statistic in 1972 
although the rate was still above the 3.7 percent unemployment rate 
for whites. The jobless rate for teen-agers dipped to 12.6 percent 
while the rate for adult women fell to 3.6 percent, both 30-year 
lows. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall gain of 11,000 payroll jobs reflected the fact that  
job growth in service industries moderated substantially last 
month, increasing by only 71,000, well below the average monthly 
gain of 125,000 over the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	While business services added 42,000 jobs last month, reflecting  
strong gains in computer services, growth in engineering and 
management services moderated significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of 45,000 jobs in manufacturing reflected widespread  
cuts in a number of industries including industrial machinery, 
apparel and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, fell by  
7,000 in May. Construction, which had been enjoying huge large 
gains through the mild winter, suffered a setback of 40,000 lost 
jobs in May.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Said Planning Reorganization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.'s stock price jumped more  
than 3 percent Friday after a report that the consumer products 
maker plans to cut thousands of jobs and close plants at a cost of 
up to $3 billion to become more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they weren't surprised by what would be the  
company's second major reorganization in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been making changes over the last year with their new  
strategy,'' said Douglas Christopher, of Crowell, Weedon &AMP; Co. 
``The company's never been one to just sit around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have praised P&AMP;G for its recent introductions of  
revised or new products, such as last year's rollout of Febreze -- a 
product designed to remove odors from clothing and household 
fabrics -- and the company's continued effort to sell brands for 
which it doesn't anticipate business growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Friday that P&AMP;G will announce the  
changes when its executives meet with investors and analysts 
Wednesday in New York to detail what P&AMP;G calls Organization 2005. 
The Times attributed its report to analysts and institutional 
investors who have already met with management. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G spokesman Simon Denegri declined to comment on the story.  
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Procter &AMP; Gamble was  
up $3.12 1/2 a share to $96.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected announcement would be the first major overhaul  
since Durk Jager took over as chief executive Jan. 1 after 29 years 
with the company, which makes Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and 
Pampers diapers among other products. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the new round of cuts are expected to take place outside  
the United States, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati-based consumer products company told shareholders  
in September that it planned corporate structural changes including 
forming business units based on products instead of regions, 
improving marketing and streamlining its staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said then that it believes the changes are necessary  
to bring new products to the market more quickly, and if the 
company is to meet its stated goal of improving profits and 
doubling its worldwide sales within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G said in September that the reorganization creates seven  
global business units based on product lines instead of four units 
based on geographical regions. It also centralizes business 
services such as accounting and payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The global business units are to be responsible for their  
profits, design, research and development and personnel. Eight 
market development organizations will develop local marketing 
strategies, new distribution channels and improved retail-customer 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest reorganization and the prior one implemented in 1993  
are intended to overhaul cumbersome layers of management that 
critics said made P&AMP;G bureaucratic and unable to quickly respond to 
market changes and new products from competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1993 reorganization, designed to reduce expenses to 12  
percent of sales, closed 30 plants and eliminated 13,000 positions 
throughout the world. Most of the job cuts came from early 
retirements, attrition and voluntary separation packages.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Shaken Baby Dies in Neb. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- A 3-year-old girl with severe brain injuries,  
allegedly caused by child abuse, died this week after her parents 
gave up a long legal battle with the state and agreed to let her be 
taken off life support. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabatha Renshaw, who became known as Baby Tabatha, suffered her  
injuries in January 1996, when she was 25 days old. 
</P>
<P>
	Her parents, Ronda Renshaw and Ronald Davis, say she slipped  
into a coma because of a viral infection, but authorities said the 
child had been violently shaken. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents fought for three years to maintain custody and keep  
the girl on life support. Finally, last week, they agreed to let 
her die. Physicians said that Tabatha had no chance of recovering 
and that life support would only prolong her dying. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Renshaw told authorities she had taken a nap with the child  
and found Tabatha had stopped breathing when she woke up. The 
father said he was in a different room at the time. Both told 
police they did not know how the baby had been harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have not filed criminal charges against the parents.  
Douglas County Attorney Jim Jansen said prosecutors were waiting to 
examine autopsy results and other evidence in hopes of pinpointing 
which parent shook the child. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for agreeing last week to let Tabatha be taken off  
life support, the parents were allowed to be present for her final 
moments Wednesday night, said Regina Makaitis, the court-appointed 
special prosecutor for the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bianchi, the attorney representing Ms. Renshaw, said his  
client is grieving for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that it's all hit her,'' Bianchi said. ``It's  
difficult for everyone involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar case in Pennsylvania, the parents of a severely  
brain-damaged 17-month-old boy are trying to keep that child alive. 
The child's brain injuries were the result of being shaken. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, the child's father has been charged with attempted  
murder. Prosecutors have said that if the boy dies, they are likely 
to upgrade the charge to murder.

<HEADLINE> NFL Suspends Leon Lett Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys will start the 1999  
season without their best defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
	How long Pro Bowl defensive tackle Leon Lett remains on the  
sideline will depend on him -- and NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL informed the team Friday it was suspending Lett  
indefinitely for a third violation of the league's substance-abuse 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	League spokesman Joe Browne refused to discuss details of Lett's  
case other than to say the lineman can reapply for admission to the 
NFL in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The length of the suspension will be determined by Tagliabue,  
based on evaluations of Lett's progress by officials in the 
league's substance-abuse program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys were notified of the suspension on Friday. Spokesman  
Rich Dalrymple released a statement declining comment on behalf of 
the team ``because of the confidential nature of the NFL's 
substance testing policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports that Lett might be facing another league suspension have  
been circulating for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett, 30, has been enrolled in the NFL's substance-abuse program  
since 1995. He was suspended four games in 1995, for the last three 
games of 1996 and the first 13 of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 season was his first complete one since 1994 and, as in  
that season, he made the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett's agent, Jim Steiner, could not be reached Friday night. A  
message left at his office was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6, 300-pound Lett went from seventh-round draft pick  
from Emporia State in 1991 to Pro Bowl starter by 1994. Nicknamed 
``The Big Cat,'' Lett used size, speed and strength to become a 
standout in the middle of a solid defensive line, both as a 
run-stopper and pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 51 tackles, four sacks, 20 quarterback pressures and a  
team-high seven tackles for losses last season. His presence was 
considered a big reason the Cowboys' run defense improved from 24th 
in 1997 to 12th in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas was already facing the prospect of starting the season  
without its other defensive star, cornerback Deion Sanders, who has 
been nursing an ailing toe since late last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders had surgery on the toe this spring, but the timing of  
his return remains uncertain.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Seeks First French Open Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Pressure? What pressure? For Steffi Graf,  
Saturday's French Open women's final is just another tennis match. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she is playing for a Grand Slam title for the first  
time in almost three years, Graf has won this clay-court 
championship five times before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I obviously feel that I don't have to prove anything,'' Graf  
said. ``I don't have the feeling that I have to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the case for her 18-year-old and No. 1-ranked  
opponent, Martina Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	She is determined to win at Roland Garros and become only the  
ninth woman -- and the first since Graf -- to triumph at each Grand 
Slam singles stop. 
</P>
<P>
	It should be a tight final, a clash of generations if not of  
styles. Both Graf and Hingis are big hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	But, while Hingis doesn't have any clear weaknesses, Graf -- in  
her first Grand Slam final since the 1996 U.S. Open -- will look to 
take advantage of her greater athletic ability and speed, and 
attack the Swiss player's unexceptional serve. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis will be wary of Graf's renowned forehand. But the  
29-year-old German's tendency to run around her backhand could 
leave her out of position -- and exposed to Hingis' accurate ground 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, who has won seven Grand Slam doubles titles, is happier  
at the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steffi has a powerful baseline game,'' Hingis said. And in  
addition to Graf's forehand, ``her slice backhand is very deep and 
low. You can't do much out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, holder of 21 Grand Slam titles, is 6-2 against Hingis  
lifetime, but Hingis won their only previous match on clay -- in the 
1996 Italian Open -- and their most recent meeting -- this year at 
the Pan Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	After terrible luck with injuries, Graf is storming back.  
</P>
<P>
	A win against Hingis would leave her one shy of Chris Evert's  
record of seven French Open singles titles. She already has equaled 
Evert's record of nine finals appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf will move to No. 3 in the rankings next week, her best  
placing for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	And if she beats Hingis, Graf would be the first woman in open  
history to defeat the top three players in the same event, already 
eliminating second-seeded Lindsay Davenport and No. 3 Monica Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, looking to add to her fifth Grand Slam win in Australia  
this year, has had a much easier route to the final, facing only 
one seeded player, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she has been in outstanding form here, not dropping a set  
so far, and is eager to overcome the disappointment of her surprise 
French Open final defeat two years ago to Iva Majoli. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis admits that she underestimated Majoli in that match.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have learned to play smarter now,'' she said. ``The last two  
or three years I felt worse. Now I am feeling better. That is the 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis added that she is happier facing Graf than Seles, and  
hopes that the German will have stage fright on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``With her absence in the last two years I hope she will be a  
little bit nervous,'' Hingis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's reply? ``I won't.''

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Sign Top Pick for $3.65M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays didn't want  
to spend all summer negotiating with Josh Hamilton. They offered 
him a $3.65 million signing bonus and the No. 1 pick accepted 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing bonus is the largest ever given to drafted amateur  
player who signed with the team that selected him. 
</P>
<P>
	``With those parameters, it went very quickly,'' Devil Rays  
general manager Chuck LaMar said after the North Carolina high 
school outfielder agreed to a minor league contract with a bonus 
payable over the next 19 months. Because some of the money is 
deferred with interest, Hamilton will receive a total of $3.96 
million in payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing came just two days after Tampa Bay selected Hamilton  
with the first overall pick, and two days before the 6-foot-4, 
210-pound slugger graduates from Athens Drive High in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very unique situation that the first player in the  
entire country signs this quickly,'' said LaMar, who declined to 
discuss specifics about the contract except to volunteer that the 
big signing bonus was a factor in the speedy resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The general manager also credited scout Mark McKnight with  
developing a good relationship with Hamilton and his parents in the 
months leading up to the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a trust that was built up ... I think the family was  
very comfortable with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. ... Sometimes in 
negotiations with a high profile player like this, what's lacking 
is that trust,'' LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to cut through, get to the chase and say, `let's  
not take three months of this player's development and his career 
away. He wants to go play. We want him to go play. We want to treat 
like the first player in the country taken,' and we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who took batting practice with the team before Friday  
night's game against the Florida Marlins, batted .529 with 13 
homers and 35 RBIs in 25 games as a high school senior. He will 
begin his pro career with Princeton of the Appalachian League on 
June 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The top draft pick was accompanied to town by his mother and  
father, grandmother, brother and agent Casey Close, who along with 
the parents handled negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really thought about the money. I just like to play  
ball and have fun,'' Hamilton said. ``It's something I've been 
doing all my life. The money issue never came up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is the first high school player to be taken with the  
first pick since Seattle selected Alex Rodriguez in 1993. Despite 
going 18-3 as a pitcher the last two seasons, Tampa Bay plans to 
develop him as a right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays wanted him to get started as soon as possible,  
but emphasized there is no timetable for him developing into a 
major leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just turned 18, so there's really no rush,'' Close said,  
adding that even if Hamilton spends four seasons in the minors 
before being promoted to the majors he'd still be a 21-year-old 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously with a player of his ability, you hope that it is  
not too long,'' Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild said. ``But 
you've got to give him time to develop the way he should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three players selected in the 1996 amateur draft got larger  
bonuses after they were declared free agents on technicalities: 
Matt White got $10.2 million from the Devils Rays, Travis Lee 
received $10 million from the Arizona Diamondbacks and John 
Patterson got $6,075,000 from the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, J.D. Drew was guaranteed $7 million when he signed  
with St. Louis after the Cardinals drafted him last year, but that 
was part of a four-year major league contract that included a $3 
million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest deal ever for a player with no previous North  
American professional experience was the $10.8 million, four-year 
contract Hideki Irabu signed with the New York Yankees in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Capital Planners OK WWII Monument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A controversial World War II monument to be  
built on the green Mall between the Lincoln Memorial and the 
Washington Monument won 9-2 approval Thursday from the National 
Capital Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came after a series of witnesses denounced the plan as  
ugly and an obstacle to one of Washington's best known views. The 
witness list showed 26 against the plan and six supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most beautiful city in the world and this is the  
ugliest damn thing I've ever seen,'' Rundy Hamblen, who served as a 
nurse during the invasion of France, told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hamblen, 77, is a trauma nurse at D.C. General Hospital. In  
an interview after the vote, she said Washington doesn't need any 
more columns and slabs of marble -- she favors a single jet of 
water, half the height of the Washington Monument. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the plan said it would enhance the Mall.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rainbow Pool at the opposite end of the Reflecting Pool from  
the Lincoln Memorial would be rebuilt, with a memorial plaza around 
it. Ceremonial steps 170 feet wide, big enough to serve as an 
amphitheater for ceremonies, would lead into the plaza from 17th 
Street. Two memorial arches, commemorating the victories in the 
Atlantic and the Pacific, would be placed at the north and south 
entrances. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the vote Thursday was technically a preliminary  
approval of the site and design, no major changes seemed likely. 
The commission asked for more details on the landscaping and 
plaques, sculpture and inscriptions that will appear on the 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
	Final approval is needed from Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,  
the city's Fine Arts Commission and from the planning commission 
itself. No timetable has been set.

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Rampage Leaves Four Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The first blast came suddenly, ripping through  
a supermarket clerk tending to shopping carts just inside the front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the muscular man with a shaved head began chasing his  
panicking victims. One by one, workers were shot at close range as 
they fled for their lives, their blood smearing the polished aisles 
of the Albertsons store. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the carnage ended early Thursday, four employees  
were dead and another was critically wounded. After a brief 
standoff with police outside the store, the gunman dressed in 
camouflage fatigues surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took the path of least resistance, shooting at everybody he  
saw,'' Las Vegas Sheriff Jerry Keller said. ``He roamed throughout 
the store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities later joined friends and family in trying to figure  
out why Zane Floyd, a 23-year-old former Marine who was doted on by 
his parents, had gone on the shooting spree in a market that served 
the neighborhood where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy would remind you of the guy next door,'' said Laura  
Sellers, who owns a security company from which Floyd recently was 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was booked Thursday for investigation of four counts of  
murder and one of attempted murder. Identities of the victims were 
not available early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they know of no link between the store workers and  
Floyd, other than that he lived for years with his parents in a 
house two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who knew Floyd said he was honorably discharged from the  
Marines last summer, liked to spend time with friends from a bar 
where he worked once a week as a bouncer. He spent part of Memorial 
Day weekend joking with them at a swim party and barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Marquez, who worked with Floyd at Sneakers bar and  
restaurant, described Floyd as ``just a regular guy who likes to 
party and hang out like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good guy. I just can't understand it,'' Marquez said.  
</P>
<P>
	According to Sellers, Floyd appeared agitated and ``a little bit  
more sarcastic'' on Wednesday night, when he arrived at Affirmative 
Security to pick up a final paycheck. He'd been fired May 14 from 
his $7-an-hour job with the company after he began missing shifts 
and acting differently, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Sellers said: ``We're not looking at a bad boy or someone  
who would go insane at all. In all honesty, he didn't have any real 
quirks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police say that a few hours after picking up his check, Floyd  
walked into the market and began firing away with a pump-action 
shotgun. He was apprehended only after police persuaded him not to 
take his own life. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the massacre, Floyd's mother cried in a bedroom as  
friends arrived to console her. His father opened the door to let 
people in, but neither was talking. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Cathy Downey went inside to hug Mike and Valerie Floyd.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were so proud of him because he was in the Marines and  
all they talked about was when he was coming home on leave,'' 
Downey said. ``He was their pride and joy.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Release Carlos Baerga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Former major leaguer Carlos Baerga, who has  
been trying to earn a promotion from the Cincinnati Reds' farm 
system, was released by the Reds on Friday so he could sign a 
minor-league contract with the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, 30, had been playing with the Reds' Triple-A  
Indianapolis team. The Reds said he asked for his release so that 
he could join San Diego's Triple-A club. 
</P>
<P>
	The infielder batted .290 in 52 games at Indianapolis, with  
three home runs and 27 runs batted in. He agreed to a minor league 
deal during spring training that allowed him to become a free agent 
if another team wants him for its major league roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds had considered bringing him up, but bypassed him to  
promote other players and acknowledged that they could lose Baerga 
as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sorry that we were not able to provide Carlos an  
opportunity at the major league level, but we believe we kept the 
best 25-man roster to win now and long-term,'' Reds general manager 
Jim Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga made the American League All-Star team in 1992, 1993 and  
1995 while with the Cleveland Indians. Cleveland traded him in July 
1996 to the New York Mets. He played for the Mets through last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals signed Baerga as a free agent in  
January, then released him during spring training. The Reds signed 
him on March 23 to his Triple-A contract with Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> Ballet Theater Dances `Anastasia' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Arts and Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Anastasia,'' a three-act ballet about the  
murdered Russian royal family and the woman who claimed to be the 
daughter who survived the communist firing squad, is impressively 
danced for the first time by American Ballet Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Vivana Durante, the petite British Royal Ballet ballerina who is  
a guest with ABT at the Metropolitan Opera House this season, 
danced a delicate, affecting Anastasia, simultaneously dreamy in 
demeanor and precise in steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike 19th century full-evening ballets like ``The Sleeping  
Beauty,'' in which much of the dance roles are for villagers and 
court entertainers, the dancing in ``Anastasia,'' while not 
flamboyant, is done by the never-resting principals. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth MacMillan choreographed ``Anastasia'' for the Royal  
Ballet in 1971 and dedicated it to the company's founder, Ninette 
de Valois. The performance Monday was staged, from ballet notation, 
by Monica Parker, who works mainly on MacMillan ballets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anastasia'' was last danced here in 1972 by the British Royal  
Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	Act 1 shows the royal family enjoying a day on the royal yacht  
in 1914. Victor Barbee and Christine Dunham danced the tall, 
elegant czar and czarina, tenderly loving to each other and their 
children. Ilone McHugh, Gillian Murphy and Oksana Konobeyeva 
portrayed the three older daughters, youthful and lovely in 
lace-edged white dresses, as they danced together and with sailors. 
Durante, smaller than the three, often danced alone. Chase Finlay 
danced their small brother and Ethan Brown danced Rasputin, the 
czarina's sinister confidant. 
</P>
<P>
	The happy atmosphere of Act 1 takes on a poignancy because of  
the audience's foreknowledge of the blood bath to come. Act 2 
depicts Anastasia's 1917 coming-out ball, with women wearing 
fan-shape headdresses and some traditionally Russian group dance 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	The last act is the most dramatic. The Anastasia ballerina must  
also be an actress. Wearing a gray dress and found on a hospital 
bed, she dances in many brief scenes of memory or hallucination -- 
with nurses, with distant relatives of the czar who reject her. 
There are quickly cut scenes of five people saving her on a cart, 
of a husband and baby who both die, of soldiers marching in, guns 
drawn. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ermanno Florio conducting, acts 1 and 2 are danced to  
Tchaikovsky, while the final act is set to music by Bohuslav 
Martinu. It ends with the main people in Anastasia's life entering 
while her bed moves around the stage in a circle.
