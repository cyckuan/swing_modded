   LOS ANGELES -- Patrick Crawford, a 7-year-old boy who was
severely injured in a Christmas tree Thursday in Val Verde, Calif.,
died Sunday at the Grossman Burn Center at Sherman Oaks Hospital in
suburban Sherman Oaks, Calif. His 17-year-old half-brother, Shawn
Williams, had died Saturday after surgery at the same facility.
</P>
<P>
   The boys were burned in a fire that broke out shortly after 8
a.m. Dec. 31 in the Santa Clarita Valley north of the Los Angeles
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman Burn Center spokesman Larry Weinberg said Patrick went
into respiratory failure at 5:23 a.m. Sunday and was pronounced
dead at 6:25 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in extremely critical condition with third-degree burns
over 65 percent of body and significant smoke-inhalation damage to
his lungs,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the boy's small size and severe injuries, his chances of
survival had been slight, Weinberg said. While young children heal
faster than adults, he said, the loss of fluid is more devastating
to a child's body. Burns and smoke damage to Patrick's lungs
eventually overwhelmed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the pediatricians -- part of the team that treated him
-- said that, given the extent of his burns and extent of
smoke-inhalation damage, the mortality rate for a child in his
condition would probably be about 90 percent,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The older half-brother's friend, Patricia Lynn Martin, 20, and
the boys' aunt, Dawn Carter, 45, were also injured in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has declared that
the fire's origins are suspicious, and arson investigators were
assigned to the case. Sgt. David Halm said Sunday that the
investigation is continuing.

KRAFT MUST MULL CARROLL'S FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Almost to a man the Patriots said the right
thing Sunday. They talked about heart and soul and true grit and
battling back and never saying die and overcoming adversity and
coming back next year with new resolve.
</P>
<P>
   They said Pete Carroll was one of them. It was all for one and
one for all and everybody taking the blame for a defeat that sent
them on vacation far sooner than they ever thought they'd be this
year.
</P>
<P>
   They said it to the media and more importantly they said it
before the media entered the locker room during a moment of what
owner Bob Kraft later called ``bonding.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounded great. It was all baloney.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft was so impressed by this that a minute later he said he
did not know yet if Carroll would be back and he would seek a
recommendation from vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier
on what to do before he made a decision. He said this about a man
who has three years left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few of the same players who were so unified behind
Carroll in the wake of a 25-10 AFC wild-card playoff loss to the
Jacksonville Jaguars at Alltel Stadium (would that it were Tell All
Stadium because maybe we'd know more Monday about what tomorrow
holds) were the same ones who have been talking for weeks now about
growing doubts that Carroll can lead them to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, only hours before the game, one of them told a
media member, ``There's not many guys left who have much respect
for Pete and the ones that still do are losing it more and more
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The player in question was not a rabble rouser. He was someone
with eyes in his head and, more importantly, fear in his heart.
Fear of the future. Fear of just what his teammates spoke of Sunday
after they were knocked out of the playoffs with too many backup
players pressed into the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was a microcosm of our season,'' said safety Willie
Clay in a quiet voice. ``It was a tough struggle. This is the way
the season has been for us. We put ourselves in adverse situations
and then have to make too many plays to get back. We didn't quite
make it. We battled but we didn't quite make it. It's been a very
tough season. A very long season.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the same Clay who was one minute ranting at Lawyer
Milloy and the next Chris Slade about being out of position in
various defenses, the same Clay who at one point picked up a chalk
board and drew a formation for Slade to show him where he should
have been on an end zone coverage, the same Clay whom secondary
coach Ron Lynn recently called ``a coach on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay has forgotten more about the defenses the Patriots play
than anyone else on the team remembers, but why does he so often
have to call timeout because his teammates are in the wrong
formation?
</P>
<P>
   Why does his team repeatedly waste timeouts early (two in the
first quarter and two more in the third Sunday) because the wrong
players are on the field or not enough of them are or too many of
them are or the ones who are are standing in the wrong formation
for the play that's being called?
</P>
<P>
   Why, after two years and two playoff appearances, did the same
logistical problems surface Sunday that have cropped up time and
time and time again?
</P>
<P>
   Why do they fall behind two touchdowns to a team as injured as
they are?
</P>
<P>
   Why do they open the game with a fumbled kickoff and a penalty
and a series that produces nothing, as has happened time and time
and time again?
</P>
<P>
   Why oh why?
</P>
<P>
   Across the room from Clay, a battered Willie McGinest, his balky
groin again having proved a traitor to him, sat in near exhaustion
and blamed no one and everyone for the whys and wherefores of
Sunday's loss. There were no angry words from him, as there had
been a year ago after a 7-6 playoff defeat in Pittsburgh that so
infuriated him he lambasted Carroll in full view of his teammates
and no one said a word in protest.
</P>
<P>
   This time, McGinest was spent, mentally and physically. Proud to
be a Patriot, proud to have tried to do all he could on one leg,
but sad to see another season end far short of its goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team finds a way to overcome things,'' McGinest said.
``All these decisions as far as coaches and players is not my
decision. I don't know (if Carroll will be back). I think he did a
good job. He led us in the direction we needed to go. We got close
but we didn't finish.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the alarming truth of things. Pete Carroll has led
them close for two years but he also led them into one hole after
another. Whether injured or healthy, the Patriots too often have
had to scramble to survive.
</P>
<P>
   That they are willing to work that hard is clear. That was clear
last season and this season and Sunday. But what is just as clear
is that they cannot reach the goal Kraft has set for them _ the
Super Bowl _ if they continue to dig holes for themselves because
for every time they rise out of one at least as many times they
slip back, as they did Sunday when they had to settle for a field
goal after being first-and-10 at the Jaguar 13.
</P>
<P>
   A touchdown would have given them two straight second-half
scores and the lead and erased a miserably played and
embarrassingly disorganized first half when there were arguments on
the sideline, arguments on the field, and an offense that managed
but one first down to the Jaguars' 12.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't get the touchdown. They fell short as they had
fallen just short last year in Pittsburgh and just short this
season when they barely made the playoffs. Just short. That should
be their epitaph.
</P>
<P>
   So what is Kraft to do?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he'll probably do nothing because that's the easy
choice. He'll probably do nothing because he heard his players say
the right things Sunday and he heard the coach give a stump speech
about how ``what happened in the second half was an explosion on
the sidelines and in the locker room of will and heart and guys
coming through ... ''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounded good. It was all baloney, unless a 15-point loss
can be defined as coming through.
</P>
<P>
   What the Patriots did Sunday is what they are paid to do. They
tried hard in a difficult circumstance. That is admirable. It is
also the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   There are no medals for trying in life. There's no jewelry for
it either, and somebody needs to remember that because the Patriots
are a team adrift, a team trying but coming up short.
</P>
<P>
   The tide is not yet high and so the seas are not yet running out
on them, but Kraft need only think back to another time when he and
his family sat in Section 225 instead of the owner's box and
watched a good guy named Ron Erhardt coach the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Erhardt took over a team Chuck Fairbanks had just abandoned the
same way Bill Parcells abandoned this team. They had been
considered one of the most talented teams in the NFL yet had won
nothing much to speak of when Fairbanks left abruptly and Erhardt
replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   Erhardt went 9-7 and just missed the playoffs in 1979, and
doubts began to surface about his leadership. He went 10-6 and just
missed the playoffs in 1980, and the doubts grew. But a decision
was made that you couldn't replace a guy who was 19-13 in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the last of the Erhardt Era, the New England
Patriots went 2-14 with the best offense in football. It was five
years before they made the playoffs again in a non-strike season.
</P>
<P>
   If that 19-13 number sounds familiar, it is the record Pete
Carroll has today. Monday morning, when Bob Kraft thinks about all
the words he heard Sunday, he should think back to what he was
hearing in 1979, when he was just a fan and another coach whose
team kept drifting backwards was 19-13.
</P>
<P>
   He should think about it a lot.
</P>

PATRIOTS FINISH ON A DOWN NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Ty Law, the Pro Bowler who was beaten on
the back-breaking touchdown pass to Jimmy Smith in the fourth
quarter, stood up before the team in the locker room afterward and
said, ``This was my fault. I take full responsibility for the
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Armstrong and injured quarterback Drew Bledsoe also gave
speeches to the beaten and stinging Patriots following a 25-10 loss
to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Sunday's AFC wild-card playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   The season over after the Patriots couldn't come back all the
way from a horrid first-half performance by the offense, Armstrong
and Bledsoe began looking ahead to next year _ a year in which the
team might have to make another transition depending on whether
coach Pete Carroll is fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' said center Dave Wohlabaugh of the speeches.
``I think we needed those guys to do that. I think we can build off
of this and come into next year with a good, positive attitude. I
hope Pete's a part of that, because with everything that happened
and with all of the injuries, he deserves another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the reason the Patriots didn't win Sunday was because
they didn't have a healthy Bledsoe or a healthy Terry Glenn for him
to throw to.
</P>
<P>
   Backup QB Scott Zolak (21 for 44, 190 yards, one interception),
though he led a second-half resurgence, went 5 for 16 for 39 yards
in the first half. At one point he was 3 for 12 (as was
Jacksonville's Mark Brunell) and was missing his targets badly,
once throwing wide of Sedrick Shaw, who was standing right in front
of him.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots left the field at halftime trailing by only
12-0 in a game they could have been out of from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first half wasn't just frustrating, it was ugly,'' said
wide receiver Shawn Jefferson. ``We couldn't do anything right out
there. We came out in the second half and put some things together,
but we couldn't get it done when he had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was referring to a drive that began in the third
quarter and lasted into the fourth, with New England trailing,
12-7. Zolak threw to Tony Simmons for gains of 13 and 16 yards and
to Robert Edwards (28 yards rushing) in the flat for 15. The
Patriots got it as close as the 9, one Zolak pass was off the mark
and another was dropped, and New England settled for Adam
Vinatieri's 27-yard field goal to make it 12-10.
</P>
<P>
   The big play was Lovett Purnell's drop on third and 6. Had he
caught the ball, the Patriots likely would have had a first down,
and it might have even gone for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to give the Jaguars all the incentive they needed
for their resurgence, even with Brunell bothered by an ankle sprain
that has hampered him for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say that was the turning point, but if we get
it there, the momentum gets going, it shuts up their crowd, and you
never know what could happen,'' said Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars then drove 70 yards in six plays. Brunell hit on a
22-yard pass play to Pete Mitchell, and three plays later, from the
New England 37, Brunell hit a diving Smith in the end zone, with
Law doing everything humanly possible to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed momentum for us,'' said Brunell. ``It was a simple
hand signal to Jimmy to give him the `go' route. He ran a nice
route and I was able to put the ball out there for him. It was just
a check at the line of scrimmage. That was a big play. They were
moving the ball and putting some points up, and we knew we had to
answer it. Any time we get a press on Jimmy, we feel we have the
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said he didn't think the ball was going to go as far as it
did. ``I think the wind took it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Law spoke to his teammates, they soothed him by telling him
it wasn't his fault. And perhaps in the overall scheme of things,
it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, playing without Ted Johnson and Todd Collins,
couldn't contain Fred Taylor, the exciting rookie running back who
wound up with 162 yards on 33 carries. The Jaguars had heard talk
last week that the Patriots thought Jacksonville was more of a
finesse team than a hard-nosed unit. The Jaguars seemed inspired by
that. ``Who's smash-mouth and who's soft?'' said Taylor afterward.
``We put that rumor to sleep,'' added offensive tackle Tony
Boselli. ``We definitely weren't a finesse team today.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Law's miscue, Jacksonville defensive end Joel
Smeenge beat Zefross Moss one-on-one, made a great rush, and hit
Zolak in the chest, causing him to fumble. It was fallen on by end
Tony Brackens, and the Jaguars were back in business at the Patriot
25. From there, Mike Hollis made a 34-yard field goal, basically
drop-kicking it as holder Bryan Barker never really got the ball
down.
</P>
<P>
   The game had started inauspiciously for the Patriots. On the
opening kickoff, Derrick Cullors fumbled when struck hard by former
Boston College linebacker Tom McManus. The Patriots recovered but
had to punt, and Jacksonville drove to a 35-yard field goal to go
ahead, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars got another field goal later in the quarter after
the Patriots stopped Jacksonville at the New England 6.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jaguars added their first touchdown in the second
quarter, going 68 yards on nine plays.
</P>
<P>
   The big play was a 21-yard run by Taylor, who seemed to be
stopped in the backfield and then reversed direction, getting it
down to the Patriots' 34. The drive culminated in Taylor's 13-yard
run, making it 12-0.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin went for the 2-point conversion, and
Taylor was stuffed in the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Despite adjustments, halftime speeches, and looks in the mirror,
the Patriots simply were outplayed.

</HEADLINE>
 BOWL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ After all the talk abut the Bowl Championship
Series, about computer rankings, and polls, the champion of the
1998 college football season finally will be crowned Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be done on the field, between teams who are the best
college football has to offer this season.
</P>
<P>
   In matching No. 1 Tennessee (12-0) vs. No. 2 Florida State
(11-1), the Fiesta Bowl has a game worthy of its hype.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, teams like Ohio State (11-1) can make claims, as they did
after Friday night's 24-14 Sugar Bowl victory over Texas A&AMP;M. There
are Rose Bowl winner Wisconsin and Holiday Bowl winner Arizona,
each with a loss. There's even Tulane, other than Tennessee the
only unbeaten Division 1-A team remaining. All could be considered,
but no one can really quibble with the credentials of either the
Volunteers or Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has earned its shot at its first national championship
since 1951. If the Vols win _ and they are 5 1/2-point underdogs _
they will have beaten eight bowl teams, including three BCS teams _
Syracuse, Florida, and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   They have shown they can win various ways, whether on a
last-second touchdown pass, as quarterback Tee Martin threw in
beating Syracuse in the opener, or with a modicum of luck, as they
had in their last-minute win over Arkansas, aided by a crucial
Razorbacks fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Vols are contending with doubters who believe that
this will be another Tennessee disappointment, another team that
will lose the ultimate game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably a lot of people out there who don't think we
belong in this game,'' said Tennessee wide receiver Peerless Price.
``We've been a team that's been so close for so long. With how hard
we've worked and everything we've overcome, I really can't see
anybody being more deserving to be here than us.''
</P>
<P>
   Price may have a point. The Vols have leaped a steady succession
of hurdles this season.
</P>
<P>
   They switched from four-year starter Peyton Manning to Martin at
quarterback without a hitch; they absorbed the season-ending injury
of their best running back, Jamal Lewis; they adjusted to losing
three starters in their secondary.
</P>
<P>
   This is a much different Tennessee team than the one that lost
to Florida for the fifth straight time last season, than the squad
that was embarrassed and overmatched against Nebraska in the Orange
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there were certain things that had to happen, certain
things that we had to make happen,'' said Tennessee's Phil Fulmer,
who is finally starting to receive recognition as a coach who can
win big games.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols have done it all, mostly with their defense and enough
offensive production by Martin to get them leads.
</P>
<P>
   For Florida State, it has been another year on the edge. The
Seminoles nearly fell off the cliff when they were soundly beaten
by then-unranked North Carolina State, 24-7, Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   But, as much as Top 5 finishes _ of which there have been 12 in
a row _ stumbling at least once a season also has become a Florida
State tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's because of the schedule we play,'' said coach Bobby
Bowden, who never has had an unbeaten season at Florida State. ``We
don't go out and play Tennessee-Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Seminoles win, they will have played nine bowl teams, and
beaten three BCS teams _ Texas A&AMP;M, Florida, and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   They also have overcome adversity, handling a season-ending
injury of quarterback Chris Weinke without much loss of efficiency,
replacing him with untested sophomore Marcus Outzen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Outzen oozes confidence and seems to show no nerves
about the biggest game of his career and his his fourth game as a
starter, count on the Tennessee defense to make him its focal
point.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden already has a national championship, but says he wants
another.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer wants his first.
</P>
<P>
   On paper it looks like a defensive tossup, which could and
probably will be decided by a late-game turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be putting a crown on a great six years, really,''
said Fulmer, who has the highest winning percentage (66-11, 85.7
percent) of any active Division 1-A coach.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee can get Win No. 67 Monday night, it truly will have
earned its national championship.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a playoff game for the ages _ in a finish
that will be remembered as one of the most dramatic in NFL history
_ San Francisco quarterback Steve Young found absolution and 49ers
receiver Terrell Owens found redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who never had beaten Green Bay, put an exclamation mark
on a 76-yard desperation drive by throwing a 25-yard touchdown pass
to Owens with three seconds left, giving the 49ers a 30-27 victory
over the Packers in an NFC wild-card game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was double significant because it was in the
playoffs against the team that knocked us out the last three
years,'' said Young, who was 0-8 as a starter against the Packers.
``All we wanted was a chance in the end. We were so grateful for
that last shot.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was more grateful than Owens, who had dropped four
passes, including an easy touchdown, and lost a fumble that set up
a Packers field goal. But on a play that meant survival or death in
the playoffs, it was Owens _ not Jerry Rice _ who caught the most
important pass for the 49ers since Dwight Clark beat Dallas in the
1981 NFC Championship Game to propel San Francisco to its first
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers, who thought they won the game on Brett Favre's
15-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman with 1:56 remaining,
played a four-deep zone designed to prevent a touchdown. It was
third-and-three with eight seconds left when Young dropped back,
stumbled and almost fell before regaining his balance.
</P>
<P>
   Owens ran down the middle of the field, and with four Packers
zeroing in on him like heat-seeking missiles, he leaped to catch
the ball and was immediately smashed by safeties Pat Terrell and
Darren Sharper. When he came down just inside the goal line still
clutching the ball, Owens was mobbed by his teammates, and delirium
overcame 66,506 fans at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is going down in history, and I'm just glad to be
part of it,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, who ended a five-game losing streak to Green Bay,
advance into the second round at Atlanta. They split the season
series 1-1 with the NFC West-rival Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers, who had eliminated San Francisco from the playoffs
the last three years, lost in the first round for the first time
since Mike Holmgren became the coach in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren was beaten by his former team and his former
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful game by Steve,'' Holmgren said. ``He's had
that kind of marvelous season. If someone had to beat us like that,
I'm glad it was Steve. I'm happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   There were six lead changes and seven turnovers in this
confrontation between former Super Bowl winners who could undergo
major changes at the coaching and personnel levels in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who completed 18 of 32 passes for 182 yards and three
touchdowns with two interceptions, and Favre, who was 20-of-35 for
292 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions, guided their
teams up and down the field against defenses that allowed a total
of 750 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was a physical game that bordered on brutal at times. Running
backs Garrison Hearst (49ers) and Dorsey Levens (Packers) earned
their yards the yard way. Hearst, who didn't practice last week
because of a hamstring injury, rushed for 128 yards. Levens, who
didn't play most of the season because of surgery on his leg,
rushed for 116 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game had a lot of ups and downs,'' San Francisco coach
Steve Mariucci said. ``Green Bay's a great team, and they were very
physical, and we rotated players to try to keep them fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys had to suck it up, play hurt and shed a lot of blood,
sweat and tears to win one of the greatest games in the history of
the organization. I think this team showed true character.''
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers led to most of the scoring. There were five turnovers
in the first half, after which Green Bay led 17-10 on Ryan
Longwell's 23-yard field goal, Favre's two-yard touchdown pass to
Freeman and Levens' two-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers scored on Wade Richey's 34-yard field goal and Young's
one-yard touchdown pass to tight end Greg Clark. Clark caught an
eight-yard touchdown pass from Young to tie the score 17-17 in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Richey and Longwell exchanged field goals to make it 20-20 early
in the fourth quarter. Richey kicked a 40-yarder for a 23-20 Niners
lead midway through the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With 4:19 remaining, Green Bay got the ball at its 11 trailing
by three. Favre took the Packers to the San Francisco 15 and found
Freeman alone in the end zone. Longwell's extra point gave the
Packers a 27-23 lead with 1:56 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers started the winning drive at their 24 with 1:50 left.
Young completed three passes for 29 yards. Then, after an
incompletion, he found Rice near the sideline for a six-yard gain.
Rice appeared to fumble, and the Packers recovered, but the
officials ruled he was down. Replays showed the ball came loose
before Rice's knee hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers didn't waste the second chance. Young completed passes
of nine and seven yards. After an incompletion, there were eight
seconds left. The ball was on the Green Bay 25. One play was all
the Packers needed to make to prevent a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``One shot, one shot was all I wanted,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Young and Owens collaborated on the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I faked outside and knifed down the middle,'' Owens said. ``I
had the option of going inside or outside. Steve threw the ball
where it had to be. When I turned, the ball was right there. I was
just happy to catch the ball because I'd had a rough day up to that
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens was crying when he came to the bench to be mobbed by his
teammates again.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates encouraged me to keep my head up, and I'm so
happy I got a chance to redeem myself,'' he said. ``They were
right. I held my head up. I came up big, didn't I?''

FLAMES ARE TEST FOR BRUINS' RESOLVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Which way are the Bruins headed? Is the team back to
its winning ways, playing defense first and scoring goals off other
teams' mistakes, just as it did in beating Anaheim, 2-1, Saturday
night? Or was that just one game; did the real Bruins show their
wares in losing three out of four on their recent road trip, when
they were outscored, 17-9?
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will take a step in one direction Monday night
against the Calgary Flames. Will it be another game like the
victory over the Mighty Ducks? Or a game like the 6-1 setback in
Dallas Thursday? Which is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a relief if we can back it up,'' said Bruins
veteran defenseman Don Sweeney Sunday after the Bruins' workout at
the FleetCenter. ``It won't be a relief if it's a one-game stint.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the Bruins' difficulties began before the road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gotten away from it (playing defensively) for a while
even during our winning streak,'' Sweeney said. ``We were getting
away with little things in areas that we've got to do better in. We
were talking about it, trying to adjust, but when you're winning,
sometimes you overlook those things. When you're losing, that's
what stands out.''
</P>
<P>
   So against Anaheim, featuring the high-scoring trio of Paul
Kariya, Teemu Selanne and Steve Rucchin _ and a team coming off a
7-2 victory against the Buffalo Sabres and Dominik Hasek Friday _
focusing on the little things was an essential part of a winning
formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys did a good job against that top line and, for the most
part, we tried to stay out of the penalty box,'' said Sweeney of
the win over Anaheim. ``Their power play is real good and to stay
focused every shift that you're out and stick to the game plan,
that's what we're trying to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville, Ray Bourque talked to the players about how the
Bruins have a pretty good reputation under coach Pat Burns as a
team that other squads don't want to go against. The Bruins make
opponents work for goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to disappoint them (the opponents) in that
area,'' Sweeney said. ``We don't want to do some of the things we
sometimes got away from doing, especially on the last road trip. We
want them to realize that's the way it's going to be to play
against us. We want that reputation of being hard to play against.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a difficult team to play against and when you talk to
other players, that's respect. You have to go out and earn that.
You have to earn that every night. You don't just live on that from
last year. You've got to go out and back that up and give it to
them. You might as well bring them what they expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who have forged a 17-13-6 record, have no give in
their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inspiration comes in the fact how close everything is in
the conference,'' Sweeney said. ``It's going to take a lot of
points to make the playoffs. You've got to realize that. Every
night, those two points you have an opportunity to get are
precious. You've got to realize that from the get-go and go out and
protect them and go out and get them. You want them in the bank now
because it's only going to get harder as the year goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Every team is tough. Any team can beat any other team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're gaining ground or losing ground,'' Sweeney said. ``It's
going to be tough all the way across the board. Every night,
there's going to be a challenge, an opportunity to step forward and
take two points. You gain two points and gain ground or push
yourself away from somebody else.''

MINNESOTA WINS RESPECT FROM BC WITH TIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Minnesota wing Mike Anderson called his team's
performance 24 hours earlier against Boston College ``downright
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   His coach, Doug Woog, said Sunday's rematch was ``all about
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Gophers, who were walloped, 8-4, Saturday, gained
some measure of revenge against Boston College when they charged
from behind with two third-period goals to salvage a 3-3 overtime
tie before 3,234 at Kelley Rink.
</P>
<P>
   Rico Pagel scored the tying goal with less than eight minutes to
play when he deflected a blast from the point past the glove of BC
goalie Scott Clemmensen. That came three minutes after Anderson had
pulled the Golden Gophers to within 3-2 with a pretty goal from the
top of the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmensen, who had 22 saves against Minnesota Saturday, had 33
more Sunday, many of them spectacular. None, though, was more
important than the shot he turned aside off the stick of Bill Kohn,
who blasted the puck from the point through a screen with 1:08 left
in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard and good things happen when you work hard,''
said Anderson. ``We came out not wanting a repeat of yesterday. We
played for each other and as a team today rather than as
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Woog was a little more direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was about respect and unselfishness rather than pettiness
and selfishness,'' he said. ``When you look at your neighbor in the
locker room and realize what he's doing is just as important as
what you're doing, then you've arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's respect and we needed to make a statement about that
today. I think some people on this team had to drop the I and the
best way to do that is to play with respect for one another.''
</P>
<P>
   BC came out swarming and took a 1-0 lead 3:50 into the game when
Tony Hutchins poked a loose puck past Minnesota goalie Adam Hauser
during a scramble just outside the crease. Late in the period, Jeff
Farkas, who had four goals Saturday, made it 2-0 when he potted a
power-play goal off a rebound to Hauser'sleft.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt Smith bagged his 11th of the season midway through the
second period to trim the deficit to 2-1, but Mike Lephart upped
the margin to a pair again with a wrap-around beauty at 5:49 of the
third period. Then Anderson and Pagel struck to tie the game at
3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota had a golden opportunity to win in overtime when Smith
and Mike Lyons broke in on Clemmensen two on one, but Lyons
mishandled the feed across the crease from Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was the best he's played all year,'' said BC
coach Jerry York of Clemmensen, ``and that's a good sign for us
because we're going to need him at the top of his game as we go
into the Maine (Friday and Saturday at Kelley) series.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to sweep the series, that was our objective,'' York
continued. ``Three out of four points isn't bad, but we really
wanted that fourth point.''
</P>
<P>
   BC (11-5-2, 6-3 Hockey East) is idle until its showdown with
Maine this weekend. Minnesota (7-10-3, 5-5-2 WCHA) returns to
league action Saturday at Denver.

FISK WOULD BE NICE CATCH FOR HALL 
</HEADLINE>
 OF FAME VOTE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON FISK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tomorrow, we'll know about Carlton ``Pudge'' Fisk. Will
the one-time Red Sox catcher be elected to the Hall of Fame? And if
he is, which hat will he wear on his plaque?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the results of the month-long balloting of the Baseball
Writers Association of America will be announced. Given the depth
of the competition (George Brett, Robin Yount, Nolan Ryan among
others), there is no guarantee Fisk will be elected to Cooperstown
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk was an All-Star in seven of his 11 seasons in Boston. He
appeared in 1,078 games as a catcher before leaving through free
agency in 1980. He appeared in 1,148 more games as a catcher in 13
seasons in Chicago, to set the record with 2,226 at the position.
The White Sox also used Fisk in left field, at first base, and as a
designated hitter. Late in his career, when he had Bob Boone's
major league record in sight, the White Sox' decision to let
someone else do the catching created some bad blood, the memories
of which remain today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I went out there I tried to play as hard as I
could,'' Fisk said in a recent interview. ``As a catcher, you never
knew how long it was going to last. I had a couple of serious
injuries and operations in Boston but I could have played there
longer. I thought about coming out to Chicago and playing three,
four, or five years. I had full intentions of coming back to New
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the years kept going by, I thought I just wanted to prove a
point. A lot of people said I was too old. I was too fragile. Too
brittle. I wouldn't play or wouldn't last very long. I became as
stubborn as I could, I guess. I went out and worked hard every day
to get myself ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he makes it into the Hall or not, Fisk's worthiness
surely will be debated this week. He is a fan favorite in two
cities, but also has his detractors. The mail recently included a
note from a reader, Larry Feehley of Brockton, who said he believes
Fisk shouldn't be on the ballot. Feehley pointed out that Fisk
never won a Most Valuable Player award and batted just .269 over
his 24-year career. Fisk was described as ``an above-average player
who hung on too long to set a secondary record via longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, it was suggested that Fisk was not the dominating
catcher of his time and his career twice ended in much publicized
exits from the teams he represented. Feehley pointed out that
Boston made Fisk a free agent rather than pay a 33-year-old catcher
a premium salary, then just under $700,000. And that Fisk and the
Chicago front office feuded in his closing years all the way to his
major league record number of games as a catcher. Six days after
getting the mark, Fisk was released and asked to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   But after talking with Fisk about this and other subjects, one
becomes more convinced than ever that he belongs in Cooperstown.
You have no heart if you can't reward the man who provided baseball
one of the thrills of a lifetime in the 1975 World Series with his
Game 6 homer. Fisk used to drive people crazy with his frequent
trips to the mound, his slow manner between pitches, and his
countless foul balls to left. But he played sometimes in awful pain
and at the very least was the American League's answer to Johnny
Bench.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of any catcher lasting 24 years in today's game are
exceptionally slim. And catchers are worth their weight in gold.
Fisk was a hell-raiser one day and a gentle giant the next. He was
not always a happy camper when it came to club functions. But they
loved him in Boston. Still do.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do I believe Fisk should be elected to Cooperstown as
soon as possible, he should go in wearing a Red Sox cap. Despite
his exit from Boston in 1980, he still has strong roots in
Charlestown, N.H. Red Sox CEO John Harrington absolutely loves him.
Lately, there have been some good feelings emerging about his early
days in Boston, now that the team's co-owners at that time, Haywood
Sullivan and Buddy LeRoux, have been erased from his memory bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk says he is pleased there are people who value what he did
during his career and who won't assess it with just a calculator.
He is reminded that in 1988, former teammate Carl Yastrzemski came
under fire in some quarters at election time. Critics said his 23
years of service and the fact that half of his 3,308 games were
played in the bandbox called Fenway Park detracted from his
accomplishments. Yaz was elected in a first-ballot landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk said he never took the game or the records he set lightly.
The manner in which he prepared for each game was grueling, but it
was something he liked at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I really liked the preparation and the competition,''
he said. ``The older I got, the more single-minded I had to be in
my preparation. Getting into a real regimen of strength and
conditioning allowed me to play as long as I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record motivated me at the end. It suddenly became
approachable and it came in sight. I knew that if I was just given
a chance to compete or participate I could contribute and chase the
record at the same time. I was happy to set the record. But I
wasn't around much after that.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, said Fisk, he won't forget that his days
as a Red Sox are what helped put him in the position he is in now.
He recently became a grandfather. One of his daughters, Courtney,
has returned from college and is living at home. Life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in Boston was the dream of a New England boy come
true,'' said Fisk. ``I think we all know that to play in Fenway
Park was to play in perhaps the best ballpark in all the major
leagues. I'm talking about from what it has to offer in history and
tradition to its dimensions to a close relationship with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the teams that I played on while I was there, if you
had a wish list of people you'd want to have on your team to try to
chase the pennant, just about all of them were on the Red Sox in
those years.''
</P>
<P>
   The years in Boston went quickly after he signed with the Red
Sox, who made him the fourth player taken in the January 1967 free
agent draft. He had chosen the Red Sox and baseball over a possible
career with the Celtics and pro basketball. In hindsight, he did
the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before 1967, there wasn't much going on. But by 1972 I was
able to make it to the majors (he actually debuted in 1969) and we
had a close run. We did it again in 1975. The 1978 season
highlighted the Don Zimmer years for me. It turned out to be a
heartbreaker but a great year, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sticks in my mind is that there were just successful
years against terrific teams like Baltimore and New York, who were
also as good a team as you could put on the field. One of the
reasons the Red Sox-Yankee rivalry was so intense is that we were
equal in talent and desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk still has no clue as to why his Red Sox career ended so
abruptly. Sullivan failed to mail him a contract by the Dec. 20
deadline and instead of arbritration, he was given free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two guys (Sullivan and LeRoux) put me in a position that
it was unacceptable to return,'' he said. ``They made no offer.
They had no intentions of having me come back. I felt for the
longest time that I had been abandoned. Out to sea in a little
rowboat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I always had a great time coming back. People treated me
nice and welcomed me with their cheers. That made it fun coming
back. In a way it was a burden, but it was a fun one to shoulder.
To be voted into the Red Sox Hall of Fame is quite an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball Hall of Fame should be next.

OWENS, 49ERS GRAB VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You could have won a lot of bar bets outside the
Bay Area by posing the following question:
</P>
<P>
   ``Has Steve Young ever won an NFL game with a last-second
touchdown pass?''
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, the answer was no. But that's all in the past
tense now. His 25-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens with three
seconds remaining provided the league's resident management orphans
with a 30-27 victory over archrival Green Bay before 66,506
enraptured onlookers at 3Com Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers may not have any front office accountability at
present, but guys in $1,000 suits don't play. Football players do,
and San Francisco's will be heading to Atlanta next Saturday for a
date with the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Young and the team exorcised a few ghosts. The
Niners had lost five straight games to the Packers, and they had
been bounced from the playoffs three years in succession. In
addition, Young was 0-8 lifetime against the Packers, a streak that
included some no-hopers in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   This information was known to everyone within a 500-mile radius.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to get this one,'' said the 37-year old
Young, who has taken some hits in these parts lately for not _
believe it or not _ winning the so-called big ones. ``They had
knocked us out of the playoffs three years running, and if we are
who we say we are, and are supposed to be charging to Super Bowls,
and the same team keeps beating you, that can't be overwritten.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor can anyone overwrite the drama inherent in the final two
drives of this game. For the nine-play, 76-yard winning 49er drive
came in direct response to a crisp nine-play, 89-yard drive
orchestrated by Brett Favre, a drive that had culminated in a
15-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman with 1:56 left.
</P>
<P>
   Young took over with the ball on his 24. There was 1:46 left.
``That's plenty of time,'' he pointed out, ``especially with all
our timeouts. Also, I know I've got big receivers. It's important
to make sure you don't get too greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was 7 for 9 on the final drive, and he had some help.
There was, for example, a spectacular bull-in-the-china-shop 3-yard
catch-and-run by fullback Marc Edwards, who took a short pass and
got the Niners a first down at the Green Bay 47 by refusing to come
down until hit by the 11th Packer. And there was the obligatory Bad
(Non)-Call.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers did indeed catch a huge break when Jerry Rice lost
control of the ball for a clear fumble after making a 6-yard
reception at the Packer 41. But Green Bay did not get the call.
</P>
<P>
   It came down to a third and 3 at the Packer 25 with eight
seconds left. The call, according to coach Steve Mariucci, was for
all four wide receivers to head into the end zone. ``I can't tell
you the name of the play,'' he said. ``Bombs away, and throw it
into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called `All Go,''' said Owens, who found safety Leroy
Butler was giving him the middle. ``I faked outside and knifed back
toward the middle. Steve put the ball right where it had to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Young threw what may have been his best pass of the day, a
bullet that Owens caught to his outside shoulder, and never mind
that he had been dropping passes all day, including one in the end
zone and another on the penultimate possession that would have
given his team a valuable first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' said Young. ``You just
keep playing. I don't even remember. But I'm glad T.O. had a chance
for redemption.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad I caught the ball,'' said Owens. ``I had a rough
day, all day.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't anyone to fault. Two great athletes teamed up on a
great play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball goes down the middle like that,'' said Green Bay
coach Mike Holmgren, ``you don't think the ball's going to be
caught, ever. I think it was a marvelous catch. It was the perfect
throw by Young, and Owens made the play.''
</P>
<P>
   When Green Bay examines this game in the sober light of day, the
Packers will feel even worse than they did Sunday. They handed
Young two scores with a fumble and pass interception which led to
touchdown ``drives'' of 19 and 33, yards, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay led by a 17-10 score at the half, but if you had never
glanced at the scoreboard you'd have thought they were up by three
touchdowns, minimum. The Packers had offensive balance (292 yards
passing and 116 Dorsey Levens yards on the ground), and when the
time came to make their own statement they did so via the
aforementioned 89-yard march for what looked like the winning
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't lose a game like this,'' lamented Holmgren, who
very likely was coaching his final game in Green Bay (assuming you
believe half of what you read and hear). ``It's the worst that can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite all that, but in the pro football world, it's bad
enough.

ON BALANCE, DOLPHINS CONTENT

<P>
   MIAMI _ Dan Marino didn't have to look at the final statistics
of Miami's 24-17 wild-card victory Saturday over the Buffalo Bills.
He just knew. For the first time in four playoff meetings against
the Bills, the Dolphins finally were able to strike a perfect
balance with their offense.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-50 split between run and pass.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Marino's oft-overtaxed arm was not relied upon to
cover up for an anemic rushing attack, which had gained just 145
yards on 42 attempts in Miami's three previous playoff losses to
the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Marino attempted 34 passes, completing 23 for 235
yards and an 11-yard touchdown to Lamar Thomas. And Miami's rushing
game _ bolstered by the return of running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar
(concussion), left tackle Richmond Webb (triceps), and right guard
Kevin Donnalley (knee) _ netted 117 yards on 34 attempts, with
Abdul-Jabbar doing the bulk of the work by carrying 27 times for 95
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four passing attempts. Thirty-four rushing attempts. One
big playoff victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was a thing we had to do against the Bills defense
because they're so good you really can't drop back and pass every
play like we did in some other games,'' said Miami center Tim
Ruddy.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple formula most NFL coaches strictly follow,
especially during playoff time. Play balanced football. Win, and
move on to the next round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always talked about how we needed to be balanced,'' said
Marino, whose TD pass was the 30th of his playoff career, moving
him into a second-place tie with Terry Bradshaw on the NFL's
all-time list behind Joe Montana (45). ``And I think we were
balanced today. When you can do that and be successful at it, it
really takes a lot of heat off (the passer). You've got guys on
Buffalo who can really rush the passer, and they just can't pin
their ears back and go, so it helps.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped Marino to have the three injured starters back on
offense. That was never more evident than on an impressive 12-play,
52-yard touchdown drive in the third quarter. The Dolphins
demonstrated how committed they were to the rushing game by running
the ball on nine plays, including seven of the first eight.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar highlighted the drive with a 3-yard touchdown burst
up the middle. Then Marino handed off to Stanley Pritchett for the
successful 2-pointer _ Miami's first of the season _ that gave the
Dolphins a 14-7 lead with 2:32 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Marino completed two of three attempts on the drive, an 8-yard
pass to Thomas and a 6-yarder to Oronde Gadsden for a
first-and-goal at the Buffalo 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our offensive coordinator (Kippy Brown) just
recognized that they might have gotten a little tired and he just
kept calling run after run after run,'' said Webb. ``We just kept
driving it down and pounding it, and we got it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how tired he became on that series, Webb said, ``I got a
little winded, but that was to be expected. I haven't played in
like seven or eight weeks, but I hung in there and made it
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he played at slightly less than 100 percent,
Abdul-Jabbar said the sight of Webb wincing in pain in the huddle
served as all the inspiration he needed to get through the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to ask how he was doing once the whole game,
because I could see it in his face _ I knew he was hurting,'' said
Abdul-Jabbar, who appeared to be hurt himself by the way he
gingerly walked from the trainer's room to his stall in the
Dolphins' locker room at Pro Player Stadium after the game. ``But
he performed great.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially on that touchdown drive. Or, rather, that touchdown
stampede.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys up front were doing a great job, but I'm going to
look at the film, because I know I left a few out there,'' said
Abdul-Jabbar, who helped Miami record its first 100-yard rushing
game in postseason since 1994 against Kansas City, which was the
last time the Dolphins won a playoff game before Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some times where I just wanted to get the first
down and I think there was a big play outside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though when you run the ball, you're going to have a lot
of 1- and 2-yard gains,'' Ruddy said. ``If you stick with it, the
fact is it helps keep the defense honest and it only helps you in
the long run.''

CANCELED SEASON THE END FOR HARRIS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everyone associated with the NBA loses something
if the league's labor war kills the season. Money. Championship
hopes. Comeback attempts. Fresh starts.
</P>
<P>
   Del Harris loses something far more personal: the chance to
honor his late parents. And if the season is indeed canceled this
week, Harris may also lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   The latter issue is cloudy. The Lakers coach is in the final
year of his contract, and the team has not offered an extension.
Even with the season on the verge of oblivion, management has made
no assurances Harris will get a final opportunity to take the
Lakers to the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no reason to believe that will change. If there is
no season, Harris probably has coached his last Lakers game.
</P>
<P>
   It would be another crushing blow in an already tumultuous
offseason for the 61-year-old Harris.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Elmer Harris, died of heart failure Aug. 17. Six
weeks later, his mother Wilma, who had been battling illness for
several years, passed away.
</P>
<P>
   The losses ``had a profound effect on me,'' said the deeply
religious Harris, noting it was his father who inspired his love of
basketball growing up in tiny Plainfield, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   All Harris wanted was a chance to dedicate the season to his
parents. To win a championship for Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was during Dad's process of dying, I was kind of using the
season as sort of a reason for him to hold on, hang on,'' Harris
recalled in an interview last week. ``He was truly a basketball fan
and sports fan and was the reason I got involved in sports in the
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Elmer Harris and twin brother Delmer _ for whom the coach
was named _ who instilled Del with a passion for sports. And later
it was Delmer who helped the 26-year-old Del get his first major
high-school coaching job, in Spencer, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   But Del's uncle died 25 years ago, missing the chance to see
Harris coach in the NBA and take the Houston Rockets to the 1981
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big regret at the time, that he had not been able
to see that,'' Harris said. ``I had hoped that Dad would be able to
complete this, and see us win a championship, and put a closure, a
final touch, on all the things we started on so many years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, both of Harris' parents lost their vision. They
tracked the Lakers' progress through Del's sister, Beverly, who
watched all the games via satellite TV in Tennessee and called with
regular scoring updates. During close games, she'd call during the
final minutes and hold the phone up to the TV so they could hear
the action.
</P>
<P>
   The way Harris figures it, Mom and Dad might get a better look
at the games now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it works in heaven. I suppose they have
better things to do than watch the ups and downs of an NBA
season,'' Harris said. ``Or maybe they just see the good parts, you
know, it's all joy up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in heaven, it's one long replay of Lakers-Sonics in the
'98 playoffs, or Rockets-Celtics in the '81 Finals, or Del's
Coach-of-the-Year season in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the courts are empty and Harris' chance for closure is
slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Harris said, ``we will still be able to do this
and fulfill all those things. If not, they'll still share in
whatever future endeavors might come up. In any case, their passing
on has had a profound effect on me. Whether we win this
championship or not, there will still be other positive things that
came from their life.''
</P>
<P>
   The case for Harris: All sentiment aside, the Lakers should do
the right thing and bring Harris back for another season no matter
how the lockout plays out.
</P>
<P>
   All signs pointed to this being Harris' last season, with that
outcome subject to change if he wins a title. The buzz is that
assistant Kurt Rambis would take the reins next.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harris posted a .691 winning percentage in the last
three years _ behind only Chicago's Phil Jackson (.825), Seattle's
George Karl (.740) and Utah's Jerry Sloan (.736) _ he has not
developed a strong rapport with his players.
</P>
<P>
   But reports of a full-scale mutiny are vastly exaggerated, and
the more difficult personalities are either gone (Nick Van Exel) or
soon will be (Elden Campbell, within seconds after the lockout
ends).
</P>
<P>
   And Harris has improved the team's finish each year despite
never having a full season with a healthy Shaquille O'Neal _ not to
mention the challenges posed by Van Exel's tantrums, Kobe Bryant's
youth and the lack of a reliable power forward.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy Shaq, a maturing Bryant, a real power forward and a
better clubhouse atmosphere will put the Lakers in championship
contention, and Harris deserves to be there when it happens _ even
if it means getting a contract extension the Lakers hadn't intended
to give him.
</P>
<P>
   More lockout fallout: The NBA and its battery of attorneys are
mulling the consequences of a lost season, and among the weighty
issues _ assuming the league survives _ will be the status of
player contracts and the structure of the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom is that player contracts _ which run by
year, not by season _ are in effect even if there are no games.
</P>
<P>
   That means Bryant and Lakers point guard Derek Fisher would be
free agents this summer, and O'Neal could exercise an opt-out
clause in his contract.
</P>
<P>
   It also means the Nuggets may never get the services of Van
Exel, whom they obtained on draft night for rookie Tyronn Lue and
second-year forward Tony Battie. Van Exel would be a free agent
this summer, happily pursuing a new home without spending a day in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In all, some 100 players would become free agents, adding to the
current pool of 200 and making for a signing season that could put
baseball's hot stove league to shame.
</P>
<P>
   The draft is another matter. Without a season of win-loss
records, how would draft order be determined? Would the Clippers
pick first again?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows yet, but one possibility is the league could order
the draft based on three-year cumulative records, or use a
combination of those records and the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The ``winner'' of a three-year record scenario? Not the Clippers
(they'd be sixth at .333), but the Vancouver Grizzlies (.195), who
drafted second in '98. Following Vancouver would be Toronto and
Denver (both at .272), Dallas (.285), Philadelphia (.289), the
Clippers, Boston (.341) and Golden State (.346).
</P>
<P>
   Santa Shaq: O'Neal has been a notable absence at charity games,
wisely skipping the Showtime debacle, opting out of the Chris Mills
game at UCLA and sitting out a Dallas game when he couldn't get
large enough shorts. But he's still in a giving mood.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 20, O'Neal picked up the checks for everyone eating at
Ruby's Restaurant in Redondo Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shook his hand and thanked him,'' Kenneth Eldredge, who had
half a club sandwich and a bowl of clam chowder, told the Easy
Reader. ``He was very pleasant.'' &QL;

LAW FINISHED ON WRONG SIDE OF KEY PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ For so long Sunday, the familiar Patriots
were seen in sights so familiar to Patriot fans, sights that so
often this season led to familiar losses to good teams.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Lovett Purnell being on the field, for some reason, in
key situations and then dropping the key pass. The ball being
handed off to Robert Edwards and the entire Patriot offensive line
still on its feet, no blocks being made by any of them, as Edwards
is pounded to the turf by the Jaguars defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sedrick Shaw blocking no one on a kickoff return, causing
Derrick Cullors to be pounded deep in his own territory. Confusion
in the defense, causing Willie Clay to call a timeout because the
team was in the wrong coverage.
</P>
<P>
   On the key third down of the game, when New England had crawled
back to trail by only 2 points in the fourth quarter, and
Jacksonville was flustered, the Patriots let tight end Pete
Mitchell roam free in the middle, as tight ends have been free all
season, and Mitchell made a 22-yard catch. On and on and on, the
familiar sights of a team that was not championship material.
</P>
<P>
   But one sight unfamiliar to all was this: Ty Law being beaten on
a go pattern down the left sideline by the Jaguars' Jimmy Smith for
the 37-yard touchdown 2 1/2 minutes into the fourth quarter that
absolutely turned the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my fault,'' Law said time and again in the locker room.
``I take full responsibility,'' he said many times. ``I'm to blame
for the loss'' came from Law's mouth more than once.
</P>
<P>
   No consolation, either, that Mark Brunell's pass was perfect and
Smith's catch was superb. ``It was a great throw and a great catch
by two great players on the other side,'' said Patriots coach Pete
Carroll. ``It took a great play to beat a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said he is not the type to let this killer of a play haunt
him during the offseason. But the New England cornerback, in the
first half hour after the play occurred, already had analyzed what
went wrong scores, if not hundreds of times, in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   And when asked about Smith's catch, Law began a monologue that
went on and on as he replayed techniques and methods that had
served him so well this Pro Bowl year of his, only to desert him at
the most crucial time of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect thrown ball and catch,'' Law began, ``but I'm
pretty pissed off about that. Being in that situation like that ...
I take everything like that personally. I got to give credit where
credit is due; Mark Brunell threw a great ball and Jimmy Smith made
a great catch. It's just that I didn't make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   January football games are so often decided by this _ great
players making great plays in the fourth quarters of tight games.
Always it divides the winning team from the losing team. And so
Law's monologue went on, analyzing and dissecting every move he
made on the play, but also every thought that went through his head
as Brunell's pass floated high down the left sideline and Law was
step-to-step with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of slowed up there at the end, because I thought it was
an underthrown ball,'' Law went on. ``It seemed like the wind ...
the wind took it or something. Actually, it was such a high arc of
a thrown ball that I was there. And that's why I turned back (to
look at the ball). I might have been looking at the ball too long,
you know what I mean. That might be a bad technique.''
</P>
<P>
   Law's voice was barely audible as he talked on. He had his face
in his locker, but talk Law did, as he always talks after a game,
win or lose, good play or bad play. And so he went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have to look at it again to see if it was bad
technique by me,'' he said. ``I thought I was seeing the ball
coming down ... but it went further than I anticipated. And Jimmy
Smith made a helluva grab. It took every bit of his speed to get
that ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very hard on me. I always take stuff like that to
heart because I'm a competitor and I don't like to give up things
like that, things that I normally don't. But I'm human. But
sometimes, you know, I try to make myself not be human. But this is
very hard, because we were in a situation where we were back in the
game and so I'll take full responsibility for (the loss). I'm
supposed to be a guy who's counted on on this team. It's only one
play, and they say one play doesn't win or lose games, but as far
as I'm concerned that was the turning point of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The play was pure pro football chess at its best. The Patriots'
defense had shown what appeared to be a blitz, but then checked off
into another defense. Brunell had checked off the play he had
called, and given a hand signal to Smith for a ``go'' pattern. And
now it was man-to-man, Jimmy Smith vs. Ty Law, and a season was
riding on who would win the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smith likes to have a step or so on me at the start,'' Law
explained, as he voiced his mind's replay, ``but I like to play a
step short on receivers anyway. You play a guy tight and it gives
too much chance to push off and come back on a comeback pass, so I
always play a little shorter, figuring that if the ball is there,
it has to be a perfectly thrown ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Law's words now raced, as his mind did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one time I was not in the vicinity to at least not
make a play on the ball, or make a play on the receiver. That's
because I read the pass wrong. I wasn't there. I mean, as far as
how far the pass was going. You know, the ball was coming down, and
being as I like to play over the shoulder, and not over the top, it
cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   Law kept grasping for an answer about why he was not where the
ball came down. He thought he was in perfect position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have been the wind,'' Law said. ``The wind might have
taken it and made it go further than I thought. Maybe that was it
... I don't know ... I thought I was there ... Maybe the wind took
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Israel's half-hearted attempts on blitzes are familiar,
and so is the sight of Robert Edwards being wide open in the left
flat on that third-down pass from the Jaguars' 6-yard line that
Purnell dropped, when New England was ready to take the lead on the
second play of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was a microcosm of the whole season,'' said Carroll,
and Willie Clay used virtually the same words, saying, ``It was a
microcosm of how the season went the way we dug ourselves into a
hole and tried to climb out.''
</P>
<P>
   But this game was no microcosm of the New England season. That's
because Ty Law got beat deep.

BRUNELL PRESSES ISSUE WITH AUDIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ When he saw the ``press'' coming, Mark
Brunell decided it was time to take Ty Law to the cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't supposed to be the pattern,'' said Brunell of his
37-yard touchdown strike to Jimmy Smith in the fourth quarter that
just about sealed the Jaguars' 25-10 win over the Patriots Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With his team clinging to a 12-10 lead, and the momentum
swinging toward New England, Brunell unloaded the bomb that blew
the Patriots right out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play we had called was an 18-yard comeback,'' said Brunell
of the first-and-10 play. ``But when I saw the corner (Law) started
to move up and press, I gave Jimmy a hand signal that tells him to
change the pattern and go deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith did that, streaking down the left sideline. The Patriots
blitzed, but unlike the success they had attacking the gimpy
Brunell for three periods, this time it backfired. The Jaguars
picked it up, and with no one in front of him, Brunell was able to
step up and throw a perfect strike to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the field, both of them were running stride-for-stride,''
said Jaguars tight end Pete Mitchell. ``But at about the 5-yard
line, Jimmy started to pull away from him and the ball was
perfectly thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   Touchdown, and a 19-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to have something on that drive,'' said Brunell.
``New England was taking over, had things going for them. We had to
make a statement. We talked about it on the sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell did not play a good first half. Playing for the first
time in a month and trying to operate on an ankle that had to have
a special tape job and be deadened by medication, he was having
passes sail everywhere except into the arms of open receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frustrated at the end of the half,'' said Brunell, even
though his team led, 12-0. ``We had a terrible series of plays at
the end of the half, and then I hurt my ankle on the last play.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Coach) Tom Coughlin and myself talked about whether I could
play the second half, but we really didn't argue. I wanted to keep
on playing. I felt I could play better as the game went along.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell calmed down in the fourth period and reverted to the
accurate passer he usually is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark won the game for us,'' said offensive tackle Tony
Boselli. ``Under the circumstances, he came up with a big game.
When we needed to make a play at the end, he did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said before the game I thought he would struggle,'' said
Coughlin. ``He practiced this week, but it wasn't like a normal
week of practice. He didn't take all of the snaps because of his
ankle. So we anticipated that it might take a while for him to play
his game, and it did.''

   MIAMI _ Dan Marino didn't have to look at the final statistics
of Miami's 24-17 wild-card victory Saturday over the Buffalo Bills.
He just knew. For the first time in four playoff meetings against
the Bills, the Dolphins finally were able to strike a perfect
balance with their offense.

   A 50-50 split between run and pass.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Marino's oft-overtaxed arm was not relied upon to
cover up for an anemic rushing attack, which had gained just 145
yards on 42 attempts in Miami's three previous playoff losses to
the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Marino attempted 34 passes, completing 23 for 235
yards and an 11-yard touchdown to Lamar Thomas. And Miami's rushing
game _ bolstered by the return of running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar
(concussion), left tackle Richmond Webb (triceps), and right guard
Kevin Donnalley (knee) _ netted 117 yards on 34 attempts, with
Abdul-Jabbar doing the bulk of the work by carrying 27 times for 95
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four passing attempts. Thirty-four rushing attempts. One
big playoff victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was a thing we had to do against the Bills defense
because they're so good you really can't drop back and pass every
play like we did in some other games,'' said Miami center Tim
Ruddy.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple formula most NFL coaches strictly follow,
especially during playoff time. Play balanced football. Win, and
move on to the next round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always talked about how we needed to be balanced,'' said
Marino, whose TD pass was the 30th of his playoff career, moving
him into a second-place tie with Terry Bradshaw on the NFL's
all-time list behind Joe Montana (45). ``And I think we were
balanced today. When you can do that and be successful at it, it
really takes a lot of heat off (the passer). You've got guys on
Buffalo who can really rush the passer, and they just can't pin
their ears back and go, so it helps.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped Marino to have the three injured starters back on
offense. That was never more evident than on an impressive 12-play,
52-yard touchdown drive in the third quarter. The Dolphins
demonstrated how committed they were to the rushing game by running
the ball on nine plays, including seven of the first eight.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar highlighted the drive with a 3-yard touchdown burst
up the middle. Then Marino handed off to Stanley Pritchett for the
successful 2-pointer _ Miami's first of the season _ that gave the
Dolphins a 14-7 lead with 2:32 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Marino completed two of three attempts on the drive, an 8-yard
pass to Thomas and a 6-yarder to Oronde Gadsden for a
first-and-goal at the Buffalo 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our offensive coordinator (Kippy Brown) just
recognized that they might have gotten a little tired and he just
kept calling run after run after run,'' said Webb. ``We just kept
driving it down and pounding it, and we got it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how tired he became on that series, Webb said, ``I got a
little winded, but that was to be expected. I haven't played in
like seven or eight weeks, but I hung in there and made it
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he played at slightly less than 100 percent,
Abdul-Jabbar said the sight of Webb wincing in pain in the huddle
served as all the inspiration he needed to get through the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to ask how he was doing once the whole game,
because I could see it in his face _ I knew he was hurting,'' said
Abdul-Jabbar, who appeared to be hurt himself by the way he
gingerly walked from the trainer's room to his stall in the
Dolphins' locker room at Pro Player Stadium after the game. ``But
he performed great.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially on that touchdown drive. Or, rather, that touchdown
stampede.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys up front were doing a great job, but I'm going to
look at the film, because I know I left a few out there,'' said
Abdul-Jabbar, who helped Miami record its first 100-yard rushing
game in postseason since 1994 against Kansas City, which was the
last time the Dolphins won a playoff game before Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some times where I just wanted to get the first
down and I think there was a big play outside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though when you run the ball, you're going to have a lot
of 1- and 2-yard gains,'' Ruddy said. ``If you stick with it, the
fact is it helps keep the defense honest and it only helps you in
the long run.''

PATRIOTS FINISH ON A DOWN NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Ty Law, the Pro Bowler who was beaten on
the back-breaking touchdown pass to Jimmy Smith in the fourth
quarter, stood up before the team in the locker room afterward and
said, ``This was my fault. I take full responsibility for the
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Armstrong and injured quarterback Drew Bledsoe also gave
speeches to the beaten and stinging Patriots following a 25-10 loss
to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Sunday's AFC wild-card playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   The season over after the Patriots couldn't come back all the
way from a horrid first-half performance by the offense, Armstrong
and Bledsoe began looking ahead to next year _ a year in which the
team might have to make another transition depending on whether
coach Pete Carroll is fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' said center Dave Wohlabaugh of the speeches.
``I think we needed those guys to do that. I think we can build off
of this and come into next year with a good, positive attitude. I
hope Pete's a part of that, because with everything that happened
and with all of the injuries, he deserves another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the reason the Patriots didn't win Sunday was because
they didn't have a healthy Bledsoe or a healthy Terry Glenn for him
to throw to.
</P>
<P>
   Backup QB Scott Zolak (21 for 44, 190 yards, one interception),
though he led a second-half resurgence, went 5 for 16 for 39 yards
in the first half. At one point he was 3 for 12 (as was
Jacksonville's Mark Brunell) and was missing his targets badly,
once throwing wide of Sedrick Shaw, who was standing right in front
of him.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots left the field at halftime trailing by only
12-0 in a game they could have been out of from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first half wasn't just frustrating, it was ugly,'' said
wide receiver Shawn Jefferson. ``We couldn't do anything right out
there. We came out in the second half and put some things together,
but we couldn't get it done when he had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was referring to a drive that began in the third
quarter and lasted into the fourth, with New England trailing,
12-7. Zolak threw to Tony Simmons for gains of 13 and 16 yards and
to Robert Edwards (28 yards rushing) in the flat for 15. The
Patriots got it as close as the 9, one Zolak pass was off the mark
and another was dropped, and New England settled for Adam
Vinatieri's 27-yard field goal to make it 12-10.
</P>
<P>
   The big play was Lovett Purnell's drop on third and 6. Had he
caught the ball, the Patriots likely would have had a first down,
and it might have even gone for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to give the Jaguars all the incentive they needed
for their resurgence, even with Brunell bothered by an ankle sprain
that has hampered him for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say that was the turning point, but if we get
it there, the momentum gets going, it shuts up their crowd, and you
never know what could happen,'' said Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars then drove 70 yards in six plays. Brunell hit on a
22-yard pass play to Pete Mitchell, and three plays later, from the
New England 37, Brunell hit a diving Smith in the end zone, with
Law doing everything humanly possible to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed momentum for us,'' said Brunell. ``It was a simple
hand signal to Jimmy to give him the `go' route. He ran a nice
route and I was able to put the ball out there for him. It was just
a check at the line of scrimmage. That was a big play. They were
moving the ball and putting some points up, and we knew we had to
answer it. Any time we get a press on Jimmy, we feel we have the
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said he didn't think the ball was going to go as far as it
did. ``I think the wind took it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Law spoke to his teammates, they soothed him by telling him
it wasn't his fault. And perhaps in the overall scheme of things,
it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, playing without Ted Johnson and Todd Collins,
couldn't contain Fred Taylor, the exciting rookie running back who
wound up with 162 yards on 33 carries. The Jaguars had heard talk
last week that the Patriots thought Jacksonville was more of a
finesse team than a hard-nosed unit. The Jaguars seemed inspired by
that. ``Who's smash-mouth and who's soft?'' said Taylor afterward.
``We put that rumor to sleep,'' added offensive tackle Tony
Boselli. ``We definitely weren't a finesse team today.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Law's miscue, Jacksonville defensive end Joel
Smeenge beat Zefross Moss one-on-one, made a great rush, and hit
Zolak in the chest, causing him to fumble. It was fallen on by end
Tony Brackens, and the Jaguars were back in business at the Patriot
25. From there, Mike Hollis made a 34-yard field goal, basically
drop-kicking it as holder Bryan Barker never really got the ball
down.
</P>
<P>
   The game had started inauspiciously for the Patriots. On the
opening kickoff, Derrick Cullors fumbled when struck hard by former
Boston College linebacker Tom McManus. The Patriots recovered but
had to punt, and Jacksonville drove to a 35-yard field goal to go
ahead, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars got another field goal later in the quarter after
the Patriots stopped Jacksonville at the New England 6.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jaguars added their first touchdown in the second
quarter, going 68 yards on nine plays.
</P>
<P>
   The big play was a 21-yard run by Taylor, who seemed to be
stopped in the backfield and then reversed direction, getting it
down to the Patriots' 34. The drive culminated in Taylor's 13-yard
run, making it 12-0.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin went for the 2-point conversion, and
Taylor was stuffed in the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Despite adjustments, halftime speeches, and looks in the mirror,
the Patriots simply were outplayed.

JAGUARS DID GROUNDWORK FOR VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The game was not Mark Brunell vs. Scott
Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   The game was decided by Fred Taylor and Robert Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran the ball and we stopped the run,'' was the first
sentence out of Tom Coughlin's mouth after his Jacksonville Jaguars
had beaten the Patriots, 25-10, Sunday at Alltel Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin's assertions are backed up by the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had 162 yards rushing; Edwards had 28 of New England's
total of 35 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was a great complement to a struggling Brunell; Edwards
was no help to a harassed Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we looked at the Patriots on film during the week,'' said
Jaguars tight end Pete Mitchell, ``we saw that the teams that got
very physical with their defense were the teams that had luck
running the ball against them. We just picked up our (run blocking)
game by getting more physical.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars dominated the first half, outgaining the Patriots,
199 yards to 54, while taking a 12-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the game almost turned for New England in a big way when
Brunell injured his ankle on the final play of the half, and
Coughlin had a decision to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really upset because he played the whole half until the
final play without hurting his ankle again,'' said Coughlin. ``Then
he got hit on the final play. We talked about how he felt, and he
wanted to keep on playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game, we thought it would take him some playing
time to get back to being sharp. He was definitely off in the first
half. But in the fourth period, he stepped up and made some big
plays that turned the game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of dominating the first half, the Jaguars fell asleep
in the third period and the Patriots ran off 10 straight points.
</P>
<P>
   New England grabbed all the momentum in the third, outgaining
Jacksonville by a staggering 130 yards to 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zolak did a better job of getting the ball out (throwing)
faster in the third period,'' said Jaguars defensive coordinator
Dick Jauron. ``They did a good job of spreading us out in that
period. Twice we had our defensive backs go after the ball and
miss, and that hurt us, giving up big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just played sharper in the third than they did in the
first half. They caught on to what we were doing against them and
made some adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   There were three critical plays in the game. The Jaguars made
two of them. The Patriots missed on theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 12-7, Zolak moved the Patriots to the Jacksonville 9
and faced third and 6 early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak threw a pass right into the hands of backup tight end
Lovett Purnell at the 5, and he dropped it. Purnell had a first
down for sure, and most likely a touchdown that would have given
the Patriots a 14-12 lead. Instead they had to settle for a field
goal and still trailed, 12-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense of urgency on our sideline at that point,''
said Jaguars tackle Tony Boselli. ``We knew we had to go out and
score some points. Everything was going New England's way. Luckily
for us, Mark made some big plays and we took the momentum back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots defense had great success attacking Brunell with
blitzes. ``They knew he couldn't run with his ankle,'' said
Jacksonville offensive coordinator Chris Palmer, ``so they came
afer him. They had good pressure. We made some mistakes. He missed
a couple of passes early that could have been touchdowns. But in
that drive he made some big plays. I thought the biggest play of
the game was the completion to Mitchell on third down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars, sitting on that 2-point lead, faced third and 10 on
their 30 after the Patriots had kicked their field goal. The
Patriots blitzed again, but this time the Jaguars blocked it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to get open in the middle of the field,'' said
Mitchell, who made a 22-yard reception to keep the drive alive.
``Someone jammed me at the line of scrimmage, but once I got away,
I don't know what happened to him. Mark saw what happened and made
a great throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, the Jaguars struck for the decisive score, a
37-yard touchdown pass from Brunell to Jimmy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just a great play,'' said Palmer. ``Jimmy had dropped
a pass a few plays earlier when the sun was in his eyes, but Mark
put the ball right on the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith beat Ty Law deep and Brunell dropped the ball into his lap
in the end zone to give the Jaguars their first playoff home win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we got the lead back, we got the turnovers,'' said
Coughlin. ``They had three; we didn't have any. New England played
hard. They did a great job in the third period, but we were
fortunate to come back in the fourth period to make the plays and
win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they ran away with it.

IT'S TIME TO COMPETE 
</HEADLINE>
 BOWL-BOS-2   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ After all the talk abut the Bowl Championship
Series, about computer rankings, and polls, the champion of the
1998 college football season finally will be crowned Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be done on the field, between teams who are the best
college football has to offer this season.
</P>
<P>
   In matching No. 1 Tennessee (12-0) vs. No. 2 Florida State
(11-1), the Fiesta Bowl has a game worthy of its hype.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, teams like Ohio State (11-1) can make claims, as they did
after Friday night's 24-14 Sugar Bowl victory over Texas A&AMP;M. There
are Rose Bowl winner Wisconsin and Holiday Bowl winner Arizona,
each with a loss. There's even Tulane, other than Tennessee the
only unbeaten Division 1-A team remaining. All could be considered,
but no one can really quibble with the credentials of either the
Volunteers or Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has earned its shot at its first national championship
since 1951. If the Vols win _ and they are 5 1/2-point underdogs _
they will have beaten eight bowl teams, including three BCS teams _
Syracuse, Florida, and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   They have shown they can win various ways, whether on a
last-second touchdown pass, as quarterback Tee Martin threw in
beating Syracuse in the opener, or with a modicum of luck, as they
had in their last-minute win over Arkansas, aided by a crucial
Razorbacks fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Vols are contending with doubters who believe that
this will be another Tennessee disappointment, another team that
will lose the ultimate game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably a lot of people out there who don't think we
belong in this game,'' said Tennessee wide receiver Peerless Price.
``We've been a team that's been so close for so long. With how hard
we've worked and everything we've overcome, I really can't see
anybody being more deserving to be here than us.''
</P>
<P>
   Price may have a point. The Vols have leaped a steady succession
of hurdles this season.
</P>
<P>
   They switched from four-year starter Peyton Manning to Martin at
quarterback without a hitch; they absorbed the season-ending injury
of their best running back, Jamal Lewis; they adjusted to losing
three starters in their secondary.
</P>
<P>
   This is a much different Tennessee team than the one that lost
to Florida for the fifth straight time last season, than the squad
that was embarrassed and overmatched against Nebraska in the Orange
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there were certain things that had to happen, certain
things that we had to make happen,'' said Tennessee's Phil Fulmer,
who is finally starting to receive recognition as a coach who can
win big games.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols have done it all, mostly with their defense and enough
offensive production by Martin to get them leads.
</P>
<P>
   For Florida State, it has been another year on the edge. The
Seminoles nearly fell off the cliff when they were soundly beaten
by then-unranked North Carolina State, 24-7, Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   But, as much as Top 5 finishes _ of which there have been 12 in
a row _ stumbling at least once a season also has become a Florida
State tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's because of the schedule we play,'' said coach Bobby
Bowden, who never has had an unbeaten season at Florida State. ``We
don't go out and play Tennessee-Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Seminoles win, they will have played nine bowl teams, and
beaten three BCS teams _ Texas A&AMP;M, Florida, and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   They also have overcome adversity, handling a season-ending
injury of quarterback Chris Weinke without much loss of efficiency,
replacing him with untested sophomore Marcus Outzen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Outzen oozes confidence and seems to show no nerves
about the biggest game of his career and his his fourth game as a
starter, count on the Tennessee defense to make him its focal
point.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden already has a national championship, but says he wants
another.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer wants his first.
</P>
<P>
   On paper it looks like a defensive tossup, which could and
probably will be decided by a late-game turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be putting a crown on a great six years, really,''
said Fulmer, who has the highest winning percentage (66-11, 85.7
percent) of any active Division 1-A coach.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee can get Win No. 67 Monday night, it truly will have
earned its national championship.

ZOLAK LACKING IN THE END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Scott Zolak could twist the numbers if he
wanted. It would be easy. Numbers are like that. Sometimes they can
be so flexible that they can make you question what you saw with
your own eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people watched Zolak and his Patriots play the
Jaguars on national television Sunday. Another group of 71,139
watched live in Alltel Stadium as the Jaguars ended the Patriots'
season, 25-10, in an AFC wild-card game. Maybe you were one of the
viewers who thought Zolak didn't look good at quarterback. Maybe
you threw things at your television and called the man out of his
name. There's a chance you thought he looked like a veteran
quarterback _ a veteran quarterback who is very experienced at
watching and not playing. Maybe you thought, ``I wish the Patriots
had someone like Mark Brunell,'' the former Pro Bowler who starts
for the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say you didn't watch the playoff game that Zolak was
forced to start because of an injury to Drew Bledsoe's finger.
Let's say you bumped into Zolak at your neighborhood convenience
store and asked him to stack his numbers next to Brunell's. In that
case, the numbers would not reveal the true story. That's because
Zolak could tell you that he completed a higher percentage of his
passes than Brunell. He also could tell you that he threw for more
yards. He could say that he moved his team up and down the field in
the third quarter while Brunell could only direct a couple of
three-downs-and-out series.
</P>
<P>
   If you asked for more, Zolak could recite this quote from
Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin: ``The Patriots played a solid
football game and Zolak made some plays in the third quarter which
got us quite concerned.'' He could accurately tell you that
Patriots coach Pete Carroll never considered taking him out of the
game at halftime but, on the Jaguars sideline, Coughlin and Brunell
could be seen having a lively discussion. Speculation was that
Coughlin was considering removing Brunell before, as Brunell said,
``I just encouraged him, I should say, to keep me in there. It
wasn't a confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   See? Numbers are crazy. All of those words and numbers are true,
yet the Patriots are in Foxborough, Mass., this morning. They are
cleaning out their lockers, having team meetings, and, as Zolak
said, ``picking up two Super Bowl tickets if you want to watch
somebody else play in it. Not me. I'm selling mine.'' He was asked
his selling price for the Super Bowl tickets. ``Oh, face value,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. Face value. More than anything, ``face value'' tells
you more about Zolak and the Patriots than numbers. Brunell may
have been wild on some of his throws. He may have looked like a
rookie in the second quarter when he was called for an intentional
grounding penalty that took his team out of field-goal range. But
he did throw for a touchdown, did not have an interception, and did
have a running game.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak can't say that. He got the team into position for a
touchdown in the third quarter, when Robert Edwards scored from the
1. But with his team trailing, 12-7, at the beginning of the fourth
quarter, Zolak needed a touchdown. What his team got was a field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say that was the turning point, but if we get it there
it really gets our momentum going and shuts up their crowd,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   You know by now that the opposite happened. After the
Jacksonville lead shrunk to 2, 12-10, Brunell found Jimmy Smith
open against Ty Law. Most of the 34 balls he threw on the afternoon
were wayward, but Brunell threw perfectly toward the end zone on
the ball to Smith. Thirty-seven yards later, Smith had a touchdown.
Shortly after, the locals began to crank up their music and chant,
``We want the Jets.'' Amidst all that was poor Zolak, the guy who
was forced to face the craziness of numbers again.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers can be two-faced. Sometimes they matter and sometimes
they don't. They mattered when the Patriots trailed by 9 in the
fourth quarter. That's because the Jaguars knew that the Patriots
had to pass because they could not run. Edwards finished the day
with 28 yards on 17 carries. Scary numbers. And since Coughlin
knows Bill Parcells's phone number, you can bet that he talked to
the Tuna about the quarterback he coached for five seasons. So
there were no secrets at the end of the game. Not only did the
Jaguars know Zolak would throw, they knew where he was throwing. It
is no surprise, then, that New England was done scoring for the
day.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the best northern Florida afternoon for the Patriots.
It was a day when rookies Edwards and Tony Simmons had more
receptions than Ben Coates. It was a day when the punter, Tom Tupa,
was the most outstanding player. It was a day when the Patriots had
one first down in the first half. It was a day when Zolak walked on
the field, put up slightly better numbers than a Pro Bowler, and
then walked off the field to talk about a loss.

FIRE CLAIMS SECOND YOUNG VICTIM

   LOS ANGELES -- Patrick Crawford, a 7-year-old boy who was
severely injured in a Christmas tree fire Thursday in Val Verde,
Calif., died Sunday at the Grossman Burn Center at Sherman Oaks
Hospital in suburban Sherman Oaks, Calif. His 17-year-old
half-brother, Shawn Williams, had died Saturday after surgery at
the same facility.
</P>
<P>
   The boys were burned in a fire that broke out shortly after 8
a.m. Dec. 31 in the Santa Clarita Valley north of the Los Angeles
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman Burn Center spokesman Larry Weinberg said Patrick went
into respiratory failure at 5:23 a.m. Sunday and was pronounced
dead at 6:25 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in extremely critical condition with third-degree burns
over 65 percent of body and significant smoke-inhalation damage to
his lungs,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the boy's small size and severe injuries, his chances of
survival had been slight, Weinberg said. While young children heal
faster than adults, he said, the loss of fluid is more devastating
to a child's body. Burns and smoke damage to Patrick's lungs
eventually overwhelmed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the pediatricians -- part of the team that treated him
-- said that, given the extent of his burns and extent of
smoke-inhalation damage, the mortality rate for a child in his
condition would probably be about 90 percent,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The older half-brother's friend, Patricia Lynn Martin, 20, and
the boys' aunt, Dawn Carter, 45, were also injured in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has declared that
the fire's origins are suspicious, and arson investigators were
assigned to the case. Sgt. David Halm said Sunday that the
investigation is continuing.

BLEDSOE PINED TO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ He was one of the first players to exit the
locker room after Sunday's playoff loss to the Jaguars. And why
not? Drew Bledsoe didn't have to shower after the game. He never
got in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   With a protective pin still sticking out of his right index
finger, the quarterback watched from the sideline Sunday as the
Patriots went down, 25-10. It was the third straight game he
missed, but it hurt more because he was unable to play in a playoff
game for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   While Scott Zolak struggled against the Jaguars, making No. 11
look more valuable than ever, Bledsoe wore headphones and sent
signals from the sideline. In a white T-shirt and khaki pants, the
Patriots' franchise player looked downright coach-like. There were
times when he seemed to be in charge of the entire team.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a rough few weeks for Bledsoe. As he walked toward the
team bus, he was asked if he was glad to see the season finally end
or just looking forward to starting again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking forward to next year, definitely,'' said Bledsoe. ``I
can't wait for the next one to start.''
</P>
<P>
   He signed a few autographs as he walked. This is not easy when
you have little use of the index finger on your writing hand.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the fate of coach Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``His record speaks for itself,'' said the quarterback. ``He's
made the playoffs two years in a row. And he didn't allow all the
distractions to get to us. There were a lot of things that could
have made us quit, but we didn't, and that's because of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe is a favorite of owner Robert Kraft. It's much like the
Carl Yastrzemski/Tom Yawkey relationship, in which Yaz was
considered coach-maker/breaker. Does Bledsoe want Carroll to
return?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, definitely,'' he said.

BROWN DOWN AFTER GOOD GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ He was their best receiver, their best
return man, and, when it was over Sunday in Alltel Stadium, their
best spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I look at the last couple weeks?'' asked Troy Brown.
``We've gotten our asses kicked the last couple weeks. That's all
you need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Those searching for any shred of positivity from the Patriots'
25-10 wild-card playoff loss to the Jaguars should look toward
Brown. The team had missed his steadiness midway through the season
because of his severe ankle injury. When he is in the lineup, Brown
has a knack for doing good things. Drew Bledsoe has called him ``my
guy.'' Bill Parcells tried to cut him a few times, but the coach
finally realized that Brown made plays.
</P>
<P>
   He did that Sunday, catching four balls for a team-high 46
yards. He returned a punt 17 yards in the third quarter, which led
to New England's final points of the day. He did his job. You
wondered why the ball wasn't thrown his way more often. ``I just do
what they tell me,'' he said. ``I'm not the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown sat next to Bruce Armstrong in the locker room. So he
listened at halftime when Armstrong and a few others tried to
inspire the team for the second half. The Patriots trailed, 12-0,
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armey is a guy who has been around for a long time; he knows
what he's talking about,'' Brown said. ``Some guys listened and
some guys didn't. All I can say is that you have to be ready to
play, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say the Patriots were not ready to play. He didn't
say they were, either. After a few seconds, he didn't say much at
all. Finally, he shrugged, continued to dress quietly, and said,
``I guess now it's time to go home.''

FLAMES ARE TEST FOR BRUINS' RESOLVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Which way are the Bruins headed? Is the team back to
its winning ways, playing defense first and scoring goals off other
teams' mistakes, just as it did in beating Anaheim, 2-1, Saturday
night? Or was that just one game; did the real Bruins show their
wares in losing three out of four on their recent road trip, when
they were outscored, 17-9?
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will take a step in one direction Monday night
against the Calgary Flames. Will it be another game like the
victory over the Mighty Ducks? Or a game like the 6-1 setback in
Dallas Thursday? Which is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a relief if we can back it up,'' said Bruins
veteran defenseman Don Sweeney Sunday after the Bruins' workout at
the FleetCenter. ``It won't be a relief if it's a one-game stint.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the Bruins' difficulties began before the road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gotten away from it (playing defensively) for a while
even during our winning streak,'' Sweeney said. ``We were getting
away with little things in areas that we've got to do better in. We
were talking about it, trying to adjust, but when you're winning,
sometimes you overlook those things. When you're losing, that's
what stands out.''
</P>
<P>
   So against Anaheim, featuring the high-scoring trio of Paul
Kariya, Teemu Selanne and Steve Rucchin _ and a team coming off a
7-2 victory against the Buffalo Sabres and Dominik Hasek Friday _
focusing on the little things was an essential part of a winning
formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys did a good job against that top line and, for the most
part, we tried to stay out of the penalty box,'' said Sweeney of
the win over Anaheim. ``Their power play is real good and to stay
focused every shift that you're out and stick to the game plan,
that's what we're trying to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville, Ray Bourque talked to the players about how the
Bruins have a pretty good reputation under coach Pat Burns as a
team that other squads don't want to go against. The Bruins make
opponents work for goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to disappoint them (the opponents) in that
area,'' Sweeney said. ``We don't want to do some of the things we
sometimes got away from doing, especially on the last road trip. We
want them to realize that's the way it's going to be to play
against us. We want that reputation of being hard to play against.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a difficult team to play against and when you talk to
other players, that's respect. You have to go out and earn that.
You have to earn that every night. You don't just live on that from
last year. You've got to go out and back that up and give it to
them. You might as well bring them what they expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who have forged a 17-13-6 record, have no give in
their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inspiration comes in the fact how close everything is in
the conference,'' Sweeney said. ``It's going to take a lot of
points to make the playoffs. You've got to realize that. Every
night, those two points you have an opportunity to get are
precious. You've got to realize that from the get-go and go out and
protect them and go out and get them. You want them in the bank now
because it's only going to get harder as the year goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Every team is tough. Any team can beat any other team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're gaining ground or losing ground,'' Sweeney said. ``It's
going to be tough all the way across the board. Every night,
there's going to be a challenge, an opportunity to step forward and
take two points. You gain two points and gain ground or push
yourself away from somebody else.''

PATRIOTS' FOCUS TURNS TO CARROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ First, Patriots owner Robert Kraft called
media reports that coach Pete Carroll would be fired after Sunday's
loss ``hogwash.'' He then said that he will let vice president of
player personnel Bobby Grier evaluate Carroll and give the owner a
recommendation on his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby is going to evaluate things on the football field and
(vice president of business operations) Andy Wasynczuk evaluates it
off the field,'' said Kraft. ``That's how our organization works
and that's the process we're going to go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Pete Carroll. He's a tremendous guy, a great family
man, and he's done a lot of great things for our organization. He's
a very good coach and we're trying to help him along as much as we
possibly can. I would like nothing more than for Pete Carroll to be
the coach of this team for years and years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the stories are ludicrous. Why would anyone in our
family say something like that and hurt our chances right before a
playoff game? Would we be trying to hurt our own chance of winning
the game? Anyone who knows us knows we would never do something
like that. I hated to hear that those stories were out there, and I
can tell you nobody in this organization has anything to do with it
because we haven't discussed it as an organization yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said of the evaluation, ``It's going to be very detailed
and it's probably not going to be right away. I want to evaluate
all aspects of the organization and not just the coach and see the
things we did right and the things we did wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't be a knee-jerk evaluation. And it certainly won't
be based on one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has been meeting with Carroll the past few days. ``I told
Pete that the stories were hogwash,'' he said. ``I told him that he
shouldn't pay any attention to them. He should concentrate on
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Carroll hurt himself more with Sunday's loss remains to
be seen. What is certain is that Kraft shook Carroll's hand after
the game and thanked him for the season.
</P>
<P>
   He then went across the way and shook hands with Tom Coughlin
and wished him well against the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville offensive coordinator Chris Palmer, rumored to be a
candidate to replace Carroll, did not comment.

FISK WOULD BE NICE CATCH FOR HALL 
</HEADLINE>
 OF FAME VOTE-BOS-2   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tomorrow, we'll know about Carlton ``Pudge'' Fisk. Will
the one-time Red Sox catcher be elected to the Hall of Fame? And if
he is, which hat will he wear on his plaque?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the results of the month-long balloting of the Baseball
Writers Association of America will be announced. Given the depth
of the competition (George Brett, Robin Yount, Nolan Ryan among
others), there is no guarantee Fisk will be elected to Cooperstown
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk was an All-Star in seven of his 11 seasons in Boston. He
appeared in 1,078 games as a catcher before leaving through free
agency in 1980. He appeared in 1,148 more games as a catcher in 13
seasons in Chicago, to set the record with 2,226 at the position.
The White Sox also used Fisk in left field, at first base, and as a
designated hitter. Late in his career, when he had Bob Boone's
major league record in sight, the White Sox' decision to let
someone else do the catching created some bad blood, the memories
of which remain today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I went out there I tried to play as hard as I
could,'' Fisk said in a recent interview. ``As a catcher, you never
knew how long it was going to last. I had a couple of serious
injuries and operations in Boston but I could have played there
longer. I thought about coming out to Chicago and playing three,
four, or five years. I had full intentions of coming back to New
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the years kept going by, I thought I just wanted to prove a
point. A lot of people said I was too old. I was too fragile. Too
brittle. I wouldn't play or wouldn't last very long. I became as
stubborn as I could, I guess. I went out and worked hard every day
to get myself ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he makes it into the Hall or not, Fisk's worthiness
surely will be debated this week. He is a fan favorite in two
cities, but also has his detractors. The mail recently included a
note from a reader, Larry Feehley of Brockton, who said he believes
Fisk shouldn't be on the ballot. Feehley pointed out that Fisk
never won a Most Valuable Player award and batted just .269 over
his 24-year career. Fisk was described as ``an above-average player
who hung on too long to set a secondary record via longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, it was suggested that Fisk was not the dominating
catcher of his time and his career twice ended in much publicized
exits from the teams he represented. Feehley pointed out that
Boston made Fisk a free agent rather than pay a 33-year-old catcher
a premium salary, then just under $700,000. And that Fisk and the
Chicago front office feuded in his closing years all the way to his
major league record number of games as a catcher. Six days after
getting the mark, Fisk was released and asked to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   But after talking with Fisk about this and other subjects, one
becomes more convinced than ever that he belongs in Cooperstown.
You have no heart if you can't reward the man who provided baseball
one of the thrills of a lifetime in the 1975 World Series with his
Game 6 homer. Fisk used to drive people crazy with his frequent
trips to the mound, his slow manner between pitches, and his
countless foul balls to left. But he played sometimes in awful pain
and at the very least was the American League's answer to Johnny
Bench.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of any catcher lasting 24 years in today's game are
exceptionally slim. And catchers are worth their weight in gold.
Fisk was a hell-raiser one day and a gentle giant the next. He was
not always a happy camper when it came to club functions. But they
loved him in Boston. Still do.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do I believe Fisk should be elected to Cooperstown as
soon as possible, he should go in wearing a Red Sox cap. Despite
his exit from Boston in 1980, he still has strong roots in
Charlestown, N.H. Red Sox CEO John Harrington absolutely loves him.
Lately, there have been some good feelings emerging about his early
days in Boston, now that the team's co-owners at that time, Haywood
Sullivan and Buddy LeRoux, have been erased from his memory bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk says he is pleased there are people who value what he did
during his career and who won't assess it with just a calculator.
He is reminded that in 1988, former teammate Carl Yastrzemski came
under fire in some quarters at election time. Critics said his 23
years of service and the fact that half of his 3,308 games were
played in the bandbox called Fenway Park detracted from his
accomplishments. Yaz was elected in a first-ballot landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk said he never took the game or the records he set lightly.
The manner in which he prepared for each game was grueling, but it
was something he liked at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I really liked the preparation and the competition,''
he said. ``The older I got, the more single-minded I had to be in
my preparation. Getting into a real regimen of strength and
conditioning allowed me to play as long as I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record motivated me at the end. It suddenly became
approachable and it came in sight. I knew that if I was just given
a chance to compete or participate I could contribute and chase the
record at the same time. I was happy to set the record. But I
wasn't around much after that.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, said Fisk, he won't forget that his days
as a Red Sox are what helped put him in the position he is in now.
He recently became a grandfather. One of his daughters, Courtney,
has returned from college and is living at home. Life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in Boston was the dream of a New England boy come
true,'' said Fisk. ``I think we all know that to play in Fenway
Park was to play in perhaps the best ballpark in all the major
leagues. I'm talking about from what it has to offer in history and
tradition to its dimensions to a close relationship with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the teams that I played on while I was there, if you
had a wish list of people you'd want to have on your team to try to
chase the pennant, just about all of them were on the Red Sox in
those years.''
</P>
<P>
   The years in Boston went quickly after he signed with the Red
Sox, who made him the fourth player taken in the January 1967 free
agent draft. He had chosen the Red Sox and baseball over a possible
career with the Celtics and pro basketball. In hindsight, he did
the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before 1967, there wasn't much going on. But by 1972 I was
able to make it to the majors (he actually debuted in 1969) and we
had a close run. We did it again in 1975. The 1978 season
highlighted the Don Zimmer years for me. It turned out to be a
heartbreaker but a great year, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sticks in my mind is that there were just successful
years against terrific teams like Baltimore and New York, who were
also as good a team as you could put on the field. One of the
reasons the Red Sox-Yankee rivalry was so intense is that we were
equal in talent and desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk still has no clue as to why his Red Sox career ended so
abruptly. Sullivan failed to mail him a contract by the Dec. 20
deadline and instead of arbritration, he was given free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two guys (Sullivan and LeRoux) put me in a position that
it was unacceptable to return,'' he said. ``They made no offer.
They had no intentions of having me come back. I felt for the
longest time that I had been abandoned. Out to sea in a little
rowboat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I always had a great time coming back. People treated me
nice and welcomed me with their cheers. That made it fun coming
back. In a way it was a burden, but it was a fun one to shoulder.
To be voted into the Red Sox Hall of Fame is quite an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball Hall of Fame should be next.

 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ They announced plans to move to the state
of Connecticut, ended their season in the state of Florida, and
always seemed to be in a state of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, take one last look at your 1998-99 New
England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' Season of the Witch ended Sunday with a limp,
25-10 wild-card playoff game loss to the beatable Jaguars by the
swampy shores of the St. John River. The season that started in
promising fashion (the Patriots were considered NFL elite after
their 41-10 dismantling of Kansas City made them 4-1 in October)
ended with Drew Bledsoe on the sideline with a broken finger,
players on the field pointing fingers, and coach Pete Carroll
embroiled in speculation that he may be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming back next year to put together a football team
that can win championships,'' Carroll said after the loss. ``And
I'm going to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Carroll has three years remaining on a five-year
contract, but tanned owner Bob Kraft and his son, Jonathan, failed
to issue any assurance that their coach will return. Both claimed
the decision would be made by player personnel director Bobby Grier
_ which is tantamount to the US Senate claiming the fate of Bill
Clinton lies in the hands of Connecticut State Assembly. Does
George Steinbrenner let Brian Cashman hire or fire Joe Torre? Let's
not be ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Patriots are a team headed in the wrong direction.
In the last two years, since Carroll replaced Bill Parcells, they
have gone from 11-5 to 10-6 to 9-7. They have gone from the Super
Bowl, to the second round of the playoffs, to one-and-out in
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   They were 8 1/2-point underdogs Sunday and played down to the
low expectations. New England fell behind, 12-0, in the first half,
and backup quarterback Scott Zolak made a good case for Bledsoe
($42 million over seven years) to ask for a raise. New England
compiled an embarrassing 54 yards of offense in the first half (one
first down) when Zolak was 5 for 16 for 39 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots showed some heart in the second half, closing
within 12-7 with a 17-play, 85-yard third-quarter drive. Early in
the fourth, they stormed inside the red zone again and it looked
like they might take the lead, but they settled for a field goal
and it was 12-10.
</P>
<P>
   In a season in which the Patriots suffered so many injuries to
key players, it seemed unfair that the final loss would come down
on the head of their best injury-free player. Cornerback Ty Law,
tops in the game at his position, was burned by Jacksonville
wideout Jimmy Smith for a 37-yard touchdown pass that effectively
put the game out of reach. New England's defeat wasn't sealed until
Zolak fumbled on his 25-yard line with 7 1/2 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in New Jersey, the Great White Tuna must have been
smiling when Zolak fumbled. The man who recovered Zolak's fumble
was none other than Tony Brackens _ the lineman Parcells wanted to
draft instead of Terry Glenn three years ago. It was Kraft's
duplicity during the 1996 draft that paved the road for Parcells to
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Brackens's fumble recovery assured that the Patriots would lose
to Jacksonville, which meant another victory for Parcells. This
way, the Tuna gets to play wobbly Jacksonville next week instead of
dangerous Miami. It also means that Kraft continues to look foolish
for playing Strat-o-Matic with the Super Bowl Patriots of 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998-99 Sons of Pete Carroll were certainly unlucky.
Bledsoe, Terry Glenn, and Ted Johnson, three of their best players,
were on the shelf down the stretch, and many fans believed the team
overachieved under adverse conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But Patriot Nation was discouraged by the 31-10 humiliation at
the hands of Parcells's Jets in the final regular-season game and
Sunday's listless loss to a similarly wounded team. And the final
week of the star-crossed season, a pre-playoff time that should
have been joyous, was punctuated by speculation about Carroll's
dismissal floated by an in-house source.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft, the power behind the throne in the family
empire, was enraged that his name was floated (here) as the source
of the rumor and vehemently denied the charge after Sunday's game.
``I've been unjustly accused of something that isn't true,'' he
said before addressing his disgust with ``all the people that have
been putting knives in our backs all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody should be watching their backs in Foxborough this
week. And next. The offseason has only just begun.

A CLASSIC WILD-CARD WAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER   
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin ital)Welcome to today's NFL-heavy edition of The Sporting
Muse:(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's time-honored tradition of equating football with war
is pretty weary, but Sunday's playoff game between the 49ers and
Packers deserves that kind of labeling. This one could be replayed
immediately on ESPN Classic Sports.
</P>
<P>
   This NFC wild card playoff match was about the respect and/or
contempt the two teams have for each other, born of having met in
the playoffs the last four seasons and each taking various turns as
the best team in football. The games' title was no match for these
two teams, who played as if their freedom depended on victory.
</P>
<P>
   The hits were harder and the effort seemed greater. Both teams
lowered their guard as NFL royalty and took wild swings, right down
to Brett Favre hammering a 49er rusher in the facemask before said
lineman had a chance to hit first.
</P>
<P>
   In the years to come, the 49ers' 30-27 win may be viewed as the
last punch of two heavyweights who know their best days are behind
them. We'll likely remember the game longer than the Super Bowl....
</P>
<P>
   It may be the greatest sports mystery of all time: Why do
bright, intelligent coaches pass rush only three men in situations
like Sunday's?
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers needed a touchdown to win and were down to their last
few seconds, but that did not deter Packers coach Mike Holmgren
from dropping eight backs into coverage _ and getting beat down the
gut for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The three-man rush is a virtual invitation to disaster,
especially when it comes against a veteran quarterback like Steve
Young.
</P>
<P>
   The book on pass defense may say that an eight-man secondary
ultimately has the edge on five receivers. But what I saw Sunday
was Young finding Terrell Owens in the middle of the field between
five converging Packers.
</P>
<P>
   If the Packers rush four men instead of three, and force Young
to move or at least put a couple of hands in his face, maybe he
doesn't see Owens splitting the seam, or maybe he misfires because
his feet are moving right or left....
</P>
<P>
   The non-call on Jerry Rice's fumble in the final sequence will
undoubtedly feed the machinery to revive Instant Replay. But based
on past applications, that particular play would not have subject
to videotape scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   That's actually the kind of play which sent I.R. to its death.
Once an official whistles a play dead, all action stops. It may
have looked like a fumble or been a fumble, but I.R. can't put a
whistle back into the blower.
</P>
<P>
   The situation depends on the ability of the men on the field to
know when a play has reached its conclusion, a not a nanosecond too
soon or late. I.R. can't fix that problem....
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit difficult to get a handle on the NFC what with all
the newcomers still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing out all results from the 1982 strike season, Arizona is
making its first playoff appearance since 1975 and Atlanta its
third appearance since 1981. Minnesota won its first round game
last year after losing its first postseason outing its previous
five tries....
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a moral to the NFL story at this juncture? When
making quarterback personnel decisions, favor those of vintage.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of the eight starting quarterbacks remaining is
33, and its almost 35 if you throw out the kid with the rattle,
Jake Plummer. The Snake turned 24 last month.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the eight are 33 or older. John Elway is 38, Young and
Dan Marino are 37, Randall Cunningham and Vinny Testaverde are 35
and Chris Chandler is 33. Mark Brunell is 28....
</P>
<P>
   Here's some spread numbers, courtesy of The Gold Sheet, for
those who care about such things. Minnesota is 11-4-1, Atlanta
11-4-1, San Francisco 6-9-2 and Arizona 6-10-1; Denver is 9-7, the
Jets 12-4, Jacksonville 10-7 and Miami 10-6-1....
</P>
<P>
   Playoff and bowl perspectives:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona-Minnesota: Has a team that went 9-7 during the regular
season ever made it to the Super Bowl? Yes. Your own Los Angeles
Rams were the only team to do so since the league went to the
16-game schedule. They won the desultory NFC West at 9-7 and then
upset 11-5 Dallas and 10-6 Tampa Bay to earn their only Super Bowl
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals can point to three seasons when a 9-7 team made it
to the AFC title game. It happened in 1983 (Seattle), 1984
(Pittsburgh) and 1995 (Indianapolis). Chances are they'll be
content with beating Dallas and winning a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-Atlanta: Since 1984, the Falcons' all-time record
against the 49ers is 6-23-1. They split the series this season.
Most of their games have been high-scoring affairs, too. And for
what it's worth, the Falcons are among the league's worst in home
attendance, so who knows whether or not they'll have an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Denver: Between 1983 and 1997, Elway and Marino met once.
Now they meet for the second time in less than a month. Marino won
the latest battle, but the Fish were catching Elway at home and the
week after the Broncos' perfect season had expired. Denver's last
loss at home was to Jacksonville in the 1996 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville-New York Jets: Jags coach Tom Coughlin was on Bill
Parcells' staff with the Giants. The Jags are dangerous, but
Parcells reportedly preferred seeing them than having to play a
third game against an AFC East foe.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee-Florida State: Let me first eliminate any confusion in
the minds of Ohio State fans: The Buckeyes will not win any polls
outside of Columbus regardless of what happens in the Fiesta Bowl
tonight. A 24-14 win against Texas A&AMP;M won't make any difference.
</P>
<P>
   This should be a low-scoring contest. Both teams have great
defenses, with Florida State ranking first or second nationally in
every key defensive area. Both have good but not overpowering
running games. Both quarterbacks are efficient, with Tee Martin
having an experience edge on Marcus Outzen.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State went 7-1 against opponents that bowled this
season, and Tennessee was 7-0. I have nothing good to say about the
BCS, but this matchup is about as close as you'd get to a national
title match without the benefit of a playoff.

ONE KILLED, ONE LOST AS WAVES SINK CANOE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY KEVIN F. SHERRY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. -- An outrigger canoe carrying an experienced
six-man paddling team sank in heavy surf Sunday, killing one,
leaving one lost at sea and injuring four others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was totally a freak accident,'' said Michael Davis, 30,
one of the crew members rescued by a fishing boat after several
hours in the 56-degree water. ``We were very trained, skilled at
what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   John Devlin, 50, of Oxnard in Southern California's Ventura
County died in the water, and crew mate Scotty Fullenger remained
missing. One crew member was in critical condition Sunday night and
another in guarded condition. Two others were treated at area
hospitals and released.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 13 years, the six men have gathered four days a
week to paddle their 40-foot Hawaiian-style outrigger canoe and to
rejuvenate their souls, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the team headed out about 8 a.m. in shorts and
T-shirts but no life jackets. The waves were high, but the team had
handled higher, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile off the breakwater, waves 4 to 6 feet high slapped
water into the canoe, and the crew headed back to the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were already on our way back before we got hit by a couple
of good waves,'' Davis said. ``We took on water, and we sunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Two crewmen swam for shore while four remained with the sinking
boat. Eventually the boat sank, and the four also took their
chances swimming, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hanging close to each other,'' he said. ``It was too
hard. We were just getting worked out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The men did not get very far because of the waves and the cold,
Davis said. They could see the shore and signaled for help, but to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a few boats in the beginning, but they were off to the
distance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis figured his one hope would be to return to the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think anyone was coming by,'' he said. ``I was
thinking about getting all my men to shore.''
</P>
<P>
   After the men spent a few hours in the chilly surf, hypothermia
began to set in. When Devlin died in the water, his three teammates
struggled to keep him afloat, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to hold him,'' Davis said. ``(Captain) Ben
Taitai held him in his arms for about 45 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, a fishing boat came upon the four men and
helped them aboard. ``Everybody was just at different stages of
hypothermia,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Crewman Justin Heard, 28, of Oxnard was airlifted from the
fishing boat to St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, where
he was listed in critical condition in the hospital's intensive
care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Taitai, 50, also of Oxnard, were treated for
hypothermia at Ventura County Medical Center and released.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 p.m., a civilian boat that was helping in the search
found crewman Tino Rico, 38. Rico was taken to St. John's Regional
Medical Center, where he was listed in guarded condition.
</P>
<P>
   The search for Fullenger was expected to continue until 1 a.m.
today and start again later this morning, said Dawn Butler, a petty
officer with the Search and Rescue Division of the U.S. Coast
Guard. Helicopters, boats and vehicles from the Harbor Patrol, the
Coast Guard and the state lifeguard station joined in the search on
land, on sea and in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll search until they've exhausted all possibility of the
person being alive,'' Butler said.

CHICAGO DIGS OUT, BUT STORM CRIPPLES AIR TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 9th graf to update number of deaths in Illinois and the
Midwest) (lb) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Pummeled by the most ferocious snowstorm in more than
30 years, this high-stepping city, after being slowed to a crawl,
started to come back to life on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2 feet of snow blanketed the city, left by a storm so
furious that at times on Saturday street plows sat idle in
futility. By Sunday afternoon, however, after an army of city
workers had scraped and swept with a vengeance, the streets became
passable.
</P>
<P>
   Getting in or out of town by air, however, remained problematic.
O'Hare International Airport, the United States' busiest, and
Midway Airport struggled to get back to normal on Sunday after
virtually shutting down on Saturday. There were still plenty of
canceled flights and long delays for travelers returning from the
holidays. Some 400 people had slept on cots and benches inside the
airport on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, air travel throughout the eastern half of the nation was
disrupted Sunday, as the snow and ice in the Midwest, coupled with
heavy sleet and rain on Sunday morning in the Northeast as the
storm moved eastward, resulted in hundreds of canceled flights and
thousands of disgruntled passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, the storm and the ripple effects from the
Midwest stranded or delayed thousands of travelers at Kennedy, La
Guardia and Newark International airports as airlines scratched or
rescheduled flights and threw out their timetables.
</P>
<P>
   With water a foot deep on the JFK Expressway leading to Kennedy
Airport, traffic was halted for more than two hours at
midafternoon, and witnesses told of chaos as riders abandoned
stalled taxis and cars and, with luggage and children in tow,
streamed like refugees for the terminals a mile or two away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely frustrating,'' Adena Muchnik, 26, of New
York said as she and her husband, David, hobbled along the
roadside, struggling with three suitcases and two small children in
strollers, trying to catch a 3:45 flight to Australia. It was
already 3:15, and the dream was dying. ``If we don't make the
flight to Melbourne, we might be out of a vacation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, which barreled up from the Gulf Coast on Friday, also
dumped heavy snow on Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was blamed for at least 36 deaths in the Midwest,
including 11 in Illinois. Many were the result of traffic
accidents. A 130-mile stretch of Interstate 65 in Indiana reopened
Sunday after being closed on Saturday, but many counties in the
state still banned unnecessary travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roads were like ice,'' said John Rawlings, who spent the
night with 200 other travelers at a church near Lafayette, Ind.,
after his van slid off I-65. ``The wind just picked it up and put
it in the ditch,'' Rawlings told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast on Sunday, it was rain that turned highways
across the region into running rivers, downed power lines in parts
of Connecticut, caused 200 accidents on the New York Thruway, and
toppled rainfall records in New York's Central Park, where 2.42
inches eclipsed a 1936 mark for the date by more than an inch, and
in Bridgeport, Conn., which had 2.71 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh as it was, the storm might have been much worse if
temperatures, which hovered in the 40s most of the day, had been 10
or 15 degrees lower, and the precipitation had turned to snow,
weather experts said. A meteorological rule of thumb is that every
inch of rain would have been a foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a big snowstorm,'' Todd Miner, a
meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, said. ``As it
was, all the snow was dumped in the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22 inches that was dumped in Chicago was the most in one
storm since 1967. Indeed, for all its reputation for tough winter
weather, the city had not had more than a foot of snow from any one
storm since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   And in a city where where almost everything is viewed through
the prism of politics, the storm prompted plenty of parlor talk
about the infamous snowstorm of 1979, a mess that contributed
mightily to Jane Byrne's upset victory of the incumbent mayor,
Michael Bilandic. Bilandic had been regarded by voters as being
indifferent to the suffering of Chicagoans, in particular
neglecting black neighborhoods on the South Side.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, running for re-election this year
against Rep. Bobby Rush, made himself highly visible during this
storm, casting himself in news conferences as a general rallying
the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This task will be enormous,'' said Daley. ``Please be
patient.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The storm followed a remarkable stretch of weather in Chicago
during the last months of 1998, mild temperatures, brilliant
sunshine and skies that seemed as blue as Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the blankets of snow have given the city an almost
angelic cast, a look of purity and cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, it's just beautiful,'' said Tom Amenda, 41, a stock
trader.
</P>
<P>
   Amenda and his wife, Mary Shannon, a 38-year-old teacher, had
spent the afternoon shopping, and making snow angels in the yard of
their Wicker Park neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Struck by how quickly the city's streets had been cleaned,
Amenda expressed gratitude for nature's good timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to have a blizzard in Chicago,'' said Amenda,
``you want to have it during an election year.''

ASU LOOKS TO CHANGE LUCK VS. UCLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For eight seasons, Bill Frieder couldn't do it.
Don Newman twice took a shot at it last year and came away empty.
Now it's Rob Evans' turn to try to coach an Arizona State
basketball team to a victory over UCLA tonight when the Sun Devils
visit Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to some good players and a few problems, Evans
inherited a streak of 19 consecutive losses to UCLA, dating to late
in the 1988-89 season. The Sun Devils are 0 for the 90s against the
Bruins. Their last win came under interim coach Bob Schermerhorn,
who replaced the fired Steve Patterson and preceded Frieder.
</P>
<P>
   Frieder's clubs were 0-17 against the Bruins, albeit with some
close calls. The most notable was a 1995 overtime game at Pauley in
which Frieder will swear until his last breath his team was robbed
by an official. Under Newman, the interim coach last season, ASU
lost by five and eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Schermerhorn, meanwhile, is a junior college head coach taking a
leave of absence this season. He watched the Sun Devils on Saturday
when they lost to Southern California, 72-70, at the Sports Arena
in the Pac-10 opener and pronounced them ``very well-coached.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans is responsible for much of that. But he had nothing to do
with the futility against the Bruins and reacted to it
accordingly.``It's no factor now,'' he said. ``Some of the kids
playing now, some were part of the streak, some weren't. I know I
wasn't a part of it. Streaks mean nothing to me. The next ball game
is the only thing that means anything to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Evans was at Mississippi, his 1997-98 team won at Kentucky
for the first time in more than 50 years. That was big, but Evans
put it in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Mississippi, every time we did something we broke a
streak,'' he said. ``The situation had been so bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players, especially the veterans, see it a little
differently. Beating UCLA is huge by itself. Being the first ASU
team to do it in almost a decade would be special.
</P>
<P>
   For senior Mike Batiste, who grew up around here, nothing would
be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never beaten UCLA,'' he said. ``It's time to break the
streak.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, ASU will have to avoid the mistakes that cost the
Sun Devils against USC, and do it against a better team. But it is
a younger UCLA team, at least on the surface. With Batiste, senior
forward Bobby Lazor and junior guard Eddie House, the Sun Devils
have three players with more experience than anyone on UCLA's
roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could play three-on-three we could probably win,'' Evans
said. ``But they're not gonna allow us to play three-on-three.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomores Baron Davis, Earl Watson and Moose Bailey form the
best three-guard rotation ASU has seen, and freshmen Jerome Moiso
and Dan Gadzuric pose big problems inside. And freshman forward
JaRon Rush, the Bruins' third-leading scorer, returns from a
one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils gave up an 18-point first-half lead to the
Trojans by failing to get back on defense, being careless with the
ball and allowing too many put-backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of got lazy and broke down a little bit,'' Batiste
said. ``We didn't find their shooters. We've got to know who to
guard, who to locate and get to them and get a hand in their
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said ASU might have become worn down in the second half.
Only two reserves, swingman Derrick Davis and forward Chad Prewitt,
played 11 minutes or more. Three USC subs played at least 24
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he would like to go to his bench and give players
like Lohnnie Tape and Jason Patton more time, but it's difficult
when they don't produce in games or practice.
</P>
<P>
   Tape, a 6-foot-7 forward, played one minute against USC before
getting yanked. Patton, a 6-4 swingman, has not yet grasped the
system. He didn't play against the Trojans and hasn't seen
meaningful action in more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have confidence in them,'' Evans said. ``You have
to play them early and in critical situations. When you end up
losing ball games, you end up losing confidence, but you've got to
bite the bullet and play some guys some more minutes.'' &QL;

FAIRY TALE SEASON CAPTIVATES NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One journey has ended, and that's the quest for awareness, the
uphill climb through quicksand, the struggle for allegiance in a
fickle desert.
</P>
<P>
   But as you gather around the water cooler, basking in the warm
cocoon of civic pride, reliving the magic and replaying the
triumph, you might not know this:
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are a national entity now.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't just throttle America's Team. They stole its title,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Their quarterback is not only the cornerstone of the franchise,
but the perfect symbol for the NFL. Somewhere in New York,
marketing executives are surely preparing their pitches, clearing
out space in their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Their team is full of characters. From the bravado of Andre
Wadsworth, to the wide eyes of Jamir Miller, to the kaleidoscope
personality of Simeon Rice. From the homogenous coach who has
broken through, to the hermit owner suddenly surfing in the
glorious waves of acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   From the gregarious personnel boss who can't watch (he gets too
nervous at the end of games), yet a man who can't miss (the latest
being Chris Jacke and Carl Simpson). And a staff of assistants
earning their keep.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, NFL rumor monger Fred Edelstein blasted
Marc Trestman during a radio interview. Citing an anonymous source
in San Francisco, he claimed that the offensive coordinator would
show up at the 49ers' training complex on Monday and ask if anyone
had any ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Trestman has been nothing short of brilliant in the second
half of the season. A diverse mind with an aggressive approach. Any
doubts now?
</P>
<P>
   You may not know this, but the Cardinals captivated the country
in a 20-7 pasting of the Cowboys. They are wild, unpredictable, the
best entertainment value in the league. Their infamous futility is
the perfect backdrop in which to frame the story, one that is
currently jumping off the canvass.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not a stretch:
</P>
<P>
   With a decent showing in Minnesota, the Cardinals will be
considered an outside shot to ``win'' the Super Bowl next season.
After all, they do have the eighth pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Nationally televised games. Invitations to Monday
Night Football. No more third-rate broadcasting crews. A new
stadium proposal not unlike Deion Sanders' toe, shot up with
cortizone, upgraded from doubtful to probable in the span of 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, in a hotel bar in Dallas, Plummer's mother
proudly wore her son's jersey. Other Cardinals fans wandered about
in conquest. And in the corners of the room, pockets of Cowboys
fans shriveled in their seats. The iron lungs of arrogance were
reduced to silence.
</P>
<P>
   While they were mute in Texas, the rest of the nation hailed the
conquering heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-eminent voice in Chicago told a half-million readers
that the wrong football team may have left town four decades ago. A
columnist in Dallas said when Troy Aikman shook Jake Plummer's hand
after the game, he may as well have passed a torch. And surely
there are directives from newspaper editors across the land,
messages to their troops in town for the Fiesta Bowl. Requests
that, while you're in town, can you please scoot over and give us
something on the Cardinals?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, something for all you Cowboys fans in the Valley: On
the front page of the ``Dallas Morning New''s' sports section,
these words shined, crafted from the alphabet of treason:
</P>
<P>
   ``Plummer and his Cardinals are the future of the NFC East.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the future is only a proposition, never a guarantee.
When the door finally shuts on this post-season, some weighty
issues need to be addressed. Miller's contract. The demands of Rob
Moore, who is looking for $4 million per season. The happiness of
Bob Ferguson, a man whose accomplishments cannot be understated or
undervalued. The future of Dave McGinnis, the defensive coordinator
about to enter an arena where demand exceeds supply.
</P>
<P>
   But the curtain remains closed on the stage of tomorrow, and it
should be. Because, after 11 years where ambivalence was the flip
side of scorn, after 11 years of empty seats and Broncos fans and
Steelers jerseys, the roots are taking hold.
</P>
<P>

CINDERELLA CARDS AWAIT NEXT DANCE  
 WILL MIDNIGHT CHIME IN MINNESOTA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not everyone is buying that the Cinderella Cardinals, the NFL's
touchy, feely story of the year, will continue to shock the world
as they march on in the NFC playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are 14{-point underdogs against the Minnesota
Vikings, owners of the NFL's best record at 15-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised,'' rookie cornerback Corey Chavous said.
``People probably don't think we can stop their offense. We take it
as a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin's team hasn't been a two-touchdown underdog
all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what they've done,'' said Tobin of the Vikings, who
meet the Cardinals next Sunday at the Metrodome in Minneapolis.
``It's pretty impressive. They've got all those weapons and a guy
(Gary Anderson) who hasn't missed a kick.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings lead the NFL in scoring (556), passing (270.5 yards
per game) and third-down efficiency (51.4 percent). They are second
in total offense (391.5 yards per game).
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Randall Cunningham is the NFL's leading passer.
Rookie wide receiver Randy Moss is second in touchdowns with 17.
Anderson is the top scorer, thanks to converting all 35 of his
field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings offensive coordinator Brian Billick acknowledges that he
enjoys using his weapons to give opponents fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a defensive coordinator, when he sits down and goes
back one game, two games, three games, to have the cumulative
effect of `Oh, my God. How do I handle this?' '' Billick told ``Pro
Football Weekly.'' ``I want multiple formations, multiple people. I
want it to look overwhelming to a defense.''
</P>
<P>
   So should the Cardinals, with a 20-7 upset of the NFC
East-champion Dallas Cowboys still on their minds, consider
canceling the trip?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in awe,'' Tobin said. ``We think we're capable of
beating everyone in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Cardinals can say they've beaten a team this season
with a winning record. They played their most complete game of the
season in knocking the Cowboys (10-7) out of the playoffs Saturday
at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Now they will try to win a fifth consecutive game for the first
time since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we played an awfully good football game,'' Tobin said.
``It's the first time all year our offense, defense and special
teams played (well) for 60 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings Coach Dennis Green was impressed. He expected to play
the winner of Sunday's Green Bay-San Francisco wild-card game but
said the Vikings spent as much time last week studying the
Cardinals as they did the Packers and 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had excellent balance,'' Green said of the Cardinals, who
passed for 213 yards and ran for 133. They ran the ball and
controlled the ball well, and their defense was excellent. Any time
you go on the road and win at Dallas in the playoffs, that says
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, no matter who you play, they're going to be
good. Look at how they played Dallas. Clearly, they handled Dallas.
They've got good talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have beaten the Cardinals the past two years,
including a 20-19 victory at Sun Devil Stadium a year ago, a game
in which the Cardinals blew a 10-point lead in the final five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Vikings scored 50 points against AFC
Central-champion Jacksonville. They also routed Green Bay twice
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get into a scoring contest up there,'' Tobin said.
``They have too many weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional edge should go to the Cardinals, who are coming
off the franchise's first playoff win in 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first one since emblems were put on helmets, which
happened in 1948, one year after the Chicago Cardinals won the NFL
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all well and good what we've accomplished, but our future
is this week in Minnesota,'' Tobin said. ``Still, I'm proud of
where this franchise is. I'm proud of the way this team now is
thought of around the league. That was a big part of my goals. I
wondered, `Why couldn't the Cardinals be a class organization other
people emulate?' It wasn't thought of that way back then. We've
gone a long way to change that.''

ONE KILLED, ONE LOST AS WAVES SINK CANOE

   OXNARD, Calif. -- An outrigger canoe carrying an experienced
six-man paddling team sank in heavy surf Sunday, killing one,
leaving one lost at sea and injuring four others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was totally a freak accident,'' said Michael Davis, 30,
one of the crew members rescued by a fishing boat after several
hours in the 56-degree water outside Channel Islands Harbor in
Southern California's Ventura County. ``We were very trained,
skilled at what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   John Devlin, 50, of Oxnard developed hypothermia and drowned.
Crew mate Scotty Sullenger, 36, who tried to swim ashore remained
missing, said officials with the Ventura County Sheriff's
Department. One crew member was in critical condition Sunday night
and another in guarded condition. Two others were treated at area
hospitals and released.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 13 years, the six men have gathered four days a
week to paddle their 40-foot Hawaiian-style outrigger canoe and to
rejuvenate their souls, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the team headed out of Channel Islands Harbor toward
an oil platform about 8 a.m. in shorts and T-shirts but no life
jackets. The waves were high, but the team had handled higher,
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile off the breakwater, waves 4 to 6 feet high slapped
water into the canoe, and the crew headed back to the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were already on our way back before we got hit by a couple
of good waves,'' Davis said. ``We took on water, and we sunk.''
</P>
<P>
   The canoeists detached the pontoon from the canoe and tried to
float to shore, but battled a strong wind that blew them farter
from shore, according to officials at the Ventura County Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Two crewmen swam for shore while four remained with the sinking
boat. Eventually the boat sank, and the four also took their
chances swimming, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hanging close to each other,'' he said. ``It was too
hard. We were just getting worked out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The men did not get very far because of the waves and the cold,
Davis said. They could see the shore and signaled for help, but to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a few boats in the beginning, but they were off to the
distance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis figured his one hope would be to return to the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think anyone was coming by,'' he said. ``I was
thinking about getting all my men to shore.''
</P>
<P>
   After the men spent a few hours in the chilly surf, hypothermia
began to set in. When Devlin died in the water, his three teammates
struggled to keep him afloat, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to hold him,'' Davis said. ``(Captain) Ben
Tai Tai held him in his arms for about 45 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, the fishing boat John Start came upon the
four men and helped them aboard. ``Everybody was just at different
stages of hypothermia,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Heard, 28, of Oxnard who had tried to swim to shore, was
rescued by the Channel Island Harbor Patrol two miles from shore.
He was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard where
he was listed in critical condition in the hospital's intensive
care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Tai Tai, 50, also of Oxnard, were treated for
hypothermia at Ventura County Medical Center and released.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 p.m., a civilian boat that was helping in the search
found crewman Tino Rico, 38. Rico was taken to St. John's Regional
Medical Center, where he was listed in guarded condition late
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The search for Sullenger was expected to continue until 1 a.m.
today and start again later this morning, said Dawn Butler, a petty
officer with the Search and Rescue Division of the U.S. Coast
Guard. Helicopters, boats and vehicles from the Harbor Patrol, the
Coast Guard and the state lifeguard station joined in the search on
land, on sea and in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll search until they've exhausted all possibility of the
person being alive,'' Butler said.

BRUSH FIRE BURNS HUNDREDS OF ACRES IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Adds detail, updates byline, revises number of acres
burned.) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN AND LEE CONDON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A massive brush fire scorched up to 600 acres of
dry hillsides above suburban Porter Ranch on Sunday, as winds up to
50 mph whipped 20-foot flames perilously close to homes.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which started about 11 a.m. in the city's San Fernando
Valley region about 25 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles,
spread west through the Santa Susana Mountains, creeping within
several yards of homes in the far north portion of Porter Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It burned from the top of the hill to the bottom in about 30
minutes,'' said resident Jerry Colburn, whose back yard abuts the
burn area. ``It kind of jumped around because there were embers
being blown around all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The arid, 78-degree air allowed winds of 35 mph to 50 mph to fan
the flames through brush parched by a season of low rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   While 400 to 600 acres burned, no injuries or structure damage
occurred, and the blaze was fully contained at 5 p.m. just east of
Winnetka, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian
Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   But residents spent several anxious hours Sunday afternoon
watching thick brown smoke rise off the charred hillside and
debating whether to leave or stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very worried,'' said Alex Henson, 46, whose home was also
on the front line of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here four years and this is the first time we've
had this kind of fire here,'' he said, watching bulldozers clear
dried grass as burning cinders stung his eyes. ``That's why I'm
trying to hang on as long as possible. If worst comes to worst, I
will have to take what I can and run.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 firefighters from the city Fire Department and the
Los Angeles and Ventura county fire departments attacked the blaze
on the ground, while five helicopters dropped water on the flames
or scouted out the fire's path, Los Angeles fire Capt. Tim McDonell
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the fire was reported, the Los Angeles Fire Department's
entire fleet of six helicopters was grounded for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, a department helicopter on a training mission
in the Santa Monica Mountains had a ``hard landing'' because of a
mechanical malfunction, Humphrey said. Under department policy all
helicopters in the fleet are inspected after such incidents,
grounding the fleet on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   One firefighter injured his ankle in the incident Saturday,
Humphrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our airships were out of service at the beginning of the fire.
But within the first half-hour our airships were cleared to fly,''
Humphrey said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident did not make a difference in terms of firefighting
because the Los Angeles County and Ventura County fire departments
sent a total of three helicopters to the fire at the request of the
city of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually three more Los Angeles city helicopters joined in the
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire Department did not order evacuations, but Henson and
other residents stood ready to flee if the flames flared out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a firebreak, and between that and the tile roofs the
fire couldn't get through,'' said Dan Rigney, 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the kind of thing where you get the baby pictures out
and you get things ready to go just in case,'' said his wife,
Jamie, also 45.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in nearby neighborhoods also prepared for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my pictures and clothes in the car,'' said Nenet
Kureghian. ``The deer and rabbits were escaping from the flames and
it became very hot in our house. But there were fire trucks parked
all over in front so I felt pretty safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, fire officials were concerned Sunday afternoon that
the fire was not controlled and still posed a potential threat to
nearby neighborhoods. Because of the steep terrain and high winds,
firefighters could not attack it head on, but fought along its
flanks, trying to reduce and contain it.
</P>
<P>
   As firefighters monitored the fire through the Santa Susana
hillsides, others were stationed in Brown's Canyon and in
neighborhoods below Highway 118 in case the fire took a turn
southward, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get engine companies at least an hour ahead of
the fire, instead of trying to chase it,'' McDonell said.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts were successful, and the department pronounced the
fire contained at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Abkian of Porter Ranch said the flames burned up to her
home, but added that she was confident firefighters would keep them
at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were worried, but those firefighters were right in front of
our house,'' she said. ``They told us that if there was any danger
they would protect us. We trusted them and didn't panic. Now we're
OK. They knew exactly where the fire was heading. Thank God for
them.''

NICK AT NIGHTFALL: NICK NOLTE WALKS THE DARK SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
NIRDI RELIS in New York at 212-499-3333, or by fax at
212-499-3382.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 Includes a color slide of Nick Nolte in a scene from ``The Thin Red
Line.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Nick Nolte takes an interminable drag on a cigarette, squints
his steely blue eyes and squirms, either stalling or at a loss for
words.
 &HT;    The question: What exactly does he do for a living?
 &HT;    ``I'd like to think I'm reflecting some sort of truth,'' he says
finally, exhaling a prodigious plume of smoke that fills a room at
Manhattan's Essex House. ``As an actor you're exposing life's
facades.
 &HT;    ``Acting, it's my marijuana,'' he says. ``It's what scrambles my
brain enough that I get to see past what I'd be so frightened to do
in real life, because real life is full of anxiety, greed and
power.
 &HT;    ``Reflecting all of that is my life.''
 &HT;    A bear of a man with a craggy face and a mad-scientist shock of
salt-and-pepper hair, Nolte has abandoned his usual attire of
pajamas in favor of a gray suit and a tie. He's talking about life,
but he might as well be talking about his latest films, ``The Thin
Red Line'' and ``Affliction,'' two dark dramas now in limited
release.
 &HT;    The former, reclusive director Terrence Malick's first film in
20 years, is based on James Jones' World War II novel, set in the
Pacific theater. Nolte plays Lt. Col. Gordon Tall, a bellowing
battalion commander who, in quest of personal glory, intends to
take a crucial hill on Guadalcanal at any cost, over the objections
of his loyal junior officer (John Cusack) and Capt. Staros (Elias
Koteas).
 &HT;    ``Our favorite phrase for the character was `self-will run
riot,''' Nolte says. ``Terry and I built him as caught between
World War I and World War II. He didn't get time on the firing
line, and most of the men who enlisted at that time were drunks,
homeless people who didn't have anyplace else to go.
 &HT;    ``So this guy's experience was he's a West Point grad training
drunks, going from fort to fort,'' he says. ``There's no war for
him, and he's getting old. And boom! Here's World War II, and now
is his chance.
 &HT;    ``There's the objective, and underneath that is the selfish
reason. Staros is the humanity, the compassion, and the real
question is, does compassion have any place in war?''
 &HT;    ``Thin Red Line'' has gotten tremendous attention as much for
Malick as for the movie itself. And Nolte reports that the director
lived up to his reputation.
 &HT;    ``It's not like he's eccentric or anything, but Terry's mind is
extremely wide,'' Nolte says. ``He can talk about Homer, birds,
history, and you're a little in awe of it.
 &HT;    ``He'd hand me a couple of pages to read,'' the actor recalls,
``and they'd be in Latin. He'd give me poetry and I'd say, `Jesus,
that's wonderful.' He'd say, `That's Homer. Maybe tomorrow you
could look up into the sky and say this.'
 &HT;    ``He'd write long scenes and say, `Edit it down. Find the core
in there.'''
 &HT;    Nolte's other film, ``Affliction,'' is even darker _
understandably, since it's based on a novel by Russell Banks,
author of last year's depressing ``The Sweet Hereafter.''
 &HT;    He plays Wade Whitehouse, a dreamer from a bleak small town who
has family troubles galore: His father (James Coburn) is a brutal
drunk, his brother (Willem Dafoe) long ago fled to the big city and
his daughter (Brigid Tierney) would rather be with his ex-wife
(Mary Beth Hurt). Through in his rapidly unraveling job as a cop,
and even by Banks' standards it's a dark, sad story with precious
few rays of hope.
 &HT;    When director Paul Schrader first approached Nolte several years
ago, the actor turned down the role.
 &HT;    ``I didn't feel mature enough,'' he says. ``I didn't have a
strong enough understanding of my own personal rage and violence in
general to get to the archetype.
 &HT;    ``I could understand alcoholism or being beaten by my father,''
he says. ``Those are easy. I could understand the cultural
standpoint, that we live in a competitive society and that breeds
violence. But I didn't understand the archetype and I didn't
understand the energy of it connected to nature, of why we're
violent and have been for thousands of years.''
 &HT;    There are a lot of violent movies, but few that try to
understand their violence. Three years later, Nolte felt ready to
try.
 &HT;    ``We can reach a certain level of rage that we needed at one
time to survive as a species,'' he says. ``When we socialized, it
became arcane, but that rage is innate and it's still within all of
us ...
 &HT;    ``Once I understood that,'' he concludes, ``I understood that I
am the killer, that I'm capable of killing, that we're all capable
of it. Then I could say to Paul, `I'm ready.'''
 &HT;    Finally released three years after it was shot, ``Affliction''
has garnered positive reviews and talk of Oscar nominations for
Nolte and Coburn.
 &HT;    Nolte couldn't care less about statuettes, he says, but hopes
that the buzz will encourage people to see the hard-to-promote
film.
 &HT;    ``I want audiences to experience it, to experience a catharsis _
not an intellectual catharsis, but an emotional one,'' he says.
``The depth of emotion is part of what's at the bottom of
`Affliction.'
 &HT;    ``Every man and woman has this rage underneath,'' the actor
continues, ``and the denial of that side of us causes us to become
tremendously violent toward one another ... That's how we kill in
the name of righteousness.
 &HT;    ``If you realize that you're the killer, you at least have to
think about what you're doing,'' he concludes. ``That's a
disturbing feeling to get from a movie, and it'll stay with you.''
 &HT;    Incredibly, Nolte will turn 58 in February. He's been a star
since the 1976 television miniseries ``Rich Man, Poor Man,'' and
has established himself as that rarity, a box-office draw who's
also one of his generation's most respected actors.
 &HT;    It didn't come easily, says Nolte, who's gone through several
divorces and fought to kick alcohol and drug abuse.
 &HT;    ``I was 35 when I came out to Hollywood,'' he recalls, ``and I
thought I was mature enough to handle it.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't,'' he says. ``You begin to think you can do no wrong.
Your ego is fed to such a degree that you lose your grounding. It's
very painful and confusing, and you turn to booze and drugs to
escape.
 &HT;    ``You become successful and think you have to repeat it,'' the
actor says. ``It's a frightening, frightening experience.''
 &HT;    Right now, Nolte considers himself a happy guy. He's dating
``NewsRadio's'' Vicki Lewis and has several films on tap, among
them Albert Brooks' ``Muse'' and an adaptation of the Sam Shepard
play ``Simpatico,'' which will co-star Sharon Stone, Jeff Bridges
and Albert Finney. Also in the works are ``Breakfast of
Champions,'' with Bruce Willis, and a number of projects Nolte
intends to produce through his own company, Kingsgate Films.
 &HT;    ``I'm enjoying myself now more than ever,'' Nolte says. ``I've
done the whole journey that can happen to an actor, experienced the
ebbs, spikes, money and adulation.
 &HT;    ``I've dabbled in all that, and I've let it go and returned to a
point I was at when I was doing theater,'' he says. ``I'm only
doing that which I really love, and I'm only going by the
screenplay.
 &HT;    ``I've realized a great director can't overcome a bad script,
that great actors can't overcome a bad script,'' the actor says.
``So I now go strictly by the script.
 &HT;    ``Hollywood still approaches me with big films,'' Nolte adds,
``but the scripts are sh-t. `Thin Red Line' was an exception.
Really, I'd rather make small films that say something, that mean
something, than big films with no heart, that are empty and say
nothing.''

KEVIN SPACEY: AN ACTOR'S ACTOR ON THE ACT OF ACTING

 Includes a color slide of Kevin Spacey in a scene from
``Hurlyburly.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Some actors see Marlon Brando as their greatest inspiration. For
older actors, perhaps Laurence Olivier. For younger ones, maybe Al
Pacino.
 &HT;    But not Kevin Spacey, the Academy Award winner who is this
decade's leading candidate for ``actor's actor.'' His choice is ...
Bugs Bunny?
 &HT;    ``I'm a Saturday-morning-cartoon kid,'' the 39-year-old Spacey
says. ``I'm a Bugs Bunny kind of guy. He gets away with everything.
He tweaks authority. People know they can never really get mad at
him.''
 &HT;    That's different. But then, so is Spacey, who took home the 1995
Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ``The Usual Suspects.'' His flair
for the offbeat, and his remarkable range, are on display in two
offerings on neighborhood screens this holiday season:
``Hurlyburly,'' the hard-hitting adaptation of the David Rabe play,
and the animated crowd-pleaser ``A Bug's Life,'' in which he voices
Hopper, the villainous, marauding grasshopper.
 &HT;    The two parts couldn't be more different, which is exactly what
appeals to Spacey.
 &HT;    ``I'm not one of those actors who aspires to be a movie star in
the sense that I will always show up on screen playing myself,''
Spacey says by telephone from his Los Angeles home.
 &HT;    ``Hey,'' he adds with a laugh, ``I'm not knocking being a movie
star. It's not necessarily a bad job for some people.
 &HT;    ``To me it's not about the money and generating this level of
fame,'' he says. ``It's not about publicity. If it was, my career
would be a lot easier, because then I could just show up in every
movie and do the same thing with my eyes closed. That's exactly
what I don't ever want to do.
 &HT;    ``I never want to hear someone say, `What happened to Kevin
Spacey? Remember that guy? A few years ago he was really
interesting. We expected big things from him.'''
 &HT;    In ``Hurlyburly,'' Spacey plays a sleazy casting agent, complete
with platinum-blonde hair and a side line in cocaine. It's a film
he's long wanted to make, having understudied all the male roles
when Mike Nichols directed the play on Broadway.
 &HT;    ``It's a fantastic actor's piece and very funny,'' he says.
``It's one of those pieces where you sit down and say, `You're
doing this, no matter what.'''
 &HT;    In John Lasseter's ``A Bug's Life,'' his character is just as
creepy, but in another sense. Spacey enjoyed playing the
over-the-top Hopper, he says, because he'd always wanted to do an
animated project.
 &HT;    ``I met John Lasseter at the Student Academy Awards,'' he
recalls. ``We were both presenting, and we got into this great
conversation. I had admired his `Toy Story' (1996) so much.
Finally, John said, `Well, would you ever do an animated film?' I
said, `Why don't you ask me?'''
 &HT;    The director sent Spacey a test animation of Hopper to give him
an idea of the character. The voice was a familiar one.
 &HT;    ``He sent me Lee J. Cobb in `On the Waterfront' (1954), and
animated him doing the lines. It was hysterical,'' Spacey says.
``What cracked me up was that they had this little grasshopper
swearing.''
 &HT;    The actual work of doing voice characterizations is notoriously
dreary, and Spacey reports that recording Hopper took two years of
on-and-off work.
 &HT;    ``You just go into this room and play with your voice,'' he
says. ``They videotape you doing it and send that to the animators.
It helps them use your own gestures and facial tics to infuse the
characters.''
 &HT;    His fans will have a tough time discerning Spacey's features in
the rugged Hopper doll, however. Unlike the recent Dreamworks film
``Antz,'' the animators made no effort to have the characters look
like the actors voicing them.
 &HT;    Not that Spacey minds.
 &HT;    ``Oh, I have an action figure?'' the actor says. ``I must admit
I haven't seen a thing yet.
 &HT;    ``Hey, Christmas gifts for all my friends _ I'm done!''
 &HT;    Actually, Spacey is far from done, though he's a long way from
South Orange, N.J., where he started out. He did his first acting
at Los Angeles Valley College, then moved to New York, where he
studied at the prestigious Juilliard School and began to make a
name for himself in the theater. He won a Best Actor Tony Award for
Neil Simon's ``Lost in Yonkers'' (1991).
 &HT;    By that time he'd already made his small-screen debut in a 1988
multi-episode segment of the series ``Wiseguy'' and his film debut
in ``Heartburn'' (1986), but plum roles proved elusive.
 &HT;    ``I went through a number of tough years, but most people do,''
he says. ``That's what they call paying your dues. Mine are paid in
full.''
 &HT;    His filmography includes roles as a nasty agent in ``Swimming
With Sharks'' (1995), the psycho killer who beheads Gwyneth Paltrow
in ``Seven'' (1996), a gung-ho prosecutor in ``A Time to Kill''
(1996), a gay Southern gentleman in ``Midnight in the Garden of
Good and Evil'' (1997) and a smart cop with a gift for gab in ``The
Negotiator'' (1998).
 &HT;    But it's his ``Usual Suspects'' turn as a petty crook who just
might be the mysterious Keyzer Soze that got Spacey his turn in the
spotlight, not to mention his Oscar.
 &HT;    ``My mother told me later that she had three consecutive dreams
that I was going to win an Oscar,'' Spacey recalls.
 &HT;    It's a good thing she didn't tell him, because he was nervous
enough already. When his name was announced, he says, he almost
passed out.
 &HT;    ``I began to hyperventilate,'' Spacey says, laughing.
``Backstage, I began to realize, `You've just won an Oscar. You've
just spoken to 1 billion people. You don't even know what language
you were speaking in because you were so nervous!'''
 &HT;    Some Oscar winners rush to cash in, grabbing handfuls of the
higher-profile projects that come the winners' way. Spacey, on the
other hand, has been cautious in plotting his next moves.
 &HT;    In other words, don't expect to see him in ``Armageddon II'' or
``Zorro III.''
 &HT;    ``I don't want to do a big studio movie where the audience walks
out going, `What was he doing in this mess?''' Spacey says.
 &HT;    And while an Oscar may draw bigger paychecks, he reports, it
doesn't necessarily attract better scripts.
 &HT;    ``I do think the Oscar has an impact on what you're offered,
money-wise,'' he says. ``It's the nature of the beast, and I'm not
complaining about it. But the scripts are just as bad as before I
won. There's just more of them.''
 &HT;    Spacey will soon return to Broadway in Eugene O'Neill's ``The
Iceman Cometh.'' He will also co-star with Annette Bening in
``American Beauty,'' a film which he describes as being about ``a
married couple going through a difficult phase.''
 &HT;    In the meantime, he recently finished ``Ordinary Decent
Criminals,'' an Irish gangster saga co-starring Linda Fiorentino.
 &HT;    ``It's not shades of `The Godfather,''' Spacey says. ``The
character I play is actually more like Bugs Bunny _ no one can
catch up with him.''
 &HT;    Bugs Bunny as an Irish gangster?
 &HT;    Spacey laughs, but refuses to divulge anything more about the
film.
 &HT;    ``Look, I'm just plodding along, trying to keep my head above
water and do the things that I love to do,'' the actor says. ``My
goal is to be honest to myself, my friends and my family.
 &HT;    ``As far as I'm concerned, I've had a pretty great couple of
years. It just keeps getting better,'' Spacey says. ``I'm really
careful, because the law of averages are that I'm due to get hit by
a bus any day.
 &HT;    ``Just like Hopper, I could be squashed at any moment.''

 Includes a color slide of country singer Clint Black. 
 By JANET E. WILLIAMS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Who says you can't have it all?
 &HT;    Well, maybe you can't, but Clint Black just might be able to:
best-selling records, a beautiful actress wife, a couple of
shelves' worth of awards ... in only 10 years, since his 1989 debut
album, ``Killin' Time,'' the talented Texan has managed to realize
most of his dreams.
 &HT;    But to sit down in his Nashville office for a conversation with
Black is to realize one more thing, something more impressive than
all the best-selling records combined: Superstar or no, the
singer/songwriter is singularly unchanged by his success. He came
to stardom as a down-to-earth country boy, and to a remarkable
extent that's what he still is.
 &HT;    Black's latest album, ``Nothin' but the Taillights'' (1998),
represents both more of the same and a glance down new paths.
Several of its tracks are co-written with his longtime friend and
writing partner Hayden Nicholas, but a number of the others were
written with fresh collaborators, including such Nashville
mainstays as Marty Stuart, Matraca Berg, Skip Ewing, Steve Wariner
and Kostas.
 &HT;    ``A lot of these guys I'd been wanting to write with all along,
but life gets in the way,'' Black says. ``I'd get so busy that,
whenever I would finally block out two weeks to write, I would go
with the thing that I knew worked, which was Hayden and me. If we
spend a week, I know we can get three to five songs that we love.
 &HT;    ``So it wasn't until I got off the road that I finally started
calling up some of these feelers that I'd put out there years and
years ago,'' he recalls. ``Steve Wariner and I had talked about
writing together like four years ago. Kostas and I had been meaning
to do it for three years. He's in L.A. and I'm not, I'm in
Nashville and he's in Montana, and so we never caught up to each
other.''
 &HT;    Given Black's success, both in critics' eyes and in record
stores nationwide, it would be understandable if he resisted
tampering with his formula. But he insists that ``Nothin' but the
Taillights'' is a natural step in his artistic evolution.
 &HT;    ``I always want to get better,'' he says. ``I've applied myself
to the guitar more now. And I know I'm growing as a musician, as an
engineer ... I have my home studio, and when I'm composing I'm
playing the drums, the bass, the acoustic guitar, the electric
guitar and I sing the lead, and I'll either get my wife or one of
the guys in the band to come over, and we'll do all the background
parts. Just by doing that, I've become more intimate with the song.
I know I'm growing there, and that helps me when I'm writing,
because I see more opportunities on the guitar and melodies open
up.
 &HT;    ``My main intent has always been `Don't write the same song
twice,''' he adds. ``The music that people are making here today,
it influences me ... What's happening on the radio has inspired me
to take chances that I wouldn't have otherwise taken. It's really
all just about trying to write a new song.''
 &HT;    Like most country singers, Black can really dig into a ballad of
loneliness and depression. Offstage, however, he radiates relaxed
contentment.
 &HT;    ``I am generally happy,'' he says. ``One of the things that I
vowed was that I'm going to have a good time, enjoy everything I
can _ even when I make mistakes, I'm going to have fun. I try to
remember that. And I don't always, but for the most part, I'm
blessed, so I'd better look like I'm having a good time even if I'm
not.''
 &HT;    To complain about his own problems, given the degree of his
success, would be downright sinful, the singer adds.
 &HT;    ``With the problems that a lot of people have out there, how
would that look?'' he says. ``How would that make people feel who
are really going through hard times? Just because it's a crazy life
is no reason to be bellyaching. Because everybody has a crazy
life.''
 &HT;    Some of that craziness stems from his seven-year marriage to
actress Lisa Hartman Black, and the complexities of maintaining a
relationship with outposts in Nashville and in Hollywood. But the
singer insists that the two are ``the best of friends,'' and that
their relationship isn't really as unlikely as it seems.
 &HT;    ``If you look at who she is,'' he says, ``she's from Houston,
Texas, she's as country as it gets. She is just the sweetest person
that I know, the most grounded and the best communicator that I
know. That's really what it's all about.
 &HT;    ``We fell in love really quickly, got married very quickly, like
10 months,'' he recalls. ``But we're two people who were old enough
to understand what we were committing to. Never been married
before, either of us, and we really understood what we were
offering and what we were giving.
 &HT;    ``We understood each other well enough to know that whatever
would overcome one of us, the two of us would overcome together.''
 &HT;    With homes in Los Angeles, Houston and Nashville, the two are as
likely to be found relaxing in blue jeans as dressed up in formal
wear for a film premiere.
 &HT;    ``I love Hollywood, I love the movies and all that stuff,''
Black says, ``but she loves her time in Nashville. You see her
running around Nashville, she wears cowboy boots more than I do.
She's about as down-to-earth as it gets. You really couldn't find
anybody more country, in that sense of the word.
 &HT;    ``I can go on about it all day,'' the singer says, laughing.
``She's a solid person. She gives me the strength to relax. There's
no question we're closer today, we understand each other better
today.
 &HT;    ``There's a song Steve and I wrote called `You Know It All' that
goes, `When it comes to me, you know it all,''' Black adds.
 &HT;    ``That's how it works with us, because otherwise the
communication's gone.''

 Includes a color slide of Doris Roberts with Ray Romano in a scene
from ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television executives don't seem to be a particularly bright
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, how little they learned from ``The Golden
Girls'' and ``Murder She Wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1984 and 1996, those two shows spent a collective 18
seasons at the top of the Neilsen ratings, proving that veteran
female performers such as Bea Arthur, Betty White and Angela
Lansbury could attract millions of fans _ and, incidentally, earn
millions of dollars for their respective networks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the formulaic world of prime-time programming, where
successful concepts are usually cloned faster than Scottish sheep,
there's still little room for older actresses. Scan the cast lists
of this season's top 20 hits and you'll find only two women who
have celebrated their 50th birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   Both, as one might expect, appear on CBS, a network which has
long been the butt of industry jokes about its penchant for
creating shows that appeal to older viewers. One is ``Touched By An
Angel's'' Della Reese, and the other is ``Everybody Loves
Raymond's'' meddling matriarch, Doris Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of mature actresses was put in perspective for
Roberts recently by her show's producer, Phil Rosenthal, in a
speech at New York's Museum of Television and Radio after
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' received an award from the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the presentation,'' she recalls, ``Phil Rosenthal told
the audience that over 100 women went up for the part of Marie
Ramone. One hundred! And as soon as he said that, I realized that
most of them are my friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``That same week, I was a guest on David Letterman's show,'' the
actress adds, ``and he asked if I'd ever had a hard time. `Hard
time?' There was a 10-year career break when I couldn't get
arrested!
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember once when someone called my agent and said, `I'd
like to book Doris Roberts for a two-day shoot,''' she recalls.
``He said, `Well, I'm sorry, she's not available.' And they said,
`Why not?' My agent explained that I was working, and this person
responded, `Doris Roberts is working!?!''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her frustration with Hollywood's unflagging
discrimination against older actors in general and older women in
particular, the 68-year-old Emmy winner has managed to find a home
in one of television's smartest comedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is the writing on `Everybody Loves Raymond' superb,''
Roberts says, ``the whole atmosphere is refreshing. I have to give
the credit to one man, Phil Rosenthal, who has set the tone for
everyone. It's fabulous. It's a joy to come to work in the morning
_ there are no sick personalities to deal with. We come in prepared
to work, and then we go home and have a life. That's very
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more unusual, Roberts says, is the professional support
that is the norm on the ``Raymond'' set.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one on this show is trying to grab the spotlight,'' she
says almost disbelievingly. ``No one's trying to score an
individual touchdown. It's the best ensemble I've ever worked with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do something that I've never heard of on any other
series,'' she adds. ``If the script is difficult for any one of us,
we all get together on Saturday with the dialogue coach to
rehearse. There's no overtime, no extra money _ nobody cares about
that. We simply do it until we get it right and everybody is
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   In shaping the role of Marie Barone, mother of series star
Raymond (Ray Romano), Roberts says that her biggest challenge is to
tread the fine line between funny and obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason `Everybody Loves Raymond' is successful,'' she
says, ``is that it's based on reality. It's not shtick, not forced
laughter. The humor comes from situations that are very
identifiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``With regard to Marie, it all comes through her innocence,''
she continues. ``She's not a woman who is educated. She was never
taught to do anything but be a mother and a housekeeper and a wife,
and that's what she's done. If she was savvy enough to realize how
intrusive and what a pain in the neck she is, that would make her
quite unpleasant. But everything I do on the set is done through
love.''
</P>
<P>
   That viewers are picking up what she is trying to do was brought
home to Roberts in October, when she won an award from Viewers for
Quality Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they do when they present the award,'' she says, ``is
tell you the comments of the people who voted. For me, the most
important thing was that they said, `The sense of humanity that
comes from you is overwhelming.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I thought, `Perfect. They've gotten what I'm after.'''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the show, Roberts' main interest is the Children
Affected by AIDS Foundation, which she has chaired for the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raise money for organizations who feed, house and clothe
children affected by AIDS,'' she says. ``We're the only
organization that does that. It's hard work, but it's worth it
because we've already raised over $900,000.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, since the 1983 death from leukemia of her husband,
novelist William Goyen, Roberts has worked tirelessly to raise
funds for research into the disease. She's also become an advocate
for her husband's writings, which she considers world-caliber.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in 1987, after her long-running series ``Remington
Steele'' had been canceled, Roberts launched a cross-country tour
to promote her husband's posthumously published collection of short
stories, ``Had I A Hundred Mouths.'' It was more important than her
own work, she told one interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an imitator, an interpretive artist,'' she said then.
``William was a creative one. My show has just been canceled, but
his art will continue. In 100 years no one will know what
`Remington Steele' was, but they'll still be reading his book.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconsidering that remark 15 years later, Roberts has to back
off a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at the time I really believed that,'' she says.
``Every time I read my husband's work, I felt such awe and
reverence for him that Doris Roberts the actress was sort of
subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``But recently I read from one of his stories at the opening of
the Getty Museum Theatre,'' she recalls. ``We had to add almost
five minutes to the piece because of the audience's laughter and
response. That's when I realized that, of course, I am much more
than just an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finally coming to terms with that,'' she says, laughing,
``which is great. Thank God it happened before I really get too
old!''

STORM WARNING: THE COMING CRIME WAVE IS WASHED UP

 By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, when a small but influential group of criminologists
and politicians began fixing their gaze on the end of the 20th
century, they saw a crime storm on the horizon, one teeming with a
new breed of superpredators who would soon be reaching their teens.
</P>
<P>
   According to their forecasts, the storm should have hit by now.
Instead, the sky has been clearing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the rate of homicides committed by 14- to
17-year-olds, which leapt from 10 per 100,000 in 1985 to 30.2 in
1993, has gone down every year since, to 16.5 in 1997, said James
Alan Fox, dean of the college of criminal justice at Northeastern
University.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, statistics released by the Justice Department last
week indicated that robberies by offenders of all ages fell a
staggering 17 percent in 1997, continuing the seven-year drop in
violent crime that followed the crime surge of the 1980s. That
drop, criminologists say, is being driven by the falloff in the
crack market and by concerted efforts by police departments across
the country to seize handguns from juveniles, among other causes.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not exactly what Fox _ along with James Q. Wilson of
UCLA, John DiIulio of Princeton University, and Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., the chairman of the House subcommittee on crime _ foresaw
in their crystal balls several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995, for example, DiIulio, a professor of politics
and public affairs, suggested that a dip in crime, already
perceptible then, was ``the lull before the crime storm.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that was the case, said Franklin Zimring, a professor of
law at the University of California at Berkeley, who was skeptical
of such forecasts, ``We should have our umbrellas open right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who doesn't recall using a weather analogy but did
firmly predict rising youth crime, is more blunt than Zimring.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it clearly hasn't happened,'' he said. ``This is a
good indication of what little all of us know about criminology.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the pessimistic predictions was a historical
fact: teen-agers commit a lot of crimes. Therefore, it seemed to
follow, more teen-agers would mean more crime.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not too late for the doomsday prognostications to
come true, given that they were projected from now through 2010 and
beyond, it's worth examining why they have not held so far.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most exaggerated factor underpinning the anticipated
youth crime wave has been demographics. In January 1996, the
Council on Crime in America, an organization of prosecutors and
law-enforcement experts, issued a report compiled by DiIulio
describing violent crime as a ``ticking time bomb'' that would go
off as the number of teen-agers soared in the coming few years.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimring contends that too much has been made of the
anticipated boom in the adolescent population. Consider that the
number of Americans aged 14 to 24 is expected to grow bout one
percent a year from 1995 to 2010 _ from 40.1 million to almost 47
million _ a total increase of about 16 percent. By comparison, the
growth in adolescents during the baby boom, from 1960 to 1975, was
50 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the correlation between increases in the juvenile
population and a rise in violent crime has been regarded as
conventional wisdom, the link has hardly proven strong in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   During the five years that the homicide rate among teen-age
offenders has been falling, the population of adolescents has
already begun to rise. And when the homicide rate among adolescents
was spiking in the early 1990s, the adolescent population was flat.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, a professor emeritus in the school of management at UCLA
who has written extensively about crime, now says that in
foreseeing a youth crime wave, he may have focused too much on
population increases at the expense of intangibles like ``the
perception of young people about the costs and benefits of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Though rates of violent crime have been influenced by a host of
more quantifiable factors _ the availability of guns, the growth in
the economy, the expansion of crime-prevention programs _ Zimring
says he is uncomfortable with trying to predict the criminal
potential of someone who may be just a toddler now, if born at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been weird has been this single focus: we're only
interested in kids four years old now and how many kids they're
going to shoot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Snyder, director of systems research for the National
Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh, a longtime skeptic about
the predicted crime wave, thinks many people, especially
politicians, have an incentive to be pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People naturally have this pessimism about what's going to
happen, especially with kids,'' he said. ``If you predict the
future's going to be terrible, you're in a win-win situation. If it
does happen, you were right. If it doesn't, your raising the flag
of concern helped turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the gloomy oratory has already ``changed the nature of
juvenile justice,'' by enabling many states to pass laws that make
it easier to try and imprison youthful offenders as adults.
</P>
<P>
   DiIulio, one of the most vocal prophets of the coming storm, did
not return telephone calls last week. But Fox, whose analysis
DiIulio has cited, says that a number of signs remain ominous.
</P>
<P>
   He projects, for example, that growth in the population of black
males _ those 14 to 17 years old, as well as to 18 to 24 _ will
grow at a steeper rate than their white male counterparts during
the first two decades of the 21st century. And if history holds, he
said, young blacks will be responsible for a disproportionate share
of violent crimes when compared with whites.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests further that the rate of homicides committed by
youths 14 to 17 years old _ 16.5 per 100,000 in 1997 _ while nearly
half of what it was in 1993, remains nearly double the 20-year low
of 8.5 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that Fox continues to see bad weather on the
horizon, as he did so clearly three years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``We may indeed see a resurgence in youth violence,'' Fox said.
``I say `may.' I didn't say `will.'''

who has written extensively about crime, now says that in
foreseeing a youth crime wave, he may have focused too much on
population increases at the expense of intangibles like ``the
perception of young people about the costs and benefits of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Though rates of violent crime have been influenced by a host of
more quantifiable factors _ the availability of guns, the growth in
the economy, the expansion of crime-prevention programs _ Zimring
says he is uncomfortable with trying to predict the criminal
potential of someone who may be just a toddler now, if born at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been weird has been this single focus: we're only
interested in kids four years old now and how many kids they're
going to shoot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Snyder, director of systems research for the National
Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh, a longtime skeptic about
the predicted crime wave, thinks many people, especially
politicians, have an incentive to be pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People naturally have this pessimism about what's going to
happen, especially with kids,'' he said. ``If you predict the
future's going to be terrible, you're in a win-win situation. If it
does happen, you were right. If it doesn't, your raising the flag
of concern helped turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the gloomy oratory has already ``changed the nature of
juvenile justice,'' by enabling many states to pass laws that make
it easier to try and imprison youthful offenders as adults.
</P>
<P>
   DiIulio, one of the most vocal prophets of the coming storm, did
not return telephone calls last week. But Fox, whose analysis
DiIulio has cited, says that a number of signs remain ominous.
</P>
<P>
   He projects, for example, that growth in the population of black
males _ those 14 to 17 years old, as well as to 18 to 24 _ will
grow at a steeper rate than their white male counterparts during
the first two decades of the 21st century. And if history holds, he
said, young blacks will be responsible for a disproportionate share
of violent crimes when compared with whites.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests further that the rate of homicides committed by
youths 14 to 17 years old _ 16.5 per 100,000 in 1997 _ while nearly
half of what it was in 1993, remains nearly double the 20-year low
of 8.5 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that Fox continues to see bad weather on the
horizon, as he did so clearly three years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``We may indeed see a resurgence in youth violence,'' Fox said.
``I say `may.' I didn't say `will.'''

FLIGHT ATTENDANTS COULD MAKE SKIES MUCH FRIENDLIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A young adult who lives in my house when she's not matriculating
(or whatever) at an institution of higher education had flown to
the East Coast for part of the recent holiday and was due back on a
Saturday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But on the day of her expected arrival she called to say that
the airline, plagued at the time by labor disputes (for which I
even-handedly blame everyone involved plus a few who had nothing to
do with it), had canceled her flight home. She hoped, she said, to
return the next day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She did. But her luggage did not arrive with her. Which is when
I remembered that I was a little out of sorts with the Association
of Flight Attendants, billed as the world's largest flight
attendants' union. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, the flight attendants had nothing to do with any lost
luggage in my family. At least not that I know of. But their union
announced recently that it wants the government to regulate
carry-on luggage. Each year, the union says, some 4,000 passengers
and crew members are injured by bags and objects that fall from
overhead bins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All that may be true. Airline rules vary on this subject. And
enforcement of those rules varies even more. Beyond that, many
airline passengers are nincompoops who place such things as loose
bowling balls in overhead bins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, OK. They flight attendants have a point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if passengers are to lose some of the carry-on privileges
they now enjoy, some compromise must be reached. There are, after
all, things that flight attendants do _ or perhaps must do, to
conform with government regulations _ that are simply beyond what
any passenger should put up with. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, as we approach 2000, several decades after auto
makers were required to install seat belts, is there a sane
American above the age of three who does not know how to click a
belt shut or to reopen it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do flight attendants on each flight have to stand in the aisles
before takeoff and demonstrate something even numskulls who can't
set the timer on their VCRs can do blindfolded? And, worse than
that, must they also explain what they are doing over the fuzzy and
annoying public address system? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Something like rocket science may be required to get a passenger
jet airborne, but it isn't needed to operate a seat belt. If
something must be said, wouldn't this suffice: ``Folks, you know
the seat belt rules''? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hold on. I'm not done. If we'll have to limit our carry-on bags
beyond the current rules, let's also forbid flight attendants on
non-meal flights from rolling those stupid beverage carts down the
middle of the aisle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone on board wants a drink. Not everyone wants to be
interviewed by a flight attendant to determine what sort of drink
is desired. Why not just announce that anyone who wants a drink can
turn on the call button? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The amazing result of this sane change would be to let people do
something far more important than taking in liquid. Passengers
could actually get to the bathroom, if needed, or, having made that
trip, return to their seats unimpeded by those cursed beverage
carts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under my scheme, all the flight attendants would have to do is
jot down a few drink orders and go to the kitchen bay (or whatever
it's called) to fill them. Those carts could be melted into
plowshares. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm all for the safety of airline employees. Our carry-on
luggage should not endanger them. But neither should we have to
attend their Seat Belt School for Dummies or be blocked from
responding to nature's call. OK. I'm done. Please return your tray
table to its full upright and locked position and remain seated
until this column has come to a complete stop at the gate. &QL;

SOMETIMES BEING FORGETFUL HAS ITS REWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If 1999 turns out anything like 1998 (a clue is they've both
begun with January), there will be lots you'll want to forget a
year from now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My advice: Don't stimulate your vagus nerve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If, like me until recently, you have no idea you even had a
vagus nerve and, thus, wouldn't know where to find it to protect it
from stimulation, it's time for a short anatomy lesson. (Do you
suppose that's what Bill Clinton said to Monica Lewinsky their
first time together? Let's not go there.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The vagus nerve is sometimes called the 10th cranial nerve. It
runs from the brain through the face and thorax all the way down to
your abdomen. Or, looking at it from an abdomen-centric point of
view, it runs from the abdomen to your brain. Which makes it both
long and complex, which this column, despite my best efforts, is
also starting to be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the vagus nerve, if you ask me, is that
scientists now think it has something to do with memory and that
(because it's pronounced VAY-gus) it brings to mind the word vague,
which often is a perfect description of my own memory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I can remember a lot of old and useless stuff. For instance,
I can tell you who made the final out of the 1954 Giants-Indians
World Series (the mortal Dale Mitchell on a pop-up to third baseman
Hank Thompson). I can tell you my family's phone number when I was
a child (just plain 893). And I remember that Jan. 3 is the
anniversary of the birth of Grace Anna Goodhue Coolidge, wife of
Silent Calvin Coolidge. (Why would a family name a kid Silent?
Weird.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as I have explained to some of you before, my short-term
memory, were it a car, would be recalled for more than one defect.
In fact, I usually need a grocery list just for bread. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently there is help for people like me. (Even if, in a
technical sense, there are no people like me.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the January issue of the journal ``Nature Neuroscience'' _
which you'll usually find on drug store magazine stands between
``Naughty North Dakotans Weekly'' and ``Vector Analysis Digest'' _
scientists report that memory can be improved by stimulating the
vagus nerve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They had been looking at people involved in a study that was
trying to see whether implanting a vagus-stimulating device (not
unlike a pacemaker for the heart) could suppress epileptic
seizures. Federal regulators, in fact, approved the device for just
that purpose in 1997. (You may know the device by a trade name, the
NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis System. But I'm guessing not.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The memory study showed that people whose vagus nerve was
stimulated improved their score on a memory test by 36 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be benefits to remembering 36 percent more stuff than
I do now, but I'm imagining the drawbacks. What good would it do,
for instance, if I could tell you (or anyone who cared) what I had
for lunch a week ago Thursday? Would this be either a small step
for man or a giant leap for mankind? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the light bulb just outside the back door of my house needs
changing again, will it be useful for me to be able to say, ``This
isn't right. I just changed this on Sept. 21''? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What worries me is that with a 36 percent improvement in my
memory, I'd simply follow my current pattern and remember more
useless stuff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, if someone could assure me that stimulating my vagus nerve
would cause me to remember to send a birthday card on time to a
friend in Arizona or to put out the dog and turn off the light at
night (and not, as I sometimes do, vice versa), fine. I'd take the
cure _ if only I could remember my vagus stimulation appointment. &QL;
</P>

   WOLF SOLENT
</P>
<P>
   By John Cowper Powys. (Vintage International, $15.) This British
novel, recently restored to print, follows a sensitive young
Londoner who returns to an insulated village in his native Dorset
and becomes romantically entwined with two vastly different women.
```Wolf Solent' is a modern prose 'Hamlet,''' Percy Hutchison wrote
here in 1929. ``The novel is a momentous piece of work ... of
transcendent interest and great beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   GOD &AMP; THE AMERICAN WRITER
</P>
<P>
   By Alfred Kazin. (Vintage, $14.) A renowned critic and
impassioned reader, in his final book before his death last year at
the age of 83, argues that classic American writers from Hawthorne
to Frost to Faulkner were driven by spiritual passion and a
yearning for something like faith, motivations that echo the
author's own emotional approach to his subject. ``He strolls from
writer to writer as if through the rooms of his own house,
occasionally shaking hands, by means of an anecdote, with someone
he has known personally,'' Paul Berman wrote in the Book Review in
1997, adding that when Kazin hits his target squarely, ``the effect
is spectacular and brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   FLYING LEAP: STORIES
</P>
<P>
   By Judy Budnitz. (Picador USA, $12.) These tales twist familiar
middle-class terrain into strange new shapes, creating a world
where a local baker creates babies from dough and high school
cheerleaders get so charged up at a pep rally that they set
themselves on fire. In 1998 our reviewer, J.D. Biersdorfer, called
this ``a consistently impressive debut.''
</P>
<P>
   FATHER, SOLDIER, SON: MEMOIR OF A PLATOON LEADER IN VIETNAM
</P>
<P>
   By Nathaniel Tripp. (Steerforth, $14.) In his unflinching
account of the horrors of war, an ex-infantry lieutenant also
describes his efforts to confront his guilt and achieve manhood
through love and family. ``The writing is cathartic, an expiation
by a middle-aged man haunted by everything that went wrong in war,
in youth, in country,'' David D. Gilmore wrote here in 1997. In
Patches of Fire: A Story of War and Redemption, by Albert French
(Anchor, $12.95), a black novelist tells how his Vietnam War
experiences became a creative wellspring he tapped into after years
of struggle in civilian life. ``It is a classic tale,
life-affirming and updated for the modern age,'' Terrence Maitland
said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   THE GUN SELLER
</P>
<P>
   By Hugh Laurie. (Washington Square, $14.) The hero of this
tongue-in-cheek techno-spy thriller is a dissolute ex-military man
who gets sucked into international intrigue involving money
launderers, terrorists, arms dealers and, of course, beautiful
babes. The result is ``a genuinely witty and sophisticated
entertainment,'' Christopher Buckley wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   UTOPIA PARKWAY: THE LIFE AND WORK OF JOSEPH CORNELL
</P>
<P>
   By Deborah Solomon. (Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $16.) The
author maintains that the secretive artist known for his boxes
filled with scraps, cutouts and trinkets was primarily an
iconographer and archivist with a basement full of ``source
material,'' including files on movie actresses and 19th-century
ballerinas. In 1997 our reviewer, James R. Mellow, called this a
``thoroughly detailed, highly informative biography.'' Mary
Cassatt: A Life, by Nancy Mowll Mathews (Yale University, $18),
shows how the American-born Mary Cassatt (1844-1926) blended her
love of painting with a desire for financial success. In 1994 in
these pages, Carol Armstrong cited some shortcomings in the
author's straight-ahead approach, but said the book was
``thoroughgoing in its resurrection of the contexts and
conditions'' of the artist's life.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TROUBLE SLEEPS
</P>
<P>
   By Clyde Edgerton. (Ballantine, $12.95.) Much of this novel is
told by a 6-year-old boy who describes what happens when a stranger
in a stolen Buick rolls into sleepy Listre, N.C., in 1950. The book
is ``as much the story of a man who brings random badness into a
good place as it is the story of a boy's search for his own
salvation,'' Mark Childress wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG BALLAD JAMBOREE
</P>
<P>
   Rural North Carolina circa 1950 is also the setting for The Big
Ballad Jamboree, by Donald Davidson (University Press of
Mississippi, $17), which follows the fortunes of a country singer
and his sweetheart, who is collecting folk songs for her a master's
degree thesis. In 1996 in these pages, George Garrett called this
''a lighthearted and (in a musical sense) light-fingered'' novel.
</P>
<P>
   THE REICHMANNS: FAMILY, FAITH, FORTUNE, AND THE EMPIRE OF
OLYMPIA &AMP; YORK
</P>
<P>
   By Anthony Bianco. (Times Books/Random House, $20.) This
large-scale chronicle tracks the rise and fall of an Orthodox
Jewish family that at its peak in the 1980's amassed phenomenal
wealth through its international property holdings. In 1997 our
reviewer, Mordecai Richler, called the book ``a nicely balanced
study.''
</P>
<P>
   THE VOICE IMITATOR
</P>
<P>
   By Thomas Bernhard. Translated by Kenneth J. Northcott.
(University of Chicago, $10.) The tiny stories in this 1978
collection showcase the Austrian writer's obsessions with
hypocrisy, corruption, murder and lunacy -- and especially his
contempt for his homeland. ``Bernhard's rage against society'' is
``a highly artistic undertaking,'' Peter Filkins wrote here in
1997.

CASPIAN LOGIC: DEMOCRACY? SURE, SURE. NOW BUY OUR OIL. 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By STEVE LeVINE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ Kazakhstan, on the steppe between Moscow
and Mongolia, was only recently a forbidden southern Soviet
hinterland, a synonym for obscurity. But it is rich in oil and
natural gas, recently independent, and in a region that forms a
corridor separating Russia to the north from Iran to the south.
</P>
<P>
   In these geographic facts, the Clinton administration has seen
an irresistible opportunity _ to help American firms share in the
riches, to prevent Russia from expanding dangerously back south
once it is back on its feet, and to help contain Iran.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that the White House has declared the Caspian Sea a top
strategic priority. So it is that it is pouring enormous effort
into helping the surrounding nations with the most energy _
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan _ build a pipeline to the
Mediterranean that would get their oil and gas to market without
going through Russia. And so it is that America has become
interested in the niceties of democracy in places as obscure as
these.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a problem. Call it a perception gap.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it helps funnel in billions of dollars in U.S. contracts
for energy development, the administration has wanted to transform
the societies that will receive it by turning them into democratic
and economically transparent meritocracies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Caspian leaders have a different idea. As they see it,
they have been willing to sign almost any agreement promising
reform, and they have handed over their crown jewels _ their oil
fields. So they want to know why Washington makes a fuss when they
cheat in their elections, rule as autocrats and appoint relatives
(who, after all, are among their most trusted intimates) to senior
government posts.
</P>
<P>
   Just now, this difference of view is causing tension between the
Clinton administration and this republic of 16 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is viewed abroad
as the region's most reasonable leader, has ruled since 1989. Next
Sunday, he is up for re-election to a new seven-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington's view, Nazarbayev would probably win a fair race.
Few expected one, however, and the administration took umbrage when
the fix seemed more flagrant than necessary. First, Nazarbayev's
Supreme Court disqualified a former prime minister, Akezhan
Kazhegeldin, as an opponent. Perhaps more galling, it did so just a
day after Vice President Al Gore phoned Nazarbayev asking that
Kazhegeldin be permitted to run.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Dec. 23, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
summoned Kazakhstan's ranking diplomat in Washington to protest the
beating of a local employee of the U.S. Embassy in Almaty who had
represented the embassy in meetings with opposition and human
rights figures. On Dec. 22, three men attacked him, leaving him
with a cracked rib and cuts near both eyes. A State Department
spokesman, Lee McClenney, said the circumstances suggested ``a
politically motivated attack aimed at intimidating the embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the background is a disagreement over Nazarbayev's right to
rule and Kazhegeldin's right to compete. Kazakh officials seem to
have a Soviet-style regard of their leader _ elections or no, they
assume he will govern until he chooses to step down or dies.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kazhegeldin, Nazarbayev and his subordinates openly
despise him, and are trying to remove him from the political scene
by leveling corruption charges _ a slippery topic in a nation
where, diplomats say, a third to a half of more than $1 billion in
privatization bonuses from foreign companies to the government in
the last two years have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   So how does this square with the promises of reform?
</P>
<P>
   ``The local governments have learned to talk the talk about
human rights, freedom of the press and democracy. But since they
also are cynical, it is not surprising they believe we don't really
mean it,'' said Adam Smith Albion, an expert on the region with the
Institute of Current World Affairs, a policy study group based in
Hanover, N.H. ``The United States is happy to deal with plenty of
autocratic-led states that have hydrocarbons, and surely this has
not gone unnoticed by the Central Asian leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Kazakh government has acted on the perception gap.
In a full-page ad in American newspapers, including The New York
Times on Dec. 16, it said it wanted ``to celebrate our thriving
nascent democracy as a leader in political and market reforms,
human rights and peaceful policies in Central Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bergne, who teaches about the Caspian region at Oxford
University, thinks the gap can be bridged. ``But it is going to
take much longer than people think,'' he said. ``From the West,
starry-eyed idealists came pouring into the Caucasus and Central
Asia thinking they would persuade the leaders to introduce
pluralist democracy and market reforms. On the other side, the
countries thought these companies would come in with all their
investments and, before you say Jack Robinson, they would have a
modern economy. From both sides it has proved very wrong.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate returns to Washington this week to
begin an impeachment trial of President Clinton, the airwaves and
Op-Ed pages are filled with prophecies of doom. A year of scandal
and partisanship on a scale unseen in a generation has, it is said,
left the capital adrift and the president paralyzed no matter how
the senators vote. The White House rarely misses a chance to
exploit that worry, warning darkly about how a prolonged trial,
much less the removal of a president, could unravel this Age of
Prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred and fifty miles north, on Wall Street, life looks
different. The Dow's party goes on. It ended the year well above
9,000, after a plunge in September and October that now seems like
nothing worse than a terrifying bungee-jump that punctuated a
delightful vacation. No one is sure exactly what brought it back _
maybe Alan Greenspan's interest rate cuts, maybe new money for the
International Monetary Fund, maybe the hope that 18 months of
global chaos is morphing into something more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are still anxieties about profits, deflation, slow
growth and the gnawing sense that whatever afflicted Asia and
Russia is simply in remission.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the intersection of those views _ Washington's
certainty that what's happening here matters to the government's
ability to manage the nation and its economy, and the markets' view
that the political wars and moral arguments here are irrelevant _
lies a dynamic that seems bound to define 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is a well-proven maxim that in good times, countries can
thrive even when their governments are paralyzed. Japan is perhaps
the premiere example: In the 1980s, Japanese industrialists boasted
that the weakness of the Japanese state was one secret of their
success.
</P>
<P>
   But the experience of the past few years in Japan, Russia, Asia
and Latin America suggests that once things go awry, a distracted
or weak government can make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a man who
has lived in both worlds, went out of his way last week to portray
Clinton as a president in full, remarkably undistracted by the
prospect of an imminent trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him a lot lately, and when he comes into our
meetings he is fully there,'' Rubin said. ``He is remarkably
focused on what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the president is engaged or depressed, consumed with his
fate or determined to turn his mind to other things, the question
remains: Are there unforeseen dangers emanating from the ugliness
of the past year?
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell, especially at a moment when it is unclear
whether Clinton's trial in the Senate will be long, or as many
suggested last week, could move quickly to the question of censure.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue hardly goes away when the trial ends. Will the
legacy of partisanship end any chance of working out a deal on
Social Security or the range of other issues on the national
agenda?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as many moderates in both parties argue, will there be a
drive to get something done, anything that would enable incumbents
to go to the voters with something more to show than a vote on Bill
Clinton's behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom in Washington, which has been wrong at
virtually every turn in this melodrama, sides with the gridlock
scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, at least for now, gridlock sounds fine. More
than a few top executives say that a Congress consumed with
impeachment is a Congress too distracted to raise taxes or think up
new ways to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   But that is mostly loose cocktail party talk, the kind of
bravado born of good times. Government action never seems more
useless than when interest rates and unemployment are hovering near
30-year lows, when budgets are in balance, when crime is down and
Internet stocks are trading at levels that seem to defy logic.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember September and October, a time of terror in the
markets, when it seemed as if Asia's troubles and Russia's default
had arrived on America's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   The almost-crash of '98 prompted muted talk of a global
recession and fears that the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management, a huge hedge fund, presaged big trouble. The big
question was: What was Washington going to do, and how quickly was
it going to do it?
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Washington acted pretty fast. Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, came through with three
interest-rate cuts. Clinton gave speech after speech urging other
nations to focus on growth and forget about inflation fears, and
they cut rates, too. A scared Congress approved new financing for
the International Monetary Fund. The Fed coordinated a private
sector bailout of Long-Term Capital Management. Things settled
down, defying Washington's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Those were largely actions that the Federal Reserve and the
executive branch could execute by themselves. What no one yet knows
is whether Washington's immersion in the impeachment, the culture
wars and the positioning for supremacy at the polls could distract
it from more politically difficult steps needed to sustain
America's boom.

   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate returns to Washington this week to
begin an impeachment trial of President Clinton, the airwaves and
Op-Ed pages are filled with prophecies of doom. A year of scandal
and partisanship on a scale unseen in a generation has, it is said,
left the capital adrift and the president paralyzed no matter how
the senators vote. The White House rarely misses a chance to
exploit that worry, warning darkly about how a prolonged trial,
much less the removal of a president, could unravel this Age of
Prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred and fifty miles north, on Wall Street, life looks

   History, an uncertain guide, suggests that the risk is real.
</P>
<P>
   President Andrew Johnson's impeachment in 1868 led to an era of
weak government and, the next year, a Black Friday in which a major
Wall Street firm sought to corner the market for all gold in the
country outside the Treasury. International trade, which was
settled in gold at the time, briefly came to a halt. The next 20
years were marked by forgettable presidents and a succession of
panics and scandals.
</P>
<P>
   But as David Donald, the Harvard historian of the Civil War and
Reconstruction eras, said in an interview recently, what happened
in America in the 1860s and 1870s ``didn't radiate out into the
world, except to confirm the European view that America is a
barbarous and uncouth nation.'' Nor did the economic events beyond
U.S. borders require swift or decisive action in Washington. ``This
time,'' he said, ``it could be different.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is plenty of evidence around the world in recent
years that political distraction in one country can affect the
wealth of other nations. Japan is the most conspicuous example.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese in the late 1980s not only thought they were on top
of the world, they thought the chaos in their own government barely
mattered. Bribery scandals and the political power struggles that
in 1993 resulted in the ouster of the Liberal Democrats after 35
years of increasingly corrupt rule, all seemed like a side show to
an economic miracle.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it is clear that Japan was like a car that had
run out of gas, but had so much momentum that the passengers didn't
notice until the scenery stopped moving.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians didn't notice even then; they raised taxes, making a
bad situation worse. They ignored a trillion dollars in bad debts,
hoping a market upturn would make it all go away. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The story was similar in Thailand, South Korea and especially
Russia, where U.S. officials were warning President Boris Yeltsin
two years ago that a free-market economy did not mean that the
government had no power to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is clear from the financial crises,'' said Stanley
Fischer, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund.
``Weak governments have a terrible time putting together sensible
decisions, and rallying market confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly noted that the United States appears to be
different, because the independence of the Federal Reserve and
market confidence in the competence of the Treasury mean that ``the
system seems to work even when it might superficially appear to be
immobilized. It is relevant to Russia and to the Asians and
certainly to Japan.'' The United States, Fischer said, is
different. ``It seems to work even when it would appear
immobilized.''
</P>
<P>
   How well the United States responds to any imminent economic
shocks amid impeachment and its aftermath depends, of course, on
how markets, consumers and world economies weather the next few
months. If the Internet-stock bubble is pricked, if the bailout of
Brazil goes bad, if Russia dissolves or China slows, if another
hedge fund crashes, politics and prosperity are bound to cross
paths.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Beschloss, a historian of the presidency, wonders
whether President Richard M. Nixon might have responded differently
to the 1974 energy crisis if Watergate had not been engulfing him
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know how much Nixon was distracted _ that he was
spending 70 to 80 percent of his time on Watergate,'' Beschloss
said. ``If you need to convince Congress and the public that the
moment has come to make a sacrifice, that's when credibility
suddenly becomes important.''

<P>
   When Prudential Insurance Company of America decided in December
to sell its health-care operations to Aetna Inc., it was the latest
example of a company that could not make money caring for sick
people. Despite Prudential's best efforts, the business, mostly in
managed care, had lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Prudential
finally gave up.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years have proved enormously difficult for many of
the businesses created to capture the vast sums flowing through the
nation's health-care system _ now more than $1 trillion each year.
In particular, companies designed to oversee the delivery of care,
like HMOs and groups of doctors' practices, are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of HMOs lost money in 1997, accumulating nearly
$800 million in losses, according to Weiss Ratings Inc., a Palm
Beach Gardens, Fla., company that tracks insurers. Several,
including such former industry standouts as Oxford Health Plans and
UnitedHealth Group, formerly United HealthCare, reported sizable
losses in 1998, and a shakeout is underway among the companies that
manage doctors' practices.
</P>
<P>
   Offering some discipline and an entrepreneurial approach, these
enterprises had promised to deliver health care much more
efficiently than some of the traditional players like Blue Cross
and Blue Shield plans _ many of which are nonprofit _ or
independently functioning doctors. Investors would share in the
savings, they claimed, and the public would benefit from a respite
from the relentless climb in health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   But a real debate is emerging over whether these businesses can
wring more efficiencies out of the system and therefore make money
over the long haul. While they prospered by taking advantage of
easy one-time savings, like the use of their clout to get doctors
and hospitals to accept less to provide care, their fat profits
could prove ephemeral in the face of medical costs that they, too,
cannot control.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term you can make money,'' said Howard Berliner,
the chair of health services and management policy at the New
School for Social Research in New York. ``In the long term, you
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Having rejected costly old-style medical insurance and Clinton
administration proposals for government-supervised health care, the
nation has embraced profit-making managed care companies as the
solution to rising medical costs. The failure of these companies to
work out their problems is more than just bad news for investors;
it raises doubts about the theory that managed care, left to the
forces of the free market, would, within a few years, distribute
resources effectively and keep costs down.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies simply keep raising premiums, the government or
business or the consumer will eventually object. Cutting back on
services by limiting benefits or refusing to provide certain kinds
of care is proving equally unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the optimists from Wall Street, who tend to be true
believers about the power of the free market, say that while the
HMOs have achieved tremendous savings, they have not demonstrated
that they can achieve efficiencies that come from knowing which
drugs or treatments work best.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figured out how to take costs out of the system, but they
need to take care to the next level,'' said Mary Anne Citrino, a
managing director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. who
specializes in health care.
</P>
<P>
   With profits at many of these companies scarce, investors have
fled the stocks. The number of health-care service companies going
public dwindled last year to the lowest level in a decade,
according to Securities Data Co. in Newark, N.J., and the amount of
capital the new companies raised from the public this year is only
a fourth of the amount raised in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, plenty of people _ the executives running these
companies, for example, and the vast majority of physicians _
continue to make very good livings. UnitedHealth chief executive
William McGuire, for example, made about $10 million, including the
value of his stock options, in 1997, according to Graef Crystal, a
compensation expert. Even Oxford's debacle could prove lucrative to
its founder, Stephen Wiggins, who got a $9-million severance
package when he resigned as chairman early last year. That package
is currently under review by the company.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these businesses appear to be running out of
opportunities. After several profitable years during which premiums
were kept in check, HMOs seem to be no match for the inexorable
rise in medical costs. Oxford, whose rapid growth got the better of
it, has accumulated about $900 million in net losses over the last
12 months because it underestimated the cost of delivering care and
failed to charge enough for its popular plans. The company has
sharply raised its prices at the risk of losing some of its
members.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth, which is considered among the best managed in the
industry, misjudged how expensive it would be to provide care to
the elderly under the government's Medicare program. The company
reported a $565-million net loss in August and rapidly scaled back
its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even an old hand like Kaiser Permanente, a nonprofit pioneer, is
losing hundreds of millions of dollars because demand for care is
increasing and it can do little to check the rising cost of drugs
and medical technology.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the managed-care companies were able to
significantly raise their premiums for 1999, they may never be as
profitable as they were five years ago. And the public's
willingness to accept higher prices may be short-lived if people
begin to believe that there is not enough money to go around to
insure that care remains affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cold reality began to dawn on people in the system: Saving
money for employers and making money comes at the expense of public
access to doctors, hospitals and services,'' said Dr. Arnold
Relman, a former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Other attempts to cut costs by being more efficient have also
foundered. When HMOs and other insurers forced doctors to accept
less money for their services, there was little room for the
companies that buy and manage doctors' practices to make money.

the chair of health services and management policy at the New
School for Social Research in New York. ``In the long term, you
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Having rejected costly old-style medical insurance and Clinton
administration proposals for government-supervised health care, the
nation has embraced profit-making managed care companies as the
solution to rising medical costs. The failure of these companies to
work out their problems is more than just bad news for investors;
it raises doubts about the theory that managed care, left to the
forces of the free market, would, within a few years, distribute
resources effectively and keep costs down.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies simply keep raising premiums, the government or
business or the consumer will eventually object. Cutting back on
services by limiting benefits or refusing to provide certain kinds
of care is proving equally unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the optimists from Wall Street, who tend to be true
believers about the power of the free market, say that while the
HMOs have achieved tremendous savings, they have not demonstrated
that they can achieve efficiencies that come from knowing which
drugs or treatments work best.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figured out how to take costs out of the system, but they
need to take care to the next level,'' said Mary Anne Citrino, a
managing director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. who
specializes in health care.
</P>
<P>
   With profits at many of these companies scarce, investors have
fled the stocks. The number of health-care service companies going
public dwindled last year to the lowest level in a decade,
according to Securities Data Co. in Newark, N.J., and the amount of
capital the new companies raised from the public this year is only
a fourth of the amount raised in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, plenty of people _ the executives running these
companies, for example, and the vast majority of physicians _
continue to make very good livings. UnitedHealth chief executive
William McGuire, for example, made about $10 million, including the
value of his stock options, in 1997, according to Graef Crystal, a
compensation expert. Even Oxford's debacle could prove lucrative to
its founder, Stephen Wiggins, who got a $9-million severance
package when he resigned as chairman early last year. That package
is currently under review by the company.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these businesses appear to be running out of
opportunities. After several profitable years during which premiums
were kept in check, HMOs seem to be no match for the inexorable
rise in medical costs. Oxford, whose rapid growth got the better of
it, has accumulated about $900 million in net losses over the last
12 months because it underestimated the cost of delivering care and
failed to charge enough for its popular plans. The company has
sharply raised its prices at the risk of losing some of its
members.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth, which is considered among the best managed in the
industry, misjudged how expensive it would be to provide care to
the elderly under the government's Medicare program. The company
reported a $565-million net loss in August and rapidly scaled back
its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even an old hand like Kaiser Permanente, a nonprofit pioneer, is
losing hundreds of millions of dollars because demand for care is
increasing and it can do little to check the rising cost of drugs
and medical technology.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the managed-care companies were able to
significantly raise their premiums for 1999, they may never be as
profitable as they were five years ago. And the public's
willingness to accept higher prices may be short-lived if people
begin to believe that there is not enough money to go around to
insure that care remains affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cold reality began to dawn on people in the system: Saving
money for employers and making money comes at the expense of public
access to doctors, hospitals and services,'' said Dr. Arnold
Relman, a former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Other attempts to cut costs by being more efficient have also
foundered. When HMOs and other insurers forced doctors to accept
less money for their services, there was little room for the
companies that buy and manage doctors' practices to make money.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies discovered that their doctors simply
could not deliver care as cheaply as had been expected. FPA Medical
Management of Miami filed for bankruptcy protection in July because
it was losing money on many of its doctors' contracts, and
MedPartners Inc. of Birmingham, Ala., the largest of these
companies, announced last November that it would leave the business
because it could not figure out how to deliver care cheaply enough.
</P>
<P>
   And most HMOs are losing money on Medicare patients, according
to Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. When the
government decided to sharply limit Medicare payments to
managed-care plans beginning in 1999, dozens of HMOs either
abandoned or scaled back their services. Some 400,000 Medicare
patients are being dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the current system say it has never offered an
economic incentive to care for sick people. Because the insurers do
not spread the risk of caring for the sick over the entire
population, and are not paid more when they provide more care, the
companies can only thrive by covering those who are healthiest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have a health-care system designed to encourage
health plans to treat the sick, and not compete purely on cost,
there will be no winners,'' said Diane Archer, executive director
of the Medicare Rights Center, a New York consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all the elderly could not get health insurance in 1965,
before Medicare, because private insurers would not cover them or
made their policies unaffordable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the profit-making companies believe it is only a
matter of time before business will find a way to make sense of the
nation's health-care system. But companies will first need to
develop the kind of monitoring systems necessary to know exactly
how care is being delivered and what kind of care is, in fact, most
effective, according to Ms. Citrino. Now, she said, it is like
banking before the development of automatic teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Others doubt whether the businesses will ever succeed,
especially if they attempt to provide care for everyone, including
those who cannot afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a Wall Street analyst,'' said Relman.``I would have
a no-buy recommendation on them all.''

AS ETHNIC PRIDE RISES, RHINOPLASTY TAKES A NOSE DIVE 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By JANE GROSS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time not so long ago when the Manhattan
Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital on East 64th Street was as chic a
destination for Christmas vacation as St. Barts or Telluride.
</P>
<P>
   That is where many teen-aged girls would disappear during school
holidays to get the ethnic bumps on their noses smoothed out. So
crowded were the operating rooms at this time of year, recalled Dr.
Gerald Pitman, a plastic surgeon, that he would set out 20 sets of
rhinoplasty instruments in the morning and run out before the day
was done.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd is thinning.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of an explosion in cosmetic surgery, the number of
nose jobs has dropped significantly. While the total number of
cosmetic procedures increased 76 percent, to 697,000 from 395,000,
between 1992 and 1996, the numbers of rhinoplasties, as they are
known, fell 8 percent, to 46,000 from 50,000. And the decline was
probably steeper between the 1990s and the 1970s, experts say,
although no statistics are available before this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are partly cultural and partly economic, according
to plastic surgeons who have watched the evolution of a procedure
that was once a benchmark in a young girl's life, especially among
Jewish teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the thing to do,'' said Dr. H. George Brennan, who
practices in Southern California. ``You had your bat mitzvah and
you got your nose done.''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday for nose jobs, experts agree, was in the '60s and
early '70s, when the postwar baby boomers were teen-agers. Parents
of Jewish ancestry who knew first-hand of the Nazi atrocities were
ever on the alert for stirrings of anti-Semitism. They wanted their
own children spared discrimination. And to them, that meant fitting
inconspicuously into the Protestant mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish parents at that time didn't want their children to look
Jewish,'' said Dr. James L. Baker Jr., who practices outside
Orlando, Fla. ``They feared a stigma left from the war.''
</P>
<P>
   The physical characteristic that most set Jews apart was their
noses, and so legions of teen-agers, usually girls, had them fixed.
The technology was primitive compared to today's, and so the
results, through the 1970s, had a cookie-cutter similarity _ little
ski-jump noses with the bony bridge scooped away.
</P>
<P>
   But that was OK with the patients. ``Everybody wanted to look
like a shiksa,'' said Dr. Thomas Rees, a retired plastic surgeon
who trained many of the high-priced doctors at work today along
Park Ave.
</P>
<P>
   The leading practitioner back then was Dr. Howard Diamond of
Manhattan, renowned for standardizing what had been a hit-or-miss
operation. ``Every girl on Long Island had a Diamond nose,'' said
Dr. George Beraka, who said he can still pick them out on women now
deep into middle-age.
</P>
<P>
   But fashion was changing. Ethnic looks were coming into style.
In the mid-'70s, black models appeared for the first time on the
covers of Glamour and Vogue. Blondes were not the only ones having
fun. Lana Turner and Betty Grable were replaced by Barbra Streisand
(who was afraid to have a nose job for fear it would change her
voice) and Cher (who eventually had her nose fixed, along with many
other body parts.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, doctors say, their patients want to maintain their ethnic
individuality, perhaps with slight refinement. Where once the
button nose was the rage, women these days beg for a ``natural''
look. ``They're not trying to erase their ethnic background
anymore,'' said Dr. Darrick Antell, a Park Avenue surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christopher Nanni of Brooklyn agreed: ``There's a much
broader definition of beauty. Not everyone needs to look like
Barbie.'' Nanni noted that the preoccupation has shifted to flat
stomachs and wrinkle-free faces. ``It's youth they're looking for,
not certain facial features.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the decline of nose jobs, doctors say, is the
new health care economics. In the old days, insurance plans covered
the procedure if a patient complained of breathing difficulties.
Now, insurers do not docilely accept that a cosmetic operation
costing between $3,000 and $8,000 is necessary for a deviated
septum. ``They fight and fight,'' Pitman said, and many
middle-class families are ``reluctant to spend the college money.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics available on rhinoplasty do not distinguish
between primary and secondary surgeries, the return trips to the
operating room to fix what was done before. Antell said he sees
older women who have tired of their cute little ski-slope noses and
``want to turn the clock back'' and look like real people. He
complies, transplanting cartilage from the septum to give them back
the bump they once hated.

TEST-TUBE BABIES: PRIVATE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

   As New York prepares to become the 34th state to operate charter
schools, the model of the future may be in Chicago. Last week, a
Chicago priest proposed closing down a Catholic parochial school
and reopening it as a charter school, financed by taxpayers.
Religious instruction could be available before and after the
regular classes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago plan came just days after an unusual coalition of
black and Hispanic ministers and wealthy Wall Street businessmen
proposed similar arrangements under a law passed last month
allowing 100 charter schools to be set up in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The first charter school advocates had something else in mind
when they sat around a conference table in a lakeside lodge near
Brainerd, Minn., in 1988 and dreamed up the idea of public schools
freed from the bureaucracy of public schools. Like many parents,
educators and policymakers grappling with ways to improve
education, especially in poor neighborhoods, their agendas were
more personal than political or religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us were deeply frustrated,'' said Joe Nathan, who now
heads the Center for School Change at the University of Minnesota's
Humphrey Institute. Nathan, a former public school teacher,
recalled sitting with Albert Shanker, the president of the American
Federation of Teachers, Seymour Fliegel, a former deputy
superintendent of public schools in East Harlem in New York City,
lawmakers and PTA and community leaders. Several of them had
started small, innovative alternative public schools that thrived
by breaking rules but foundered when the local school district
demanded conformity.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Budde, a retired teacher and administrator, had coined the
term charter in a 1988 government-financed report, ``Education by
Charter,'' to capture the notion of teachers and districts creating
innovative programs. The Minnesota group took his idea one step
further to charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked the term because it talked about mutual
responsibilities,'' Nathan said. The charter school would receive
public money and be independent, but in return it would have to
demonstrate that schoolchildren were learning at least as well as
they were elsewhere in the system. Otherwise, its charter would be
revoked and the school shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Minnesota became the first state to adopt charter school
legislation, which was written by Ember Reichgott Junge, a
Democratic state senator who had sat with Nathan and others three
years earlier. In 1992, the first charter school opened. In less
than a decade, the movement has spread to 1,128 schools across the
country, enrolling about 250,000 children, according to the Center
for Education Reform, an advocacy organization in Washington. About
3 percent of all charters granted have been revoked, center
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these schools are little more than conventional public
schools; others are radically different, with special missions and
innovative, even quirky, approaches, like biofeedback to help
learning disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools receive operating money _ the equivalent of
tuition _ from the public school system. But that doesn't cover
construction, renovation or in many cases equipment, and unlike
public school systems, charter schools rarely have the ability to
issue bonds. To help pay for buildings, desks and computers,
charter schools have teamed with philanthropists, local businesses
and institutions like the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich., and
the YMCA in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The need for institutional support has also given rise to a
third model _ charter schools managed by profit-making companies
like the Edison Project, run by the former media entrepreneur Chris
Whittle, or Advantage Schools Co. Whittle estimates that
profit-making companies run fewer than 10 percent of charter
schools in the country. Executives of both companies say they have
yet to run enough schools to make an overall profit.
</P>
<P>
   While charter schools obviously are a long way from taking over
public education in America, their proponents say their influence
has been disproportionate to their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about losing talented teachers to charter schools, local
school superintendents in cities like Boston, Rochester, Minn., and
Flagstaff, Ariz., have permitted innovation that they blocked
earlier, Nathan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you absolutely get out of it,'' Whittle said,
``and I've seen this in city after city, is that competition does
raise all boats, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether clergy join parents and others in the charter-school
movement remains to be seen. The Rev. Michael Pfleger's proposal to
turn the St. Sabina School in Chicago into a charter school has
encouragement from the public schools chief, Paul Vallas.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, legislators have warned that groups that want to
start charter schools must meet a series of tests designed to prove
they are not trying to receive tax dollars by converting an
existing private or parochial school. But ministers like the Rev.
Floyd Flake, a former six-term congressman who is pastor of the
Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Queens, say they can
create secular schools that meet the test of the law.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's Roman Catholic Archdiocese has expressed little
interest in charter schools. But it shares the same goals and
speaks the same language as a political action committee that spent
more than $100,000, much of it raised by Wall Street businessmen,
to prod lawmakers to vote for New York's charter law. The committee
was called School Choice Now. The Catholic Church is still pressing
its plan for vouchers, which it calls School Choice.

WAR WITHOUT CASUALTIES: AVOIDING LOSSES IS ONE THING, WINNING IS
ANOTHER
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying
for his country,'' Gen. George Patton roared in May 1944 to
soldiers preparing to invade Europe. ``He won it by making the
other poor dumb bastard die for his country.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four years later, that admonition, immortalized by the
movie ``Patton,'' has evolved into a dogma that Old Blood and Guts
would scarcely recognize, one in which avoiding casualties _
``force protection,'' in military-speak _ has been elevated to a
central objective of a military mission, and spilling little or no
American blood has become a primary indicator of success.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the four-day blitz bombing of Iraq last month was
proclaimed a success even before the full extent of damage was
known, because no American got hurt. ``To do this without any
casualties in the environment our forces faced was truly
remarkable,'' Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of the operation,
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it was a relief that no American was killed or
wounded. And nobody would disagree that the cruise missiles and
other ``stand-off weapons'' fired so accurately from a great
distance came a long way toward fulfilling the hopes of honorable
soldiers throughout history to achieve military objectives with a
minimum of carnage.
</P>
<P>
   But putting so high a premium on bloodless combat and so much
faith in high technology has also raised some troubling questions.
One is whether the electronic razzle-dazzle creates the
expectation, some would say illusion, in the American public that
the new weapons can accomplish every military mission, and
therefore that the loss of any GIs in a future operation is
tantamount to failure. And does that not in turn encourage
commanders to tailor the goals of a mission to insure minimal
casualties?
</P>
<P>
   Another question is whether America's apparent reluctance to
shed blood leads its enemies to conclude that the way to defeat the
United States is to achieve gruesome and televisable casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Some have already concluded just that, including Iraq's Saddam
Hussein, who made clear in a conversation with the U.S. ambassador
on the eve of the 1991 Gulf war that he saw America's sensitivity
to casualties as an exploitable weakness. He told the U.S.
ambassador then, ``Yours is a society which cannot accept 10,000
dead in one battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to technology to reduce carnage is not new. The
introduction of gunpowder 400 years ago, for example, raised
expectations that war would become less gruesome now that men would
not have to hack or bludgeon each other to death. Neither is
America's reluctance to send its boys to die in distant wars new or
surprising, given its geographic insulation from potential foes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if Americans went reluctantly into World War II, it was
still an axiom that waging war meant being prepared to die. When
Patton exhorted his men to do in the other guy, he also told them,
``The real man never lets fear of death overpower his honor, his
duty to his country, and his innate manhood.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made bloodless war so much more tempting for generals
and politicians since then is the power that television has had in
bringing carnage home to the general public, and the development of
ever more sophisticated and accurate long-distance weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the Vietnam War, the public was exposed for the first time to
the realities of the battlefield, and movies like ``Saving Private
Ryan'' have followed by portraying aspects of earlier wars that
censors ruthlessly concealed in Patton's time.
</P>
<P>
   It was the televised horrors that seemed responsible for
transforming initial support for the Vietnam war into fierce public
opposition, and instilled a deep wariness of body bags in the
current generation of leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomenon of warfare being broadcast in relatively
unadulterated form into people's lives, and the need to build
political support to sustain military operations, have caused
political and military leaders to become more and more concerned
about casualties,'' said Michael Peters, a retired Army colonel and
now senior vice president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity has been reinforced by incidents like the failed
mission to save American hostages in Iran, the killing of 241 U.S.
servicemen in 1983 in Beirut in a terrorist bombing, or the images
of the charred bodies of American Rangers killed in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when military commanders launched Operation Desert Storm in
1991, their idea was to hit hard and with minimum casualties,''
said Bernard Trainor, a retired Marine general. ``That was also the
major factor in the decision to end the war.'' Not only were the
commanders wary of losing their men, Trainor added, but for the
first time in history, they also tried to minimize casualties to
the foe, out of reluctance to have the United States appear
needlessly vicious.
</P>
<P>
   By these criteria, Operation Desert Storm was an indisputable
success. Only 299 U.S. servicemen died, out of about a half million
deployed. Less than half of these, 148, were battle deaths.
</P>
<P>
   That achievement, in turn, led to calls for an increased
emphasis on ``stand-off weapons'' and ``force protection'' in
military planning, and thence to a debate that still rages within
the military between advocates of the new, high-tech approach to
warfare and those who believe that trying to make war bloodless was
not really effective, and potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Tilford of the Army War College is among those who argue
that the effectiveness and credibility of an army, and of a
superpower, still ultimately depend on its willingness to send
soldiers into mortal combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new American way of war is being sold by the high-tech
crowd as a nearly bloodless kind of thing,'' he said in an
interview. ``But this is a misinterpretation of what happened in
the Gulf.'' There, he said, America faced an enemy massed in the
open desert with little air cover, and thus easy to spot and hit
from a distance. Yet even there, he said, it took troops on the
ground to finally chase the Iraqis out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Precision, he said, is ``not the answer to all things.'' Though
it can ``degrade'' Iraq's capability, it apparently can not
eliminate the threat of its weapons of mass destruction _ and it
has notably failed to dislodge Saddam, a goal now embraced by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tilford is convinced, moreover, that the American public is more
willing to accept casualties than political and military leaders
believe, if people can be persuaded that the sacrifice is
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the key is to find the balance between maintaining the
credibility of American arms and the constraints American history
and democracy impose.
</P>
<P>
   ``A superpower that doesn't exert its power will lose that power
over time,'' said Robert Ebel, the director of national security
programs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
``But the problem is that we cannot be seen as a ruthless
superpower. So we've got to continuously use our super powers, but
without turning the world against us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine in theory, military historians would argue, but when
it comes to using a cudgel to make the bad guys fall in line,
history is clear: There's no antiseptic or bloodless way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis,'' said Trainor, ``if you want to
radically change the behavior of your opponent, it takes boots on
the ground to do it.''

central objective of a military mission, and spilling little or no
American blood has become a primary indicator of success.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the four-day blitz bombing of Iraq last month was
proclaimed a success even before the full extent of damage was
known, because no American got hurt. ``To do this without any
casualties in the environment our forces faced was truly
remarkable,'' Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of the operation,
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it was a relief that no American was killed or
wounded. And nobody would disagree that the cruise missiles and
other ``stand-off weapons'' fired so accurately from a great
distance came a long way toward fulfilling the hopes of honorable
soldiers throughout history to achieve military objectives with a
minimum of carnage.
</P>
<P>
   But putting so high a premium on bloodless combat and so much
faith in high technology has also raised some troubling questions.
One is whether the electronic razzle-dazzle creates the
expectation, some would say illusion, in the American public that
the new weapons can accomplish every military mission, and
therefore that the loss of any GIs in a future operation is
tantamount to failure. And does that not in turn encourage
commanders to tailor the goals of a mission to insure minimal
casualties?
</P>
<P>
   Another question is whether America's apparent reluctance to
shed blood leads its enemies to conclude that the way to defeat the
United States is to achieve gruesome and televisable casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Some have already concluded just that, including Iraq's Saddam
Hussein, who made clear in a conversation with the U.S. ambassador
on the eve of the 1991 Gulf war that he saw America's sensitivity
to casualties as an exploitable weakness. He told the U.S.
ambassador then, ``Yours is a society which cannot accept 10,000
dead in one battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to technology to reduce carnage is not new. The
introduction of gunpowder 400 years ago, for example, raised
expectations that war would become less gruesome now that men would
not have to hack or bludgeon each other to death. Neither is
America's reluctance to send its boys to die in distant wars new or
surprising, given its geographic insulation from potential foes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if Americans went reluctantly into World War II, it was
still an axiom that waging war meant being prepared to die. When
Patton exhorted his men to do in the other guy, he also told them,
``The real man never lets fear of death overpower his honor, his
duty to his country, and his innate manhood.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made bloodless war so much more tempting for generals
and politicians since then is the power that television has had in
bringing carnage home to the general public, and the development of
ever more sophisticated and accurate long-distance weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the Vietnam War, the public was exposed for the first time to
the realities of the battlefield, and movies like ``Saving Private
Ryan'' have followed by portraying aspects of earlier wars that
censors ruthlessly concealed in Patton's time.
</P>
<P>
   It was the televised horrors that seemed responsible for
transforming initial support for the Vietnam war into fierce public
opposition, and instilled a deep wariness of body bags in the
current generation of leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomenon of warfare being broadcast in relatively
unadulterated form into people's lives, and the need to build
political support to sustain military operations, have caused
political and military leaders to become more and more concerned
about casualties,'' said Michael Peters, a retired Army colonel and
now senior vice president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity has been reinforced by incidents like the failed
mission to save American hostages in Iran, the killing of 241 U.S.
servicemen in 1983 in Beirut in a terrorist bombing, or the images
of the charred bodies of American Rangers killed in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when military commanders launched Operation Desert Storm in
1991, their idea was to hit hard and with minimum casualties,''
said Bernard Trainor, a retired Marine general. ``That was also the
major factor in the decision to end the war.'' Not only were the
commanders wary of losing their men, Trainor added, but for the
first time in history, they also tried to minimize casualties to
the foe, out of reluctance to have the United States appear
needlessly vicious.
</P>
<P>
   By these criteria, Operation Desert Storm was an indisputable
success. Only 299 U.S. servicemen died, out of about a half million
deployed. Less than half of these, 148, were battle deaths.
</P>
<P>
   That achievement, in turn, led to calls for an increased
emphasis on ``stand-off weapons'' and ``force protection'' in
military planning, and thence to a debate that still rages within
the military between advocates of the new, high-tech approach to
warfare and those who believe that trying to make war bloodless was
not really effective, and potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Tilford of the Army War College is among those who argue
that the effectiveness and credibility of an army, and of a
superpower, still ultimately depend on its willingness to send
soldiers into mortal combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new American way of war is being sold by the high-tech
crowd as a nearly bloodless kind of thing,'' he said in an
interview. ``But this is a misinterpretation of what happened in
the Gulf.'' There, he said, America faced an enemy massed in the
open desert with little air cover, and thus easy to spot and hit
from a distance. Yet even there, he said, it took troops on the
ground to finally chase the Iraqis out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Precision, he said, is ``not the answer to all things.'' Though
it can ``degrade'' Iraq's capability, it apparently can not
eliminate the threat of its weapons of mass destruction _ and it
has notably failed to dislodge Saddam, a goal now embraced by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tilford is convinced, moreover, that the American public is more
willing to accept casualties than political and military leaders
believe, if people can be persuaded that the sacrifice is
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the key is to find the balance between maintaining the
credibility of American arms and the constraints American history
and democracy impose.
</P>
<P>
   ``A superpower that doesn't exert its power will lose that power
over time,'' said Robert Ebel, the director of national security
programs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
``But the problem is that we cannot be seen as a ruthless
superpower. So we've got to continuously use our super powers, but
without turning the world against us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine in theory, military historians would argue, but when
it comes to using a cudgel to make the bad guys fall in line,
history is clear: There's no antiseptic or bloodless way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis,'' said Trainor, ``if you want to
radically change the behavior of your opponent, it takes boots on
the ground to do it.''

   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia _ As two Khmer Rouge leaders accused of
killing more than a million people toured this balmy seaside town
with their military escorts and deferential guides Thursday, they
drove past the police station where two Cambodian human-rights
workers were receiving different treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were being held without bail on vague charges after
they advised protesters who demonstrated recently against dumping
toxic waste at the edge of town. Ten of the demonstrators were also
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   It is a contrast that points up the inequities hobbling
Cambodia's development into a democratic state. It also casts a
harsh light on the claim that Cambodia has its own way of dealing
with its crimes and traumas.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge leaders _ Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea _ came in
from the cold on Christmas after three decades of revolution that
included four years of brutal rule from 1975 to 1979. They were
welcomed with flowers and with embraces from Prime Minister Hun Sen
and the former United Nations Secretary- General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, who was in town to promote the French language but
also paid his respects.
</P>
<P>
   Boutros-Ghali, who praised Hun Sen for his policy of ``national
reconciliation,'' said the mass killings by the Khmer Rouge were
the internal affair of a sovereign state, immune from the
``interference'' of outsiders. Cambodians must find their own route
to resolving their human rights issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody sees it this way. The United Nations is
investigating evidence and possible procedures to bring Khmer Rouge
killers to trial if either the Security Council or the Cambodians
agree to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   The process of democratization that the United Nations tried to
initiate in Cambodia at the start of the decade, under
Boutros-Ghali's leadership, has spawned a new cadre of local human
rights workers dedicated to principles of law and justice that
challenge the feudal ways of this politically primitive country.
</P>
<P>
   ``National reconciliation should not be at any cost,'' said Kao
Kim Hourn, head of the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and
Peace, a local human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   In freeing the leaders of the Khmer Rouge, which has collapsed
over the past two years, Cambodia is bucking a worldwide trend
toward accountability. Tribunals are addressing mass killings in
Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Truth commissions have examined
the past in South Africa and Argentina. South Korea has convicted,
then pardoned, two former leaders. Japan has been offering grudging
apologies for its war crimes. Spain is trying to prosecute the
former Chilean dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Even President
Clinton, visiting Africa, expressed regret over America's
participation in the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``While much of the rest of the world is moving, fitfully and
problematically, towards ending impunity for crimes of this
magnitude, Cambodia is taking a giant leap backwards,'' said Steve
Heder, a scholar of the Khmer Rouge who is examining records in
Phnom Penh for the War Crimes Research Office of the American
University Law School. ``This cannot be justified in terms of
stabilizing a fragile democracy. This is not an Argentina or a
Chile where a military apparatus left over from a criminal regime
can threaten stability. There is no solid basis on which to base an
assertion that the Cambodians do not want a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The imprisonment of the human rights workers at the time of the
embrace of the Communist leaders suggests that politics rather than
principle is involved _ that Hun Sen finds it in his own interest
to let one party walk free and not the other. It was Khieu Samphan
himself who crystallized what has emerged over recent years as the
Cambodian approach to accountability for political crimes. ``Let
bygones be bygones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights monitors have pointed out for years that no one has
been held to account, or even seriously investigated, for a series
of political killings, including a grenade attack on a political
rally early last year that killed 16 people and injured more than
100.
</P>
<P>
   After their visit to the beach with their families and aides,
the two Khmer Rouge leaders planned a trip to the ancient temples
at Angkor Wat and then a sentimental homecoming to their respective
villages. ``I need to relax a bit,'' Khieu Samphan said, brushing
past reporters who tried to interview him, ``so please forgive
me.'' He seemed a walking advertisement for a problem that human
rights advocates say is dragging Cambodia down: impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People accused of crimes against humanity and mass murder are
allowed to walk free within Cambodia's borders at the same time
that the government is arresting and imprisoning human rights
workers for carrying out their duties,'' said Sidney Jones, Asia
director of the Washington-based group Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights workers, representing Licadho, Cambodia's
leading rights group, were doing what the United Nations intended
and what the Hun Sen government has claimed to support: trying to
assure that public issues were dealt with in a legal way. They had
reportedly advised protesters on how to prepare a petition and
stage a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people to trust the justice system, there needs to be some
consistency,'' a Western diplomat said. ``And the arrests of the
Licadho workers are a stark reminder that there isn't this
consistency, that there is a gross disparity between the small and
the big in society.''

OLD SCARS ON THE NEW SOUTH AFRICA

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Today's maps don't show they ever
existed. The gates and customs posts that supposedly protected
their borders have all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are driving in South Africa and find yourself gazing
at barren stretches of eroded land, clusters of huts without
electricity or absurdly opulent administration buildings rising
from the heart of a shantytown, you are probably in one.
</P>
<P>
   These are South Africa's ``homelands'' _ apartheid's bizarre
scheme for getting rid of black citizens by dividing them by tribe
and forcing them to live on 10 small, remote patches arbitrarily
designated foreign countries. Legally speaking, they evaporated in
1994 when the country held its first nonracial elections. But
experts say they have left a mighty imprint on this society that
may take decades to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1960s, South Africa's white supremacist
government _ often arriving before dawn with trucks and dogs _
uprooted 3.5 million blacks to resettle them in the homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being torn from their livelihoods, these families lost
whatever wealth they had accumulated. Some were given as little as
$10 for their houses. Their furniture and livestock frequently did
not survive the move. They usually arrived at a plot empty but for
a prefabricated outhouse. There was too little land or water to
farm and they were miles from anything like a job.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to get 80 percent of the population onto 13 percent
of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these homelands remain islands of dismal poverty. Their
incompetent and corrupt administrations, fostered by the former
government, are a huge burden on the new one. Lavish airports,
stadiums and office buildings were built to stroke the egos of
compliant homeland leaders but the ``citizens'' were left in such
poor conditions that they lacked even clean water, leaving the
grandiose schemes useless. Few of the homelands ever attracted any
industry, which doomed the whole scheme to failure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of South Africa's blacks stay there because they
have homes and family ties and the system succeeded in nurturing
tribal allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Community patterns are so firmly established,'' said Richard
Humphries of the Center for Policy Studies, ``that some people just
won't move. They don't want to move.''
</P>
<P>
   The homelands fiction _ which even included passports that were
never taken seriously by other countries _ was expensive to
maintain. But the apartheid government was so intent on it that it
paid the bills and turned a blind eye to theft and faults in the
banana republics it had created.
</P>
<P>
   Many homeland civil servants never had the skills to do their
jobs, so it is no accident that provinces that took over the
administrations of former homelands are unable to deliver services.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report on the civil service warned that special
vigilance was needed in the Eastern Cape and Northern provinces,
which incorporated most of the old homelands. Recently, the Eastern
Cape administration stunned the nation with its callousness. The
province, which is made up largely of the former Xhosa homelands of
Transkei and Ciskei, ran out of money and simply stopped its meager
welfare payments without warning. Elderly people were stranded for
days without food or shelter at welfare payment offices, having
used their last few cents to get there.
</P>
<P>
   The homelands used to employ for the sake of employment and the
new government is now stuck with those people,'' said Xoliswa Hewu,
a researcher with the Institute for Democracy in South Africa.
``Even when they have the money to do something they don't
necessarily have the capacity. They have computers, for instance,
but no one knows how to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of corruption that occurred in the old administrations
is only now becoming clear. The new government says it has already
dropped 60,000 questionable welfare recipients and 20,000
fraudulent disability claimants from its rolls, most of them from
homelands. It has also estimated that it is paying 47,000 ghost
workers, mostly inherited from the former homelands.
</P>
<P>
   And Judge Willem Heath, who heads a new investigative team
looking into corruption, said he is probing 90,000 other cases
involving over $1 billion. Most of the ``rot,'' he has said, is
rooted in the former homeland administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Just last summer, Lucas Mangope, the former head of the most
successful homeland, Bophuthatswana, (bah-POO-taht-swah-nuh) was
convicted on 103 counts of fraud, theft and contravention of
exchange regulations involving about $1.3 million. The 75-year-old
former leader received a two-year suspended sentence and was
ordered to repay hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the other homelands, however, ``Bop'' has done
well. It had a platinum mine and was home to Sun City, a casino
fantasyland of fake jungle and waterfalls in the middle of a
desert. Since it was near Johannesburg but lacked South Africa's
puritanical laws, whites could drive there to indulge in
pornography, gamble and drink on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Now pornography and gambling are legal all over South Africa.
Sun City survives, though not as profitably. Some of Mangope's
excesses, however, remain simply excesses. For instance, he paid
$10 million for a stadium that is rarely used. With 90,000 seats,
it dwarfs all American football stadiums, but lacks overhangs to
block out the desert sun.
</P>
<P>
   Other former homeland leaders have been absorbed into
contemporary politics, some serving in Parliament. Most of them are
members of the ruling African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular holdout is the flamboyant Bantu Holomisa, a
former dictator of the Transkei who came to power by a coup and
then aligned himself with the ANC. He was ousted from the party
after revealing that Nelson Mandela had accepted a huge campaign
donation from Sol Kerzner, the builder of Sun City. But now he has
created a new multiracial party, the United Democratic Movement,
with Roelf Meyer, the former heir apparent of the National Party,
which created apartheid. The new party enjoys wide support in the
former Transkei.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the former homelands may turn out to be more independent
minded than the rest of black South Africa, which continues to
support the ANC overwhelmingly. This is perhaps because life has
improved less in these remote rural areas than it has in the urban
townships.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, there is still talk of creating a new homeland in
South Africa. But it is whites this time who want it for
themselves. The idea is a rallying cry for many of South Africa's
far-right voters. But they are getting nowhere in negotiations with
the ANC.

a prefabricated outhouse. There was too little land or water to
farm and they were miles from anything like a job.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to get 80 percent of the population onto 13 percent
of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these homelands remain islands of dismal poverty. Their
incompetent and corrupt administrations, fostered by the former
government, are a huge burden on the new one. Lavish airports,
stadiums and office buildings were built to stroke the egos of
compliant homeland leaders but the ``citizens'' were left in such
poor conditions that they lacked even clean water, leaving the
grandiose schemes useless. Few of the homelands ever attracted any
industry, which doomed the whole scheme to failure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of South Africa's blacks stay there because they
have homes and family ties and the system succeeded in nurturing
tribal allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Community patterns are so firmly established,'' said Richard
Humphries of the Center for Policy Studies, ``that some people just
won't move. They don't want to move.''
</P>
<P>
   The homelands fiction _ which even included passports that were
never taken seriously by other countries _ was expensive to
maintain. But the apartheid government was so intent on it that it
paid the bills and turned a blind eye to theft and faults in the
banana republics it had created.
</P>
<P>
   Many homeland civil servants never had the skills to do their
jobs, so it is no accident that provinces that took over the
administrations of former homelands are unable to deliver services.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report on the civil service warned that special
vigilance was needed in the Eastern Cape and Northern provinces,
which incorporated most of the old homelands. Recently, the Eastern
Cape administration stunned the nation with its callousness. The
province, which is made up largely of the former Xhosa homelands of
Transkei and Ciskei, ran out of money and simply stopped its meager
welfare payments without warning. Elderly people were stranded for
days without food or shelter at welfare payment offices, having
used their last few cents to get there.
</P>
<P>
   The homelands used to employ for the sake of employment and the
new government is now stuck with those people,'' said Xoliswa Hewu,
a researcher with the Institute for Democracy in South Africa.
``Even when they have the money to do something they don't
necessarily have the capacity. They have computers, for instance,
but no one knows how to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of corruption that occurred in the old administrations
is only now becoming clear. The new government says it has already
dropped 60,000 questionable welfare recipients and 20,000
fraudulent disability claimants from its rolls, most of them from
homelands. It has also estimated that it is paying 47,000 ghost
workers, mostly inherited from the former homelands.
</P>
<P>
   And Judge Willem Heath, who heads a new investigative team
looking into corruption, said he is probing 90,000 other cases
involving over $1 billion. Most of the ``rot,'' he has said, is
rooted in the former homeland administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Just last summer, Lucas Mangope, the former head of the most
successful homeland, Bophuthatswana, (bah-POO-taht-swah-nuh) was
convicted on 103 counts of fraud, theft and contravention of
exchange regulations involving about $1.3 million. The 75-year-old
former leader received a two-year suspended sentence and was
ordered to repay hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the other homelands, however, ``Bop'' has done
well. It had a platinum mine and was home to Sun City, a casino
fantasyland of fake jungle and waterfalls in the middle of a
desert. Since it was near Johannesburg but lacked South Africa's
puritanical laws, whites could drive there to indulge in
pornography, gamble and drink on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Now pornography and gambling are legal all over South Africa.
Sun City survives, though not as profitably. Some of Mangope's
excesses, however, remain simply excesses. For instance, he paid
$10 million for a stadium that is rarely used. With 90,000 seats,
it dwarfs all American football stadiums, but lacks overhangs to
block out the desert sun.
</P>
<P>
   Other former homeland leaders have been absorbed into
contemporary politics, some serving in Parliament. Most of them are
members of the ruling African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular holdout is the flamboyant Bantu Holomisa, a
former dictator of the Transkei who came to power by a coup and
then aligned himself with the ANC. He was ousted from the party
after revealing that Nelson Mandela had accepted a huge campaign
donation from Sol Kerzner, the builder of Sun City. But now he has
created a new multiracial party, the United Democratic Movement,
with Roelf Meyer, the former heir apparent of the National Party,
which created apartheid. The new party enjoys wide support in the
former Transkei.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the former homelands may turn out to be more independent
minded than the rest of black South Africa, which continues to
support the ANC overwhelmingly. This is perhaps because life has
improved less in these remote rural areas than it has in the urban
townships.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, there is still talk of creating a new homeland in
South Africa. But it is whites this time who want it for
themselves. The idea is a rallying cry for many of South Africa's
far-right voters. But they are getting nowhere in negotiations with
the ANC.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Last week, while governments and the press abroad
dwelled on the harsh sentences meted out to Chinese dissidents,
exuberant middle-class couples crowded into the newly opened Ikea
warehouse store here, snapping up stylish, modestly priced
furniture and housewares.
</P>
<P>
   As the Chinese and American governments sparred over human
rights, moviegoers rushed to see the season's hit, ``Be There or Be
Square,'' a romantic comedy filmed in Los Angeles that
affectionately caricatures the United States and the Chinese who go
there to seek their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Among ordinary Chinese people, it would seem, the current
crackdown on democracy activists has registered only faintly, if at
all. Ask even well-educated professionals what they think about
people like Xu Wenli or Wang Youcai, two of the four democracy
advocates who received prison terms of a decade or more, and they
are apt to call them brave but stupid men who sacrificed themselves
with no chance of success. Many Chinese are bewildered by all the
attention outsiders give these cases, asserting, as one lawyer did,
that ``these things just have no affect on our daily lives now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that people are entirely unaware of the virtues of free
speech and politics. But they know that while there is little room
for dissent these days, they can pursue exciting new options in
their own lives. Many of them just assume that the society will
eventually have to liberalize. The biggest threat to their personal
freedoms, many say, would be a souring of Chinese-American
relations that might strengthen conservative forces here.
</P>
<P>
   Though audiences are streaming to see ``Be There or Be Square''
for a good laugh rather than for a sociology lesson, the movie's
popularity and themes are revealing. The film, which is directed by
Feng Xiaogang, deftly plays on Chinese stereotypes about America
and about themselves, and viewers are sophisticated enough to see
past the caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Los Angeles is horrid: Robbers lurk around every
corner and wide-eyed immigrants at first seem destined for drudgery
or jail. But as the two main characters zoom about in their cars,
have amusing encounters with the police and create their own
niches, the essential, refreshing freedom of California shines
through.
</P>
<P>
   The male lead, played by the comic actor Ge You, is an appealing
but shiftless man who has spent a decade living in a trailer,
selling other Chinese immigrants everything from dubious insurance
policies to graveyard plots. When the female lead, played by Xu
Fan, arrives in town, pretty but penniless, he warns her that there
is good news and bad news about America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to China,'' he says. ``This is a terrible place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, so what is the good news?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the good news,'' he replies. Then: ``Do you want to
work as a stripper?''
</P>
<P>
   She declines the offer and after years of perseverance she
achieves a decent living in the promised land and, of course, the
two fall in love. America is a land of opportunity after all.
</P>
<P>
   Americans here sometimes have a hard time understanding how many
Chinese can simultaneously appreciate the freedom of the West _ a
growing number of professionals have studied in the United States _
and readily dismiss the dissidents as foolish idealists. The vast
majority feel they are finally getting a chance to savor freedom in
their personal lives and work, and they want to enjoy the fruits of
modern society. The last thing most of them want is upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Chinese, dissidents like Xu Wenli are devoting their
lives to an abstract cause. The late philosopher Isaiah Berlin
famously said there are two types of intellectuals, the foxes who
know many things and the hedgehogs who know one big thing. Xu and
many of his colleagues in the democracy movement are hedgehogs,
with their minds focused laserlike on their quest and a
determination that transcends bravery.
</P>
<P>
   Xu has already spent 12 years in prison and he assumed, when he
started speaking out again this year, that he would probably be
imprisoned again. In the face of repeated warnings and detentions,
he stepped up the organization of a new political party and other
activities to promote freedom.
</P>
<P>
   And what did he talk about after his sham trial on Dec. 22, when
he was granted a final half-hour with his wife before starting a
13-year prison sentence? ``He said that the charge of subverting
state power made no sense,'' his wife later said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was legally irrational because state power comes
from the citizens,'' she said as she recounted, proudly, the
detailed legal and political analysis her husband gave her in their
final minutes together. He told her his prison term would give him
time to ``think things over very calmly and reflect on what has
happened and what should be done.'' He did, before he was finished,
express concern about their daughter and tell his wife _ a
remarkably dedicated person in her own right _ to look after her
health.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, some of the veteran dissidents sound almost
robotic ticking off their latest analysis of the global forces and
domestic politics that affect the democracy movement. But the
analysis is often brilliant, and the monotone reflects minds that
are wholly concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   What sustains these dissidents is an article of faith: that
freedom of speech and association is central to the good of a
modern society. If a single idea drives them, it is a big idea,
however pushed aside it is in today's China.
</P>
<P>
   As many citizens and even government officials will tell you,
Chinese today can think what they want and say what they want so
long as they do not organize against the Communist Party.
First-time visitors, having read about repression here, are often
surprised at how ordinary things appear: lively newspapers and
magazines, fast-paced television news programs and endless
commercials for cosmetics and electronic gear. Severe repression
singles out a small number of people, and most of the rest accept
the Party's limits, with little apparent pain.
</P>
<P>
   Harder to gauge is the cost to people in terms of cynicism and
even moral corrosion of blanking out certain kinds of thoughts; of
mouthing hackneyed party phrases in some settings while speaking
one's true mind in others, and of taking it for granted that all
news is subtly crafted to serve the interests of the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   It may be true that social evolution, propelled by economic and
technical change, will eventually bring a free and democratic
China, though there is no sign this will happen any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, people like Xu Wenli and Wei Jingsheng, who is
now in exile in the United States after spending much of his adult
life in prison, will keep pushing as they can. Only time will tell
whether their countrymen will some day honor them for their
persistence, and their suffering.

   Chinese Got Arms Secrets, House Panel Says
</P>
<P>
   A special House committee concluded that over the past two
decades China obtained, sometimes through theft, some of the United
States' most sensitive military secrets, including designs for
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's findings confirmed recent Clinton administration
assessments that information given to Chinese scientists by two
U.S. satellite companies helped Beijing improve its ability to
launch satellites and long-range missiles.

classified material it covers, but Congress plans to make a

   Europe Greets the Euro
</P>
<P>
   The euro, the currency common to 11 European countries, arrived
on Jan. 1. So must francs and marks be traded in now? Far from it.
There won't even be euro coins and bills until 2002, and local
currency will be good for six months after that.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, euros will exist mainly in the dark recesses of
computers at banks and stock exchanges, though they will show up in
credit-card bills and traveler's checks. But for travelers to
Europe, price comparisons should become easier.

   Early holiday sales figures for Internet retailers were stronger

   One consumer survey suggested that online sales would reach $5

   Fallout From Bus Crashes
</P>
<P>
   The cruel fact is that if people climb into vehicles and hit the
road, some will die. So the question is: What's the safest way to
travel?
</P>
<P>
   A spate of bus crashes in New Jersey on the busy routes to
Atlantic City has politicians calling for new safety measures. But
the statistics show that this is an extremely safe means of travel.
</P>
<P>
   Of 41,967 highway deaths in 1997, large trucks accounted for

<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., took a big step toward a presidential

committee to begin raising money for a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the first Republican to signal his plans, is a war hero
who took on his party's leadership in pressing, unsuccessfully, for
campaign finance reform and anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said one reason for the timing of McCain's
announcement was to upstage his many rivals and draw press coverage
before the White House scandal again dominates the news.

   Switzerland's first woman president _ and the first Jew in the

votes in recent years. Her presidency comes amid recent revelations
questioning Switzerland's cherished myths about its neutrality
during World War II.

   Octuplet Mother Goes Home
</P>

   The Houston woman who gave birth to octuplets last month left

27. Nkem Chukwu and her husband, Iyke Louis Udobi, said they were
too busy caring for their seven surviving babies to get involved in
ethical debates over the births.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors are suggesting guidelines to help regulate the use
of the advanced fertility drugs that Ms. Chukwu and others have
taken, because too many resulting babies die or suffer lifelong
medical problems. Louis said the family didn't want to rehash its
history of fertility treatments: ``That is in the past. Now all of
our concerns must be for caring for the babies.''

participating in some type of work activity, the Clinton
administration reported.

   Jobs are plentiful in a booming economy. But Rep. Sander Levin,

less than $8 an hour.

   Europe Greets the Euro
</P>
<P>
   The euro, the currency common to 11 European countries, arrived
on Jan. 1. So must francs and marks be traded in now? Far from it.
There won't even be euro coins and bills until 2002, and local
currency will be good for six months after that.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, euros will exist mainly in the dark recesses of
computers at banks and stock exchanges, though they will show up in
credit-card bills and traveler's checks. But for travelers to
Europe, price comparisons should become easier.

   Online Shopping Takes Off
</P>
<P>
   Early holiday sales figures for Internet retailers were stronger
than even the most bullish predictions of a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   One consumer survey suggested that online sales would reach $5
billion. That would be four times the total sales last year between
Thanksgiving and Christmas and twice expectations for this year of
$2.3 billion in sales. While the data were preliminary, they sent
many electronic-commerce stocks soaring.

   Fallout From Bus Crashes
</P>
<P>
   The cruel fact is that if people climb into vehicles and hit the
road, some will die. So the question is: What's the safest way to
travel?
</P>
<P>
   A spate of bus crashes in New Jersey on the busy routes to
Atlantic City has politicians calling for new safety measures. But
the statistics show that this is an extremely safe means of travel.
</P>
<P>
   Of 41,967 highway deaths in 1997, large trucks accounted for
5,355; just 41 involved tour buses. ``What,'' asked a bus industry
official, ``is the problem that you're trying to solve?''

   McCain Tests the Water
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., took a big step toward a presidential
candidacy in 2000 by announcing the formation of an exploratory
committee to begin raising money for a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the first Republican to signal his plans, is a war hero
who took on his party's leadership in pressing, unsuccessfully, for
campaign finance reform and anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said one reason for the timing of McCain's
announcement was to upstage his many rivals and draw press coverage
before the White House scandal again dominates the news.

   Woman in Top Swiss Post
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's first woman president _ and the first Jew in the
largely ceremonial top post _ took office Friday. Ruth Dreifuss,
58, was elected in December in one of the narrowest Parliamentary
votes in recent years. Her presidency comes amid recent revelations
questioning Switzerland's cherished myths about its neutrality
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dreifuss said she viewed her election as an opportunity for
the nation to come to terms with its ``complex and
conflict-loaded'' wartime history.

   Octuplet Mother Goes Home
</P>
<P>
   The Houston woman who gave birth to octuplets last month left
the hospital three days after the death of one of the infants Dec.
27. Nkem Chukwu and her husband, Iyke Louis Udobi, said they were
too busy caring for their seven surviving babies to get involved in
ethical debates over the births.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors are suggesting guidelines to help regulate the use
of the advanced fertility drugs that Ms. Chukwu and others have
taken, because too many resulting babies die or suffer lifelong
medical problems. Louis said the family didn't want to rehash its
history of fertility treatments: ``That is in the past. Now all of
our concerns must be for caring for the babies.''

   A Conductor Has a Coughing Fit
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy is an often overlooked skill among musicians,
something needed to deal both with one another and with audiences.
Under provocation, that diplomacy can break down, as it did at a
New York Philharmonic concert last week. Frustrated by what he
called ``uncontrolled coughing'' during an intense moment in the
third movement of the Shostakovich Fifth Symphony, Kurt Masur, the
orchestra's music director, stopped the performance and left the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners who were equally annoyed by their neighbors' unmuted
hacking applauded when he stepped off the podium. The coughers got
the message too: When he returned about two minutes later, Masur
was able to finish the concert in relative peace.
</P>
<P>
   Unmuffled coughing has become an unfortunate trademark of New
York audiences. Touring musicians and well-traveled concertgoers
complain about it, and some concert halls now station bins of free
cough drops for ailing patrons who don't want to write off their
sometimes costly concert tickets. Articles in program books
regularly decry coughing, candy unwrapping, page turning, jewelry
rattling and noisy watches, beepers and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   It may always have been thus. When Franz Liszt performed for
Czar Nicholas I in St. Petersburg, the czar, no fan of music,
carried on a loud conversation with a lady friend until Liszt
stopped playing and stepped away from the piano. When the czar
asked what was wrong, Liszt cloaked his anger in diplomacy. ``When
the emperor speaks,'' he said, ``music ought to be silent.''

   Adding a Stitch in Time
</P>
<P>
   Since the time of Isaac Newton, many scientists have maintained
that the solar system is a big clock that keeps perfect time and
never runs down. Alas, celestial goings-on are rarely quite as neat
as the explanations devised by humans, and the solar system now
seems rather creaky compared with the atomic clocks used by the
world's official timekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Compensating for tiny imperfections in the earth's spin and in
the definition of a second in atomic terms, the world's time czars
decreed the addition of a leap second on New Year's Eve, slightly
lengthening 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Leap seconds became necessary in 1972 after scientists redefined
the standard second as the time it takes for a cesium atom to
vibrate 9,192,631,770 times. Unfortunately, some finagling is
needed to synchronize the atomic second with the less accurate and
slightly mismatched rotation of the Earth. Were it not for leap
seconds inserted now and then, the sun would rise at noon 10,000
years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Earth's rate of spin changes unpredictably, it is
impossible to forecast when the next leap second will be needed.
That decision will be made by the International Earth Rotation
Service, a part of the Paris Observatory that blows the whistle
whenever the difference between solar time and atomic time rises to
9/10 of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's was the 22nd leap second needed to keep timekeeping
reasonably correct. (The last one was added on June 30, 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you will make good use of it,'' admonished Dr. Donald
Sullivan, chief of the Time and Frequency Division of the National
Institute of Standards and Technology.

<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ From the terrace of his home on the outskirts of
Baghdad, a carpet dealer named Ziad al-Kadhimi watched the
mid-December bombing while sipping a fruit drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It broke some windows in our house, but we saw it more or less
as a show,'' al-Kadhimi said. ``Bombing is nothing. Maybe it hits a
few military buildings, but it doesn't really affect ordinary
people. The sanctions hurt a hundred times more.''
</P>
<P>
   In much of the outside world, the U.S.-led bombing campaigns
against Iraq that have been launched periodically since the end of
the Persian Gulf war in 1991 are viewed as devastating though
perhaps necessary assaults. Many Westerners assume that when this
country is not being bombed, it enjoys relative tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis assert just the opposite. They say that bombings are
increasingly precise and all but harmless to civilians, while
economic sanctions devastate their entire society.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq eight years ago as
part of an effort to force President Saddam Hussein to curb his
weapons development program, compensate Kuwaitis for his 1990
invasion of their country, and loosen his despotic rule.
</P>
<P>
   As in some other places where sanctions have been imposed, they
do not appear to have had much of the desired political effect.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats say they are steadily weakening Saddam by showing
senior officials and clan leaders that Iraq faces only hardship as
long as he is in power.
</P>
<P>
   Others are dubious.
</P>
<P>
   What seems clear, however, is that the sanctions have plunged
this once-prosperous country into poverty, and in the process
created deepening anti-Western and especially anti-American
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which is the principal backer of
sanctions, has vowed to use its veto in the United Nations Security
Council to prevent them from being lifted. It has not, however,
ruled out supporting expansion of a U.N. program under which Iraq
is allowed to sell limited amounts of oil and use part of the
income to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials fear that lifting sanctions would allow the Iraqi
government to import an array of products it would use to rebuild
its arsenal. They point to Iraq's invasion of Iran in 1980 and of
Kuwait in 1990 as evidence that Saddam's regime is incurably
aggressive and untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington pride themselves on the pains they have
taken to assure that U.S. bombs hit only military targets in Iraq,
and to keep civilian casualties to an absolute minimum. But at the
same time, they assert that the sanctions, which probably kill more
civilians each month than bombs have killed since 1991, are a
regrettable necessity.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, therefore, that many people here and
elsewhere are increasingly cynical about U.S. claims that the
United States has no desire to hurt ordinary Iraqis. Because of
tight censorship, Iraqis know nothing about Saddam's purchases of
luxury items for his palaces over the last few years. They are
acutely aware, however, of their daily hardships, and
unhesitatingly blame them on the United States and President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the human cost of sanctions is worth what they may
accomplish in curbing or changing the Iraqi regime is being hotly
debated at the United Nations and in many world capitals. Russia,
France and China, together with several Arab countries, have called
for new approaches that could lead to lifting or relaxation of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. humanitarian workers here are among the most outspoken
critics. Their last chief, Denis Halliday, resigned his post in
protest three months ago and said sanctions ``are starving to death
6,000 Iraqi infants every month, ignoring the human rights of
ordinary Iraqis and turning a whole generation against the West.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Baghdad office last week, Farid Zarif, deputy director of
the U.N. humanitarian aid program here, held up a pencil as an
example of items that may not be imported under sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are told that pencils are forbidden because carbon could be
extracted from them that might be used to coat airplanes and make
them invisible to radar,'' Zarif said. ``I am not a military
expert, but I find it very disturbing that because of this
objection, we cannot give pencils to Iraqi schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the Security Council in
March that despite the oil-for-food program, which was launched in
1996, about one-fourth of Iraqi children are now malnourished. The
program does not provide Iraqis with protein- and vitamin-rich
foods such as milk, fruit, vegetables, eggs or meat.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. report issued in April concluded that the sanctions
``have had a devastating effect on the majority of the Iraqi
people.'' According to the report, 40,000 more children and 50,000
more adults now die each year in Iraqi hospitals than died before
the sanctions were imposed. Rates of polio, diphtheria,
tuberculosis, malaria and viral hepatitis were said to have sharply
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers like Michel Nahhal, a Lebanese national who has been
living in Baghdad for seven years as a representative of the Middle
East Council of Churches, say they see U.N. statistics vividly
translated into daily life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions are the severest thing that can happen to a
country,'' Nahhal said. ``Here in Iraq, the industrial sector is at
a standstill. Agriculture is collapsing because no fertilizers can
be imported and there is no electricity to power irrigation pumps.
The biggest employer was the oil sector, and that has all but
disappeared. Health conditions are terrible because there are no
pumps to flush the sewage pipes and not enough trucks to pick up
garbage. You see children playing in sewage with no shoes and no
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are trying to survive, trying to make ends meet. It's
very hard on them. They do whatever they can. There is a lot of
prostitution. Boys are prostituting themselves at a very young age.
A few bombs landing on military bases every couple of years is
nothing compared to this.''
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary Iraqis, sanctions have meant an almost surreal
descent into a poverty they believe they do not deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``First I sold my television, then my furniture, then my car,
then my house,'' said Mohammed Abdul Razaq, a retired office
worker. ``Everything that I built up over a lifetime is gone. A
bomb is something you hear far away, or at worst, it kills you in a
second. Sanctions kill you every day.''

other's throat. Together, they disfigured 1998 into one ugly anno.
But couldn't Time have been merciful? Newt would have been a nice
cover boy. He's at least one public nuisance the year rid us of.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt is one of the year's other odd good deeds, bestirred from
the obscurity of periodical raunch to rain fire on the political
system with tales of license and lust.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt is, of course, being universally deplored for offering a
cool $1 million each for provable stories of sexual misadventure by
big-time political figures. This, it is said, is the politics of
personal destruction, and indeed it is. But Flynt's mischief just
may be a necessary passage, a case of making the already bad so
much worse we finally get over it, like a fever breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt's money already has run off one pol _ the conservative
Republican House speaker in waiting, Bob Livingston, caught in
extramarital affairs (note plural) and abandoned by his
fair-weather friends of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his gynecological journal, Hustler, Flynt is being a bit
of a tease about the rest. He claims he is ready to out another 10
_ two Democrats, eight Republicans _ and says still more are being
investigated. This business could go on awhile, like a centipede
dropping the other shoe.
</P>
<P>
   I've always thought that hypocrisy, like cowardice, is one of
the underrated virtues. If we all told all the truth all the time,
this would be a world of constant abrasion, disillusion and combat.
A little hypocrisy, judiciously applied, is benign grease to the
wheels of life. Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, with our politics drawn off into a nasty contest in
moral high dudgeon, as the mighty righteous hurl denunciations from
a crenelated redoubt of assumed virtue, bursting a few balloons
might be useful.
</P>
<P>
   The real work of politics is the maintenance of the commonweal _
sustaining Social Security, shoring up the underclass, keeping the
military ready, perfecting the infrastructure. The agenda doesn't
include the moral harassment of the populace. We go to services for
moral instruction, not to political rallies. We elect
representatives, not saviors.
</P>
<P>
   If the politicians who pose as saints come to realize that as a
result they are sure to be searched for sin, then one of two things
will happen. Only real saints will run under that banner or, rather
more likely, the politics of sanctity will suffer a sudden drop in
numbers, easing the air pressure of the whole political biosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Flynt, it must be admitted, is an unlikely hero and an
unappealing one, but if he can panic the political system back to
its proper business, he will have done a welcome job of work.
</P>
<P>
   Come back, Miles.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Dear Miss Manners
 &HT;    For release Wednesday, Jan. 6, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For reasons other than religious, I bid the year-end holidays a
not-so-fond farewell. Frankly, I'm all partied out. I look and feel
bloated, am sleep-deprived and for the past few weeks have felt
improperly dressed.
</P>
<P>
   No manner of spiral-sliced ham, dark-meat turkey, cashew nuts or
frosty mints can soften the fundamental agony attendant to all
those parties: What to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the invitations come with suggestions, but they
are undecipherable. I have spent this just-past holiday season
asking people at parties _ people usually dressed radically
different from me _ just what was meant by the host's suggestion
that we wear ``business casual'' or ``holiday apparel'' or just
plain ``casual.'' There's also ``sophisticated casual'' as well as
``cocktail dress'' and, likely, dozens more, the most intimidating
being ``black tie optional.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what I interpreted those vague recommendations to
mean, I saw few others at parties dressed the same way. Just last
night, I attended a post-holiday party for a retiring friend and
the invitation called for ``casual'' dress. This was fortified by
an afternoon phone call to my host who told me ``casual'' was what
``casual'' should be: ``Hell, just show up in blue jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   So I came in a nice sports shirt and slacks. When I got inside
the house, I was the only one without a jacket _ until I doubled
back to my car to retrieve the one I brought just in case. I saw no
one in blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, some friends threw a '50s party and told us to
dress as we did in the '50s. Naturally, most women showed up
wearing stiff crinoline under their hoop skirts and the men arrived
in white T-shirts, black pegged pants, white socks and black penny
loafers. My wife was more reflective of her days in the '50s. She
stuffed a pillow under her skirt and came as the pregnant woman she
was in the '50s, and I showed up in an Army uniform, as that was my
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   The more intriguing dress suggestion this past holiday season
called for ``holiday apparel.'' Inasmuch as the party was for Jan.
1, I was not quite certain what holiday it was we were celebrating.
I pondered for a moment the traditional New Year's look of either a
diaper or a long robe with a scythe but concluded that wouldn't
play out well.
</P>
<P>
   And just how timely is it to come to a party on New Year's night
dressed as Santa's elf or the jolly old boy himself?
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, just about every male wore a coat and tie and
the females were dressed, as they say, ``to the gills'' _ an
expression I never have been able to figure out. (That, and ``the
man smokes like a fish.'')
</P>
<P>
   What I did over the protracted party period was to wear pretty
much the same thing, no matter what the invitation said, always
backing myself up with something left in the car; a tie, a jacket,
a dress shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, I am certain, there is a book that explains what the
myriad suggested apparel expressions mean, and if there isn't, then
someone ought to write it. There are millions of persons floating
around this world with invitations in their hands and laden with 16
different kinds of earrings or ties, trying to figure out which and
what might be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   And while we're on the party subject, when a lovely buffet table
is presented and you have the salad plate in one hand and the
dinner plate in the other, is it all right to stuff the silverware
in your jacket pocket? Or is the back pocket more acceptable?
</P>

 &HT;    Bad rap: Georgia's Y2K readiness defended
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They say it politely, but some city managers across
the state think Mike Hale got it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, Georgia's chief of information technology, last month told
freshman state lawmakers that plenty of municipalities and county
governments are unprepared for the Y2K crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That's the moment _ Jan. 1, 2000 _ when our computer-dependent
society is predicted to lose its electricity, water, sewage
treatment plants, bank statements, defense satellites and
collective wits because computers won't be able to read the new
date ending in ``00.''
</P>
<P>
   The job of exterminating the millennium bug, as some call it,
must be done in the next 12 months. Hale says his remarks were
meant to alert the new class of lawmakers, who take their oaths
this week, to the reality that their districts might need
technological guidance in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as if to underscore Hale's worst fears, Georgia had
the dubious distinction of making The Wall Street Journal's list of
10 least-prepared states for Y2K. Relying on data from the National
Association of State Information Resource Executives, the Journal
said Georgia is only 10 percent ready for the millennium.
(Top-ranked Pennsylvania was listed as 99 percent ready.)
</P>
<P>
   If a snapshot were to be taken of Georgia's Y2K preparedness
right now, it would show vast differences among the 159 counties
and hundreds of cities across the state, admits Bruce Green,
director of the Office of Development, Research and Communications
at the state Department of Community Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   His staff surveyed more than 400 governments to see what they
are doing, and paying, to get ready.
</P>
<P>
   Some city managers, like LaGrange's Patrick Bowie, say they're
already ahead of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we wanted to be unprepared for the millennium, local
businesses are holding our feet to the fire,'' said Bowie. ``We
have several Fortune 500 companies _ Kimberly Clark, Mobil Chemical
and Milliken _ that invited us to meetings at which they put us
under the bright lights and asked us to discuss our Y2K compliance
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Electricity for LaGrange, like that for other Georgia towns and
cities, comes from one of three sources, Bowie said: Georgia Power,
MEAG (the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia) or one of the
spinoff companies formed when Oglethorpe Power diversified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think those entities are sitting back and waiting
unprepared for Y2K to come upon us, do you? I would say Mr. Hale
had it wrong,'' Bowie said.
</P>
<P>
   Millions for compliance
</P>
<P>
   But what about cities that have no Fortune 500 companies?
</P>
<P>
   A new survey of towns and counties by the Georgia Department of
Community Affairs shows that, with 12 months to go, 498
municipalities and counties are aware that time-sensitive computer
chips could pose problems, and most already have begun attacking
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In reply to the question, ``how much have you budgeted for Y2K
compliance?'' 39 counties said they had budgeted a combined total
of $7,344,100 and 75 cities had budgeted a total of $1,910,700.
Those numbers don't include municipalities, like Marietta or
Lawrenceville, that are part of the greater metro Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   Milledgeville's water and sewer director, Barry Jarrett, said
his town's computers already have been refitted at a cost of $6,500
to make sure there are no interruptions in water and sewage
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide water to 40,000 people and have sewage connections
to about 60 percent of homes, and we're doing fine,'' Jarrett said.
``I don't agree with Mr. Hale's remark.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Kennesaw ``is Y2K-ready,'' said Assistant City Clerk
Bonnie Worley.
</P>
<P>
   Not all city planners think a computer breakdown, should one
occur, will mean services come to a screaming halt.
</P>
<P>
   Brunswick's water and sewer director, Bill Powell, said
telemetry (sophisticated measuring) is the only function that
requires computers in the city's water and sewage plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even if those processors malfunctioned, nothing major
would happen. After all, we didn't have computers for the past 100
years but we still provided clean water,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   LaGrange's Bowie agrees that operating without computers for a
while would not significantly alter the flow of utilities in most
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what we do doesn't depend on the date-stamp function
of a computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's preparations for Year 2000 have been underway since
1992, when planners first discussed millennium issues. By mid-1998,
the city had budgeted $6 million to replace its mainframe computer
with personal computers, and work was on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Around Atlanta, metro governments were making similar
preparations. Cobb County commissioners expect to spend $3 million
for a courthouse system and millions more to overhaul other county
computers. Cobb's School Board in February earmarked $506,000 for
Y2K changes.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb County expects to have spent $14 million by the time
technicians have rewritten 3.3 million lines of code to compensate
for Y2K. Fulton County hired Hitachi Data Systems to complete its
conversion at an estimated price tag of $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett County expects its mainframe upgrade will cost $9
million, and the state of Georgia, overall, has allocated $152
million to upgrade its systems, with plans to request more funds
from the General Assembly this month.
</P>
<P>
   MARTA, which last year hired the New Hampshire-based technology
consulting firm Renaissance Worldwide, has not yet published a
bottom line for its Y2K upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   But the transit system wants the Legislature to let it spread
the cost of fixing its computers over five years. Current law calls
for the cost to be paid all in one year, which MARTA said could
result in a hike in fares, now $1.50 a trip.
</P>
<P>
   Is it enough?
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate price tag for Y2K changes won't be fully known
until we're well into the Year 2000, said the DCA's Green.
</P>
<P>
   His staff's survey shows a vast range in the amount of money
that governments set aside for Y2K technology, from $500,000 in
Lowndes County to zero in Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current budget was done before we started Y2K planning,
but we'll use money from our contingency fund,'' a Harris official
reported.
</P>
<P>
   In between sit Twiggs ($1,500), Gilmer ($8,000), Butts
($15,000), Baker ($25,000), Telfair ($25,000), Emanuel ($30,000),
Paulding ($50,000 or less for hardware), Floyd ($50-100,000) and
Jeff Davis ($100,000) counties.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam County said it ``will address Y2K in the '99 budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said the survey results concern him. Clint Mueller with
the Association of County Commissions shares his worry.
</P>
<P>
   Both think county and city managers may not be acting quickly
enough, and that the money may not be spent well.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller looks at The Wall Street Journal rating and shakes his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held five workshops over the past year, we had a satellite
teleconference broadcast to 14 sites, we have Web sites that tell
who the state-approved Y2K consultants are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But one problem that city managers have encountered, and one
that even Mueller, Hale and Green may not have anticipated, is a
phenomenon that Toccoa city manager Bill Lewis calls the ``cover
your rear'' syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Even when new equipment is paid for and installed, suppliers and
vendors often are reluctant to guarantee that what they've sold a
city will operate snafu-free.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said his efforts to find out whether embedded chips will
break down on Jan. 1 have met with resounding silence from the
vendors who have sold a range of equipment to Toccoa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent letters to all our suppliers, all right, but none of
them wants to make any assurances because they're covering their
own rears in case something does go wrong,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, Toccoa has replaced its financial
software, utility billing software and desktop computers at a cost
of about $300,000, but not for Y2K reasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were old and it was time to upgrade, but the end result
was that we believe we are now prepared for Y2K,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, who has been dubbed the state's Y2K project director, said
he really became aware in June that ``remote cities and counties
have an increased risk of failed technology.''
</P>
<P>
   That awareness came during a series of six-hour workshops Hale
gave at five locales across Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was during question-and-answer sessions with
municipal managers that he sensed the lack of Y2K preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he says he saw the results of a survey sent by the
Georgia Public Service Commission to 1,200 electric co-ops, towns
and small utilities-providers asking about their Y2K status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relatively low response rate told me there's a problem out
there,'' Hale said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to The Wall Street Journal figure (10 percent ready),
that's low. I'd say we are closer to 36 percent ready, but I still
believe there are towns out there that are far behind where they
need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The PSC has posted the results of its survey on the Internet at
www.psc.state.ga.us/pscinfo/year%202000/response%20lists.htm
</P>
<P>
   ARE THEY READY?
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Department of Community Affairs surveyed more than
400 city and county governments to determine how ready they are to
deal with the Y2K computer crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the questions and responses:
</P>
<P>
   _ Has anyone in your local government attended any
seminars/courses on this issue?
</P>
<P>
   YES: 43.1 percent
</P>
<P>
   NO: 56.9 percent
</P>
<P>
   _ Does your government have someone designated to coordinate all
Y2K efforts governmentwide?
</P>
<P>
   YES: 62 percent
</P>
<P>
   NO: 38 percent
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you have a budget for Y2K remediation?
</P>
<P>
   YES: 27.2 percent
</P>
<P>
   NO: 72.8 percent
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you have a contingency plan in place for those systems that
may not have been fixed?
</P>
<P>
   YES: 24 percent
</P>
<P>
   NO: 76 percent

 &HT;    Georgia Gov. rejects beltway for home
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Gov. Zell Miller's poll ratings are at an
all-time high as he leaves office. He could have gone to the U.S.
Senate. But he chose to go back to his North Georgia home instead.
</P>
<P>
   I spent some time this week, asking the governor why.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mountains have always jerked me back _ like a dog on a
leash,'' said Miller, packing up his office and trying to explain
his fierce attachment to rural North Georgia: ``There's a
groundedness there _ a certain eternity. It's a place where the
soul never dies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A few times,'' he added with a chuckle,'' I thought the voters
would send me home before I was ready to go. I never needed much
incentive to run again, you know. No outpouring _ just a couple of
nods.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is pretty good at poking fun at himself, but throughout
his 38-year political life, poking fun at his native North Georgia
was off limits. He could go into a rage over negative implications
about the hillbillies in ``them thar hills.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the governor is thin-skinned about criticism of any
kind. No question he appreciates his hard-ball political adviser
James Carville, but he's often more philosopher than politician.
That shows in the 235-page syllabus for the ``Life and Leadership''
course Miller will teach at Young Harris College in his home town
and other places.
</P>
<P>
   The selected readings are full of interesting juxtapositions:
Robert E. Lee's Farewell to his soldiers and Booker T. Wahington's
``Up from Slavery''; Genesis on creation and Rachel Carson on
ecology; the classical philosophy of Plato and Aristotle and
children's classics like ``The Little Steam Engine (that could).''
</P>
<P>
   The romantic poets are his favorites _ John Keats, Percy Bysshe
Shelley. As I skimmed through his selections, I stumbled on four
lines of recent notoriety _ the lines President Bill Clinton read
in his last-ditch effort to fend off impeachment: ``The Moving
Finger writes and having writ/ Moves on; nor all your Piety nor
Wit/ Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line. Nor all your Tears
wash out a Word of it.'' (from ``The Rubayyat'' by Omar Khayam)
</P>
<P>
   The poetry, said the president in his televised speech, was
given to him by a dear friend. ``Yes, I am that friend,'' Miller
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Miller and Clinton seem incongruous friends _
Miller, the homespun teacher, and Clinton, the slick lawyer. But
they became friends when they were both governors of Southern
states, both focused on public education.
</P>
<P>
   Both have greater than 70 percent job approval ratings today.
But Clinton clings desperately to his polls, while Miller ignores
his. Clinton's legacy is uncertain; Miller's is sure. He is the
governor who brought the HOPE scholarships to Georgia, enabling
every youngster who earns a ``B'' high school average to go to
college. He is the governor who initiated the first universal
pre-kindergarten program, distributing free classical music tapes
to every new mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``To govern is to choose,'' Miller says, ``not just battles, but
who you want to help.'' He wanted to help children. He focused on
education to the exclusion of issues critics say he shouldn't have
neglected _ mass transit, and air and water pollution, for example.
He dropped his campaign to remove the confederate battle emblem
from the state flag when political support vanished. He believes
politicans make their greatest mistakes getting caught up in social
issues ``that don't matter at the kitchen table'' _ issues like the
flag, school prayer, abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't find average Americans on the left or on the
right,'' said Miller. ``You'll find them at K-Mart.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 66-year-old Miller returns to his roots, he confirms the
teachings of his greatest mentor, his mother. In his last State of
the State address, he told of sitting on the Miller front porch as
a child, watching car headlights disappear across Brasstown
Mountain. His mother would laugh and say, ``You know what's so
great about this place? You can get anywhere in the world from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Miller named the places, from foreign capitols to
the oval office, that his political journey has taken him. He knows
well it could have taken him to Washington. But, he said,
``Everywhere I've ever been was on my way back home.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Set New Year's resolutions that are easy to keep
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Every year it's the same sad story. Many
Americans with the best of intentions make lofty New Year's
resolutions they can't keep.
</P>
<P>
   They tell themselves they're going to run up the stairs every
day at, say, the One American Center until they drop 20 or 30
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later the only thing they've run up is their tab at
the local saloon. Then they get all disappointed with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   You won't catch this kid falling into that stupid trap. This is
because I know that the key to successful New Year's resolutions is
to make resolutions that are easy to keep. Don't ask too much of
yourself. Don't be too demanding. Promise to spend more time
sitting on your butt. Resolve to do stuff you were going to do
anyway. Resolve to sleep in and go to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to New Year's resolutions, you shouldn't raise the
bar. Instead, you should go to one. Instead of setting goals you
can't reach, make a New Year's resolution like this one:
</P>
<P>
   I promise that if I find myself in the One American Center,
forget the stairs. I'm taking the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another good New Year's resolution: I promise to drink
plenty of cold beer. That shouldn't be too darned difficult.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Here's one of my personal New Year's goals for 1999.
I promise not to take any French cooking classes at Central Market.
</P>
<P>
   I also promise that during the New Year I will not rearrange the
furniture in my living room according to the principles of feng
shui.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, I promise to try to stay out of bars that have the
word ``salad'' as part of their names.
</P>
<P>
   See how easy this is? Even someone with absolutely no willpower
can maintain this regimen.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, here are my other New Year's resolutions for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   I promise that when I order a baked potato, I will cover it with
grated cheese, butter, chives, sour cream and bacon bits.
</P>
<P>
   I promise not to stand up in a karaoke joint and do a solo
performance of ``The Wind Beneath My Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of jogging, I promise to mosey.
</P>
<P>
   I promise not to act presidential by messing around with any
22-year-old interns. I promise not to put myself in a position
where I have to tell a grand jury, ``It depends on what the
definition of `old fool' is.''
</P>
<P>
   I promise to go to Dirty's for a cheeseburger.
</P>
<P>
   I promise to continue my long-standing policy of not getting a
stud run through my tongue.
</P>
<P>
   I promise I will not spend a lot of time trying to find a Furby.
</P>
<P>
   I promise that if some of these rubber-britches-wearing,
pedal-pumping, knock-kneed bicyclists hog the road in front of my
car, I will moon them. (OK, so I lied about that one. But I'd like
to.)
</P>
<P>
   I promise that I will not take dulcimer lessons or join a cult.
</P>
<P>
   I promise that I will attend as many University of Texas
football games as possible and hang out at a lot of tailgate
parties.
</P>
<P>
   I promise that if I hear any bad jokes, I will repeat them.
</P>
<P>
   I promise not to join any club where you can't get in without a
tie and a sport coat. I also promise that I will not to go in for a
tuxedo fitting.
</P>
<P>
   I promise that I will not bore people at parties by talking to
them about my aura.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: An organizer faces the year
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ One of the most intimidating moments of a
year often occurs before it begins. It is when you peel back the
cellophane from a new calendar and look at the days ahead _
unsullied, unblemished, without cross-outs caused by indecision or
arrows and underlines induced by panic.
</P>
<P>
   Tabula rasa, as the philosophers say, a clean slate. Nothing but
possibilities. All blocked off and numbered. Anything that happens
after this point is either a mistake or a complication. It is
downhill from here.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by my organizer, I lead a messy life. It is littered
with phone numbers written in haste, punctuated with triple
underlineage, little arrows and cross-outs. All ineptly corralled
with index tabs. I think back wistfully to the days when my life
used to fit on a wall calendar backed-up by only an address book, a
refrigerator magnet from a pizzeria and disposable things-to-do
lists that lasted little longer than a snooze-alarm dream.
</P>
<P>
   No more. I am cross-indexed. I am marching confidently into the
twilight moments of the 20th century with year-at-a-glance charts,
month-at-a-glance views, and week-at-a-glance blocks. I even have a
little ruler to tell me what week I'm in. A pocket for floppy
disks, a time-zone map and a Fahrenheit-to-Celsius converter in
case you have the urge to tell a Canadian how unseasonably warm
it's been down here.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a to-do list with boxes you can check off to feel
the thrill of accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   I have, in fact, already checked the first box.
</P>
<P>
   I find that to-do lists work better with a running start. That's
why I start with something I've already done, then check off the
box as soon as I write down the task. This way the whole to-do list
process is far less daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Is this cheating? Oh, maybe to the purist. But it's not the sort
of thing one would dare take too far. If you overdo it, your to-do
list would turn into a have-done list. Then you'd need to go to the
office-supply store and get specially printed have-done lists with
their own little tab. And to remember to do this errand, you would
need to write yet another chore on the to-do list. This would, of
course, defeat the entire purpose of cheating and make more work.
</P>
<P>
   My organizer also has another tab marked ``ideas.'' Its pages
are blank. I hold out hope.
</P>
<P>
   To do: Get rid of intimidating ``ideas'' tab.
</P>
<P>
   To do: Find organizer sheets with little boxes and the heading,
``Things Successfully Put Off for More Than a Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiving a good, thick, full-service organizer as a Christmas
gift is a wonderful thing, but it does give a mixed message. Did I
get this under the tree because I seem like the kind of person who
could, perhaps, stand more organization in my life? Do I appear out
of control? Did I miss one birthday too many?
</P>
<P>
   To do: Find out if I've been insulted.
</P>
<P>
   Some might argue that this system, however elaborate and
perfect, is out of date. That the true scheduling compulsive would
be computerized and data-linked. Not so. A silicon-and-wire system
can't give you the perspective that dead-tree and ink can.
</P>
<P>
   A computer screen comes up on the right day with no thickness of
pages past and no future pages unflipped. You have accuracy but not
perspective. No stray phone numbers. No underlines. No drink
strains from far away places.
</P>
<P>
   (To do: Take organizer out for a good time.)
</P>
<P>
   Electronics also deprive one of the flip side of clipping clean,
new pages in place _ the pleasures of tossing the old. Maybe
setting those pages on fire for a bad year. Lingering over them in
a good year.
</P>
<P>
   Perspective. It's something computerized scheduled don't give.
In the old pages, you can find the flight numbers of airplanes met.
Tally up the time spent in an orthodontist's office. Shake your
head at pages dark with appointments, meetings and deadlines.
Wonder if you appreciated those clean expanses go on unaccountably
for pages. Cringe at the still-empty boxes on year-old to-do lists.
</P>
<P>
   (To do: Throw out old to-do lists without reading them.)
</P>
<P>
   This is the change of year you can touch. A ritual for sorting
the past and steeling yourself for the future. No delete key can do
it for you.

 &HT;    For a few bottles of vodka, maybe I'd complain a little less
about being a teacher
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ You think times aren't tough in Russia? Money
is so tight
</P>
<P>
   in the Altai region of southern Siberia that schoolteachers
haven't been paid since February of last year. Local authorities
tried to cut a deal with the unpaid educators - toilet paper and
coffins in lieu of salaries. No takers.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers nixed the idea and it's not too tough to figure out
why. Folks who haven't eaten in a while don't need toilet paper,
and it takes a sick mind to offer hungry people coffins instead of
cabbages.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, an alternative plan was called for and the government
came up with
</P>
<P>
   one: vodka! Fifteen bottles per teacher to kind of tide them
over until the country can scrape up enough rubles to pay its
educators.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, what are the Altai teachers going to do with 15
bottles of vodka apiece? Probably trade most of it for food and
clothing but it wouldn't surprise me if some kept a bottle or two
around the dacha for emergencies, like
</P>
<P>
   snake bite or revolution. I know I would.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolteaching being what it is, I'm thinking a little vodka in
the coffee thermos couldn't hurt. It might even liven up
conversation in the teacher's lounge where we mostly go to gripe.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, like enlisted men, are born bellyachers. It's the
American way. I'm sure that if I didn't grouse about kids and the
thousands of essays I grade each year, I probably would be
considered some kind of deviant and lose my job.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think it's easy; there's an art to being a successful
whiner. Most of it's in the timing. Example: Popular complaint No.
1. ``The cooks in this cafeteria were hired when the Allies closed
down Auschwitz. We made them an offer they couldn't resist.''
Hilarious in the teachers' lounge but falls flat in the food line.
So does, ``In my educated opinion, if vegetables were supposed to
have come all mixed up in a big can, God would have grown them that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Popular complaint No. 2. Do not speak the following words to the
custodian in
</P>
<P>
   January when the boiler has just self-destructed but the blowers
are still running: ``Hey, Benny! The air conditioning's working
great today.'' He will not think this is funny and may try to get
even by tattling to the Director of Support Services that you've
been performing illegal operations on your thermostat with a pair
of scissors.
</P>
<P>
   Little cages and missing control knobs characterize the
thermostats in our building. It's to keep the kids from messing
with them, we're told, but I know better. It's actually a ploy to
keep the teachers in line and remind them of their position in the
pecking order: 1) custodian 2) cooks 3) secretaries 4) bus drivers
5) cheerleading advisor 6)superintendent 7)principal 8) U.P.S.
delivery person 9) teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm not a chronic complainer (although I'm working on it)
but it would be my preference to teach without icicles hanging from
my nose and free of the constant worry that one leg of my long
underwear is suddenly going to drop into
</P>
<P>
   sight.
</P>
<P>
   Each winter the custodian and I play this game of cat and mouse.
I've tried everything from opening the windows and hoping for a
blast of Canadian air
</P>
<P>
   that would cause the system to overcompensate, to the science
teacher's suggestion that I drape a wet paper towel over the
thermostat. Either way, I always get caught. Finally, one of my
students showed me how to stick scissors in the little hole and
turn the control wheel, reminding me of something I learned at
</P>
<P>
   university in Schoolteaching 101: Got a problem? Ask a kid.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what it would be like to teach in Russia where
there are not enough rubles to go around. Somehow I can't picture
doing what I do for toilet paper. My hat is off to those teachers
who keep working for a promise and a few bottles of vodka.
</P>
<P>
   Za vashe zdorovye! (To health!)

 &HT;    Surprise! Everything you read isn't true
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The World Wide Web has become a valuable source of
information for research, whether you're using it for a project at
work or homework.
</P>
<P>
   But if you plan to use the Web as a research aid, you have to
remember there's nothing particularly magic about information from
the Web. Anyone who wishes can have a Web page and, within really
broad limits of decency and the law, there are no rules or
standards about what is placed on the page.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the really far-out pages that offer proof UFOs exist,
or that the Holocaust did not happen, or that the Earth is flat,
aren't the problem. Common sense helps filter out the obvious
misinformation. It is the well-intentioned and articulate that pose
the most problems. These folks are doing their best to spread the
word, but _ many times _ the word is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing all that won't change your grade from a D to an A, and
it is unlikely your boss will excuse a costly error based on it.
But armed with the knowledge the Web doesn't have any lock on the
truth, there are techniques that let you enjoy the value of the
Web's vast storehouse of information while protecting yourself from
misinformation.
</P>
<P>
   The safest way to approach the Web is to navigate instead of
surf. If you're familiar with how navigating by the stars works,
you know that ships once found their true position by taking
sightings on the stars. Using just one star wasn't enough to
pinpoint your location. It would just give you a general idea of
where you are. You needed three or more star positions to get a
good idea of your location.
</P>
<P>
   When you navigate the Net, the same techniques can help filter
out some of the misinformation. Use three or more sources and
compare the information you find. The likelihood of getting
accurate information increases when you find agreement on the basic
facts from several different sources.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not enough. Anyone who has ever worked at a newspaper
is aware how misinformation from an old story can be added to a new
story for background. Over the years, the misinformation can be
repeated dozens of times. And with that repetition comes added (and
undeserved) credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happens with information on the Web. The virtues
of the computer at duplicating information by simply copying and
pasting make it more likely that a nifty (true or not) bit of
information will find its way to another Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to take some added star sightings that will help you
ferret out this kind of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Start by evaluating the credibility of the page. If, for
instance, you are reading about cancer treatment on a page
sponsored by the federal government or the American Cancer Society,
then the odds of it being credible go way up. But, just as in real
life, you should be careful when you don't know anything about the
person or group furnishing the information.
</P>
<P>
   There's still an extra step that you can take. Use a recognized
source book in the field that you are researching and see how the
information there jibes with what you are reading on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   And many books that have a recent publication date cite Web
resources, giving these sites extra points on the credibility
scale.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is a terrific source of information. Don't be afraid to
use it. Instead, simply avoid the temptation to believe that, just
because you read it on the Internet, it is true.

 &HT;    Microsoft launching new Explorer
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ironically, competition for the best Mac Web browser
has not slackened a bit between Microsoft and Netscape during the
long weeks of the government's antitrust suit against the world's
dominant software provider.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is readying the next version of its Internet Explorer
browser, which will probably be previewed at the MacWorld
convention in San Francisco this week.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of Internet Explorer comes only weeks after
Netscape released the latest version of the Mac version of its
Communicator suite of browser software.
</P>
<P>
   That version has won high praise from reviewers, who gave
Communicator the edge, however fleeting, in its competition with
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Now Communicator may lose that edge if leaks and initial online
chatter about Internet Explorer prove true. This version, dubbed
4.5, promises easier use.
</P>
<P>
   In Internet Explorer 4.5, Microsoft has taken an approach that
differs from its normal software strategy. It has decided to focus
on tweaking Internet Explorer rather than adding tons of new
features.
</P>
<P>
   What a novel idea for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company set out to reduce the number of mouse
clicks and keystrokes users had to make to do common tasks. One way
is through a new feature called autofill, which will be familiar to
users of Microsoft's Word and Excel products.
</P>
<P>
   Like in these programs, autofill will automatically fill in
personal data in a Web site registration after you enter the first
few letters of your name.
</P>
<P>
   There's also new features that improve printing from the Web.
For example, now you can set Internet Explorer to reduce a Web page
to fit a standard 8 1/2x11 sheet of printer paper. This feature
also mimics Microsoft's other products.
</P>
<P>
   Like Word and Excel, Internet Explorer will now automatically
replace a needed file if accidently deleted from its system.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Explorer remains free, and you will be able to download
a copy of the latest version from the Microsoft Web site after its
release.

 &HT;    A few 1999 resolutions for the road
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is the time of year we typically make resolutions
about things like losing weight, being better organized, being
punctual or trying not to procrastinate. Most of these require more
than a spur-of-the-moment commitment, so we end up breaking most of
them before the holiday decorations find their way back to the
attic.
</P>
<P>
   This year, I decided to focus my resolutions on a subject I can
address one trip at a time. That, hopefully, will not only improve
my outlook, but also those of my fellow drivers. My 1999
resolutions are all directed at being a more aware, courteous and
safer driver:
</P>
<P>
   _ I will not tailgate.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will, when stopped in traffic, leave a minimum of
three-quarters of a car length between myself and the next vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will not ride in the left lane.
</P>
<P>
   _ If people are passing me on the right, I will take that as a
directive to move to the right.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will only talk on my hand-held cell phone in the far right
lane (or, better yet, when standing still).
</P>
<P>
   _ I will not ``brake-check'' the car behind me (even if it is so
close I can't see its grille).
</P>
<P>
   _ If I drive an 18-wheeler on a four-lane highway, I will never
attempt to pass another truck while going uphill.
</P>
<P>
   _ When I rent a moving truck, I will limit my travel to the far
right lane.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will do my best to maintain the speed limit and/or keep up
with the flow of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will not be a moving roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will never make a left turn from the right lane or a right
turn from the left lane.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will always strap toddlers and babies into their car seats.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will never move a vehicle until all occupants have buckled
their seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will never allow children under the age of 12 to sit in the
front seat of a vehicle equipped with a passenger-side air bag.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will not allow people or dogs to travel in the bed of my
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will not stop in the ``keep moving'' lane.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will stop for red lights, and I won't charge through yellow
lights.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will make sure my vehicle's headlights are properly aligned
so I can see, and so I won't blind other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will never drive in the rain or fog without turning on my
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will use my turn signals.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will make sure my brake lights and turn signals work.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will try to refrain from giving my spouse more driving
instructions/directions than he really wants.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will work hard to ``chill'' when in Atlanta traffic and try
to be patient with other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   If none of this works, then next year I'm asking Santa for a
tank for the next millennium.

 &HT;    Interactive pagers intelligently handle e-mail, faxing as well
as customary duties
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Your daughter is airborne, flying to Los Angeles,
where her uncle is to pick her up at LAX. You get an urgent call.
The uncle is detained, but a neighbor, a young lady dressed in red,
will pick her up instead. No problem. You get on the computer,
dispatch an e-mail to the daughter, and she receives it on her
interactive pager as she rides the down escalator to baggage claim.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra, your spouse, is making her final business rounds in
Seattle, preparing to fly back to Atlanta on Friday afternoon.
Suddenly, in a stroke of genius, you suggest she pick up some
smoked salmon, a family favorite, to brighten up the weekend. No
problem. You e-mail her on her interactive pager, she sees the
message and instructs the cabby to take the side trip en route to
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Or, your wife is having her second child, and at the hospital
you decide to do it right this time. You use your interactive pager
to e-mail messages to all four grandparents simultaneously, and a
fax to Grandpa Joe, who rarely looks at his e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of the latest in hand-held computing, the
interactive pager. Except for its beep, it has little in common
with its cousin, the ordinary pager. The BellSouth Interactive
Pager, a companion of mine for several weeks, is different because
it sends and receives information. Like an ordinary computer, it
has directories and an electronic address book.
</P>
<P>
   It sends e-mail and faxes more simply than the personal
computer, communicating with other interactive pagers in seconds
across thousands of miles. The communication with computers via the
Internet occurs in four or five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, you cannot reach it automatically by phone as you do
regular pagers. But a toll-free phone call to an operator, on duty
24 hours a day, allows you to send an alert or a dictated text
message.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the interactive pager system is the handy,
sophisticated pager, which is actually a radio that communicates
with a wireless network that is similar to a cell phone network _
but entirely separate.
</P>
<P>
   The low-powered radio contains circuitry that allows you to
write messages and hold them until you want to send them. And it
instructs the network, by way of the nearest communications tower,
to take the message and deliver it directly to another pager, or to
a computer or a fax machine. The network is able to locate the
target, and hold the message for transmission later if the computer
or fax or pager happens to be turned off, or out of range.
</P>
<P>
   This sophisticated technology was first brought together in 1993
to serve mostly businesses, which mostly needed a high level of
communication between offices and field forces. It still does that,
but now since BellSouth bought the business, it is being
transformed into a consumer service as well.
</P>
<P>
   Invented by a company called Ram Mobile Data, which was
purchased in 1998 by BellSouth, the wireless network was used
mostly to serve major corporations with customized programs.
</P>
<P>
   But with the purchase of the company, William Lenahan, president
of BellSouth Wireless Data, said he foresees hundreds of thousands
of individual customers, many eager to join what Chuck Napier of
Convergence Corp. calls ``the mobile digirati.''
</P>
<P>
   As you use the little machine, it does achieve the feel of a
companion. Sitting in a meeting, for instance, you could hear a
speaker talking about the possibility of war between two former
Soviet republics. You could flash a message back to the office to
check company investments there, without leaving the table.
</P>
<P>
   You could, as I did, run across a gift item at Lenox Square
mall, just right for a friend. You could flash a query about the
person's size, and get the answer when she returns from lunch.
</P>
<P>
   You could assign or loan a pager to a teen, and keep track of
his needs, problems or comings and goings during the day, directly
from your office computer.
</P>
<P>
   What is startling is the reach of the system.
</P>
<P>
   And it really works. Recently I loaned my pager to my nephew,
Andre Wallace, who was leaving by plane for a business trip to the
West Coast. His plan was to land in Los Angeles and drive up the
coast to the Bay Area, making several stops along the way.
</P>
<P>
   When he landed at LAX, he flashed me the arrival message as he
took the escalator down to the baggage center. His progress reports
included one from the car as he motored to his hotel, and notices
from various towns and villages as he made his way up through the
central valley. We were in constant touch.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive pager may sound reminiscent of the ordinary
satellite-based pagers, but it is quite different. Commands are not
broadcast by satellite and picked up by the pager wherever it may
happen to be. Instead, interactive pagers receive messages
addressed only to them.
</P>
<P>
   The little devices are intuitive. If you put a period after a
word, it automatically capitalizes the next letter to begin another
sentence. A single letter ``i'' automatically capitalizes.
</P>
<P>
   The network, sure to serve additional devices, will become the
means to connect hand-held computers, BellSouth announced in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive pager, which costs about $250, connects to the
service for about $25 a month, comparable to cellular phone
service. Some 25,000 ``anytime'' characters can be transmitted
without additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service probably will appeal mostly to business
professionals, and users in field service such as sales,'' said
Janet Boudris, senior vice president for marketing at BellSouth
Wireless Data, based in Woodbridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have found is that many subscribers get them for
business use, but in time they begin to adapt them to personal use,
for instance to stay in touch with children and spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   This all sounds like the pattern when cellular phones were
introduced to the general population in the early 1980s, when the
initial customers were businesses but then spread into the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unanticipated developments, Boudris said, is deaf
people have been attracted to the devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many feel this is the first handy communications device `just
for the deaf,' so practical because it can alert the user by
vibrations,'' she said. ``Then they can communicate in writing.''
</P>
<P>
   One warning, however. The network coverage of the interactive
pager is in its early stages in terms of individual consumer use. I
found a totally dead spot in Stone Mountain, though the signal was
fine just a mile or two away in south DeKalb County and the same
distance westward in East Lake.
</P>
<P>
   As you should with wireless telephones, it would be advisable to
check signal strength in areas where you work or spend the most
time to verify service is satisfactory _ before you sign a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, even if you compose and ``send'' a message
while you are in a dead spot, the message will store and transmit
the moment you enter a service zone.

 &HT;    Give yourself a break: Get brakes checked
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brake pedal vibration, or ``pulsation,'' is typically
caused by warped brake rotors or out-of-round (oval-shaped) brake
drums.
</P>
<P>
   The constant heating and cooling of the brake rotor as the
brakes are applied and released eventually causes the flat rotor to
warp (like leaving a vinyl record in the sun). When you step on the
brake pedal, the pads clamp against the high spot on the rotor. As
the low spot rotates around, the pads need to move again to clamp
it.
</P>
<P>
   The pads must move in and out to keep contact with the distorted
rotor. This causes the uneven braking action to be felt through
your foot.
</P>
<P>
   On the rear brakes, the once-round drum becomes oval-shaped, and
the same kind of thing happens. The brake shoes first contact the
high spot, then need to move out to touch the low spot. Again, the
in-and-out action of the shoes is felt at the pedal.
</P>
<P>
   Another contributor to warped rotors and drums is uneven
tightening of the wheel lug nuts. This is sometimes done when the
tires are rotated and the wheels are tightened with an air-driven
impact gun. When you have your tires rotated, insist the wheels be
torqued to specification.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the braking is done with the front brakes, so warped
rotors are much more common than out-of-round drums. If you are
experiencing brake pulsation, have the ``rotor runout'' checked.
This needs to be done by a mechanic with a special gauge that can
measure how much warpage the rotors have. The only thing that will
fix a pulsating pedal caused by rotor warp is to have the rotors
machined flat (turned) or replaced with new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Even though brake drums rarely distort, it can be caused by
driving with the emergency brake left on. The extreme heat caused
by the constant friction of the applied brake can get the drum hot
enough to warp. As with the rotors, the drums will have to be
machined round again or replaced if they've gotten too hot.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget about brake fluid. The reason cars use fluid to
apply the brakes is fluid cannot be compressed. In essence, it
works like a solid rod between your foot and the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   However, air can be compressed. When air gets into the hydraulic
system, it must first be squished before the fluid has a chance to
apply the pistons down at the brakes. Air gets into the hydraulic
system when the fluid in the master cylinder is too low.
</P>
<P>
   Heat also can affect the air in the system. Brake fluid is
designed to boil at very high temperatures (usually between 300 and
400 degrees Fahrenheit). If you've had to apply the brakes for a
long period of time (like descending a steep grade), the brakes can
actually get hot enough to boil the fluid, which will create little
air bubbles. In either case, the brake pedal may feel mushy because
you are having to squish air. You may even have to ``stand on the
brakes'' to bring the car to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   If you are experiencing a mushy brake pedal or you're having to
pump the brakes, the culprit is probably air in the system.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the only way to get the air out is to have the
brakes bled at the wheels. Fluid is pushed through the hydraulic
system and allowed to drain out ``bleeder screws'' until all of the
air has been removed. However, if the brake pedal is going to the
floor and no amount of pumping will stop the car, there may be an
internal fluid leak or external leak. Needless to say, this is a
dangerous situation in need of immediate attention.

 &HT;    Hasbro's `Stratego' reborn on CD
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hasbro Interactive has been bringing one age-old board
game after another to computer CD. Its latest offering is
``Stratego,'' a war strategy game. With computer technology, Hasbro
has expanded ``Stratego'' to three levels of difficulty. There also
are five variations of the game, and five board designs to choose
from. Available only for Windows 95 PCs, ``Stratego'' retails for
$29.95.

   It's hard to believe but, yes, it's the beginning of a new tax
year. And to celebrate the coming tax season, Intuit has released
MacInTax, the Mac version of its popular tax preparation software.
This version includes several new features that simplify both
preparing taxes and navigating tax forms. For example, MacInTax
lets you import annual financial data from Quicken, if you have the
program. You can also jump among forms and topics with the click of
a mouse from a side-screen directory. MacInTax retails for about
$35.

   There are few things funnier than a bad advertisement. Now you
can look at a whole slew of them at a site called The Gallery of
the Absurd. It features bad advertising from throughout the
industry's history. You'll find, for example, a print ad showing a
laughing family that proclaims in big type ``They're happy because
they eat lard.'' Or how about this one _ Hometown, Ill., resident
Pay Mayo bragging her toilet is the best-smelling one in the
neighborhood. She invites skeptics to come and sniff for
themselves. Find The Gallery of the Absurd at
http://www.absurdgallery.com.
</P>
<P>
   In print
</P>
<P>
   It must be the first of the year. The tech magazines are
offering best-of-the-year lists. Yahoo! Internet Life is first out
of the gate. In its January issue, it features a ``Top of the Net''
list for last year. The list includes selections of best Web site,
best Web star, best wacky site and best Net event.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's next generation of laptop computers will include the
ability to play DVD movies. Read about this computer, to be called
the PowerBook G3/300, in the January issue of MacWorld. This
computer will let you watch a movie while traveling cross-country
via airplane, for example. No more settling for the airline's
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, your laptop may not last through the whole flight,
given the state of portable batteries. But Apple Computer is
reportedly working on some improvements here, too.

 &HT;    Finally, a site for ig-pay atin-Lay
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bell bottoms, disco and Donnie and Marie have made
comebacks. So did John Travolta and Richard Nixon. About the only
things from the 1970s that haven't returned are TV variety shows
and pig Latin.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, variety shows will stay gone. The world doesn't
need another weekly hour of Tony Orlando and Dawn. But the Web
could do a lot for pig Latin.
</P>
<P>
   A slew of sites offer text translators. You type in a line of
text or, in some cases, a Web address, and the application turns it
into pig Latin.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, check http:/www.rinkworks.com/dialect/ or
</P>
<P>
   http://voyager.cns.ohiou.edu/(tilde)jrantane/menu/pig.html. One
site turns the word of God into pig Latin, from Enesis-gay to the
Book of Ob-Jay,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.well.com/user/earl/Ible-bay.html.
</P>
<P>
   The rules behind the language are simple enough: You take the
first consonant of most words, put an -ay behind it and stick it at
the end of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Simple, but time consuming for chunks of text. It would take
minutes to translate the opening words of Lou Gehrig's famous
farewell speech. A Web translator can do it in seconds. ``Odaytay,
Iyay onsidercay yselfmay ethay uckiestlay anmay onyay ethay acefay
ofyay ethay earthyay.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Web translators that change text from one language to
another, like Spanish to English, but those probably have some
practical application. What good is the Web if it also can't be
used for things with no definable purpose?
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance savings available on Internet
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can cost you money: Usually, you have to buy a
computer with a modem and access fees to reach it. But once there,
some things you find actually save you money.
</P>
<P>
   A few new studies by the Telecommunications Research &AMP; Action
Center show how.
</P>
<P>
   TRAC found that in some cases long-distance customers can cut
their monthly bill in half by signing up for service over the
Internet. Internet long-distance service requires you pay your bill
with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   TRAC publishes a study called Tele-Tips at its Web site,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.trac.org. This month's study compares rates for
dial-around phone codes. The study found dial-around access offers
some competitive rates, but some have hidden fees that can hit
hard. The report warns that, shockingly, the advertising for the
dial-around codes can be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   TRAC is a nonprofit, tax-exempt consumer group that works to
inform long-distance customers
</P>
<P>
   Test your knowledge of 'Sesame Street'
</P>
<P>
   If television is indeed wet nurse to a generation of children,
``Sesame Street'' is the good milk. The children's television
stalwart turns 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the anniversary, the ``Sesame Street'' Web site,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.ctw.org/sesame/trivia/0,1736,,00.html, has put
together a trivia game.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know which ``Sesame Street'' characters were inspired by
the movie ``It's a Wonderful Life'' and the year ``Sesame Street''
made its debut? Do you know how big Big Bird really is?
</P>
<P>
   If you knew Bert and Ernie owe their existence to Frank Capra,
the morning show debuted on public television in 1969 and that Big
Bird stands 8 feet, 2 inches tall, there might be no need to play.
</P>
<P>
   The game tallies answers for everyone who plays. If you thought
Fozzy Bear, instead of Bert and Ernie, owed his creation to ``It's
a Wonderful Life,'' you could see how many others were similarly
misinformed.
</P>
<P>
   Take a sneak peek at some famous recipes
</P>
<P>
   If the year between Girl Scout cookie deliveries seems like 10
years, a Web site of copycat recipes might lessen the distance.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.copykat.com is devoted to recipes for well-known
food, like Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies; macaroni and cheese from
Boston Market; and fried chicken from KFC.
</P>
<P>
   There are also recipes for lesser-known delicacies, such as the
Pea Salad from Knott's Berry Farm and the Oyster Bar Trash from
Willie G's.
</P>
<P>
   Most online job help is for nontechies
</P>
<P>
   CareerMosaic, an online job site, released a study showing most
jobs listed on online sites are nontechnical.
</P>
<P>
   The CareerMosaic Index found three of the top 10 most popular
online job searches were related to technical jobs, engineering,
computers and computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   The index found the most popular keywords used in searches were
``manager/management,'' ``engineer,'' and ``sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Online job hunting reflects seasonal trends as well. Teaching
positions ranked 22nd in July, but fell to 28th in August and 30th
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Other job categories among the top 25 were, ``finance,'' ``human
resources,'' ``nurse'' and ``package handler.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted by CareerMosaic between July and
September. More than 14 million keyword searches were tallied.

 &HT;    In enough free time, a Web page can be built for free
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, you were part of the high-tech elite
if you had an e-mail address and knew Yahoo! was more than an
especially disgusting soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, of course, you need a home on the Web. Having one is
pretty easy; some Internet accounts come with the provision for
free Web space. Even if that isn't the case with your account,
there are other sites that offer free Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``free'' is the operative word for today. I'll tell you
how to find your own free home in cyberspace, then we'll talk about
some free tools and techniques that can make your Web site into a
good home.
</P>
<P>
   For today, I'm going to assume you don't have a home page on the
Web and walk you through the steps for creating one in semi-logical
order. Pay attention, because it's going to be a brisk walk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free Web space: There are literally dozens of sites offering
Web space for free (in return, the service usually puts an ad of
some type on your page). To get a complete list, use your favorite
search engine and the terms ``free'' and ``Web.'' Or you can take
my advice and try one of these two sites:
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities at http://www.geocities.com or Angel Fire at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.angelfire.com/.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free software: Now that you have a place to stash it, you'll
need to create a home page. Don't let your favorite Web-head scare
you away with talk about HTML (the language used to create Web
pages) and Java (one of the programs used to add special features
to a page). We're going to do things the easy way with a program
(it won't cost you a dime) called AOLpress. Don't let the name fool
you, AOLpress will create a page that you can use on any service,
not just AOL. You can download it at http://www.aolpress.com/. It's
easy to use and amazingly sophisticated _ creating links to your
favorite sites, placing images and automating many tasks, including
adding color or unique typefaces. There are plenty of other free
page-creation programs out there, but this one is my personal
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free images: Don't tell your mom, but we'll do some stealing
as we go along. Many pages use public domain images and artwork,
and you're welcome to grab them right off the page. Just
right-click on the image you like, then select ``Save Image As...''
and you will be able to use the image on your own page. Also use
your search engine to find the hundreds of sites offering free clip
art. I'll list just one (but this one site has half a million free
images): Cool Graphics on the Web at
http://www.fishnet.net/(tilde)gini/cool. Once you've found the
images you like, use AOLpress to include the images on your page.
</P>
<P>
   _ (Almost) free photos: You'll probably want to use some
photographs on your page. But unless you have a scanner at home (I
recommend it, and good ones sell for less than $100 now), you'll
need another source for the electronic images. Shop around for a
photo finisher that offers free or nearly free electronic images.

 &HT;    Trip planner slow at handling its job
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a new player with a very large name in the
trip planning software business.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic Trip Planner DeLuxe does no dishonor to its
august name, but on the other hand the players already established
in the field, especially Rand McNally, needn't feel overshadowed.
</P>
<P>
   Trip Planner Deluxe is a fairly routine trip planner, rather
clumsy and unintuitive in use.
</P>
<P>
   The maps, as one would hope, are very nice. There is a lot of
detail, and most cities are represented with maps of at least the
major streets; larger cities such as Atlanta have street maps as
detailed as any available for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Trip planning is done either manually, which is not as easy as
most other programs, or through the Trip Wizard, which is easy
enough but still a little cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when you select the Wizard, you get a pointless
introductory screen; next comes a ``Set Origin and Destination''
screen at which you actually select neither. Instead, you click on
either origin or destination, which takes you to yet another screen
in which you type the name of the city or, if you really aren't
sure where you wish to start, scroll down an understandably
interminable list of places to make a choice. Then you go back to
the previous screen and do the same thing for destination.
</P>
<P>
   Five screens, in other words, where one could have done the job.
</P>
<P>
   There is a guidebook where you can choose to get information on
a wide variety of attractions or matters of interest, from
high-rated hostelries and restaurants to historic locations, and
specify how far they can be from a certain point. But you have to
select the point. I can find no way to select an entire route for
this feature. Instead, I had to calculate the route and then click
at random spots along the way to get that kind of information.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting any of the locations produced by the guidebook allows
the user to both locate them on the map and store the information
regarding them to a separate notebook, which can be printed out.
</P>
<P>
   There is a selection of walking tours, which is quite small and
limited to Eastern locations. Short driving tours are much more
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating a trip is the slowest process I've seen in a program
of this type, but it's not slow enough to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   There's a tips and advice section on a number of travel
subjects, useful mainly if you have a computer with you when you
need the advice.
</P>
<P>
   This is a decent travel program, but not even the blank travel
notebook National Geographic includes raises it to the level of
Rand McNally's TripMaker.

 &HT;    Microsoft launching new Explorer
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ironically, competition for the best Mac Web browser
has not slackened a bit between Microsoft and Netscape during the
long weeks of the government's antitrust suit against the world's
dominant software provider.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is readying the next version of its Internet Explorer
browser, which will probably be previewed at the MacWorld
convention in San Francisco this week.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of Internet Explorer comes only weeks after
Netscape released the latest version of the Mac version of its
Communicator suite of browser software.
</P>
<P>
   That version has won high praise from reviewers, who gave
Communicator the edge, however fleeting, in its competition with
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Now Communicator may lose that edge if leaks and initial online
chatter about Internet Explorer prove true. This version, dubbed
4.5, promises easier use.
</P>
<P>
   In Internet Explorer 4.5, Microsoft has taken an approach that
differs from its normal software strategy. It has decided to focus
on tweaking Internet Explorer rather than adding tons of new
features.
</P>
<P>
   What a novel idea for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company set out to reduce the number of mouse
clicks and keystrokes users had to make to do common tasks. One way
is through a new feature called autofill, which will be familiar to
users of Microsoft's Word and Excel products.
</P>
<P>
   Like in these programs, autofill will automatically fill in
personal data in a Web site registration after you enter the first
few letters of your name.
</P>
<P>
   There's also new features that improve printing from the Web.
For example, now you can set Internet Explorer to reduce a Web page
to fit a standard 8 1/2x11 sheet of printer paper. This feature
also mimics Microsoft's other products.
</P>
<P>
   Like Word and Excel, Internet Explorer will now automatically
replace a needed file if accidently deleted from its system.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Explorer remains free, and you will be able to download
a copy of the latest version from the Microsoft Web site after its
release.

 &HT;    A few 1999 resolutions for the road
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is the time of year we typically make resolutions
about things like losing weight, being better organized, being
punctual or trying not to procrastinate. Most of these require more
than a spur-of-the-moment commitment, so we end up breaking most of
them before the holiday decorations find their way back to the
attic.
</P>
<P>
   This year, I decided to focus my resolutions on a subject I can
address one trip at a time. That, hopefully, will not only improve
my outlook, but also those of my fellow drivers. My 1999
resolutions are all directed at being a more aware, courteous and
safer driver:
</P>
<P>
   _ I will not tailgate.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will, when stopped in traffic, leave a minimum of
three-quarters of a car length between myself and the next vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will not ride in the left lane.
</P>
<P>
   _ If people are passing me on the right, I will take that as a
directive to move to the right.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will only talk on my hand-held cell phone in the far right
lane (or, better yet, when standing still).
</P>
<P>
   _ I will not ``brake-check'' the car behind me (even if it is so
close I can't see its grille).
</P>
<P>
   _ If I drive an 18-wheeler on a four-lane highway, I will never
attempt to pass another truck while going uphill.
</P>
<P>
   _ When I rent a moving truck, I will limit my travel to the far
right lane.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will do my best to maintain the speed limit and/or keep up
with the flow of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will not be a moving roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will never make a left turn from the right lane or a right
turn from the left lane.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will always strap toddlers and babies into their car seats.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will never move a vehicle until all occupants have buckled
their seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will never allow children under the age of 12 to sit in the
front seat of a vehicle equipped with a passenger-side air bag.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will not allow people or dogs to travel in the bed of my
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will not stop in the ``keep moving'' lane.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will stop for red lights, and I won't charge through yellow
lights.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will make sure my vehicle's headlights are properly aligned
so I can see, and so I won't blind other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will never drive in the rain or fog without turning on my
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will use my turn signals.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will make sure my brake lights and turn signals work.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will try to refrain from giving my spouse more driving
instructions/directions than he really wants.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will work hard to ``chill'' when in Atlanta traffic and try
to be patient with other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   If none of this works, then next year I'm asking Santa for a
tank for the next millennium.

 &HT;    Interactive pagers intelligently handle e-mail, faxing as well
as customary duties
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Your daughter is airborne, flying to Los Angeles,
where her uncle is to pick her up at LAX. You get an urgent call.
The uncle is detained, but a neighbor, a young lady dressed in red,
will pick her up instead. No problem. You get on the computer,
dispatch an e-mail to the daughter, and she receives it on her
interactive pager as she rides the down escalator to baggage claim.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra, your spouse, is making her final business rounds in
Seattle, preparing to fly back to Atlanta on Friday afternoon.
Suddenly, in a stroke of genius, you suggest she pick up some
smoked salmon, a family favorite, to brighten up the weekend. No
problem. You e-mail her on her interactive pager, she sees the
message and instructs the cabby to take the side trip en route to
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Or, your wife is having her second child, and at the hospital
you decide to do it right this time. You use your interactive pager
to e-mail messages to all four grandparents simultaneously, and a
fax to Grandpa Joe, who rarely looks at his e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of the latest in hand-held computing, the
interactive pager. Except for its beep, it has little in common
with its cousin, the ordinary pager. The BellSouth Interactive
Pager, a companion of mine for several weeks, is different because
it sends and receives information. Like an ordinary computer, it
has directories and an electronic address book.
</P>
<P>
   It sends e-mail and faxes more simply than the personal
computer, communicating with other interactive pagers in seconds
across thousands of miles. The communication with computers via the
Internet occurs in four or five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, you cannot reach it automatically by phone as you do
regular pagers. But a toll-free phone call to an operator, on duty
24 hours a day, allows you to send an alert or a dictated text
message.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the interactive pager system is the handy,
sophisticated pager, which is actually a radio that communicates
with a wireless network that is similar to a cell phone network _
but entirely separate.
</P>
<P>
   The low-powered radio contains circuitry that allows you to
write messages and hold them until you want to send them. And it
instructs the network, by way of the nearest communications tower,
to take the message and deliver it directly to another pager, or to
a computer or a fax machine. The network is able to locate the
target, and hold the message for transmission later if the computer
or fax or pager happens to be turned off, or out of range.
</P>
<P>
   This sophisticated technology was first brought together in 1993
to serve mostly businesses, which mostly needed a high level of
communication between offices and field forces. It still does that,
but now since BellSouth bought the business, it is being
transformed into a consumer service as well.
</P>
<P>
   Invented by a company called Ram Mobile Data, which was
purchased in 1998 by BellSouth, the wireless network was used
mostly to serve major corporations with customized programs.
</P>
<P>
   But with the purchase of the company, William Lenahan, president
of BellSouth Wireless Data, said he foresees hundreds of thousands
of individual customers, many eager to join what Chuck Napier of
Convergence Corp. calls ``the mobile digirati.''
</P>
<P>
   As you use the little machine, it does achieve the feel of a
companion. Sitting in a meeting, for instance, you could hear a
speaker talking about the possibility of war between two former
Soviet republics. You could flash a message back to the office to
check company investments there, without leaving the table.
</P>
<P>
   You could, as I did, run across a gift item at Lenox Square
mall, just right for a friend. You could flash a query about the
person's size, and get the answer when she returns from lunch.
</P>
<P>
   You could assign or loan a pager to a teen, and keep track of
his needs, problems or comings and goings during the day, directly
from your office computer.
</P>
<P>
   What is startling is the reach of the system.
</P>
<P>
   And it really works. Recently I loaned my pager to my nephew,
Andre Wallace, who was leaving by plane for a business trip to the
West Coast. His plan was to land in Los Angeles and drive up the
coast to the Bay Area, making several stops along the way.
</P>
<P>
   When he landed at LAX, he flashed me the arrival message as he
took the escalator down to the baggage center. His progress reports
included one from the car as he motored to his hotel, and notices
from various towns and villages as he made his way up through the
central valley. We were in constant touch.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive pager may sound reminiscent of the ordinary
satellite-based pagers, but it is quite different. Commands are not
broadcast by satellite and picked up by the pager wherever it may
happen to be. Instead, interactive pagers receive messages
addressed only to them.
</P>
<P>
   The little devices are intuitive. If you put a period after a
word, it automatically capitalizes the next letter to begin another
sentence. A single letter ``i'' automatically capitalizes.
</P>
<P>
   The network, sure to serve additional devices, will become the
means to connect hand-held computers, BellSouth announced in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive pager, which costs about $250, connects to the
service for about $25 a month, comparable to cellular phone
service. Some 25,000 ``anytime'' characters can be transmitted
without additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service probably will appeal mostly to business
professionals, and users in field service such as sales,'' said
Janet Boudris, senior vice president for marketing at BellSouth
Wireless Data, based in Woodbridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have found is that many subscribers get them for
business use, but in time they begin to adapt them to personal use,
for instance to stay in touch with children and spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   This all sounds like the pattern when cellular phones were
introduced to the general population in the early 1980s, when the
initial customers were businesses but then spread into the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unanticipated developments, Boudris said, is deaf
people have been attracted to the devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many feel this is the first handy communications device `just
for the deaf,' so practical because it can alert the user by
vibrations,'' she said. ``Then they can communicate in writing.''
</P>
<P>
   One warning, however. The network coverage of the interactive
pager is in its early stages in terms of individual consumer use. I
found a totally dead spot in Stone Mountain, though the signal was
fine just a mile or two away in south DeKalb County and the same
distance westward in East Lake.
</P>
<P>
   As you should with wireless telephones, it would be advisable to
check signal strength in areas where you work or spend the most
time to verify service is satisfactory _ before you sign a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, even if you compose and ``send'' a message
while you are in a dead spot, the message will store and transmit
the moment you enter a service zone.

 &HT;    In enough free time, a Web page can be built for free
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, you were part of the high-tech elite
if you had an e-mail address and knew Yahoo! was more than an
especially disgusting soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, of course, you need a home on the Web. Having one is
pretty easy; some Internet accounts come with the provision for
free Web space. Even if that isn't the case with your account,
there are other sites that offer free Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``free'' is the operative word for today. I'll tell you
how to find your own free home in cyberspace, then we'll talk about
some free tools and techniques that can make your Web site into a
good home.
</P>
<P>
   For today, I'm going to assume you don't have a home page on the
Web and walk you through the steps for creating one in semi-logical
order. Pay attention, because it's going to be a brisk walk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free Web space: There are literally dozens of sites offering
Web space for free (in return, the service usually puts an ad of
some type on your page). To get a complete list, use your favorite
search engine and the terms ``free'' and ``Web.'' Or you can take
my advice and try one of these two sites:
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities at http://www.geocities.com or Angel Fire at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.angelfire.com/.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free software: Now that you have a place to stash it, you'll
need to create a home page. Don't let your favorite Web-head scare
you away with talk about HTML (the language used to create Web
pages) and Java (one of the programs used to add special features
to a page). We're going to do things the easy way with a program
(it won't cost you a dime) called AOLpress. Don't let the name fool
you, AOLpress will create a page that you can use on any service,
not just AOL. You can download it at http://www.aolpress.com/. It's
easy to use and amazingly sophisticated _ creating links to your
favorite sites, placing images and automating many tasks, including
adding color or unique typefaces. There are plenty of other free
page-creation programs out there, but this one is my personal
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free images: Don't tell your mom, but we'll do some stealing
as we go along. Many pages use public domain images and artwork,
and you're welcome to grab them right off the page. Just
right-click on the image you like, then select ``Save Image As...''
and you will be able to use the image on your own page. Also use
your search engine to find the hundreds of sites offering free clip
art. I'll list just one (but this one site has half a million free
images): Cool Graphics on the Web at
http://www.fishnet.net/(tilde)gini/cool. Once you've found the
images you like, use AOLpress to include the images on your page.
</P>
<P>
   _ (Almost) free photos: You'll probably want to use some
photographs on your page. But unless you have a scanner at home (I
recommend it, and good ones sell for less than $100 now), you'll
need another source for the electronic images. Shop around for a
photo finisher that offers free or nearly free electronic images.
Some photo labs include electronic images along with the prints at
very little additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other free stuff: We're nearly out of space, so we'll have to
move fast now. But check out these Web sites for other nifty free
stuff such as guest books and software that will keep track of the
folks who visit your page.

</P>
<P>
   There's one free item I can't furnish. That's the free time
you'll need to get all this done. But if you have the time, I have
the free stuff.

 &HT;    Give yourself a break: Get brakes checked
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brake pedal vibration, or ``pulsation,'' is typically
caused by warped brake rotors or out-of-round (oval-shaped) brake
drums.
</P>
<P>
   The constant heating and cooling of the brake rotor as the
brakes are applied and released eventually causes the flat rotor to
warp (like leaving a vinyl record in the sun). When you step on the
brake pedal, the pads clamp against the high spot on the rotor. As
the low spot rotates around, the pads need to move again to clamp
it.
</P>
<P>
   The pads must move in and out to keep contact with the distorted
rotor. This causes the uneven braking action to be felt through
your foot.
</P>
<P>
   On the rear brakes, the once-round drum becomes oval-shaped, and
the same kind of thing happens. The brake shoes first contact the
high spot, then need to move out to touch the low spot. Again, the
in-and-out action of the shoes is felt at the pedal.
</P>
<P>
   Another contributor to warped rotors and drums is uneven
tightening of the wheel lug nuts. This is sometimes done when the
tires are rotated and the wheels are tightened with an air-driven
impact gun. When you have your tires rotated, insist the wheels be
torqued to specification.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the braking is done with the front brakes, so warped
rotors are much more common than out-of-round drums. If you are
experiencing brake pulsation, have the ``rotor runout'' checked.
This needs to be done by a mechanic with a special gauge that can
measure how much warpage the rotors have. The only thing that will
fix a pulsating pedal caused by rotor warp is to have the rotors
machined flat (turned) or replaced with new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Even though brake drums rarely distort, it can be caused by
driving with the emergency brake left on. The extreme heat caused
by the constant friction of the applied brake can get the drum hot
enough to warp. As with the rotors, the drums will have to be
machined round again or replaced if they've gotten too hot.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget about brake fluid. The reason cars use fluid to
apply the brakes is fluid cannot be compressed. In essence, it
works like a solid rod between your foot and the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   However, air can be compressed. When air gets into the hydraulic
system, it must first be squished before the fluid has a chance to
apply the pistons down at the brakes. Air gets into the hydraulic
system when the fluid in the master cylinder is too low.
</P>
<P>
   Heat also can affect the air in the system. Brake fluid is
designed to boil at very high temperatures (usually between 300 and
400 degrees Fahrenheit). If you've had to apply the brakes for a
long period of time (like descending a steep grade), the brakes can
actually get hot enough to boil the fluid, which will create little
air bubbles. In either case, the brake pedal may feel mushy because
you are having to squish air. You may even have to ``stand on the
brakes'' to bring the car to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   If you are experiencing a mushy brake pedal or you're having to
pump the brakes, the culprit is probably air in the system.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the only way to get the air out is to have the
brakes bled at the wheels. Fluid is pushed through the hydraulic
system and allowed to drain out ``bleeder screws'' until all of the
air has been removed. However, if the brake pedal is going to the
floor and no amount of pumping will stop the car, there may be an
internal fluid leak or external leak. Needless to say, this is a
dangerous situation in need of immediate attention.

 &HT;    The life and times of a human cannonball
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ... with a cannon blast lightin' flash
</P>
<P>
   Movin' fast through the tent Mars bent,
</P>
<P>
   he's gonna miss his fall
</P>
<P>
   Oh God save the human cannonball
</P>
<P>
   Wild Billy's Circus Story (1973)
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
Three rings of once-in-a-lifetime thrills. Are you ready to be
stunned and amazed, dazzled and dazed by The Lady in the Cube, The
Iron Jaw, The Human Volcano and ... Mark Myers?
</P>
<P>
   That's Mark Myers, The Human Cannonball.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, Vero Beach High Class of '89, is equal to any oddity when
he talks about the finer points of his job. ``Even when I'm
spinning, I can tell which way is up and which way is down.''
</P>
<P>
   Or this: ``You land on your face and you're probably going to
break your neck and you'll probably die. Not a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He says this matter-of-factly: ``If you over-spin or land on
your side, you can break your shoulder, you can break your legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, 28, is starting a second year earning his living.
</P>
<P>
   Paired with female cannonball Vesta Gueschkova, he's a
centerpiece of the 128th edition of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP;
Bailey Circus.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Pat and Larry, own Treasure Coast Contracting, a
Vero Beach company that builds underground sewers and waterlines.
They saw him perform last winter in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Recounts Myers: ``My dad said, `That's some way to make a
living,' and my mother said, `I almost shut my eyes and couldn't
watch.'''
</P>
<P>
   So, what kind of son becomes a human cannonball?
</P>
<P>
   Myers wasn't supposed to be flying across North American arenas
when he left home right after high school for the 10-week Ringling
Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Clown College in Venice on Florida's west
coast.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't supposed to be blasted into the beyond when he
graduated from Clown College as Marty the Clown and went to work
for Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. Circus for four years.
</P>
<P>
   But then noted circus daredevil Elvin Bale asked Myers to be a
Human Cannonball for the Ringling circus. Bale recruited Myers
because of his size _ 5-feet-7, 145 pounds _ and athletic ability
honed from high school wrestling and track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it for maybe 20- or 30-hundredths of a
second,'' says Myers. ``The job sounded fun and exciting and not
many people have done it. And it was a chance to travel with The
Greatest Show on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. Circus works the East Coast while
Ringling tours all of North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got called up to the big show.''
</P>
<P>
   This Human Cannonball has been launched 440 times in 45 North
American cities so far.
</P>
<P>
   Two Ringling shows, a red and a blue, are always touring. Each
show is created to run for two years. Myers and this blue edition _
it's built on P.T. Barnum human oddities plus tightrope walkers,
elephants, a tiger tamer and other traditional circus acts _ will
end next November.
</P>
<P>
   A Human Cannonball may or may not be included in future shows.
Cannonballs have no lifetime contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Although ticket buyers don't realize it, Myers The Human
Cannonball is also pink-haired Marty the Clown for this Ringling
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clowning is fun because it gives me something else to
do,'' says Myers. ``It gives me a chance to show the audience I can
do something else besides this big act, this dangerous thing being
shot out of a cannon.''
</P>
<P>
   To learn the cannon act, Myers trained with Human Cannonball
Bale for more than six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the cannon barrel, Myers fits tight into a capsule that's on
a track. When the cannon is fired, the capsule shoots up the barrel
about 9 feet and stops, ejecting Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a tight, solid object,'' he says. ``If you're
soft, you're going to goosh and get all crumpled up in there and
your knees will bend and it's going to be really painful. If you're
tight and solid, you're ready for the hit.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3-2-1 ... fire, Myers waits a second and is launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capsule slides up and you come out. That's when you click:
You shoot your arms out, your feet come together, your toes point
and you squeeze your legs to get rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger isn't in the flying, it's landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't land right unless you fly right, you can't fly right
unless you're in the capsule correctly and tight. It's hard to play
catch up in the seconds that I'm in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   He has minor injuries such as a jammed finger but nothing that
made him miss a performance.
</P>
<P>
   Myers has been told he flies at 60 mph for the 100 feet from the
cannon to the net.
</P>
<P>
   The cannon shot feels ``like lying down and having a dumptruck
drive into your feet at 50 miles per hour,'' he says. ``When I do
it right and I don't have to think while I'm in the air, don't have
to make adjustments, it's just like flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers doesn't wear protective equipment, and his helmet is mere
canvas, a part of his costume.
</P>
<P>
   Myers has a ritual before each shot that comes from his jujitsu
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I close my eyes and go through this breathing exercise which
helps calm me and I try to clear out the thoughts of what's
happened to me that day because I can't be distracted,'' he
explains. ``I have to be 100 percent every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we're getting ready to go in, I guess you could say I give
my bow of respect to the cannon and then I do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   This six-day-a-week circus job will keep him flying for at least
six more months _ and then, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to go to California, get an agent and get into TV or
commercials or movies,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, ``Human Cannonball'' looks great on a resume.

 &HT;    Hasbro's `Stratego' reborn on CD
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hasbro Interactive has been bringing one age-old board
game after another to computer CD. Its latest offering is
``Stratego,'' a war strategy game. With computer technology, Hasbro
has expanded ``Stratego'' to three levels of difficulty. There also
are five variations of the game, and five board designs to choose
from. Available only for Windows 95 PCs, ``Stratego'' retails for
$29.95.

   It's hard to believe but, yes, it's the beginning of a new tax
year. And to celebrate the coming tax season, Intuit has released
MacInTax, the Mac version of its popular tax preparation software.
This version includes several new features that simplify both
preparing taxes and navigating tax forms. For example, MacInTax
lets you import annual financial data from Quicken, if you have the
program. You can also jump among forms and topics with the click of
a mouse from a side-screen directory. MacInTax retails for about
$35.

   There are few things funnier than a bad advertisement. Now you
can look at a whole slew of them at a site called The Gallery of
the Absurd. It features bad advertising from throughout the
industry's history. You'll find, for example, a print ad showing a
laughing family that proclaims in big type ``They're happy because
they eat lard.'' Or how about this one _ Hometown, Ill., resident
Pay Mayo bragging her toilet is the best-smelling one in the
neighborhood. She invites skeptics to come and sniff for
themselves. Find The Gallery of the Absurd at
http://www.absurdgallery.com.
</P>
<P>
   In print
</P>
<P>
   It must be the first of the year. The tech magazines are
offering best-of-the-year lists. Yahoo! Internet Life is first out
of the gate. In its January issue, it features a ``Top of the Net''
list for last year. The list includes selections of best Web site,
best Web star, best wacky site and best Net event.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's next generation of laptop computers will include the
ability to play DVD movies. Read about this computer, to be called
the PowerBook G3/300, in the January issue of MacWorld. This
computer will let you watch a movie while traveling cross-country
via airplane, for example. No more settling for the airline's
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, your laptop may not last through the whole flight,
given the state of portable batteries. But Apple Computer is
reportedly working on some improvements here, too.

 &HT;    Finally, a site for ig-pay atin-Lay
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bell bottoms, disco and Donnie and Marie have made
comebacks. So did John Travolta and Richard Nixon. About the only
things from the 1970s that haven't returned are TV variety shows
and pig Latin.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, variety shows will stay gone. The world doesn't
need another weekly hour of Tony Orlando and Dawn. But the Web
could do a lot for pig Latin.
</P>
<P>
   A slew of sites offer text translators. You type in a line of
text or, in some cases, a Web address, and the application turns it
into pig Latin.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, check http:/www.rinkworks.com/dialect/ or
</P>
<P>
   http://voyager.cns.ohiou.edu/(tilde)jrantane/menu/pig.html. One
site turns the word of God into pig Latin, from Enesis-gay to the
Book of Ob-Jay,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.well.com/user/earl/Ible-bay.html.
</P>
<P>
   The rules behind the language are simple enough: You take the
first consonant of most words, put an -ay behind it and stick it at
the end of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Simple, but time consuming for chunks of text. It would take
minutes to translate the opening words of Lou Gehrig's famous
farewell speech. A Web translator can do it in seconds. ``Odaytay,
Iyay onsidercay yselfmay ethay uckiestlay anmay onyay ethay acefay
ofyay ethay earthyay.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Web translators that change text from one language to
another, like Spanish to English, but those probably have some
practical application. What good is the Web if it also can't be
used for things with no definable purpose?
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance savings available on Internet
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can cost you money: Usually, you have to buy a
computer with a modem and access fees to reach it. But once there,
some things you find actually save you money.
</P>
<P>
   A few new studies by the Telecommunications Research &AMP; Action
Center show how.
</P>
<P>
   TRAC found that in some cases long-distance customers can cut
their monthly bill in half by signing up for service over the
Internet. Internet long-distance service requires you pay your bill
with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   TRAC publishes a study called Tele-Tips at its Web site,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.trac.org. This month's study compares rates for
dial-around phone codes. The study found dial-around access offers
some competitive rates, but some have hidden fees that can hit
hard. The report warns that, shockingly, the advertising for the
dial-around codes can be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   TRAC is a nonprofit, tax-exempt consumer group that works to
inform long-distance customers
</P>
<P>
   Test your knowledge of 'Sesame Street'
</P>
<P>
   If television is indeed wet nurse to a generation of children,
``Sesame Street'' is the good milk. The children's television
stalwart turns 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the anniversary, the ``Sesame Street'' Web site,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.ctw.org/sesame/trivia/0,1736,,00.html, has put
together a trivia game.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know which ``Sesame Street'' characters were inspired by
the movie ``It's a Wonderful Life'' and the year ``Sesame Street''
made its debut? Do you know how big Big Bird really is?
</P>
<P>
   If you knew Bert and Ernie owe their existence to Frank Capra,
the morning show debuted on public television in 1969 and that Big
Bird stands 8 feet, 2 inches tall, there might be no need to play.
</P>
<P>
   The game tallies answers for everyone who plays. If you thought
Fozzy Bear, instead of Bert and Ernie, owed his creation to ``It's
a Wonderful Life,'' you could see how many others were similarly
misinformed.
</P>
<P>
   Take a sneak peek at some famous recipes
</P>
<P>
   If the year between Girl Scout cookie deliveries seems like 10
years, a Web site of copycat recipes might lessen the distance.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.copykat.com is devoted to recipes for well-known
food, like Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies; macaroni and cheese from
Boston Market; and fried chicken from KFC.
</P>
<P>
   There are also recipes for lesser-known delicacies, such as the
Pea Salad from Knott's Berry Farm and the Oyster Bar Trash from
Willie G's.
</P>
<P>
   Most online job help is for nontechies
</P>
<P>
   CareerMosaic, an online job site, released a study showing most
jobs listed on online sites are nontechnical.
</P>
<P>
   The CareerMosaic Index found three of the top 10 most popular
online job searches were related to technical jobs, engineering,
computers and computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   The index found the most popular keywords used in searches were
``manager/management,'' ``engineer,'' and ``sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Online job hunting reflects seasonal trends as well. Teaching
positions ranked 22nd in July, but fell to 28th in August and 30th
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Other job categories among the top 25 were, ``finance,'' ``human
resources,'' ``nurse'' and ``package handler.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted by CareerMosaic between July and
September. More than 14 million keyword searches were tallied.

 &HT;    Trip planner slow at handling its job
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a new player with a very large name in the
trip planning software business.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic Trip Planner DeLuxe does no dishonor to its
august name, but on the other hand the players already established
in the field, especially Rand McNally, needn't feel overshadowed.
</P>
<P>
   Trip Planner Deluxe is a fairly routine trip planner, rather
clumsy and unintuitive in use.
</P>
<P>
   The maps, as one would hope, are very nice. There is a lot of
detail, and most cities are represented with maps of at least the
major streets; larger cities such as Atlanta have street maps as
detailed as any available for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Trip planning is done either manually, which is not as easy as
most other programs, or through the Trip Wizard, which is easy
enough but still a little cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when you select the Wizard, you get a pointless
introductory screen; next comes a ``Set Origin and Destination''
screen at which you actually select neither. Instead, you click on
either origin or destination, which takes you to yet another screen
in which you type the name of the city or, if you really aren't
sure where you wish to start, scroll down an understandably
interminable list of places to make a choice. Then you go back to
the previous screen and do the same thing for destination.
</P>
<P>
   Five screens, in other words, where one could have done the job.
</P>
<P>
   There is a guidebook where you can choose to get information on
a wide variety of attractions or matters of interest, from
high-rated hostelries and restaurants to historic locations, and
specify how far they can be from a certain point. But you have to
select the point. I can find no way to select an entire route for
this feature. Instead, I had to calculate the route and then click
at random spots along the way to get that kind of information.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting any of the locations produced by the guidebook allows
the user to both locate them on the map and store the information
regarding them to a separate notebook, which can be printed out.
</P>
<P>
   There is a selection of walking tours, which is quite small and
limited to Eastern locations. Short driving tours are much more
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating a trip is the slowest process I've seen in a program
of this type, but it's not slow enough to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   There's a tips and advice section on a number of travel
subjects, useful mainly if you have a computer with you when you
need the advice.
</P>
<P>
   This is a decent travel program, but not even the blank travel
notebook National Geographic includes raises it to the level of
Rand McNally's TripMaker.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a way to tell how heavy wrapping paper is before
buying it? I am so tired of cheap paper that tears easily. Surely
there is some guide like there is with sheets. _Carolyn E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Like a 310 thread-count per inch? Some companies have a
reputation for thick paper _ Sample House, Schwartz. You can only
tell by touch or by folding the paper. So that means buying
wrapping paper from a source that allows you to feel the goods.
Paper is measured in mils _ a very confusing measure you never see
on a label. Good wrapping paper is thicker than either fax paper or
newsprint. A simple test: Fold the paper. Folds in thin paper lie
flat; thick paper springs open.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The recipe for Tom and Jerry batter calls for beating
separated eggs and then combining them. I hesitated to use it for
the umpteenth time this year because I could picture my R.N.
daughter asking, ``We're not drinking RAW eggs in this, are we?''
and forcing the rest of the group to make a risk/reward assessment.
Do you know if any food person has ever looked at this and
concluded _ I hope _ that rum, brandy and boiling water clobber any
bugs that may be in those eggs? Am I beating this batter question
to death? Appreciate your time on this less-than-world-shaking
matter. _John N.
</P>
<P>
   A: This cold-weather drink is popular with transplanted
northerners. The bug to worry about in raw eggs is salmonella.
``Alcohol does not destroy salmonella bacteria,'' says Ione Wenzel
of the Texas Department of Health, retail foods division.
Temperatures over 145 degrees (sustained for 15 seconds) kill
salmonella. Maybe the R.N. has a point.Q: This year I could not
find the plain, plastic luminarias _ the ones on a form to place
over Christmas lights. We went to see the lights in Marshall, and
although there are miles of them strung along residential
sidewalks, I did not find them in any stores there. Where do they
get them? All I have found are those miserable things with sand and
a candle. I know it's too late for this year, but maybe for next
year? _Esther McConoghy
</P>
<P>
   A: Farolitos (little lanterns) were used by Spanish colonists in
New Mexico as early as the 1620s. The candles are said to
illuminate the way of the Christ child to holiday homes. Next year
The Famous Christmas Store will have more of these electric
luminarias in stock. To order now and store for Christmas 1999,
call (800) 447-0048, Alsto's Handy Helpers, one of my favorite
catalogs.Q: Where can I buy tire chains for our family cars? I
called around with no luck. I would like to buy them even if I use
them once in three years. Austin definitely needs them after this
horrible ice storm we had. Lives could have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   _Yvonne Heath
</P>
<P>
   A: Order tire chains from any Pep Boys. Chains are ordered in
pairs and range from $50 to $89 a pair. Drive friendly!
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar:

<P>
   _ Did you sip from the good crystal during the holidays? You may
be interested in a cleaning tip from crystal-master Waterford. Wash
crystal by hand only, using warm water and mild soap. To clean the
interiors of vases and decanters, fill them halfway with warm
water, two tablespoons of white vinegar or ammonia and 1/4 cup
uncooked rice. The rice is a mild abrasive and, when swirled
around, gently removes interior film. Finish with a vinegar and
water solution, which adds sparkle. Dry with a lint-free cloth.

   _ Readers shared suggestions for cleaning grimy fireplace glass.
Make sure the glass is cool before cleaning. One reader extolled

   1. SHOCKUMENTARIES : WHEN ANIMALS ATTACK, CARS CRASH
</P>
<P>
   AND STUNTS GO BAD TV 'shockumentaries' such as ``World's
Scariest Police Chases 4'' and ``Surviving the Moment of Impact''
are stealing audiences from high-tech, special-effects,
million-dollar productions The shockumentary is the disaster epic
of the MTV age, edited at light speed. Its goal is to let viewers
quench the morbid desire to witness acts of tragedy and mayhem. By
Tom Vanderbilt. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length
(3,500 words) + edited article available. 2. HOW RUSSIANS LIVE
WITHOUT MONEY Most Russians today live in the precapitalist economy
of the Soviet era - and in some cases, not even that well. By Serge
Schmemann. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (4,600
words) + edited article available. (Schmemann, a reporter for The
New York Times, was its correspondent in Moscow for many years.) 3.
HAVANA : CAPITAL OF DREAMS Fidel Castro took power in Cuba 40 years
ago with the ambitious goals of creating a ``new man'' and
eliminating the profit motive and prostitution. Today, Castro is
like a dinosaur who doesn't know he is extinct. The dollar reigns
in Havana, decay is all around, and prostitutes are plentiful.
Every day, several buildings simply collapse. Despite all this,
ordinary Cubans are finding ways to create their own space, and
make their own luck. And the once-glorious Old Town is finally
being rebuilt. By Eric Follath. From Der Spiegel. (English
translation available.) 1,500 words. 4. FROM MAN AS MEMORY TO THE
CONVEYOR OF HISTORY For decades, no one was interested in hearing
what survivors of the Shoah had to say about their experiences. Now
they are invited to schools and colleges, filmed on video for
archives and asked to speak on radio and TV. A new book by
historian Annette Wieviorka ('The Era of the Witness',) shows how
attitudes towards witnesses of the past have shifted down the
years. By Nicole Lapierre. From Le Monde. (English translation
available.) 1,500 words.

ATTACK OF THE SUPERBUGS! At least half the human use of antibiotics
in the U.S. is unnecessary or inappropriate, says microbiologist
Stuart Levy. ``Either antibiotics are not indicated at all, or the
wrong antibiotic is prescribed, or it's the wrong dosage or the
wrong duration.'' The upshot of this massive exposure is
disease-causing bugs that resist the drugs that once thwarted them.
They're superbugs and their power is frightening. Superbugs can
withstand not just one, but multitudes of antibiotics. Is it too
late to do anything? By Peter Radetsky. From Discover magazine.

Daimler-Benz, embodies the new triumphant Germany that is
conquering the United States. And Bertelsmann, the world's
third-largest media company, took over Random House last March,
thus becoming the top US publishing house. By Arnaud Leparmentier.

BIN LADEN LINK TO YEMEN EXPLORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following the release of two American tourists
after a deadly hostage standoff in Yemen, FBI investigators have
traveled to the Middle East nation to search for clues in the
attack, a spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did not confirm reports that Osama Bin Laden, the
Saudi millionaire suspected in the bombing of two US embassies in
Africa this summer, may be linked to the December kidnapping of 16
Westerners. The rescue attempt by Yemeni officials left three
British and one Australian dead. But bin Laden's strong connection
to Yemen, and his anti-Western sentiments, are well-documented, and
might reasonably lead investigators at least to consider his
involvement, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does have ties and contacts there, and there is no doubt
extremist Islamic terrorists have found sanctuary in Yemen,'' said
Stanley Bedlington, a former CIA counterterrorism specialist. On
the other hand, he added, ``He's becoming rather like a mythical
Robin Hood. Any crime that's committed is immediately ascribed to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports of bin Laden's connection to the Yemeni attack
coincided with the release of new interviews with the reclusive
Saudi, including one in which he came close to acknowledging a role
in attacks on Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after the embassy bombings, and the ensuing US
military raid on suspected bin Laden strongholds in Afghanistan and
Sudan, bin Laden summoned two Pakistani reporters to his mountain
compound. There, clutching an AK-47 across his chest, bin Laden
held two interviews on successive days, according to accounts in
this week's issues of Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   He told each a different story. To the Newsweek reporter, bin
Laden denied all culpability, saying of the bombings on Dec. 22
that he ``did not order them but was very glad for what happened to
the Americans there.''
</P>
<P>
   One day later, he gave a different account to a Time reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the instigation for jihad against the Jews and the
Americans . . . is considered a crime, then let history be a
witness that I am a criminal,'' bin Laden said. ``Our job is to
instigate, and by the grace of God, we did that, and certain people
responded to this instigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve Americans were killed in the Aug. 7 bombings in Tanzania
and Kenya, along with 212 Africans. Bin Laden, who was indicted in
federal court last year, is wanted by the United States. There is a
$5 million reward for his capture.
</P>
<P>
   In the attack in Yemen, a group of assailants, reportedly
members of the fundamentalist Islamic Jihad, captured the 16
tourists on Dec. 29. The incident has sparked controversy between
the host nation and Great Britain, home of three of the murder
victims; it has also brought several FBI agents as well as
detectives from Scotland Yard to Yemen, according to the London
Sunday Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers, who were arrested after the rescue raid, were
allegedly trained by bin Laden, who has also expressed strong
support of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, the paper said. According
to the Arabic newspaper Al Watan Al Arabi, bin Laden has had
significant business interests in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has been suspected of violence in Yemen in the past,
and is wanted in connection with two separate hotel bombings
targeting Western soldiers in 1992 and 1993, Al Watan Al Arabi
reported.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a way to tell how heavy wrapping paper is before
buying it? I am so tired of cheap paper that tears easily. Surely
there is some guide like there is with sheets. _Carolyn E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Like a 310 thread-count per inch? Some companies have a
reputation for thick paper _ Sample House, Schwartz. You can only
tell by touch or by folding the paper. So that means buying
wrapping paper from a source that allows you to feel the goods.
Paper is measured in mils _ a very confusing measure you never see
on a label. Good wrapping paper is thicker than either fax paper or
newsprint. A simple test: Fold the paper. Folds in thin paper lie
flat; thick paper springs open.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The recipe for Tom and Jerry batter calls for beating
separated eggs and then combining them. I hesitated to use it for
the umpteenth time this year because I could picture my R.N.
daughter asking, ``We're not drinking RAW eggs in this, are we?''
and forcing the rest of the group to make a risk/reward assessment.
Do you know if any food person has ever looked at this and
concluded _ I hope _ that rum, brandy and boiling water clobber any
bugs that may be in those eggs? Am I beating this batter question
to death? Appreciate your time on this less-than-world-shaking
matter. _John N.
</P>
<P>
   A: This cold-weather drink is popular with transplanted
northerners. The bug to worry about in raw eggs is salmonella.
``Alcohol does not destroy salmonella bacteria,'' says Ione Wenzel
of the Texas Department of Health, retail foods division.
Temperatures over 145 degrees (sustained for 15 seconds) kill
salmonella. Maybe the R.N. has a point.Q: This year I could not
find the plain, plastic luminarias _ the ones on a form to place
over Christmas lights. We went to see the lights in Marshall, and
although there are miles of them strung along residential
sidewalks, I did not find them in any stores there. Where do they
get them? All I have found are those miserable things with sand and
a candle. I know it's too late for this year, but maybe for next
year? _Esther McConoghy
</P>
<P>
   A: Farolitos (little lanterns) were used by Spanish colonists in
New Mexico as early as the 1620s. The candles are said to
illuminate the way of the Christ child to holiday homes. Next year
The Famous Christmas Store will have more of these electric
luminarias in stock. To order now and store for Christmas 1999,
call (800) 447-0048, Alsto's Handy Helpers, one of my favorite
catalogs.Q: Where can I buy tire chains for our family cars? I
called around with no luck. I would like to buy them even if I use
them once in three years. Austin definitely needs them after this
horrible ice storm we had. Lives could have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   _Yvonne Heath
</P>
<P>
   A: Order tire chains from any Pep Boys. Chains are ordered in
pairs and range from $50 to $89 a pair. Drive friendly!

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a way to tell how heavy wrapping paper is before
buying it? I am so tired of cheap paper that tears easily. Surely
there is some guide like there is with sheets. _Carolyn E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Like a 310 thread-count per inch? Some companies have a
reputation for thick paper _ Sample House, Schwartz. You can only
tell by touch or by folding the paper. So that means buying
wrapping paper from a source that allows you to feel the goods.
Paper is measured in mils _ a very confusing measure you never see
on a label. Good wrapping paper is thicker than either fax paper or
newsprint. A simple test: Fold the paper. Folds in thin paper lie
flat; thick paper springs open.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The recipe for Tom and Jerry batter calls for beating
separated eggs and then combining them. I hesitated to use it for
the umpteenth time this year because I could picture my R.N.
daughter asking, ``We're not drinking RAW eggs in this, are we?''
and forcing the rest of the group to make a risk/reward assessment.
Do you know if any food person has ever looked at this and
concluded _ I hope _ that rum, brandy and boiling water clobber any
bugs that may be in those eggs? Am I beating this batter question
to death? Appreciate your time on this less-than-world-shaking
matter. _John N.
</P>
<P>
   A: This cold-weather drink is popular with transplanted
northerners. The bug to worry about in raw eggs is salmonella.
``Alcohol does not destroy salmonella bacteria,'' says Ione Wenzel
of the Texas Department of Health, retail foods division.
Temperatures over 145 degrees (sustained for 15 seconds) kill
salmonella. Maybe the R.N. has a point.Q: This year I could not
find the plain, plastic luminarias _ the ones on a form to place
over Christmas lights. We went to see the lights in Marshall, and
although there are miles of them strung along residential
sidewalks, I did not find them in any stores there. Where do they
get them? All I have found are those miserable things with sand and
a candle. I know it's too late for this year, but maybe for next
year? _Esther McConoghy
</P>
<P>
   A: Farolitos (little lanterns) were used by Spanish colonists in
New Mexico as early as the 1620s. The candles are said to
illuminate the way of the Christ child to holiday homes. Next year
The Famous Christmas Store will have more of these electric
luminarias in stock. To order now and store for Christmas 1999,
call (800) 447-0048, Alsto's Handy Helpers, one of my favorite
catalogs.Q: Where can I buy tire chains for our family cars? I
called around with no luck. I would like to buy them even if I use
them once in three years. Austin definitely needs them after this
horrible ice storm we had. Lives could have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   _Yvonne Heath
</P>
<P>
   A: Order tire chains from any Pep Boys. Chains are ordered in
pairs and range from $50 to $89 a pair. Drive friendly!
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar:
</P>
<P>
   _ Did you sip from the good crystal during the holidays? You may
be interested in a cleaning tip from crystal-master Waterford. Wash
crystal by hand only, using warm water and mild soap. To clean the
interiors of vases and decanters, fill them halfway with warm
water, two tablespoons of white vinegar or ammonia and 1/4 cup
uncooked rice. The rice is a mild abrasive and, when swirled
around, gently removes interior film. Finish with a vinegar and
water solution, which adds sparkle. Dry with a lint-free cloth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Readers shared suggestions for cleaning grimy fireplace glass.
Make sure the glass is cool before cleaning. One reader extolled
the virtues of Easy-Off Oven Cleaner; one, household ammonia and
newspaper; and another, a damp newspaper (not just for getting news
and information anymore!) and wood ashes to cut the black goo.

   PAPERWAR _ The morning Chattanooga Times, started just after the
Civil War, finally surrendered to its afternoon competitor, the
Free Press, and a combined paper starts publication Jan 5. This
signals the end of a decades long war between two paper-publishing
families: the descendents of Adolph Ochs (of NYT fame; the Times is
his first paper), who are liberal, Jewish and old money, and the
McDonalds, who are conservative, fundamentalist Christian and
started the paper in the 40s as a shopper for their own grocery
store. Walter Hussman, owner of the Little Rock paper, bought the
McDonalds' paper, and then the Ochs descendents threw in the towel
and sold to him as well. (Hendrick, Atlkanta Journal-Constitution).

 &HT;    As the dawn of new century nears, Americans keep their sunny
side up
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are nothing if not perky. As the 20th century winds down,
pollsters, economists and other trend watchers say American
optimism is surging. Instead of turning into a mature country,
weary of its burdens and cynical about its success, we seem to be
getting younger ... and happier.
</P>
<P>
   Cheerfulness is showing up in all sorts of measures. President
Clinton gets impeached by the U.S. House, and his approval rating
surges to more than 70 percent. The global economy turns grim, and
U.S. consumer confidence rises to exuberant levels. The United
States bombs Iraq, and the stock market shoots to record heights.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe our sunniness has something to do with the thrill of
preparing for a new century. Today's optimism in many ways mirrors
what the nation experienced in 1899. ``People were euphoric around
the turn of the (last) century,'' said Claudia Goldin, an economic
historian at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Gay '90s'' of the last century found most Americans
thinking the future was filled with exciting possibilities because
of new technologies and the dramatic growth in immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Today, those same two characters _ the technology wizard and the
naturalized citizen _ may again be fueling our optimism. On Wall
Street, high-tech companies' stock prices soar. Meanwhile,
immigrants stir a sense of hopefulness.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between the late 1890s and the 1990s are
considerable. A century ago, average Americans were just beginning
to see their daily lives become easier because of inventions such
as the light bulb, telephone and bicycle. Parents who used to
huddle around kerosene lamps could relax with the evening newspaper
and watch their children do homework under the bright glow of an
electric lamp.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners, too, were rejoicing. With immigrants streaming
into the country, employers finally could find enough workers to
operate their new steel mills, factories and railroads. And the
immigrants themselves brought optimism.
</P>
<P>
   By moving to a new country, Goldin said, ``they are taking
things into their own hands. So simply in terms of self-selection,
immigrants are optimists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1990s, Americans are seeing an updated version of
the same trends. Computers are entering our daily lives and leading
us to believe in a better future. When children do school projects
with the help of the Internet, parents feel a sense of pride and
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   And just as in the 1890s, our inventions are giving rise to new
fortunes. Then we admired the builders of railroads, factories and
such; today, we are awed by Bill Gates and other computer tycoons.
And because of the availability of high-tech stocks, many ordinary
workers also are getting richer. ``Americans are saying, `Wow, any
one of us could be a cowboy capitalist too,''' Goldin said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, new citizens are renewing our sense of hope.
``Immigrants tend to be people who think the future looks brighter,
especially for their children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But even the cheeriest periods have their dark sides. That was
certainly true in the 1890s, when ``there were things that many
people were very scared about: socialism, communism, anarchism,
Catholicism'' and more, Goldin said. ``There was a tremendous fear
that the very rock foundations of the country were going to be
swept away'' by huge businesses, foreigners and political radicals.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is fear, too. Many Americans question whether the
economy can absorb so many newcomers, and parents worry about their
children being exposed to bad influences through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the parallels, the intensity of emotions differs. A
century ago, people were positively ``exuberant'' or abjectly
terrified, Goldin said. In the 1990s, Americans are mellower. For
example, ``people don't seem to be as upset'' about business
monopolies or as inclined to allow fear of immigrants to spark
Klan-type violence, she said.
</P>
<P>
   How long this mellow mood will last is anyone's guess. But look
on the bright side: Optimism is so basic to the American character
that even when it dims for a while, the sun always shines again.
``We are phenomenally optimistic,'' Goldin said.

CALIFORNIA'S NEW GOVERNOR POSITIONS HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY and ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Joseph Graham Davis Jr., who was raised in
a Republican family but became the chief aide to former Gov. Jerry
Brown, becomes the first Democratic governor of California in 16
years with a promise to find a center between his father and his
old boss.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``Gray'' by his family, Gov.-elect Davis says he'll
take California into an era of political compromise, ending years
of divisiveness between Republican governors and Democratic
legislatures, while steering clear of Jerry Brown's unorthodox
liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the cautious lieutenant governor is borrowing from
President Clinton's centrist playbook: he's tough on crime and
supports the death penalty; he's made education his top priority;
he claims to be a fiscal conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But while those moderate positions may have gotten him elected,
Davis is taking over a California that faces critical problems as
wide-ranging as Indian casinos, clogged freeways and the division
of scarce water resources. And he must try to solve those problems
without a lot of extra cash: The state faces a large budget deficit
in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   He also must deal with the pent-up demands of a Democratic state
legislature that has seen many of its initiatives vetoed year after
year by Govs. Pete Wilson and George Deukmejian.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' dilemma is whether to tackle the state's most complicated
and long-ignored problems, such as the shortage of affordable
housing, or push a more limited agenda that he thinks he can
accomplish in time for a re-election bid in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The new governor says he will be able to achieve what neither
Wilson nor Deukmejian nor his old boss Jerry Brown could: broker
solutions amenable to both Democrats and Republicans from his
position in the middle of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Not all observers are as optimistic about the power of a
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy Roosevelt answered that question,'' said state
assemblyman Tom McClintock, a conservative from Ventura who is
often a thorn in the side of Republicans and Democrats. ``He said
(moderate) is the `great gray twilight that knows neither victory
nor defeat.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, so far, Davis has built an administration that looks like
what voters would expect from a traditional Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   He has appointed a large number of Hispanics, a few African
Americans, Asians and the ``first Asian-Pacific American to hold a
cabinet position'' _ Lon Hatamiya, the new secretary of trade and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just going to be an enormous change of tone,'' said
Philip Trounstine, Davis' communications director, who is changing
his party affiliation from decline-to-state to Democrat. ``There is
going to be a change in priorities and emphasis.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis must deal with his first major headache: a projected $2.5
billion to $3 billion deficit. Friday, the new governor will
announce his budget for the coming year. Observers will watch to
see how well he appeases the business community while answering his
own party's call for more money for education, HMO reform and
stricter environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, Davis must step into a series of thorny
issues: A battle is brewing with the state's Indian tribes over
regulating casino-style gambling under Proposition 5. The $490
million deal to save some of the Headwaters forest from logging is
falling apart. Trial attorneys, who contributed to Davis' campaign,
want to increase the amount of damages that can be collected in
medical malpractice cases.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his term, he will face some of California's
most controversial and difficult problems. An anti-gay marriage
initiative is headed for the 2000 ballot. The freeways are clogged
beyond anything endured in state history. The Delta is dirty, and
Southern California wants more water from Northern California. The
Asian financial crisis could hammer California.
</P>
<P>
   The first big issue could be the heated struggle over Indian
gambling. Voters approved Proposition 5, the measure to allow
tribes to operate slot machines, but opponents are challenging its
constitutionality in the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who stayed neutral on the issue through the campaign _
though he made conciliatory statements to the tribes _ could make
the issue moot by agreeing to pacts to allow the 44 gambling tribes
to offer slots, which Wilson refused to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that's on the mind of anyone in Cala
Market, but it's a murky policy area that's going to have to be
resolved,'' said San Francisco assemblywoman Carole Migden.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also will have to deal with a higher education system
that's world-renowned but still reeling from Proposition 209, which
banned affirmative action and led to significant drops in minority
enrollment, including a 47 percent decline among minorities in this
year's freshman class at University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Davis opposed Prop. 209, but has said he would not try to
reverse the successful 1996 ballot measure. During the campaign, he
proposed a new admissions system to require the UC schools to
accept the top 4 percent of graduates from every high school in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone coming in after Pete Wilson has to be better,'' said
Carlos Munoz Jr., professor of history and politics UC-Berkeley and
an outspoken 209 foe. ``(But) I don't see Davis really being that
committed to doing what he can, given his power as governor, to
turn back the 209 tide and change the laws to reflect a pre-209
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who beat Republican opponent Dan Lungren in part by
appearing tough on crime, also will have to manage a prison system
that is growing steadily because of tougher sentencing laws, like
``three strikes,'' which Davis backed. Though crime rates have
dropped in recent years, prison populations continue to swell,
growing 10-fold in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if prison expenses continue to grow, Davis will have less
money available for programs he favors, such as education.

DAVIS LURES CLINTON ADVISERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Gov. Gray Davis is drawing
heavily from the Clinton administration for his innermost circle of
advisers, a sign that Democrats banished from the governor's office
for 16 years are returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, Davis has filled five out of a dozen
cabinet positions _ the secretaries of health and human services,
resources, food and agriculture, trade and commerce, and state and
consumer affairs _ with people who have worked or still work for
the embattled president.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 30 top-level people appointed by Davis so far,
eight have worked for Clinton. The migration is a natural one,
especially since Clinton has two years (or less) left in his term,
and Democrats have gubernatorial jobs available for the first time
since Jerry Brown left office in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor-elect made it clear,'' said Davis spokesman
Michael Bustamante, ``that he was going to look for the best and
the brightest California has to offer. I'm certain that was the
same criteria the president used.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Davis appointments, the most politically connected to
Clinton appears to be Davis' new legal affairs secretary, Demetrios
A. Boutris, who worked in the mid-'90s as a special counsel to U.S.
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, Boutris was questioned by investigators for
the House of Representative for his role in helping expand the
so-called Bingaman Commission on Pacific trade and investment.
Boutris did the legal work to increase the number of commissioners
from 15 to ``up to 20,'' but, according to a House deposition, not
much more.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was important to the congressional committee
because Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie, a major contributor to Clinton's
legal defense fund, had been appointed to it by President Clinton.
Trie fled the country and now faces charges of funneling illegal
contributions to the Democratic National Committee to gain access
to Clinton and other top officials.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokesman Bustamante said Boutris was ``an extremely
accomplished lawyer who will certainly serve the governor-elect
with distinction.'' He declined to comment on the Trie connection,
saying it was irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Boutris and the agency chiefs, Davis has tapped Los
Angeles firefighter Dallas Jones, a Clinton appointee to a
committee that advises Federal Emergency Management Agency Director
James Lee Witt. Jones will be the new director of the state office
of emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   Grantland Johnson, the new secretary of health and human
services, has served since 1993 as a regional director for the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also appointed former Clinton administration official Mary
Nichols to become secretary of resources, heading the agency that
oversees 14 environment-related boards, commissions and
departments.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists cheered the appointment of Nichols, who also
worked for ex-Gov. Brown and helped form the League of Conservation
Voters. But some conservatives say Davis broke his promise to steer
a middle course in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the campaign, Gray Davis said he'd govern from the
middle,'' said Assemblyman Rico Oller, a Republican from San
Andreas. ``However, this appointment of Nichols signals a return to
the extreme politics of the Jerry Brown administration.''

US, ANNAN AT ODDS OVER IRAQ POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years after the Clinton administration sponsored
Kofi Annan's rise to power as UN secretary general, Washington's
relationship with the Ghanaian diplomat has degenerated to its
worst state ever.
</P>
<P>
   Senior US officials, including national security adviser Samuel
R. Berger and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, have
accused him in recent months of going soft on Saddam Hussein and
interfering with US plans to bomb Iraq in November, according to UN
sources. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering recently paid a
visit to the UN chief to quash a series of initiatives under
consideration by his advisers that would have eased sanctions on
Iraq and diluted the UN weapons inspection teams in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   As the UN Security Council gets set to debate the future of the
UN's Iraq policy in the coming weeks, US diplomats are seeking to
head off Russian, French, and Chinese attempts to expand the
secretary general's role in managing the UN's relationship with the
Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute is the feeling that the secretary
general, in his desire to bring peace to the Persian Gulf, has been
too willing to grant concessions to Hussein. But the discord more
broadly reflects the inevitable conflict inherent in the
relationship between the United States and the post of UN secretary
general.
</P>
<P>
   The late U Thant of Burma, secretary general during the 1960s,
riled the Johnson administration by criticizing the US war in
Vietnam and seeking a mediation role. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
Annan's Egyptian predecessor, was pressured out of office by the
Clinton administration when he did not implement fiscal changes at
the UN urged by Washington and thwarted efforts to launch NATO
strikes against Bosnian Serb forces attacking civilians in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been few moments in the history of the United
Nations when there hasn't been a period of tension between the
secretary general and the United States over the main issue of the
day,'' said James Placke, a veteran US Middle East diplomat who now
works at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ``You saw it
during decolonization, apartheid, and throughout the entire Cold
War.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's closest aides say the secretary general's activism in
Iraq has been unavoidable. They note that France, China, and Russia
_ three of the five permanent members of the Security Council _
have been pressing Annan to take a more activist role in Iraq, as
has much of the Arab world. Besides, they say, the secretary
general works for all 185 UN member states and he has a duty to
pursue peaceful settlements, even when that involves sitting across
the table with the world's ``rogue'' leaders, from Hussein to
Moammar Khadafy.
</P>
<P>
   Observers note that the Clinton administration authorized
Annan's diplomatic intervention in Iraq in February when he
traveled to Baghdad to persuade Hussein to grant unfettered access
to UN weapons inspectors seeking to eliminate Iraq's nuclear,
chemical, and biological weapons. They say that Annan is now being
made a scapegoat for an administration that is sensitive to
criticism from Congress that it has appeased Hussein for too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a fan of the February deal, but I think its unfair
to say he bore responsibility,'' said Patrick Clawson, an analyst
at the Washington Institute of Near East Policy. ``He offered
himself as a useful interlocutor; he checked very carefully with
the US; and he said if it doesn't work out it's my skin, not yours,
that's on the line. And that's what the Americans wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Clawson said more is at stake for the United Nations than
Annan's personal relationship with Washington. He counseled Annan
to recede into the background on the diplomatic front and work
behind the scenes to forge consensus among the key members of the
sharply divided Security Council. Otherwise, he said, the United
States may decide to ignore the council in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot be an activist in a situation where the permanent
five members of the Security Council don't agree,'' said Clawson.
``Under those circumstances, the best thing to do is go back to
being a secretary and not a general.''
</P>
<P>
   The friction between Washington and the UN has clearly taken a
toll on the secretary general in recent weeks. On the eve of the
US-British air attack on Iraq, Annan reminded Washington that its
policy of toppling Hussein was in no way sanctioned by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has also lashed out at Washington for demanding UN fiscal
reform while failing to pay nearly $1 billion in dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have done enough,'' Annan said during a press
conference in mid-December. ``We should be allowed to focus on our
work and not face constant harassment of reform, reform, reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one thing to encourage efficiency,'' he said. ``It is
quite another to be subjected to a starvation diet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kofi is a man of peace who tries to avoid conflict wherever he
can,'' said a White House official. ``We respect his integrity and
independence, but at the end of the day we will pursue our own
national interests, and that doesn't always coincide with the
interests of the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody likes and respects him,'' added a former US
official and friend of Annan. ``He is a man of good will. It's just
that a lot of men of good will do bad things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he has created a lot of unhappiness in Washington over
Iraq. Many think he has lost his sense of judgment,'' he added.
``The relationship has gone through a bad spell, which could have a
longer-term impact.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the four-day US-British bombing campaign in
Iraq that ended on Dec. 19, Annan has taken a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say Annan may eventually return to a more active role in
Iraq policy. He has established a task force to generate ideas that
would help unify the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are looking for Annan to come up with ideas,''
said a senior UN aide to Annan. ``The secretary general wants to
wait and allow the temperatures to cool.''

CATHOLIC COLLEGES SEE PERIL IN VATICAN PUSH FOR CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its brochures, Boston College acknowledges that it is a
Catholic school, dedicated by its Jesuit founders to ``a world view
that encounters God in all creation.''
</P>
<P>
   It devotes much more ink to detailing what makes BC a hot school
in national rankings: the academic excellence of its faculty and
graduate schools, selective admissions, its 33 Division I athletic
teams, an $814 million endowment, and the diversity of a student
body that hails from 85 nations.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Catholicism has coexisted with excellence.
</P>
<P>
   But at BC and other Catholic colleges, administrators and
professors say a dispute with the Vatican now jeopardizes the
national prominence they have worked for decades to achieve,
thrusting them into a tug of war that at its most extreme could
force schools to cut their Catholic ties.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on a proposal that would transfer control of
the 236 Catholic colleges and universities in the United States
from their boards of trustees to local bishops, rewriting the
schools' charters to put them under Vatican law.
</P>
<P>
   Schools would be expected to have a majority of trustees and
faculty be ``faithful Catholics,'' and theology professors would be
required to get a mandate from the local bishop. The mandate would
be revoked because of teachings that stray from Catholic doctrine.
Any non-Catholic faculty would have to ``exhibit integrity of
doctrine and good character,'' and would be encouraged to attend
frequent lectures on church teachings.
</P>
<P>
   The document was proposed in November by the US Conference of
Catholic Bishops. But the bishops say they are acting only under
pressure from the Vatican, which, alarmed by recent sales of
Catholic hospitals and declining numbers of nuns and priests to
serve as teachers, wants to make sure that Catholic schools stay
firmly in its fist.
</P>
<P>
   College presidents say that as much as they want to strengthen
Catholic ties, the proposed changes present innumerable legal
perils, and are sure to prompt lawsuits over hiring discrimination
and free speech, prevent schools from getting federal grants and
students from getting federal loans, and hurt the schools' ability
to attract a stellar faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of intrusions into the academic community are just
going to wave red flags in front of a lot of academic bulls,'' said
Thomas J. Reese, editor of America, the Jesuit magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The universities are caught between a rock and a hard place.
Clearly they want to be Catholic, but they also want to be a
credible institution. They are trying to be both, and they think
they are being successful at that. But if the Vatican continues to
pressure them on this, they are going to have to choose between
being Catholic and being academically credible. It's going to force
some of them to be nonsectarian, and force others to give up their
academic respectability.''
</P>
<P>
   For the schools, the conflict is the paradox of prosperity. Like
BC, most were local institutions on the edge of economic stability
in the late 1960s. To stay viable and attract students, they added
lay expertise to once all-clergy boards of trustees and faculties,
putting a premium on academic talent over faith. Encouraged by the
ecumenical spirit that came out of the Second Vatican Council, they
added professors of many faiths.
</P>
<P>
   As they became diverse, national institutions, more conservative
Catholics worried that the schools were putting their religious
identity up for auction. So, over a decade ago, the Vatican and
bishops around the world began discussions about a document to
ensure that Catholic higher education stayed Catholic, both in the
United States and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   With pressure from a delegation of American Catholic academics
that lobbied in Rome, the Vatican agreed that the final document
should respect the culture of different nations _ for the United
States, notions of academic freedom and healthy dissent. In 1990,
it released the document ``Ex Corde Ecclesiae,'' literally ``from
the heart of the church,'' as an overall guideline. The Vatican
left it to bishops in individual countries to localize the document
to their universities.
</P>
<P>
   The US bishops agreed on a version of the document in late 1996
by a vote of 224-6. The Vatican rejected it, sending it back a year
later with a demand for tighter language to guarantee the bishops'
control over the schools _ veto power instead of a consultant's
role. The bishops responded in November with the current proposal,
leaving colleges until May to make comments before a final vote
late in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops insist the proposal could change as the debate
unfolds over the year. And how strictly the new rules would be
enforced would depend on state constitutions regarding separation
of church and state, as well as the relationship between colleges
and the local bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, for instance, has developed a
warm relationship with Boston College's president, the Rev. William
P. Leahy, who is considered to have reinforced the school's
Catholic identity after years when, local clergy complained, the
school had strayed. Law said he will withhold comment on the
document until he sees how the debate plays out over the year.
</P>
<P>
   Some bishops share the concerns about the dwindling Catholic
influence on campus. At the conference in November, Bishop Allen H.
Vigneron, auxiliary bishop of Detroit, welcomed the proposal as ``a
solid mechanism for assuring Catholic identity of institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   College presidents, though, say it presents so many problems, in
practice and in principle, that it would be unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   Under Title VII, federal aid can go to Catholic colleges only if
they are controlled by a lay board. Once control goes to the
bishop, the institutions are classified as church organizations,
and the law throws up a wall barring the school from getting
government money, and students from getting federal aid.

SAN FRANCISCO MAN CLAIMS EXPLOSIVES STOCKPILE WERE A `HOBBY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A PG&AMP;E serviceman accused of stockpiling large
quantities of explosives materials at his home and workplace simply
had a bad habit of collecting more than what he needed to fuel a
harmless hobby of making little firecrackers, his attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Joseph Madronich Jr., 44, of San Francisco, has been making
small firecrackers to share with friends for several years with no
intent of creating anything more substantial or dangerous, said
attorney Jerrold Ladar. Friends and family knew of his ``hobby''
for years and even nicknamed him ``the Unabomer'' but felt no need
to turn him over to authorities, Ladar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody felt he was not (a danger) to the community or
himself,'' Ladar said. ``This was just a hobby that he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Madronich, a 19-year PG&AMP;E employee, was arrested Thursday on
three charges of possessing illegal explosives and is being held in
county jail on $1 million bail. Authorities seized five 50-pound
bags of ammonium nitrate, a 33-gallon barrel of calcium nitrate and
bomb-making books from his work locker and his parents' home on
Potrero Hill where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   They also seized ammonium nitrate from a Sonoma home his parents
own _ a substance Ladar said was used to fertilize the garden
there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the District Attorney's office say they have a
strong case against Madronich but have no evidence indicating that
he was plotting an explosives attack.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Jean Daly said the amount of
explosives found could have ``done significant damage'' to a
building and ``endangered the lives and safety of the general
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Madronich did not intend any harm to come from the
explosives, Daly said, he is still violating the law by possessing
and assembling such devices.
</P>
<P>
   But Ladar said Madronich has been swept up in a zealous
prosecution for having a misguided hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's upset about being arrested,'' Ladar said. ``He has 19
years with PG&AMP;E with no history (of bad behavior). I think he's a
little bewildered. I get the very genuine feeling from him that he
was like, `What did I do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ladar conceded that his client would make a variety of
firecrackers and ``acorn explosives''_ filling acorn shells with an
explosive powder. But he said investigators found no evidence that
Ladar was building anything bigger than a small firecracker.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two substances (ammonium nitrate fertilizer and calcium
nitrate) don't pose a danger of exploding unless you mix them
together in some kind of ratio and add a fuel and a fuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that such large quantities of the substance were found
in Madronich's possession were consistent with a habit Madronich
had of collecting more than what he needed, Ladar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tends to oversupply with a lot of stuff,'' Ladar said,
describing his client's penchant for buying in bulk _ be it bottles
of wine or shoes on sale. ``Most of his friends and neighbors say
that this is a guy who's been known to buy more stuff then he
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladar said officials found additional fertilizer at the Sonoma
residence and an unknown white powder that was detonated
underground at the property but no explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client has been very forthcoming with authorities
and hopes prosectors will believe that Madronich did not intend to
harm anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that the search for justice and truth would allow
them to get all their facts before them and they'll see,'' Ladar
said.

RUSSIA'S ABUSED CHILDREN SUFFER GRIM NEGLECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOMILINO, Russia _ Dima Chesnokov has known more hardship in his
seven years than most people do in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   His abusive, alcoholic father forced him and his sister to beg
for money at the local market. When Dima's mother died last year,
his father's drinking became worse. So did the daily beatings, as
evidenced by the scars on the boy's body. The family lost its home
and moved into a barn. And when his father drank faster than they
could beg, he began killing stray dogs to feed his children, until
finally he abandoned them.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly for Dima, the shelter cannot keep him. He will probably
not be adopted by a Russian family and end up instead in Russia's
notorious state orphanage system, doomed to a life of ``deprivation
and cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how the New York-based Human Rights Watch described
conditions for many of the 200,000 children who live in Russian
orphanages. In its report released Dec. 17, it described state
institutions as a ``gulag'' where children suffer ``appalling
levels of abuse and neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation has deteriorated since Russia's August economic
collapse. Federal funding has all but disappeared, and even
facilities where children are treated well are struggling to
provide basic care. Despite promises to improve the situation, the
Russian government has tried to hide the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dima still cannot tell his story with words. He draws the events
of his short, tragic life using stick figures. His nightmare ended
temporarily in October, when he and his sister, both undernourished
and suffering from dysentery, were taken in by a shelter for
abandoned and abused children in Tomilino, a suburb 10 miles east
of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here,'' Dima said at the shelter last month, taking
a break from a rollicking play session around the first New Year's
tree he has ever had. ``They feed us real food and buy us toys.
Nobody beats me with a rope, or a knife or an ax.''
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch found evidence of punishment similar to
torture and brutal hazing by older children at state institutions,
home to 200,000 Russian orphans and abandoned children. Some 30,000
children are summarily diagnosed as ``invalids,'' ``imbeciles,'' or
worse, ``idiots,'' deemed ineducable. They are condemned to lives
in dark isolation and never taught to walk or read, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hunt, its author, recently told reporters that even
abandoned children deemed ``normal'' by the state may be beaten,
locked in freezing rooms, tied to furniture for days at a time, or
sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction of the Russian authorities to the critique of
their orphanages has been to block access to the institutions;
punish or threaten to fire workers if they speak about abuses; and,
in some instances, pardon those who are responsible for the
wrongdoing,'' the Human Rights Watch report said.
</P>
<P>
   The destructive legacy of such treatment is clear. Of the 15,000
children who leave orphanages each year, one in three ends up
homeless or unemployed, said Hunt. One in five commits a criminal
offense. One in 10 commits suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The report arrives at a time when the number of abandoned
children in Russia has doubled over the past three years to some
600,000, according to government figures. Financial hardship and
alcoholism have contributed to increasing instability of Russian
families. And Russian maternity wards persuade parents to give up
children with even mild or operable birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   That policy has a bitter irony. It costs the Russian government
$300 a month to keep children considered disabled in institutions
that Boris Altshuler, director of the Moscow-based nonprofit group
Children's Rights, calls ``graveyards for hopeless children.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet families, where the children would be treated far better,
receive only a $50 allowance from the state for care for their
disabled children, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Poor families with older children give them up when they decide
they cannot cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell how bad things are by the way families are starting
to ask us to take their children,'' said Irina Abramova, director
of the small Tomilino shelter. She says her colleagues at shelters
in Moscow are experiencing the same phenomenon. ``Families in
Russia are falling apart. If we don't take measures to prevent the
destruction of families, we won't be able to build enough
orphanages,'' she warned.
</P>
<P>
   Abramova's facility has room for 20 children, but 37 live there
now. Children are not supposed to stay in her care longer than six
months. But some have been there for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that Abramova does whatever she can to keep
children from entering orphanages. This involves a lengthy search
for the child's real parents. Sometimes, people claim to be the
parents of a child when they are not. Alisa, 3, a somber redhead
who cannot shake a case of pneumonia, was brought to the shelter by
a woman who stole her from her real mother to make her begging more
lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Reuniting children with their parents sometimes is impossible.
Abramova says 50 percent of her wards have been sexually abused by
adults. In some cases, parents forced their grammar school-aged
children into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not imagine that people could treat children like
that,'' Abramova said.
</P>
<P>
   For Abramova, success is the family agreeing to take the
children back. She says in 40 cases since the shelter opened in
1993, alcoholic, drug-dependent, or abusive parents have
``rehabilitated'' themselves and reclaimed their children.
</P>
<P>
   More often, this does not happen. If Abramova cannot find a
suitable relative or an adopting family, she has to give the
children up. Adoption is difficult, she explains, because many
children suffer from chronic illnesses or behavioral disorders
because of the treatment they received before entering the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in Russia will take them,'' Abramova said. ``Russian
families aren't prepared for children with problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Abramova tries to help children cope with their problems using
specially trained child psychologists. The children go to school.
For some, like Dima Chesnokov, they are in classrooms for the first
time in their lives. All children are encouraged to keep scrapbooks
in which they can put pictures of their parents in better days, or
drawings and stories of happy times at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps restore the children's self-esteem when they know
they have roots,'' Abramova said.
</P>
<P>
   But her shelter is suffering from the crisis. Salaries are
minuscule; Abramova earns $50 a month. Funding is nonexistent. The
shelter used to get 12 rubles per child each day for food from the
state. That was 50 cents before the August crisis, about 17 cents
today. And the state has not paid since September. The shelter
survives on charity. But acts of kindness are the exception rather
than the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I love my country, but our best intentions in Russia
always come down to finances,'' Abramova said. ``We used to live by
the motto `the best for the children.' Now we are left with only a
motto.''

HOT FICTION, COLD MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One week prior to publication of his second novel, ``The
Prodigal Spy,'' Joe Kanon opened the front door of his Manhattan
apartment, picked up a copy of The New York Times and read the
following assessment of how he makes his living:
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is colder than a Siberian winter for espionage
tales, many publishing executives and agents say, blaming the end
of the Cold War and shifts in readers' tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the Berlin Wall crumbled in 1989 and the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991, writers who established themselves by exploring
the duplicitous world of spycraft have had much more difficulty
climbing the heights of The New York Times best-seller list,
occupying those rarefied levels for fewer weeks if at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of the spy novel is a hard story to read if you've
just finished writing one. ``I was a bit chagrined,'' said Kanon,
``to say the least.'' The Times story will likely hound his
upcoming publicity tour. But it's a safe bet that it won't keep
people from buying his new book.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, his previous work, ``Los Alamos,'' was a runaway
success. Published to critical acclaim, it went on to sell 850,000
copies in hardback and paper. Published in 14 countries, ``Los
Alamos'' received the 1997 Edgar Award for Best First Novel,
occupied the New York Times best-seller list for a number of weeks,
and established Kanon as both a serious and commercially successful
writer.
</P>
<P>
   More important, ``The Prodigal Spy'' is a better book _
emotionally richer and more confidently told. It is the story of a
father and son, disconnected by history and reunited by the loyalty
of love. It begins in 1950, at the height of the McCarthy era, with
a State Department officer who, it turns out, really is a spy for
the Soviet Union. He defects and disappears from his son's life.
Almost two decades later, he makes contact with his son and asks
for his help. He wants to come home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested in the consequences,'' says Kanon, an old
friend of this columnist. ``It seemed to me that stories about
defectors always end with their getting on a boat or a plane. But
what happens afterwards? What about the people, the families they
leave behind. So my character, Nick, is a boy whose father defects,
one of those unintended victims for whom history itself becomes a
crime, affecting his whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the book is given over to Nick's investigation of that
crime and its consequences. ``What fascinated me,'' says Kanon,
``is how good people do the right things for supposedly the right
reasons and yet create these appalling, complicated legacies.'' As
the action moves from Washington to London to Prague and finally
back to Washington, those legacies come into ever-sharper relief.
</P>
<P>
   Kanon captures Prague one year after The Prague Spring as few
others have. The sad medley of great beauty, dashed hope, and
intense paranoia is hauntingly rendered. Kanon's portrait of J.
Edgar Hoover in the time of the Nixon presidency seems definitive.
By then, the great crime fighter had become a tyrannical
bureaucrat, clutching his files to hold his job.
</P>
<P>
   As historical events and figures combust with Kanon's imaginary
characters, the pace quickens. Most readers will guess ``whodunit''
early on, but unlike most thrillers, this foreknowledge enriches
the novel's enjoyment. One focuses not on the perpetrator, but on
those perpetrated against. The real story, the story of the father
and son, emerges from the wreckage of ideology, opportunism, and
betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtless true that writers like John LeCarre and
Frederick Forsyth have ``repositioned'' themselves in the wake of
their recent commercial disappointments. LeCarre's next novel will
be published in March and takes place in the upper echelons of high
finance. George Smiley and British Intelligence have given way to
hedge-fund managers and arbitrage. Forsyth is writing a sequel to
``The Phantom of the Opera.'' The Jackal has been retired.
</P>
<P>
   But Kanon's spy novel is likely to be every bit as successful as
``Los Alamos.'' This is due, in part, to Internet technologies.
Services like Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com use software that
constantly analyze readers' preferences. Those who read and enjoyed
``Los Alamos'' will be informed that its author has a new book out
and that the early reviews are glowing. Those who have an interest
in the McCarthy era will likewise be alerted. The market for
Kanon's kind of fiction will be made aware of his new work in a way
that would have been impossible just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is also due, in larger measure, to Kanon's talent. Great
writers combine expansive powers of observation with keen moral
intelligence. Both are on full display in ``The Prodigal Spy.''

WITLESS `AVENGERS'; TOO-BRIGHT LYMON BIOPIC

<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``The Avengers'' _ Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman
are no threat to the original ``Avengers,'' Patrick Macnee and
Diana Rigg. This is a great case of movies thinking that high-tech
production values, instead of sharp dialogue, are what made the TV
show a success. Even Sean Connery, as the mad villain, can't save
this stupid film. Get ``The Avengers'' TV episodes that have been
out for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' _ Frankie Lyman loved singing and
women, not necessarily in that order. Three ex-wives, led by a fine
performance by Halle Berry, excavate their memories of the man and
his music with mixed results. Actually, there's too much bright
lights, big city for a character who had some very dark moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseketball'' _ Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of
the phenomenally successful ``South Park'' on Comedy Central, try
to hit one out of the park with this farce. But it's a big swing
and a strikeout. Unlike other gross-out comedies, this one's
distasteful without being funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montana'' _ Whoever cast this movie must have been crazy. Kyra
Sedgwick, one of our most delicate actresses, plays a gangland
assassin with laughable results. A great supporting cast _ Robbie
Coltrane, Stanley Tucci, and Robin Tunney _ is wasted because the
central premise is so far off.

REHNQUIST SEEN AS STERN JUDGE OF IMPEACHMENT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Strom Thurmond made an unusual appearance
before the Supreme Court last October, arriving one Tuesday to see
a friend admitted to the bar. But it was the comportment of the
chief justice that surprised observers the most.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past chief justices, who would have acknowleged the
96-year-old South Carolina senator and former Judiciary Committee
chairman in their midst, William H. Rehnquist hardly blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to Thurmond the same few words he says to anyone
else,'' said Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, who was in the
courtroom that day. ``He didn't crack a smile.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, as the Senate begins impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton, Rehnquist will assume the role of overseer in
whatever form a trial takes, taking center seat in the well of the
Senate before hundreds of spectators and the world.
</P>
<P>
   Although senators and White House aides have spent the holidays
poring over his books and opinions for clues about how he might
handle the case, associates say it is his manner _ stern,
no-nonsense and businesslike _ that is more likely to make an
impact than any ideology he has outlined during his 27-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, observers have found tantalizing hints among
Rehnquist's academic thoughts about impeachment. His 1992 book,
``Grand Inquests,'' a history of the 19th century impeachments of
Justice Samuel Chase and President Andrew Johnson, vanished from
most bookstores weeks ago. Various reports have resurrected his
opinion in a 1993 case involving the impeachment of Judge Walter L.
Nixon of Mississippi, in which Rehnquist indicated his deference to
decisions of the Senate. And an old C-SPAN interview, in which he
implies impeachment should have a limited purpose, has been
replayed.
</P>
<P>
   His conservative bent has been reexamined, too. Nominated to the
bench in 1971 by President Richard Nixon, then elevated to chief
justice in 1986 by President Reagan after a heatedly partisan
confirmation, Rehnquist ``might be expected to be anti-Clinton,''
Georgetown University law professor Paul F. Rothstein said.
</P>
<P>
   But according to several colleagues and lawyers, Rehnquist would
be too concerned with his constitutional role to advance a
political agenda during a trial.
</P>
<P>
   During a trial, in fact, Rehnquist would not act as a true
judge, but instead as an overseer _ a role the vice president
assumes during all impeachment trials except that of a president.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are his parameters that of a normal trial. Rehnquist will be
constrained by an impeachment provision that lets a majority of 51
senators overrule him at any time _ meaning that serious
constitutional questions, such as whether censure could be
considered, would be in the hands of the Senate regardless of what
Rehnquist thinks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Rehnquist is expected to exert his strongest
influence over logistical matters _ from swearing in witnesses to
keeping order during testimony. And it is here that his
authoritativeness may prevail, according to people familiar with
the Rehnquist court.
</P>
<P>
   No one can predict whether Rehnquist will steer the proceedings
with ease. A trial _ any trial _ is bound to be more unwieldy than
the cases that make it to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Rehnquist has almost no trial experience. He has
sat as a trial judge just once, presiding over a 1984 civil case in
Virginia, in which the decision was reversed on appeal. Faced with
a nasty spat between political parties, that inexperience may put
him ``at a disadvantage,'' Rothstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be better if he had experience,'' Rothstein
said. ``He would be more prepared for what to expect in connection
with the actual nitty gritty of presentation of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 16th chief justice has cultivated a stern atmosphere
during his tenure, which is likely to keep him afloat in the Senate
chamber, other lawyers and former clerks said.
</P>
<P>
   In his private world, Rehnquist is regarded as an affable
74-year-old who relishes sports and practical jokes, wanders the
Capitol in near anonymity, and belts out Christmas carols at the
court's holiday parties every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very down-to-earth, approachable, friendly man,'' said
Charles J. Cooper, a Washington lawyer and former Rehnquist clerk.
``If you bump into him as a tourist and ask him for directions, . .
. you'd never know you were just helped by the chief.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bench is a different realm. Litigants who whisper in
court, even when no proceeding is under way, get a talking-to.
Court is in session whatever the weather _ three years ago,
Rehnquist sent federal marshals to the justices' homes to escort
them to work during a blinding snowstorm, according to Ted Cruz, a
lawyer who clerked for Rehnquist in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who speak after the red ``time up'' light are cut off,
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daniel Webster could be arguing before him when the red light
goes on, and I assure you, silence is the only thing that would
take place after that,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to be efficient and not to waste time,'' Cruz said.
``I think he will preside over the trial much in the same way he
presides over the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist apparently did not stray from that path during his
sole trial experience, involving a freedom-of-speech incident in
Colonial Beach, Va. His appearance in the court was unusual;
Supreme Court justices rarely preside over lower courts. But
Rehnquist had been invited by an acquaintance, Judge D. Dortch
Warriner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he understood his role,'' S. Keith Barker,
the plaintiff's attorney, told The Virginian-Pilot newspaper. ``He
didn't flip-flop on his rulings. That's what you want in a judge.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, however, the more convincing evidence that Rehnquist
will conduct a trial by the book is buried in his own writings,
particularly his 1992 book and his written opinion a year later in
the case of Nixon v. United States.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Grand Inquests,'' which is being reissued this month,
Rehnquist plays amateur historian in recounting the impeachment
trials of Chase and Johnson, offering piles of anecdotes from both
cases but few opinions of his own. As a result, scholars are
hesitant to compare past and present. But in broad terms,
associates say, it is fair to assume Rehnquist does not take
impeachment lightly and does not think it should be based on
politics alone.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's standards for impeachment are, apparently, high. He
writes approvingly that when the Senate acquitted Johnson, it
``added another requirement'' to those necessary for impeachment _
that the crime must be serious enough to warrant removal from
office, not just a ``technical violation of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   In a C-SPAN interview after the book was published, Rehnquist
expressed even greater discomfort with the political nature of the
Johnson impeachment, and said that had the Senate voted to remove
the president from office, ``the congressional authority to impeach
would have acted more like a sword of Damocles designed not to
fall, but to hang and threaten the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that gives us a significant clue that Justice
Rehnquist is not in favor of easy removal from office,'' Rothstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nixon opinion may offer insight into Rehnquist's
willingness to let the Senate exercise its will. In denying the
appeal of Walter Nixon, a judge impeached by the Senate for
presenting false testimony to a grand jury, Rehnquist wrote in the
majority opinion that the Supreme Court had no business interfering
in the case because it was ``non-justiciable'' _ it involved a
political question.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had been tried in front of a Senate committee, instead of
the Senate, with testimony presented over four days. Afterward, the
committee presented both sides of the case to the Senate, which
then voted by more than the two-thirds majority to remove the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon fought the impeachment, arguing that the Senate should not
be allowed to relegate the matter to a committee. But Rehnquist
refused to address the case, saying the power to make decisions on
impeachment lay with the Senate itself _ a decision Cruz said
reflected the justice's broader interpretation of when to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his 27 years on the court, a very consistent theme
throughout his opinions has been that it's not the court's role to
be deciding public policy,'' the former clerk said. ``The courts
should simply apply the law, and leave.''

SOME IDEAS WHOSE TIME NEVER CAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time to look forward, to 1999, but as usual, I'm looking in
the wrong direction. I've been going over a collection of column
ideas that for one reason or another didn't quite make it in 1998.
I hesitate to call it a file because the word ``file'' implies some
kind of order, and this collection is anything but orderly:
</P>
<P>
   --The personal special prosecutor. Everyone should have one of
these, a kind of a cross between Jiminy Cricket and Kenneth Starr.
Actually, many of us already have an internalized personal special
prosecutor. Mine told me to can this idea.
</P>
<P>
   --Staying together for the sake of the cats. I heard about a
married couple who made this decision. For some reason they refused
to let me write a column about them.
</P>
<P>
   --The new breed of superjournalists. Supermodels may be an
endangered species, but superjournalists are everywhere, talking
about themselves, interviewing one another. I'm not a
superjournalist, obviously. For one thing, I don't make more money
for talking about what I write than I do for writing it. Am I
bitter? Maybe. This idea never went anywhere, because I feared it
would be misconstrued by my superjournalist colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   --My secret garden. It's a secret because nobody in their right
mind would ever guess it's a garden. I didn't do this column
because writing about it would have forced me to think about it,
which might have forced me to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   --Everybody's in rehab. It's become a status symbol. People
announce, ``I've been in rehab.'' Then they stare at you, waiting
for you to ask what they've been in rehab for and did they meet
anybody famous there. So often they've been rehabbed for something
really boring, like a broken wrist, instead of some fascinating,
totally depraved addiction. Is there any affliction that isn't
rehabable? Possibly coming up with useless column ideas.
</P>
<P>
   --Pedestrian rage. We don't hear much about it, maybe because,
unlike road rage, pedestrian rage tends to be passive-aggressive.
But it can be dangerous. Pedestrians step right in front of a
moving car to prove they have the right of way, or saunter across
an intersection against the light, glaring defiantly at drivers.
When road rage meets pedestrian rage, things can get ugly, too ugly
for me, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   --The bright side of menopause. I thought and thought about this
one, mostly in the middle of the night, when I couldn't sleep.
That's one good thing about menopause. There are a million ways to
fill the time you used to spend sleeping. That may be the only good
thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   --I feel a pang of sympathy for Camilla Parker Bowles. I waited
too long to do this column. By the time I got around to it,
Camilla's approval ratings had shot up. Maybe she was in image
rehab.
</P>
<P>
   --I launch a campaign to revive popular interest in the work of
Tobias Smollett, the 18th-century social satirist. Smollett's
letter-novel, ``The Expedition of Humphry Clinker'' is ready for
Masterpiece Theater treatment. This may be a column idea whose time
will never come.
</P>
<P>
   --What do you think about when you're exercising? I asked a lot
of people this question and nearly all of them said the same thing:
food. Which is what I think about when I'm exercising. I tried to
do this one, but I kept thinking about food.
</P>
<P>
   --The New Civility. I keep hearing about the renaissance of
civility but I've seen very little of it. I suspect the new
civility is a ragged remnant of the old civility, holding on for
dear life in these uncivil times. Why belabor the obvious any more
than I have to?

THE ENDURANCE 
Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition 
By Caroline Alexander. Knopf. 211 pp. Illustrated. $29.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it is much less well-known, at least in America, one
must place the Antarctic epic of Sir Ernest Shackleton in the same
league with the great Lewis and Clark Expedition. Although
Shackleton, unlike Lewis and Clark, failed to achieve his stated
mission, what he did achieve was more impressive: He kept 27
trapped men alive in the frozen polar region for 20 months and in
the end brought them all home safely.
</P>
<P>
   The Antarctic was the last unexplored region on earth at the
start of the century, and expeditions from several countries vied
with one another to reach the South Pole. History best remembers
the 1912 race between Britain's Robert Falcon Scott and Norway's
Roald Amundsen, in which Scott reached the pole only to find that
Amundsen had been there first, then froze to death on the return
journey. Ernest Shackleton, a genial Anglo-Irish merchant officer,
had accompanied Scott's earlier failed 1901 mission and had turned
back short of the pole on a 1908 mission of his own.
</P>
<P>
   With the pole reached by Amundsen, Shackleton decided on a new
goal: to cross the Antarctic on foot. Having carefully picked the
members of his crew, including surgeons, scientists, a dog-handler,
a master carpenter, and the great Australian photographer James
Frank Hurley, Shackleton set out on the wooden 300-ton barkentine
Endurance from Buenos Aires in October 1914 (the ship had been
given special permission to leave England in August, despite the
outbreak of war). After a stop at the Norwegian whaling station on
South Georgia Island, the plan was to land near Vahset Bay, at the
edge of the Weddell Sea, cross the continent with dog-drawn sleds,
and end at a supply station set up at Cape Royds, on the Ross Sea.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, they never even landed in Antarctica. The pack
ice was heavier that summer than any experienced polar hands could
remember. As the Endurance plodded through the ice of the Weddell
Sea, it became trapped hopelessly on Jan. 18, 1915.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the epic began. Shackleton knew the original plan
was finished; the real challenge now was to escape before winter.
The men lived on the ship, hoping for a break in the ice that would
permit movement north. But the pressure of the ice became worse,
until on Oct. 27 it crushed the ship like kindling. As that was
happening, the men evacuated and made camp nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Weirdly, the trapped ship, and then the camp, was drifting
northwest in the moving pack ice, hundreds of miles from the point
at which southward progress had ended. The party salvaged all they
could from the ship, including its three large boats, and made
ready to launch them to try to cross to South Georgia Island as
soon as the northward-moving ice fell apart around them. They
launched the boats in freezing and towering seas April 9, 1916, but
after seven days only got as far as Elephant Island, a godforsaken
rocky outcropping just north of Antarctica's Palmer Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   After a short time there, with no hope of rescue, Shackleton
decided to make a run for help with one boat. Dividing the party
and leaving 21 men on the island under the leadership of his second
in command, Frank Wild, Shackleton and five others set out to cross
800 miles of raging ocean in a 22 1/2-foot boat, the James Caird,
with a makeshift canvas-covered deck and a two-masted sailing rig.
They left Elephant Island April 24 and reached South Georgia May
10, 1916. But they were not safe yet _ they were on the west coast
of the island, 22 miles from the Norwegian Stromness station. So
they trekked across the unmapped island, west to east, between
10,000-foot mountains and jagged ridges, constantly wet and partly
frostbitten, seeking out passes, to reach the Norwegian whaling
station on May 20.
</P>
<P>
   But the amazing story does not end here. England was mired in
war, and Shackleton found little interest on the home front for an
effective early rescue mission to Elephant Island, and when an
offer came, it was proposed that a Royal Navy officer would be in
charge. Rejecting that plan, Shackleton found a small Chilean
tugboat and, with his five crewmates and a cobbled-together crew,
steamed back to Elephant Island and, on Aug. 30, 1916, two years
after the epic began, rescued the men who had stayed there,
maintaining themselves with penguin meat and the springs of water
on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The miracle of this expedition was that Shackleton did not lose
a single man. His crossing to South Georgia was one of the greatest
feats of small-boat navigation ever recorded, and, combined with
the the march across South Georgia, it makes a modern-day ascent of
Mount Everest seem like a day on the links.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton never accomplished much after that; like so many of
his type, he did not do well in ordinary life. In 1921, he started
another Antarctic expedition, with some of his old comrades, but
its mission was vague. In any event, he died of a heart attack (his
body was worn out from all of his adventures) at South Georgia
Island in January 1922, and was buried on the island. He was 47.
His friends went on far enough to see the bleak abandoned camp on
Elephant Island once more.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Alexander's book makes use of the fantastic photographs
of Hurley, who was dauntless in capturing the men and the scenes of
the adventure. Many of these pictures have never been published,
and will be part of a Shackleton exhibition opening in March in the
American Museum of Natural History in New York. Her writing is
clear and swift, and she concentrates of the human drama while not
slighting the technical and mechanical details.
</P>
<P>
   The two keys to the survival of the party were luck (time after
time in reading this book, one thinks, ``That's it, they're dead,''
but then the wind abates and a couple of penguins waddle into camp
and offer themselves for dinner) and one secret weapon: Ernest
Shackleton. He was a brilliant leader who managed to hold his men
together throughout their long ordeal. Unlike the frosty,
mercurial, and class-conscious Scott, Shackleton had a gentle and
easy manner. He apportioned all duties, rations, and clothing
fairly, shared every hardship with his men, and generously took
care of them when they were sick or disabled. He was also a shrewd
psychologist, making efforts to stroke the egos of men he needed
while not hesitating to use his authority in the rare instances of
crises in discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander superbly characterizes the other men as well: the
crusty ship's carpenter, Henry McNiff, whose brilliant joinery
prepared the boats for the voyage north; Frank Worsley, the captain
of the Endurance whose accurate navigation on the James Caird amid
stormy skies and tossing seas was an astonishing achievement; and
Hurley, a brave artist who never lost his sense of the beauty
around him even at times of dire danger.
</P>
<P>
   The Shackleton story is almost unbelievable. The crossing from
Elephant to South Georgia, amid howling gales and blizzards (a
500-ton steamer in the area sank at the same time), was by itself
historic, but the whole epic of survival is incomparable in modern
times. One reads this account and looks at these pictures, and
thinks, ``No GPS receivers, no radios, no freeze-dried high-energy
foods, no Coast Guard helicopters _ no Gore-Tex!'' Just good
equipment, good luck to go with bad, and a truly ingenious leader
who never gave up or lost his cool or judgment.
</P>
<P>
   One cannot but be struck by the contrast between what was
happening in the Antarctic and events in Europe. Looked at in a
``sensible'' way, Shackleton's expedition was crazy and unnecessary
_ there was no need to cross the Antarctic. And yet what a noble
example it turned out to be. Shackleton was obsessed with keeping
28 men alive. Back in Europe, meanwhile, the leaders of
civilization were busily engaged in the opposite endeavor. When he
asked the Norwegian station manager at South Georgia when the war
had ended, Shackleton was told, ``The war is not over. Millions are
being killed. Europe is mad. The world is mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the whole world. Out on the unforgiving, glittering ice,
there was still sanity, romance, hope, companionship, and precious
life.

COMPASSION FATIGUE 
How the Media Sell Disease, Famine, War and Death 
By Susan D. Moeller. Routledge. 390 pp. Illustrated. $27.50. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Oct. 23, 1984, NBC News aired what instantly became famous
footage of Ethiopian famine victims in a segment called ``The Faces
of Death in Africa.'' With Americans finally supplied with faces to
humanize the horror of distant starvation, more than 10,000 phone
calls poured into the relief organization Save the Children in the
36 hours just after the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that only the dogged persistence of an overseas NBC
staffer convinced a reluctant network ``bored with the thought of
another African story,'' to air the piece, thus narrowly averting
another textbook case of ``compassion fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, evidence of the media's diminished attention to the
global village is rampant. According to analyst Andrew Tyndall, the
airtime devoted to stories filed by foreign correspondents at the
big three networks decreased from 4,032 minutes in 1989 to 1,991
minutes by 1995. Reporting resources are so thin that former New
York Times editor Max Frankel once surmised that ``America's
picture of the planet is painted'' by no more than a few hundred
correspondents. And a 1995 Pew Research Center study of
international news found that fully one-third of those stories are
``essentially about the United States in the world, rather than
about the world.''
</P>
<P>
   All this is exacerbated by the fact that since the end of the
Cold War _ with its white hat/black hat geopolitical chessboard _
the media have struggled to develop a new global story line.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Compassion Fatigue: How the Media Sell Disease, Famine, War
and Death,'' author Susan D. Moeller indicts the American media for
the public's numbness to tragedy, bloodshed, and pestilence around
the world. The director of Brandeis University's journalism program
argues that compassion fatigue is ``an unavoidable consequence of
the way news is now covered'' _ simplistically, sporadically, and
with conspicuous cultural bias.
</P>
<P>
   (Time for a quick quiz. When was the last time you saw an update
on the havoc wreaked by Hurricane Mitch? Have you already lost
interest in any ``collateral'' damage done by the recent US and
British bombing of Iraq?)
</P>
<P>
   In staying true to her theme of not pandering to ``the public's
short attention span,'' Moeller has written a scholarly book that
is equal parts history lesson and media criticism.b Divided into
coverage of pestilence, famine, assassination, and genocide, it's
not exactly coffee table reading unless you work for the World
Health Organization or the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The author draws important lessons from which stories make the
media cut. The 1995 Ebola epidemic _ which took relatively few
lives _ was a big story, thanks to the horrific course of the
disease and a pop culture confluence. The 1995 Dustin Hoffman movie
``Outbreak'' _ about a lethal plague _ was even used in a
``Nightline'' report as a metaphor for the Ebola outbreak in what
was then called Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the media-unfriendly, unspectacular plague that
flies under journalism's radar screen is the diarrheal disease that
kills more than 3 million children under the age of 5 each year.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Somalia contained many of the crucial dramatic
elements of newsworthiness: A starving populace, heroic relief
workers, and villainous armed thugs. When the cavalry was
dispatched and US troops arrived in December 1992, CBS's Dan
Rather, NBC's Tom Brokaw, and ABC's Ted Koppel went with them to
authenticate an important international story.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Iraq's 1988 campaign of terror against the Kurds, which
included poison gas and may have killed close to 200,000 people _
never got critical mass coverage. One problem was primarily
logistical _ limited ``access and sources.'' But another had to do
with the plot line. The Kurds were caught up in a war between two
nations, Iran and Iraq, that engendered little sympathy in this
country. ``The media like heroes and villains,'' writes Moeller.
</P>
<P>
   When Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq died in a
mysterious 1988 plane crash, even PBS's thoughtful ``MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour'' devoted less than 300 words to the story that night. The
Zia assassination didn't become a big story because he was, among
other things, ``a problematic'' figure for the media, one with too
spotty a record to be deemed a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, and the assassination, in 1981, of Egyptian leader Anwar
Sadat fit the media's morality play format more comfortably. The
two men, Moeller noted, quickly ``joined the immortal pantheon; the
meaning of their deaths was framed for Americans by journalists
associating them with the iconic martyred leaders of the past,''
such as President Kennedy, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and Mahatma
Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   In a discussion of the Sadat-Rabin killings, Moeller argues that
the slain leaders were sanitized and lionized by a ``partisan''
American media that conveniently overlooked Rabin's initial
repression of the Palestinian Intifada and Sadat's heavy-handed
treatment of internal opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Even those, like me, who believe Moeller gives short shrift to
the two Mideast peacemakers may be hard pressed to dispute her
point that too much coverage is filtered through the prism of
national self-interest. ``The Americanization of events makes the
public feel the world subscribes, and must subscribe, to American
cultural icons _ and if it doesn't or can't it is not worth the
bother, because clearly the natives are unworthy or the issue or
event is,'' she claims.
</P>
<P>
   Moeller's examination of our egocentric view of world events is
provocative. But her implication that the first law of nature
should not drive interest in foreign crises _ that news should not
first respond to threats that may potentially affect us _ is asking
an awful lot of human nature. And it is when ``Compassion Fatigue''
sometimes creeps from shrewd analysis to broad media hectoring that
it is least persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Her insistence that coverage of the African famine became
distorted by celebrity when ``reporters became caught up in the
thrill of watching Mick Jagger and Tina Turner cavort on stage''
during the Live Aid benefit seems gratuitiously niggling. Charging
that ``news shouldn't be marketed as a product . . . Yet news
packaged by the mega-conglomerates tends toward the familiar,'' is
more sloganeering than insightful.
</P>
<P>
   Her ultimate conclusion that ``the solution is for the media
business to get back to the business of reporting all the news, all
the time,'' illustrates media criticism's classic dilemma. It's
easier to diagnose the problem than to cure it.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Compassion Fatigue'' excels is in its careful dissection
of the institutional, philosophical, and logistical obstacles that
prevent the media from effectively monitoring this planet.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, as Moeller writes, that with the broadcast of the
1984 Ethiopian famine footage, ``years of apathy about starving
Africans were swept away.'' What is also true is that journalism's
crisis mode of storytelling often proves too little too late. By
the time NBC showed the film that elicited such a charitable
outpouring, one relief official noted, ``Most of the people who
were at risk of dying had already died.''

NEW CALIFORNIA TAX MAY HELP SMOKERS TO QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DIANA WALSH  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCSICO _ Smokers who hope to kick the habit as part of
their New Year's resolutions have added incentive this year:
California's new 50-cents-a-pack cigarette tax.
</P>
<P>
   The tax, along with a 45-cent price hike tobacco companies are
levying to cover the cost of settling the national tobacco lawsuit,
raises the price of a pack of cigarettes in California to more than
$4 at some grocery stores, the third-highest price in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started smoking, they were just a quarter a
pack,'' said 44-year-old Steve Bower, who was buying cigarettes at
the Cigarettes Cheaper store in Daly City. He began smoking when he
was 11. ``I was going to try quitting and now that extra 50 cents
gives me more incentive,'' he said. ``I'll be saving a lot of
money. Two packs a day is $8, times 30 is $240 a month, multiply by
12, that's a trip to Hawaii every year.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the dozens of smokers streaming into the store on the
final days of 1998 are any indication, addiction could prove more
powerful than price. This week, one committed customer bought
$7,000 _ or 12 cases _ worth of cigarettes. Others said they were
quitting, even as they bought packs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' said Karen, holding up a pack of Marlboro
menthols. ``I've already bought the patch and am going to put it on
New Year's Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Proposition 10, which boosted the state's cigarette tax
from 37 cents to 87 cents per pack, was intended to fund child care
programs, advocates are hoping it also will reduce the percentage
of Californians who smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Already only 17 percent of Californians smoke _ the
second-lowest rate after Utah _ compared with 23 percent
nationally, according to the national Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. And certainly a pack-a-day habit is pricier in the
long run than a $29.99 pack of Nicoderm patches.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's unclear whether high cost will deter longtime
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Franklin, a health educator for Kaiser Permanente in San
Rafael, said registration for Kaiser's six-week stop-smoking
program is normal for this time of year: ``We're just seeing the
typical New Year's resolution stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   She suspects the tax hike will have its greatest deterrent on
teenagers or other young smokers who don't have a lot of money.
That alone could be a significant accomplishment. Research shows
that people who don't smoke as teens are less likely to smoke in
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanton Glantz, a University of California at San Francisco
professor and one of the nation's leading anti-tobacco crusaders,
said the price hike is certain to prod thousands of Californians to
quit smoking over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very good evidence from all over the world that when
you increase the price of cigarettes 10 percent you get a 4 percent
drop in consumption,'' said Glantz. ``It will take a while to
happen, but you will probably see a 15 percent drop in cigarette
consumption in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Glantz noted that the number of smokers in California declined
after 1988, when voters passed Prop. 99, which boosted the 10-cent
tax on cigarettes to 35 cents, to fund the state's aggressive
anti-tobacco campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people still do it and some people will continue to do
it, but the message in California is very, very clear that smoking
isn't acceptable anymore,'' said Glantz.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco analyst Gary Black also predicts a significant drop in
consumption _ between 10 and 12 percent. But he said the volume of
tobacco sold in the state could drop even more as consumers look to
mail-order houses, the Internet, neighboring states and the black
market to buy cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers innovate. They'll go searching for cheaper
cigarettes,'' said Black, who works with Sanford C. Bernstein and
Co., a New York investment management firm. ``People who live in
(California) border towns will cross over to Nevada.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette discounters in the state have been cashing in on the
tax hike for months.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers began stocking up at Cigarettes Cheaper stores in
November shortly after manufacturers raised prices to pay for the
states' tobacco lawsuit and voters passed Prop. 10 by a narrow,
13,000-vote margin.
</P>
<P>
   The number of smokers patronizing Cigarettes Cheaper stores,
which sell Marlboros for $1.99, or $1.50 less than Safeway, has
jumped 30 percent since late November, according to Ned Roscoe,
vice president of the chain. To meet demand, the company tripled
the inventory in its 220 California stores during the week
preceding New Year's. The company plans to open 50 more stores in
the state this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Parillo, manager of the Cigarettes Cheaper store located in
the Westlake Shopping Center in Daly City, estimates he sold an
average of 1,200 cartons a day in the final days of December, up
from a norm of 300 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Despite daily deliveries for the final week of the year, the
store, which normally is restocked just twice a week, ran out of
Marlboro hard packs _ the most popular brand _ several days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Delfino, who described herself as a social smoker, normally
buys just a pack, but took home a carton of Truex to save $5 in the
New Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to quit but a bargain is a bargain,'' said Delfino.
``Aren't we awful? It's like a run on the store.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few committed smokers are taking the high cost seriously.
Eighty-five-year-old Lina Banideras, who smoked for 35 years, quit
the day after Christmas in anticipation of the new tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cost too much,'' said Banideras, who smoked about a
half-pack a day. ``I was thinking that it would be better for my
health and this just gave me the (extra incentive) I needed.''

MAGAZINE MARKETING GIMMICKS A TRIAL FOR MANY CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you sense your annual magazine subscriptions aren't lasting
their full 12 months, you may have good reason.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of one week, we received complaints from two
readers who felt short-changed by industry practices to attract new
subscribers. One has to do with back-dating the starting point of
an annual subscription and the other with the use of the word
``free'' to describe a trial issue of a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   These marketing gimmicks are not new this year, but industry
specialists say they are being practiced more widely as the highly
competitive publishing world vies for new customers.
</P>
<P>
   While questionable magazine marketing tactics often focus on
sweepstakes contests and high-pressure telemarketing pitches, these
recent cases illustrate the need to check the accuracy of your
magazine expiration dates. These dates are posted usually, though
not always, on the magazine's mailing labels.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the case of a reader, who signed up for a
year's worth of Elle, a women's fashion magazine, and expected to
get her first issue sometime in November. What came in November was
not one, but three issues. Within 10 days, she got the issues for
October and November and the newly released December issue.
</P>
<P>
   On the mailing label, her assigned expiration date was September
1999.
</P>
<P>
   When we called the magazine about this problem, Dave Leckey,
vice president of circulation at Hachette Filipacchi Magazine,
publisher of Elle, Women's Day, George, Home and other magazines,
referred to it as ``back-starting.'' He said it is done sometimes
when the company has excess copies of a particular issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back-starting is a way for a magazine to be able to manage its
costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, if a customer isn't happy about receiving the
outdated issues, the company will always accede to such complaints.
In the case of the woman subscriber, he said Elle would be happy to
change the expiration date to November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Industry specialists say a publisher sending old issues is a way
for them to post an earlier renewal date so as to anticipate new
revenue or justify inflated circulation figures from previous
months.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Grossman of Chappaqua, N.Y., the author of Grossman and
Circulation, follows the promotional practices of about 500
magazines. He said sending customers outdated issues is clearly a
problem. ``It's not very good customer relations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another questionable marketing practice, another reader
points out that publishers often depict as ``free'' a trial offer
of a magazine sent to your home. But he found it's only free if you
choose not to subscribe. If you decide to sign up, the first issue
is counted in the year's allotment.
</P>
<P>
   In this common marketing strategy known as a ``soft offer,'' the
publisher sends consumers a postcard in which they are invited to
receive a ``free issue'' to check out the product. By marking yes
and sending the card back, the consumer will get an issue, and soon
thereafter, a bill for a year's subscription.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't want the magazine, they can send the invoice back
marking ``cancel'' and they are not obligated to pay for the first
issue. But if they want to continue receiving the magazine, they
will pay for the so-called ``free'' issue as part of their
year-long subscription.
</P>
<P>
   To secure a genuinely free issue, the reader has this solution:
``I mark cancel on the bill, then subcribe with one of the cards
that are invariably included in the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Cargill, vice president of the New England Direct
Marketing Association, described soft-offer tactics as ``fair, but
borderline.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may be confusing to say the trial issue is a ``free
issue,'' Cargill said, most ethical magazine publishers make the
terms clear somewhere on the post card. A monthly magazine at $1 an
issue, for example, would state that if the customer likes the
first issue, he or she agrees to pay $12 for 11 more issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Audit Bureau of Circulation, which tracks the publishing
industry, also shed some light on one reason publishers are eager
to count as paid that first free-trial issue. Teresa Baird,
director of periodical field auditing, said a truly free issue
cannot be counted toward that month's circulation.
</P>
<P>
   And paid circulation figures are key numbers that advertisers
want to see when deciding whether to buy space.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say buyers should protect themselves by
reading the language of any magazine promotion and avoiding
third-party dealings when purchasing subscriptions. He also said
buyers should stay alert to the posted expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't pay attention to the expiration dates on
the mailing labels, and they should,'' said Howard Shapiro, a
spokesman for the Federal Trade Commission in Washington.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   First USA checks
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Credit card company First USA recently sent Deirdre Cummings,
consumer program director for the Massachusetts Public Interest
Research Group, a sales pitch that sounded great until she closely
studied the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   First USA offered her checks that she could use to pay off
balances on other credit cards or for anything else she wanted. On
the borrowed money, she would pay a low 3.9 percent annual
percentage rate of interest until March 1. After that, she would
pay her regular credit card rate.
</P>
<P>
   Making the offer more appealing, the bank included a chart
showing her savings if she used the checks to pay off balances on
other credit cards. The savings ranged from $34 on a $1,000
Discover card balance to $164 on a $5,000 MBNA card balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say goodbye to high interest rates right now. Grab a pen,
write a check and cash in on the savings,'' First USA president
Randy Christofferson said in his letter to Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   But a very different picture emerged in the fine print. First,
the savings claims were based on a three-month borrowing period.
Yet Cummings had received her First USA letter on Dec. 21, which
means only a little more than two months were left before the March
1 ending date.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the savings projections did not include a transaction
finance charge of the greater of $5 or 3 percent of the transaction
amount. Adding in that fine-print fee eliminates the savings and in
most cases causes the First USA ``deal'' to actually cost more.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a Discover card with a 17.49 percent APR. First USA
cited savings of $34 on a $1,000 balance carried for three months.
But adding in the transaction charge of 3 percent brings the
savings down to $4. And if the borrowing period is lowered to two
months, the First USA ``deal'' ends up costing $7 more. With a
one-month borrowing period, the extra cost is $19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like a very good deal to me,'' she said.

 CAPETOWN, South Africa: ... the past.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some forms of oppression have outlived apartheid. Mark Coetzee,
an artist and owner of the tiny Mark Coetzee Fine Art Cabinet in
Cape Town, says his last three shows have been officially banned _
and they all took place after the new government was installed.
South Africa's equivalent of Mapplethorpe, Coetzee uses openly,
even flamboyantly, gay imagery; some attacks on him have come from
fundamentalist Christians. ``Artists who work outside the
acceptable here are literally starved to death,'' he says. The show
I saw in his gallery was ``Frontier Erotics,'' Clive van den Berg's
miniatures of men loving men, wistful little paintings that deal
with one segment of a society still deeply divided.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the posh Linda Goodman Gallery in Rosebank, an upscale
Johannesburg suburb that is as close as South Africa comes to
Beverly Hills, that I saw Segogela's work, and that of the
Makhubele family, who have illustrated the history of South Africa
in large cloth hangings studded with beads and safety pins. The
pins have an unexpected, twinkling magic. Goodman is the leading
contemporary dealer in South Africa, in business for 32 years, with
a large European and American clientele. She's shown black artists
all along. During apartheid, blacks weren't allowed to drink
liquor. They were allowed to serve it, though, so if police turned
up at Goodman Gallery openings, black artists being feted instantly
turned into waiters.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman's gallery has its own private parking lot. The crime,
chaos, and corruption of life in South Africa boil down, on a
day-to-day level, to problems like parking. Few whites will venture
to the Market Theatre and Gallery complex in central Johannesburg,
despite the existence of an adjacent parking lot that is floodlit
and free _ except for the 20 cents or so you're expected to tip the
guy loitering next to your car, so he'll guard it instead of
stealing it.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has no museum dedicated to contemporary or modern
art; it publishes no art magazines; it has few committed collectors
of 20th-century work. Since it's largely overlooked, art is a
bargain, relatively speaking. The $83,000 a painting by Irma Stern
recently fetched at auction was not only the record price for
Stern, an expressionist painter who died in 1966 and is little
known outside South Africa. It is also the auction record for a
work by any South African.
</P>
<P>
   But since the fall of apartheid and the elections that swept
Mandela into office, South African art has generated huge interest
_ and a slew of shows _ in Europe and America. Probably the
best-known South African artist on the international scene is
William Kentridge, who was one of the stars of last summer's
``Documenta.'' Kentridge's drawings and films are allegories of
apartheid, of victims and victimizers. He's the subject of a
Boston-area show opening Jan. 15 at MIT's List Center for the
Visual Arts. ``William Kentridge: Weighing . . . and Wanting'' is
centered on Kentridge's fictional protagonist Soho Eckstein, a
white industrialist creep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our art wasn't up to much,'' says Marilyn Martin, ``the
excitement that started with the end of apartheid would have
dissipated by now.'' Martin, who has directed the gallery for nine
years, is a figure of courage and controversy in the small world of
South African art. When she arrived, the gallery's 1930s
neoclassical building was filled with European art. ``We have vast
collections of hunting and sporting pictures,'' she says drily. And
cows. In one room, there's a lineup of mediocre European cow
paintings, an installation that's hard not to read as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has acquired contemporary South African art aggressively
_ even though dealers say she's sometimes unable to pay for it.
She's worked at changing stereotypes. ``Black artists were supposed
to do linocuts,'' she says. ``But we're trying not to have a niche
for `black art.' '' Not a figurative niche, anyway. She's put black
art in literal ones: The niches on the National Gallery's facade,
where you might expect to see marble busts, are instead filled with
vivid Ndebele designs.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're inside the gallery, what you see in the grand hall
that is the most prominent place in the museum is contemporary
South African art, by artists of all races. Among the most
impressive works is the 1979 ``Triptych: Interrogators,'' by Paul
Stopforth, who moved to Boston a decade ago, after Kim Berman, who
had been his student at the University of Witwatersrand in
Johannesburg, helped to arrange an artist-in-residency post for him
at Tufts University. He never went back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's work is some of the finest political art produced
anywhere,'' Martin says. ``It's a pity he left.'' Stopforth
disagrees. He left ``because I thought things would never change,''
he says. ``Living there was a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The interrogators in ``Triptych'' are the jailers of Stephen
Biko, whose death in detention made him one of apartheid's most
famous martyrs. Stopforth slices the interrogators' faces, so you
see only eyes to mouth, the extreme close-up making their snarling
expressions all the more frightening. Floating beside the faces is
an empty chair, a stand-in for Biko. The chill palette of gray and
black suggests both newspapers and fingerprinting. Stopforth
anticipated by 20 years what artists are doing now in response to
the Truth commission _ and he did it at a time when his art earned
him death threats.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone I speak to about Stopforth tells me he was a towering
figure in the anti-apartheid movement; everyone wishes he hadn't
left, or that he'd return. He wishes neither.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists like Kim have sacrificed their own work for a greater
good,'' he says. ``If I'd stayed I might have found myself engaged
more with education than with my art.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, that art has become more personal and less political.
Included in his most recent show was a jaunty little figure called
``Emigre,'' who kicks up one leg, ready to go. For those who know
Stopforth's history, it's impossible not to see this figure as the
artist himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want a blindfolded lady and Roman columns,'' Albie
Sachs says, ``or the idea that the law is handed down from on
high.'' So when it came time to choose a logo for the new
Constitutional Court, the justices settled on a tree, because
``traditionally, that's where African justice took place _ under a
tree,'' Sachs says. This one comforts rather than threatens, its
large canopy spreading hospitably.
</P>
<P>
   The room where the justices deliberate is filled with
contemporary portraits. ``We are being watched by the faces of our
country,'' Sachs says, ``faces of all kinds.'' (Not by all kinds of
artists, though: They're all by women, a coincidence that pleases
Sachs, an outspoken feminist.)
</P>
<P>
   We walk over to the site where the new courthouse will be built,
a site occupied by the Old Fort, which has the distinction of being
the world's only jail where both Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi
were imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitutional Courthouse, symbol of the country's new
liberty and law, will be built on the site of the symbol of its
past oppression. Parts of the prison complex will remain, with
glass between new building and old, connecting past humiliation
with present hope.
</P>
<P>
   We walk near the ramparts, where twin staircases _ one for
whites, the other for blacks _ offer a cold reminder of the past.
``Even entering jail, people had to be separated by race,'' Sachs
says. He envisions kids climbing on the ramparts, the prison turned
playground. ``I think like a 7 year old,'' says the judge who is an
extremely youthful 63. ``On a mature day. Otherwise, it's 6.''
</P>

   For now, the army still occupies this grim compound. Sachs wants
to take me inside. The gate is padlocked. The fortress once nearly
impossible to escape is now impossible to enter. Sachs asks a
caretaker inside to let us in. He says he can't, not even for a
judge; it's against his orders. ``Some day,'' Sachs says firmly,
``the constitution in this country will be stronger than the
military. But we're not there yet.''

 UNDATED: ... federal aid.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putting a premium on faithfulness might mean sacrificing
academic quality in hiring, and even if it doesn't, lawyers say
discrimination laws would look unkindly at an institution that
creates the impression that it turns down better-qualified
applicants because they are not faithful Catholics. And the bishops
left open the definition of faithful, which colleges say leaves
them open to lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it mean that someone who's divorced is not faithful? That
someone practicing birth control is not faithful? And how will we
know?'' asked Reese. ``And then you get into questions of whether
to hire someone who the bishop doesn't approve. If you do hire
them, you're in trouble with the bishops, if you don't hire them,
you're in trouble with the (faculty unions). With the propensity of
faculty to sue, I would be very concerned if I was a bishop or a
school, because clearly this is going to result in a lot of
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Academics worry that requiring theology professors to get a
mandate from the bishops would create the sense that there was a
holier echelon on campus, relegating non-theology professors and
non-Catholics to second-class citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very subtle, but when you work side by side with someone,
these things matter,'' said the Rev. Ladislas Orsy, a law professor
at Georgetown University and a specialist in church law. ``Rightly
or wrongly, there is extreme sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The church would open itself up to liability for students
injured on school grounds, and to accusations of censorship. And
Orsy adds that schools would lose accreditation, because agencies
that grant it insist on institutional autonomy, and question
non-academic intrusions on key decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Burling, BC university counsel from 1969 to 1994 and now
an education lawyer at Foley, Hoag &AMP; Eliot, said even past bond
issues and land transfers could become null, because the lay boards
of trustees did not have the authority to make transactions with
what would be ruled church property.
</P>
<P>
   With so many thorns, college presidents say they are not sure
trustees could be persuaded to serve, and without them the schools
would lose the perspective that has helped bring efficiency and
professionalism to many.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``ex corde'' would return the schools to the
margins, many Catholic academics fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great achievements of Catholic higher education is
becoming a key player in the mainstream of American higher
education,'' said Charles L. Currie, head of the American
Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. ``They've only
been able to do that by becoming part of the culture of
institutional autonomy, academic freedom, and freedom of
expression. If the church wants to be an institution within that
culture, it has to respect its traditions. You don't go to Russia
to speak Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean,'' he added, ``that every part of the
culture is fine. But you're more effective if you're within the
system than if you're standing outside. One of the great abilities
of the church is its ability to speak to the culture, but if it's
going to be standoffish, it's going to be less effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Their opposition to ``ex corde,'' college officials say, hardly
means they aren't dedicated to the Catholic ideal. In fact, many
Catholic administrators express almost a sense of insult at the
proposal, that the bishops could fail to see how schools have been
working to strengthen their religious identity. Several schools
have commissions on ensuring the Catholic tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that so many schools began as religious institutions
and became secularized should give us pause, because there's
nothing to say that won't happen to Catholic institutions as
well,'' said the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, president of Fordham
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think imposing this is the way to go,'' he said.
``It will alienate the faculty and prevent us from hiring the kind
of faculty we want, who will support academic excellence and the
Catholic nature. Imposing any kind of loyalty oath will only deter
people from working here. There are plenty of faithful Catholics
who will say that's no part of an academic institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Heft, chancellor of the University of Dayton and
head of a project on hiring for the Association of Catholic
Colleges and Universities, said most schools don't know what
proportion of the faculty is Catholic, fearing they might violate
laws against discrimination to even ask.
</P>
<P>
   He and others say it's a mistake to assume that only Catholic
professors can support the mission of a Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen plenty of Catholic professors who don't invest as
much as a Jew or a Protestant,'' said Leahy. ``Faithful Catholics
might be a nice idea, but what you want is someone who identifies
with what you're trying to do with the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidents will meet in various formations next month to
plan how to lobby the Vatican and bishops against the proposal.
Some say they hope to appeal to the Vatican's new secretariat of
education, Joseph Pittau, who is familiar with US higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Some close to the bishops say there is sympathy among them to
the schools' concerns. Given that, they say, the bishops may vote
to reject the proposal, which would at least allow them to report
to the Vatican that they had tried and suggest that it look again
at what they approved so overwhelmingly in 1996. Another option is
to vote to continue studying it, essentially shelving it until
there is a new pope.
</P>
<P>
   But these people add that the schools have to understand the
pressure on the bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's naive to see this as a battle between the bishops and the
presidents,'' said Monika Hellwig, a non-voting member of the
bishops committee on ``ex corde'' and executive director of the
Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities. ``The bishops
did what the Vatican asked them to do. Tenure, trustees,
accreditation. All that is irrelevant to the Vatican.''

WATTS'S POWER TO BE TESTED AS HE STANDS ALONE IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ J.C. Watts Jr. cannot be compared to anyone in the
106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma representative will be the only black Republican in
the House or Senate, and when he is sworn in this week, he will be
the only black in the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Watts stands alone on the ideological spectrum, as an
African-American who carries the civil rights struggle in one hand
and his own brand of born-again, conservative politics in the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want you to be beholden to them, and they don't want
you to be independent,'' said the former star quarterback. ``Many
in the black community believe you have to think and act a certain
way. But I'm 41 years old, and I can think for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   White liberals, black liberals, and even some black
conservatives distrust Watts's political motives, his benefactors,
and his stellar rise _ fueled by the Gingrich Revolution _ that
arguably has made him in four years one of the most powerful
African-Americans in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For all the buzz on Watts, however, serious questions remain.
</P>
<P>
   Will this Baptist minister with a gift for gab use his new bully
pulpit as Republican Conference chairman to remake his party into a
``big tent,'' robbing the Democratic Party of its minority mantle
and its hold on votes that proved so crucial in the last election?
</P>
<P>
   And, if Watts succeeds in bringing more blacks into the
Republican fold, can he solidify his power and go on to a possible
run for higher office? (The second spot on the presidential ticket
is often mentioned.)
</P>
<P>
   Or will his brand of politics prove to be too polarizing? And
will personal baggage haunt his future on a national stage?
</P>
<P>
   Watts grew up in the small town of Eufaula, Okla., poor and on
``the wrong side of the tracks.'' An uncle, Wade, was president of
the NAACP Oklahoma chapter and a legendary figure who, Watts said,
converted a local grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan to Christianity
and who, with Watts's father, pushed the state to integrate.
</P>
<P>
   Watts and his cousin were the first African-Americans in his
elementary school, and it was in those early years he remembered
learning the art of politics _ and the politics of turning the
other cheek.
</P>
<P>
   At a football game in Locust Grove, Watts remembered his family
sitting with a recruiter who had come to watch him as quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The local district attorney walked up to the family and, seeing
the recruiter, proudly pointed to Watts and said, ``That's our
nigger.'' No one said or did anything because the lawyer, despite
his racist language, was sympathetic _ and useful _ to the civil
rights cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.C. always had a gift,'' said Barry Switzer, his football
coach at the University of Oklahoma. ``He was very articulate and
had an air of confidence even as a youngster. He commanded respect
and was an outstanding role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Switzer remembered how Watts, twice named most valuable player
in the Orange Bowl, spoke in church before a game one Sunday. The
Florida State coach, who was present, told his team, ``If that guy
quarterbacks as well as he preaches, we're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   An ordained minister and father of five, Watts knows how to
reach his audience. He has an earthy manner when he speaks, and a
charismatic spark. He knows when to roll out his metaphors and when
to repeat a phrase so it sticks. In short, he sounds home-spun,
making a passionate plug for family values without sounding like
the politician preacher he is.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Secretary of State Tom Cole described Watts in the way
people routinely do: as one of the most talented communicators of
his generation. This, in part, explains why Republicans tapped
Watts last year to give the party's response to President Clinton's
State of the Union speech, and why he was elected conference chair
this year, where his job will be crafting and conveying the GOP
message.
</P>
<P>
   His speeches extol such planks of the Republican agenda as lower
taxes, welfare reform, and school vouchers _ all of which are
anathema to mainstream black interests, said Glenn Loury, director
of Boston University's Institute on Race and Social Division.
</P>
<P>
   Watts presents himself as a role model in and out of church, but
this squeaky-clean image does not wash with all of his
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge, as did Ben Odom, his opponent in the 1998 race,
that Watts is a Bible-thumper who preaches personal responsibility
and family values when his own house is not in order.
</P>
<P>
   Watts piled up a mountain of unpaid debts _ and unpaid taxes _
which resulted in property foreclosures and lawsuits, the result,
he said, of being in the oil business in the late '80s when prices
plunged.
</P>
<P>
   When he was an energy commissioner regulating the oil industry,
Watts was the object of an FBI corruption probe for receiving cash
from the industry he regulated. He was never charged.
</P>
<P>
   He also fathered a baby out of wedlock when he was in high
school. His Uncle Wade raised the child.
</P>
<P>
   Watts admitted to his mistakes, but insisted he always tried to
do right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made dumb choices and I'll make more, but a life can't
always be measured by the dumb choices made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he said, he paid off his creditors rather than
declare bankruptcy, and helped raise the child.
</P>
<P>
   As for the corruption probe, he said, ``There was nothing
illegal, unethical or immoral about taking money from those you
regulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, Watts's constituents reelected him with
more than 60 percent of the vote in a majority Democratic district.
</P>
<P>
   Home, Watts said, is where he was taught to be a conservative
before he understood what the word meant. There he learned hard
work and respect for all. There were no victims in his family, he
said, only God guiding people who worked toward their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
   That is his answer to critics who cannot fathom how a man who
grew up in the cradle of the civil rights movement could become the
poster child for the Republican Party _ and to those who contend
that Watts is the tool of a right-wing leadership looking for an
African-American to blunt criticism that the party is elitist and
hostile to minority interests.
</P>
<P>
   Watts comes from the Bible Belt and agrees, as do many of his
constituents, with the Christian Coalition agenda. His voting
rating from the group is 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Watts does not always toe the party line. He has voted to
reduce crack cocaine sentencing, and has staked out a position on
affirmative action that makes neither conservative Republicans nor
liberal blacks happy.
</P>
<P>
   Watts's iconoclastic approach may earn him some respect on both
sides of the aisle, but that respect is mixed with suspicion and
even hostility when one considers that he is the only
African-American who has refused to join the Congressional Black
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``What J.C. has done is taken the language of the civil rights
movement and massaged it into conservatism which, upon closer
analysis, is tainted,'' said Representative Jesse Jackson Jr.,
Democrat of Illinois. ``And it has long-term implications for
undermining progress on race.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Watts has to do more to reach out to black
Americans than occupy a public post. But he, like others, is trying
to reserve judgment until he sees what, if anything, Watts does for
minority interests once he is in the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's well worth watching because he'll be an important
political player well into the 21st century,'' said Cole, the
Oklahoma secretary of state. ``He's got star quality and wants to
play on a bigger stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his future, Watts demurred, saying, ``I can walk
away from this any time. I don't need congressman in front of my
name.''

CRUCIAL TEST OF WELFARE REFORM BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As Massachusetts reaches a crucial midpoint in its
welfare reform experiment, the figures and facts suggest two
things.
</P>
<P>
   First, phase one of the law has worked better than many
expected. Second, notwithstanding that success, the hardest part
has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as state Senator Therese Murray, chairwoman of the Human
Services Committee, puts it: ``So far I think the law has worked _
but I have a lot of qualms about what lies ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the good news. Despite widespread predictions of
disaster, the welfare law has made significant strides at reducing
the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't worked perfectly or without some pain and
unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   The recent Suffolk Superior Court ruling that the state acted
unreasonably in cutting cash benefits to as many as 6,000 families
who had applied for disability exemptions from the new law
demonstrates that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, so far, the overall figures tell an unmistakable story.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: In February 1995, when Governor William F. Weld
signed the welfare law, Massachusetts had 102,993 families on the
Aid to Families with Dependent Children rolls. By December of this
year, the caseload for what's now called Transitional Aid to
Families with Dependent Children was 58,961, a decline of about 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Claire McIntire, commissioner of the Department of Transitional
Assistance, offers this evidence in support of the new law: Of the
original 41,000 people subject to a benefits cutoff after two years
on the rolls, 36,000 left before the deadline came.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that people are leaving welfare
to go to work in numbers that was not happening prior to welfare
reform,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say policy makers are simply claiming credit for the
work of a booming economy _ and there's little doubt that a rising
tide has lifted many recipients into private sector jobs. A study
by the Pioneer Institute attributes 65 percent of the caseload
decline to the economy, and one-third to welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   But that's still an impressive achievement, says Charles
Chieppo, spokesman for the market-oriented thinktank. ``We have
heard a whole lot of talk about what a disaster the law has been,
but the initial indications are that it is working pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   It's even more impressive when you consider that even during the
Massachusetts Miracle of the mid-1980s, the AFDC rolls were never
below 83,000 families.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the talk of draconian measures, the truly tough
strictures are only now starting to take effect, as the Department
of Transitional Assistance terminates benefits for those who have
been on the welfare rolls for 24 consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
   That means that those who have left the rolls over the last
several years have, for the most part, received only a slight
nudge, and not a shove. The main change has been the imposition of
a 20-hour-a-week work requirement as a condition of receiving
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Workfare, as that policy is called, was once an oppositional
rallying cry of the welfare rights movement. Indeed, when Governor
Michael S. Dukakis proposed a modest workfare program for welfare
(itals)fathers(unitals) during his first term, it helped antagonize
the Democratic left. The experience helped lead Dukakis to label
welfare ``the Middle East of domestic policy.'' In his second term,
he chose a voluntary welfare policy.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1995, after years of seemingly intractable rolls, the
political mood had changed dramatically. Democratic lawmakers and a
Republican administration agreed the time had come to impose both a
work requirement and a time limit of two years on the rolls in any
five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The big question about the work requirement has been whether the
state should allow recipients to let education or training courses
count against it. Advocates say that would help recipients land
better jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the state's work-first approach say the most
effective training is imparted on the job, and thus the most
important step toward a career is helping recipients land their
first job.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides can point to studies that support their view. But
either way, that work requirement only applies to about 17 percent
of the caseload _ able-bodied recipients with school-age children.
</P>
<P>
   So far, three snapshot tracking studies DTA has done of those
who have left the rolls before the deadline show encouraging
developments in most cases: 50.3 percent did so because of higher
earnings, while 10.6 percent did so because of unearned income,
generally child support; 4 percent said an absent parent had
returned, and 1 percent reported higher assets. Eleven percent,
meanwhile, had moved out of state, while another 8.3 percent no
longer had eligible children.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the data support the stereotype of a population of
long-term welfare dependents. Only 12.4 percent of the AFDC
caseload, or 5,103 families, have received a welfare check
continuously for two years.
</P>
<P>
   But it's that group that may prove the toughest challenge for
the state's new law. Of that cohort, 2,800 have appealed for a
continuation of benefits; the DTA has sent termination notices to
another 2,233 so far.
</P>
<P>
   It's those people _ and the approximately 1,000 new recipients
who could hit the deadline each month _ whom advocates worry most
about. Some familiar with the caseload say a certain percentage of
recipients may simply be unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that 20 to 25 percent of the people on welfare are
not going to be able to make it in the job market,'' said Phil
Johnston, who has served as both regional administrator of the
federal Department of Health and Human Services and state secretary
of Human Services. ``They are border-line retarded, they have
serious substance abuse problems, they have mental illness, they
are battered women whose emotional stability has been destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say what happens with the time-limited group will tell
the ultimate story about the success or failure of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what will happen to them,'' said Deborah Harris,
staff attorney for the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute.
``Experience tells us that first they exhaust their own network of
family and friends, then they turn to the shelters, and then
perhaps to the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Murray and Commissioner McIntire both say they think the
state has built in enough exemptions, supports, monitoring, and
second chances into the system that that is unlikely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   But both know that despite its initial success, what happens now
that the cutoffs have started will truly test welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very concerned that their children are well and being
taken care of,'' said Murray. ``And that's why we have to stay on
top of this whole thing.''

HOW IS PLASTIC MADE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How is plastic made?
</P>
<P>
   J.Z., Northbrook, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are all kinds of plastics. But they have one thing in
common. They're all made of very, very long molecules, called
polymers. Polymers are nothing more than long chains of identical
repeating units, called monomers, which are just small molecules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of polymers as a string of pearls,'' says Michael
Rubner, professor of polymer materials science and engineering at
MIT. ``They're incredibly simple, but beautiful.'' Rubner says it's
their amazing length, hundreds of thousands of units long, that
gives plastics their unique properties of flexibility and strength.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to making polymers is getting the individual monomers
to link up. It's kind of like performing magic on a big box full of
paper clips so they end up in one giant paper clip chain, all
connected.
</P>
<P>
   The monomers in plastic are molecules made up mostly of atoms of
carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Atoms bond together in
different ways, depending on how many electrons each has, and what
kind of electrical charge it carries. Those connections are called
chemical bonds. There are several kinds of them.
</P>
<P>
   Chemists understand the natural laws that dictate which bonds
form between which atoms under which conditions. By creating just
the right conditions using temperature, or pressure, or other
chemicals, they can break apart a molecule's natural bonds and
cause new ones to form, making those monomer molecules to link up
like our paper clips.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example of how they do that to make the plastic in
garbage bags, polyethylene. Theys start with a monomer called
ethylene. Think of a bunch of ethylenes in a vat as a crowd of
people standing next to each other. You can try this with a bunch
of friends.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule, the most important rule, is that every hand has
to be holding another hand. No free hands. The second rule, not
quite as important, is that everybody has to pair up with somebody
in the crowd, each person holding both hands of the other person.
That's how ethylenes behave. They naturally pair up _ with a double
covalent bond between their carbon atoms, written as C(EQ)C. (A
covalent bond is where two atoms share their outmost electron.)
Like two people, each holding the other's two hands.
</P>
<P>
   Now along come the chemists, who change the rules for just one
of the pairs in the crowd. Under the new rules, instead of standing
as a pair, one person has to grab a balloon with one hand and hold
just one hand of their partner. (In plastic manufacturing, the
``balloon'' is a chemical called an initiator. That's what starts
changing the rules for the kinds of chemical bonds that form.) Now
the ethylenes look like this. C-C.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget that there can be no free hands. The first
person is all set. He has a balloon in one hand, and has the second
person's hand in his other. But the second person has a free hand.
A no-no. So, he pulls one hand away from a nearby pair. Now person
two is happy, but one of the people in that second pair has a free
hand. She grabs away a hand from a nearby pair, and just like that,
you've got a chain reaction going, all started by that initiator.
Soon, instead of pairs of people in your crowd, you've formed
yourselves into a chain.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the chemical reactions vary. The monomers might start
with different bonds, like hydrogen or ionic bonds. The chemists
might create new ones like single or triple covalent bonds.
Sometimes atoms are freed up that don't connect into the chain.
They produce a byproduct. Nylon production creates polymers and
water. And sometimes, to give the polymer different properties,
chemists combine several different monomers into the chain, like a
string of pearls where one is white, the next one is black and the
next one is blue. But the process is always basically the same:
Start a chain reaction among individual units that end up bonding
together into a long chain.
</P>
<P>
   Those polymer chains are the raw material that, when rolled or
spun into fibers or molded together into sheets or balls or other
shapes, become the plastic products we're so familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   Rubner says polymers grow at lightning speed. Millions of
ethylenes floating around in pairs can become one long connected
chain, C - C-C-C-C, in just thousandths of a second. The chain
stops growing only when some chemical imperfection _ think of it as
a molecule with no hands, or three hands _ fouls things up.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil is the most common raw material for plastic monomers,
Rubner says, because ``it's the most abundant, cheapest,
easiest-to-use supply of the organic chemicals you need to make
monomers.'' About 4 percent of crude oil turns into plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Rubner forecasts a revolution in plastics: ``We can now make
polymer chains with bonds that conduct electricity and light. It
may not be too far in the future that electronic components, even
your entire computer screen or TV set, are exclusively plastic.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For their entire 30 years of married life, Fred and Kristie
Carter have worn glasses _ and hated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get perspiration on them when I work out, they fog up in
the wintertime. I hate having to buy new ones, and the last ones I
got didn't do a good job,'' complains Fred, a designer of Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, the nearsighted couple drove into Boston and
underwent laser vision correction, one after the other, in a
20-minute procedure called LASIK. Each had the surgery in one eye
and both plan to have the other eye treated in a few weeks. Once
both eyes have been treated, they hope to be free from glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Laser vision correction is a form of refractive surgery _
reshaping the cornea, the clear tissue that covers the front of the
eye, so that an image is focused sharply on the back of the eye. An
older technique, radial keratotomy, required making slits deep into
the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   The Carters had LASIK, a relatively new form of laser surgery
that's quickly becoming the standard. Sometimes called ``flap and
zap,'' LASIK calls for a skilled surgeon who makes an incision in
the cornea and folds back a flap of tissue, so that a laser can
sculpt a new shape in the underlying cornea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very psyched about this,'' said Kristie, a software
engineer as she sat waiting her turn at the Massachusetts Eye and
Ear Infirmary's laser center. ``It's something I've wanted for a
very, very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   People like the Carters are fueling the accelerating bandwagon
of laser vision correction, which rolled out with Food and Drug
Administration approval in 1995 of one type of laser surgery called
PRK, but was slow to be widely embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with patient satisfaction spreading by word-of-mouth and
the reassuring results of scientific studies, the number of laser
procedures has been doubling in the United States _ 100,000 in
1996, 230,000 in 1997 and an estimated 400,000 or more in 1998,
according to Irving Arons, director of Spectrum Consulting, which
follows the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of patients are extremely happy,'' says Dr.
Dmitri Azar a corneal surgeon at Mass Eye and Ear who performed
LASIK on the Carters. ``But not everyone gets a perfect outcome,
and if patients have unrealistic expectations'' they shouldn't do
it.
</P>
<P>
   LASIK is so new that is has not been approved by the FDA, and
the long-term effects are not known. Azar says there is more
concern about LASIK in people with very severe myopia, because more
corneal tissue has to be removed, potentially weakening the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   The price _ ranging from about $1,800 to $2,500 per eye,
depending in part on the type of surgery _ remains an obstacle for
many people. The Carters' case was unusual: Her company's insurance
paid for both of them to undergo treatment. Most policies don't
cover it.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, eye lasers have become big business. Large chains
of laser centers have opened across the country. Ophthalmologists
are lining up to learn the procedures. Newspapers, radio, and the
the internet carry ads and infomercials. Yet it appears that this
market-driven medical procedure is being carried out ethically and
with few disappointed consumers so far.
</P>
<P>
   Still, says Azar at Mass Eye and Ear, ``if you are having no
problems with contact lenses or glasses and are not dissatisfied
with your present situation,'' it's pointless to take any risk at
all by having laser surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Risks of LASIK and similar procedures include infection,
worsened vision, glare or haloes around lights at night, and even
blindness. But specialists say these risks are very low _ less than
1 percent for infection _ and almost all these problems either go
away or can be cured.
</P>
<P>
   For the Carters, who had researched the procedures thoroughly,
the small risks were acceptable. In interviews the day after their
LASIK procedures, both said they could see distant objects clearly
with the treated eye. ``It's really neat, because without my
glasses I was reading signs all the way home,'' said Kristie
Carter. And neither experienced any pain or sensitivity to light.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, those who seek the surgery are motivated because they
find glasses or contacts uncomfortable, they have recreational
interests or jobs where lenses are a hindrance.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure that was approved in 1995, called PRK, is now
being rapidly pushed aside by LASIK, which involves much less
post-operative pain and yields clear vision sooner after the
surgery than does PRK. In PRK, the laser beam shaves off tissue
from the front of the cornea; because the injured surface is
exposed to the air, healing is more painful. Arons estimates that
LASIK now makes up 80 percent of laser vision procedures. At Mass
Eye and Ear, PRK costs $1,800 per eye and LASIK is $2,200 per eye.
</P>
<P>
   Even high degrees of nearsightedness can now be corrected with
the laser; so can hyperopia, or farsightedness, and moderate
astigmatism.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovation is reversible corneal surgery, in which a
thin plastic ring is placed in an incision in the cornea, leaving
the center part of the cornea untouched. This ``instrastromal''
corneal ring is being used overseas for mild myopia, but is still
experimental in the United States. The chief advantage is that the
ring can be removed and the cornea goes back to its normal shape.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s the field of refractive
surgery was revolutionized by the excimer laser, which uses a
relatively cool beam of energy to remove a thin layer of the
cornea, giving it a flatter shape to alter the way it focuses
light.
</P>
<P>
   PRK was the original excimer laser correction method. PRK, or
photorefractive keratectomy, is still sometimes done for mild
degrees of nearslightedness. In PRK, all the correction is carried
out on the surface of the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   But LASIK has been a major improvement, because the laser
correction actually takes place beneath the corneal surface.
</P>
<P>
   First, the eyelids are clamped open and the eyeball anesthetized
with drops. Next, the surgeon fits a metal ring over the eyeball;
it's held in place by a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Then, using a miniature, automated cutting device called a
microkeratome, the surgeon slices a thin flap of the cornea,
leaving a portion of it attached, much like a hinge. He folds the
flap back, then uses the excimer laser to reshape the corneal
tissue beneath. The flap is then replaced, held there by suction
until it heals in two or three weeks. (Another advantage of LASIK
is this: If after a few weeks, it is found that the correction is
not quite accurate, the surgeon can lift the flap without making a
new incision, re-treat the cornea with the laser, and replace the
flap.)
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after the surgeon is finished with LASIK,
patients can sit up and relax in the waiting room. They will wear a
metal shield over the eye for several nights to prevent
</P>
<P>
   accidental rubbing of the eye.
</P>
<P>
   A LASIK patient can drive the next day and usually can return to
work; with PRK, the recovery is a little slower and the patient may
feel stinging or burning in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Some surgeons will do LASIK on both eyes the same day, while
others prefer to do one and then wait a couple of weeks to make
certain no complications arise.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors caution older patients that once their nearsightedness
has been corrected with PRK or LASIK, they'll likely be unable to
read or see close-up objects clearly without reading glasses.
However, more and more surgeons are offering the option of
correcting one eye for distance vision and the other for reading _
a strategy called monovision _ though not everyone can comfortably
adjust to it.
</P>
<P>
   More so than with PRK, ``LASIK is very dependent on the skill of
the surgeon; that's why patients have to very careful'' in choosing
who will perform it on them, says Dr. Ernest Kornmehl, medical
director of the Center for Laser Vision Correction in Brookline and
a spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
</P>
<P>
   He advises potential LASIK patients to seek out a
board-certified ophthalmologist who has had fellowship training in
corneal surgery, been thoroughly trained in LASIK, and has
performed it 50 to 100 times.
</P>
<P>
   What results can you expect? For both PRK and LASIK treatment of
nearsightedness, 95 percent or more of patients end up with 20-40
vision or better. That's the minimum acuity needed for a driver's
license in most states. About half of the patients get 20-20
vision, but sometimes that's after a second ``enhancement''
procedure, done about three months later.
</P>
<P>
   Kornmehl says 83 percent of his patients with mild to moderate
nearsightedness achieved 20-25 vision or better, and after
enhancement, 92 percent had 20-25 vision or better.
</P>
<P>
   For those with more severe nearsightedness, only 58 percent had
20-25 vision after the first LASIK. But with enhancement, that
figure rose to 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, this means that LASIK or PRK may free your
from glasses, but there's also a chance you might need a weak pair
of spectacles for driving at night or other demanding situations.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Azar's LASIK patient who was treated the same day the
Carters were said she won't mind at all if she needs reading
glasses, because the procedure has been so liberating in other
visual ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, it's wonderful,'' said the woman, who is from
Weston but asked that her name not be used. For the first time in
her life _ she's worn glasses since age eight, ``I woke up in the
morning and the world was in focus.''

BUDGET SURPLUS MAY SPELL TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It should be the best of times on Beacon Hill _ if you
measure good times by the torrent of tax dollars surging into state
coffers, that is.
</P>
<P>
   But in the governor's office, Paul Cellucci's aides are busy
piling up the sandbags against the bedlam they fear that flood will
bring.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the fiscal freshet is Beacon Hill's best-kept secret,
unexpected after a year of huge tax cuts and unremarked upon by
anxious budget makers intent on damping down budgetary
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, the state's tax collections for the first six
months of the fiscal year are running far above predictions,
conjuring up memories _ and fears _ of the boom and bust of the
Massachusetts Miracle in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, tax income is more than double what it was for the same
period last year, when the state ended up with a record $900
million budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Already Beacon Hill policymakers are privately confronting the
question of what to do with the embarrassment of riches.
</P>
<P>
   In the private council he holds each week with top legislative
leaders, Cellucci has seized on the state's strong fiscal
performance to argue that, even after last year's tax cuts,
Massachusetts can still afford to cut the income tax back from 5.95
percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, who has progressive
plans of his own, and House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, who
husbands the state's resources with the caution of a Depression-era
banker, have other ideas. ``They just laugh at him,'' said one
source familiar with the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Cellucci is building such a tax cut, in phased-in
fashion, into his next budget. Keenly sensitive to how the Dukakis
administration was swept from its moorings in the last fiscal
flood, Cellucci thinks the best way to avoid a repeat is to reduce
the flow.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there's good reason that Cellucci's fiscal aides are
hoping to downplay the situation. Having been through the wrangling
that last year's budget surplus created, they know the political
struggles and bureaucratic pressures that a bulging treasury
creates on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Surpluses spur every interest group in the state to seek more
funding for pet projects and programs. The bigger the surplus, the
greater the expectations _ and the harder it is for the Beacon Hill
budget writers to keep spending under control.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a special political issue at stake for the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   A major theme in his campaign against Democrat Scott Harshbarger
was that only he could control the state budget and prepare
Massachusetts for a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the rush of riches becomes known, Cellucci will be
hard pressed to explain why the state can't spend more on issues
that he supports, such as lowering tuition at state colleges,
paying for increased health insurance, funding early-childhood
programs, and adding funding to education reform.
</P>
<P>
   And then there will be an inevitable push to provide funds for a
slew of local projects, such as harbor dredgings, new ice rinks,
libraries, and weed-control programs. Last summer, eyeing the
largesse, lawmakers cobbled together $400 million in one-time
projects. Cellucci vetoed half of those, convinced that doing so
would bolster his campaign image as a fiscal disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   But those vetoes created outrage from Cape Cod to the
Berkshires. This year, the pressure will be great for the governor
to OK more one-time spending. And he may well do so, deeming that
spending is preferable to letting the surplus grow.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Administration and Finance Fred Laskey, who is
writing the administration's budget plan for fiscal year 2000, is
the man on the front lines, trying to quash any notion that
Massachusetts should let the good times roll.
</P>
<P>
   It's Laskey's job to be a pessimist, and the laconic revenue
chief is turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, with dire talk of
economic slowdowns, revenue tail-offs, and the like. He contends
that the second half of the fiscal year, which ends June 30, could
be a bust. Even zero growth, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Laskey notes that some of the major tax cuts approved this year
won't kick in until this winter and spring. Employers, he points
out, are still using the old withholding schedules, which means far
larger refunds will be due in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you think we are crying wolf, but our single biggest
problem is our models are showing slower growth, but no one wants
to believe it,'' he said. ``It would be catastrophic to repeat the
mistakes made in the mid- and late-'80s, when the base of
government spending was allowed to grow unchecked. It was
devastating when the revenues dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are skeptical. Any downturn will be offset by a big
uptick in the capital gains tax revenue, robust corporate tax
payments, and a $98 million down payment from the tobacco
settlement that is expected in March, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Laskey's warnings are falling on deaf ears even within the
administration. Take, for example, the directive that Cellucci
budgeteers, as part of their search for savings and efficiencies,
sent to the human services bureaucracies: Submit a proposal
detailing how they could pare $54 million from what would otherwise
be a maintenance budget for next year.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem like a lot, but it comes on a base of $8 billion
yearly. What that request really translates to is a budget that
would hold this year's growth to $350 million rather than $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   And what happened? Human services came back with a proposal that
would be a $50 million increase over and above inflation _ and a
declaration that this was the absolute tightest they could cinch
the belt.
</P>
<P>
   That's a perfect portent for the trouble Cellucci faces. An
epidemic of surplus fever will surely follow the fiscal overflow.
Pity poor Fred Laskey, the man trying to administer the quinine.
</P>
<P>
   Time is short _ and the revenues are rising.

GARRITY STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)We came up with certain solutions, and _ damn, it was
working quite well, really.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal Judge Arthur Garrity Jr., author of Boston's racial
busing plan, in a recent interview
</P>
<P>
   (First of two parts)
</P>
<P>
   He would win, hands down, any contest for the Most Hated
Bostonian of the last 30 years. And deservedly so. For Judge
Garrity did more than inflict on Boston's schools and families a
nightmare of riots, fear, racial hatred, and civic trauma. He did
it with such blithe indifference to the pain of those he was
hurting, such cool disdain for anyone who doubted the wisdom of
accomplishing integration through massive crosstown busing, that to
this day he (itals)still(unitals) insists, ``Damn, it was working
quite well, really.''
</P>
<P>
   This June will mark the 25th anniversary of Garrity's order to
forcibly achieve racial balance in Boston's public schools, an
order that convulsed the city and triggered the most violent and
notorious antibusing backlash in the nation. Images from the riots
of 1974 still sear. Stanley Forman won the Pulitzer Prize with his
unforgettable photograph of a black man being rammed with an
American flag outside Boston City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan that Garrity imposed upon the city was punitive in
the extreme,'' write Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom in ``America in
Black and White,'' their essential 1997 book on race relations.
``Indeed, the judge's advisers and the state Board of Education
believed that those against whom it was directed _ in their eyes,
localist, uneducated, and bigoted _ deserved to be punished. The
plan thus paired Roxbury High, in the heart of the ghetto, with
South Boston High, in the toughest, most insular, working-class
section of the city. Blacks bused in from Roxbury would make up
half of the sophomore class at South Boston High, while the whole
junior class from `Southie' would be shipped off to Roxbury High.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems incredible that Garrity could have believed that such
cruelty would be good for either Boston's schools or its race
relations. But he was a megalomaniac, intoxicated with his own
power and blinded by self-importance. A quarter-century later, he
still finds nothing to reproach himself for. ``Looking back to the
circumstances confronting me at the time,'' Garrity told The Boston
Globe in a recent interview, ``I would not have done things any
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally relinquished control of the schools in September
1985, after more than 11 years of excruciating rule. In a fine
retrospective on the busing tragedy, Matthew Richer notes in the
November/December issue of Policy Review that Garrity
``micromanaged everything from student transfers to ordering the
purchase of 12 MacGregor basketballs. . . . (He) meddled in every
aspect of the Boston Public Schools. He placed South Boston High
into federal receivership and fired its popular principal. He
decreed rigid racial quotas in faculty and administrative hiring.
When one elementary school was converted to a middle school,
Garrity issued an order requiring the urinals to be raised.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the most hated man in Boston wasn't even a
Bostonian. Throughout his dominion over the city's public schools,
Garrity lived in the posh suburb of Wellesley, a universe away from
the people and neighborhoods his orders so brutally affected.
Richer recounts the futility with which Mayor Kevin White tried to
get Garrity to dispatch US marshals to help stop the violence that
was ripping Boston apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garrity dismissed the mayor's plea,'' Richer records, ``and
insisted that `integration in the schools can be achieved by
community efforts.' The judge was apparently less confident in
community efforts to safeguard his own home in Wellesley, however,
stationing two deputy federal marshals there around the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston as in every other city where it was imposed, forced
busing was hugely unpopular. Whites overwhelmingly opposed it;
within a few years, so did the vast majority of blacks. In 1982, a
Boston Globe poll showed that busing _ or ``court-ordered student
assignment,'' as it was euphemized _ had the support of only 14
percent of black parents with children in the public schools. What
parents of every color wanted was control over their children's
education. They wanted their kids to go to school near their homes.
They wanted to be heard; they wanted their views views to count for
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we first started deseg,'' one Boston principal
recalled in 1991, ``and a black lady came to look at the school and
said, `You have a beautiful school here. But if my child ever
learns to hate a white person, it's going to be from coming to your
school on a bus _ because we don't want to do it.' She had a child
in the first grade, and she wanted the kid to go to a school that
she could see.''
</P>
<P>
   Most parents had no objection to integration. But they objected
bitterly to having their kids shoved around by liberal social
experimenters from the suburbs. Why should that have been so hard
for Garrity to comprehend?
</P>
<P>
   Busing was doomed to failure from the outset. It made everything
worse _ race relations, public education, the neighborhoods, Boston
politics. Everyone sees that now. Everyone except Garrity, who
maintains, arrogant as ever, that he was right and all the critics
were wrong. ``Damn, it was working quite well, really.''

JOHN TRAVOLTA GETS IT RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There is a kind of performance possible only to a
movie star. It's a fascinating morphing process, tied to the power
of pop iconography. John Travolta, long on recognition as a pop
culture icon, short on recognition as an actor, has delivered two
such performances within the last 12 months. In ``Primary Colors,''
he gave us not exactly Bill Clinton, not exactly John Travolta, but
an amalgam of Clinton's honeyed rasp and lively smile with all the
outsize information instantly transmitted by the face of a famous
movie-star persona. The effect was of Travolta seeming to anoint
Clinton with Travolta's own legendary cool and a likability factor
even larger than the beleageured president's.
</P>
<P>
   The second extraordinary performance is in ``A Civil Action,''
the film based on Jonathan Harr's best-selling book about the
landmark nine-year Woburn toxic waste case. Families there sued W.
R. Grace and its subsidiary, Beatrice Foods, claiming the
manufacturers put toxins into Woburn well water that caused
children to die of leukemia. Travolta plays attorney Jan
Schlichtmann, a brash young personal injury lawyer who represented
the families in a David-and-Goliath squareoff. Schlichtmann, while
fighting the good fight, is depicted as abrasive and arrogant,
initially motivated at least as much by greed and hubris as by
idealism. Much has been written about Travolta _ his comeback, his
career trajectory, his Scientology. Little has been written about
his empathetic capacity, his ability to turn himself,
chameleonlike, into one character after another.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta transforms Schlichtmann into a screen character who
places importance on owning a closetful of $1,000 suits and driving
his black Porsche as if it were a weapon. But there's something in
his eyes that tells us he can be got to. It's this vulnerability
that Travolta needed to find before he could comfortably inhabit
the role. Without overreaching, Travolta generates sympathy for
this flawed protagonist in subtle ways, most notably during the
jockeying in which high-powered lawyers for the other side play
mind games in settings designed to remind him of what a cockroach
he is in their eyes. Travolta's Schlichtmann knows the power game
that's being played. Knowing it, he deadpans his way through it,
refusing to let the other guy know he's getting to him. But we
know.
</P>
<P>
   It's an example of the kind of subtle, layered moment that
transmits several kinds of dramatically useful information, this
visible struggle that one of the kings of cool undergoes to keep
that cool. Sitting in a Los Angeles hotel suite, Travolta says he
was attracted to the role partly because of the challenge of
engaging an audience's sympathy for an outwardly unsympathetic
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I read the script aloud with other actors, I didn't
really know whether I would want to do it,'' he says. ``When I was
able to solve this distant, aloof, arrogant but funny character who
evolves into something of a human being, that's what made me
decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I think conceptually that he's a loser. To have this
ability to kind of turn everything off is something that goes with
being detached as a professional lawyer. But he added a certain
kind of flamboyancy and arrogance that I felt made him a person I
wouldn't want to be with, or hang out with. But as he evolved into
more of a human being, I think he became more of a winner. Along
the way, which makes the film interesting, he's a mix. You never
quite know. Did he really change? Is he going to? I think in a very
subtle way by the end, you have faith that he's found himself. But
he got there, you know, kind of erratically.''
</P>
<P>
   The shoot last fall and winter in and around Boston was an
arduous one, Travolta says, although he showed no sign of it during
numerous Travolta sightings. At many points, he chatted with fans
and signed autographs. ``The temperature was rough sometimes and we
had a director (Steve Zallian) who is really quite a brilliant guy,
but he had a private vision that I only understood after a month or
so. Often you were busy taking care of your job, which was giving a
performance, along with guessing which way we were going with the
piece. We indulged Steve in doing a lot of angles and a lot of
takes, often for little things. But I got some relief from that as
a character because I got to turn off my sensitivity, so I could
almost have fun with the insensitivity for a majority of the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   What Travolta doesn't say is that his natural sense of diplomacy
smoothed what could have been troubled waters. Disney, the studio
releasing the film, paid Harr $1.2 million for the film rights to
the book. Schlichtmann got $250,000 for the rights to his story.
But the Woburn families had sold the film rights to their story to
former state senator Nick Paleologos, who later proposed a bill
banning the filming of anyone's life story without their
permission. Disney's position was that they couldn't negotiate with
the Woburn families because their rights were owned by a
competitor. They were not paid. Still, Travolta met several of the
Woburn families who visited the set.
</P>
<P>
   As he recalls it: ``When you meet people who have had
extraordinary tragedy, you don't quite know how to approach it.
`I'm sorry' doesn't seem enough. Before I could originate much more
than a hello, how are you, Anne Anderson said, `Did you know my son
was crazy about you on `Welcome Back, Kotter'? I was so relieved
that I had retroactively contributed something that suddenly I felt
more on a par with them. I know what it's like to have family loss.
I didn't need to examine that with them. I guess I just enjoyed
being a release valve for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta also met with Schlichtmann, today an environmental
lawyer. ``I enjoyed the meeting, but I didn't really lean too much
on that because Jan had evolved to what he was at the end of the
book. I had to imagine the earlier Jan. I asked him some questions
about liking the highs and lows of life, but not the middle ground.
And I asked him certain things, like whether it was true that he
danced in the park after he won his first big case. He really did
live it up like that. But Steve wanted me to do an original take on
him. Well, you must know that I've had 23 years of dealing with
lawyers, so I had a head start on that. I asked several lawyers
about technicalities, and I investigated the case as much as I
could. Basically, I just absorbed and tried to create a new
beingness for this character.''

LETTER FROM THE YUKON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HUNTER SILIDES  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   George and Hunter Silides are spending two years as town priests
in the remote Inuit village of Fort Yukon, Alaska. George, an
Alaska native, is the chaplain at St. Paul's Episcopal School in
Oakland; his wife, Hunter, is a chaplain at Grace Cathedral in San
Francisco. The following is an excerpt from a letter Hunter lately
sent to their friends at St. Paul's.
</P>
<P>
   A man named John Gabriel was born in Fort Yukon in 1924. He
seems to have quarrelled with his father in the late '30s, though,
and shook the dust from his shoes in 1941, leaving Fort Yukon,
never to return. His family all died. I looked it up in the church
records. The troublesome father, the mother, the brothers and their
wives, all of them made their way down to the churchyard and were
buried in their turn, leaving nobody to remember John Gabriel. He
never married. In 1996, it turns out, he was diagnosed with cancer
of the larynx. He died three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   All of those 57 years of life, those two years of illness, all
of it he spent without contacting anybody in Fort Yukon. Probably
he held the same low opinion of the place that most of the
inhabitants do. Probably he thought this was the last place he
would ever find help or succor. But when he died in a Seattle
nursing home, his nearest of kin _ a step-niece in Texas who had
never met him _ sent his remains to Fort Yukon, unaccompanied.
</P>
<P>
   They dressed him in a paper hospital nightgown and put him in a
cardboard box and sent him here. They called ahead to say he'd be
arriving at noon on Monday on a bush plane as freight. Usually
family arrive at the airport with a pickup truck full of somber
nephews. Usually family build the casket and line it with cloth and
dress the body. Usually family dig the grave in the frozen
churchyard and cook for the grave diggers and assemble a potluck
dinner in the Bingo Hall after the funeral. But there was no one to
do these things for John Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   George and I made some phone calls. ``Who? .... Oh, you mean
Paul Gabriel's brother? What ever happened to him? Oh? Well, gee,
he doesn't have any family around here anymore, I guess. All of 'em
dead I guess. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we rounded up a truck and some guys to meet the plane
at noon. He arrived at 9 a.m. The guys with the airport van called
and wanted to know what to do with him. I told them to meet me at
the ``morgue'' (a little cabin next to the church with no heat).
Two men easily lifted the long cardboard box on a plain pine
pallete into the morgue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't touch!'' One of them scolded me gruffly. Taboo is
hard to manage when the Ginghee (``much talker,'' Inuit for priest)
is also a pregnant woman who mustn't look at or touch death. I
guess they decided that since I was Ginghee, I had to be able to
look at it, but they weren't going to let their grandmothers know
they'd let me touch it. They made a silent compromise in taboo and
went on to deliver the rest of the freight. I stood in the snow in
front of the morgue with a casket to build and a grave to dig.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, George got a friend to start the grave with him:
chop 5 inches of frozen earth with an ax, build a fire, melt some
earth, chop 5 more inches, build a fire. ... I called our radio
station and asked them to announce we needed grave diggers. A girl
from the accounting department of the Native Village office called
up and said she had $210.65 burial assistance money, could we use
it? One of the elders was sitting at my kitchen table drinking
coffee (the diluted Peet's we make and call ``Company coffee'' _
the kind you can see through that people in the village like ...)
when she called. He shrugged, ``We could use it to buy lumber for
the coffin.'' I told her. She hung up. ``Of course, Snooks Herbert
builds a good casket, but I can't ask him to.''

SOUTH AFRICA'S ART OF TRUTH AND HEALING 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ She must have been kneeling when
they shot her. The single bullet hole is right on the top of her
skull. Because she would not tell them what they wanted to hear,
before they shot her they kept her naked for 10 days, until she
found a blue plastic bag to wrap around her hips.
</P>
<P>
   After they shocked his friend to death with the infamous yellow
generator, before they did the same to him, he asked them if he
could sing.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of Phila Portia Ndwandwe and Harold Sefola are two
of the 37,000 tales of atrocities told to South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission over 2 1/2 years. Once she stopped
weeping after reading these sad stories in the newspaper, South
African painter Judith Mason started making art about them.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she joined Ndwandwe's and Sefola's stories in a
painting she calls ``Homage to the Man Who Sang and the Woman Who
Kept Silent.'' She transformed the blue plastic into a fairytale
gown wafting through the sky. For the murderous generator she
substituted open-mouthed braziers, aglow with light and warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's ``Homage'' is destined for South Africa's Constitutional
Courthouse, scheduled to open in Johannesburg in three years. It's
the sort of setting where you'd expect to see stern portraits of
judges in black robes. Instead, there will be unflinching works by
contemporary South African artists, thanks in large part to Albert
Louis ``Albie'' Sachs. A liberal lawyer and erstwhile
anti-apartheid activist, Sachs was, in the 1960s, jailed by the
white South African government without charge or trial, forced into
exile, and, while living in Mozambique in 1988, was blown up by a
bomb planted under his car by agents of apartheid. He lost his
right arm and left eye. Not his spirit, though. You don't think of
Sachs as ``handicapped'' any more than you think the ``Nike of
Samothrace'' is, and the great Hellenistic icon of feminine power
is missing both arms, not to mention her head.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs is a resilient spirit and a jolly one, given to wearing
museum T-shirts, Monet neckties, and Mondrian socks. What he does
not wear is a prosthesis. His refusal to do so seems in the same
spirit that drove the Truth commission _ confronting and
acknowledging the past in order to get on with the future.
</P>
<P>
   Once a victim of an evil government, Sachs now labors to create
a virtuous one. He's a justice of the five-year-old Constitutional
Court, the highest in South Africa. He's an impassioned advocate of
art as well as of law. From his fee for lecturing at Harvard last
year, he saved 5,000 rand _ about $800 _ to pay for the materials
Mason would need to make her ``Homage.'' He already has filled the
walls of the current courthouse with an array of first-rate art by
South Africans, almost all of it donated by the artists, as the 20
or so major works he wants for the new courthouse will have to be.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's political state of emergency has been replaced by
an economic one. The funding that the arts community anticipated at
the dawn of the new democracy hasn't happened. The National Gallery
in Cape Town has had to cancel its art magazine subscriptions, and
its director, Marilyn Martin, says there is no money to pay guards
past March. South African tax law doesn't even allow write-offs for
donations to museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would have expected a larger infusion of money for the
arts,'' Martin laments. ``Artists were used during the struggle for
freedom, and now they're marginalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Penury now isolates South African artists as much as apartheid
once did: The fall of the rand has put international travel out of
reach for many. Judith Mason is one. The 60-year-old artist earns a
pittance from painting. She's anything but a whiner, but others say
that at the point when her career ought to have blossomed
internationally, it withered instead. Her silken, Surrealist style
was at odds with the New York-derived trends that reigned in South
Africa; her work was often overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homage'' will not be. This painting is destined for a place of
honor in the new courthouse. Mason is usually extremely reticent
about showing her work. ``But this time,'' she says, ``I wanted to
shove it down people's throats.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the South African who is considered an almost
unassailable saint in the West hasn't gone out of his way to
support his country's artists. To Martin, Nelson Mandela hasn't
done nearly enough for the artists who put themselves on the line
during apartheid. On a day when South African newspapers are full
of photos of Mandela hugging Janet Jackson, who was embarking on a
South African tour, Martin says in exasperation, ``There has been
no acknowledgement by our president of the achievement of artists.
Janet Jackson receives flowers and front page coverage with him.
We've invited him to open exhibitions, but with no success.''
</P>
<P>
   Her candor, like Sachs's refusal to wear a prosthesis, seems in
tune with a country determined to get at the truth, no matter how
depressing or undiplomatic. The ``director's message'' section of
museum newsletters is virtually always an upbeat assurance that
things are swell, even if they're not. Martin's messages are
apocalyptic.
</P>
<P>
   In a November swing through South Africa, visiting Cape Town,
Johannesburg, and points between, I saw contemporary art of
exceptional strength and scope. What I didn't see was much abstract
art: South African artists seem to need legible imagery to get
their urgent messages across. It's mostly figurative imagery.
Suffering bodies are to South African contemporary art what
crucifixions are to Early Italian painting.
</P>
<P>
   The figuration varies from Mason's sophisticated metaphors to
the highly spiritual _ and eccentric _ tableaux of Johannes Mashego
Segogela, who might be termed an ``outsider'' or ``folk'' artist in
the West. A fervent believer in heaven and hell, Segogela has
earned an international following for his updates of traditional
wood carving. His little angels tote video cameras, to record what
you're doing on earth and report back to God.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's rich indigenous visual culture means that even
the scarecrows in strawberry fields are crafted with care and
flair. Move them into a gallery and you'd have an ``installation.''
Barbed wire is ubiquitous in the country, coiled atop the walls
guarding the homes of the wealthy. But wire sculpture is a
tradition, too. Black folk artists turn out wry, whimsical wire
works: bicycles, figures, even wire Christmas trees. In a country
in need, there is imaginative recycling of what other countries
would call trash: mats woven from bubble gum wrappers; huge,
elegant metal baskets fashioned from the steel belts on tires.
</P>
<P>
   I saw contemporary art displayed in all manner of settings. In
improvised ``galleries'' made out of metal freight containers in
Soweto, I saw searing photographs of the 1976 Soweto Uprising by
Peter Magubane, who spent 586 days in solitary confinement for this
``crime.''
</P>
<P>
   First-rate commercial galleries are scarce. Johannesburg and
Cape Town are both bigger than Boston, but have fewer good
galleries, maybe three apiece. One of the best is Cape Town's Joao
Ferreira Fine Art. Ferreira's artists range from Jacques Dhont, a
Zaire-born sculptor who lives in seclusion in a South African
forest, weaving rugged, life-sized figures out of wattle bark, to
Sue Williamson, an important figure on the international scene.
Williamson's recent ``Truth Games'' series were, like Mason's
``Homage,'' based on stories that came out during the Truth
commission. Over blown-up newspaper images of victims, victimizers,
and incidents of the most inhuman cruelty, Williamson placed
fragments of text from the TRC, printed on sliding horizontal
plexiglas panels. The panels suggest Venetian blinds, and cast you
as voyeur. Since you're supposed to slide them as well, you also
play a symbolic role in shaping the truth. Everyone, Williamson
says in this work, is complicit; no one can ignore the past.

 UNDATED: ask him too.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Can I?'' With another shrug, he pushes the phone toward me.
Yes, Snooks will build the casket. The girl from the native village
will line it. If only they'd dig the grave. George and a couple of
guys are out there still.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him a nickname down here at the Native Village,'' my
contact girl tells me. ``We call him J.G. We went into the files
and found a picture of him. He's a member of our tribe, and we're
going to send him off right. Sarah's making sandwiches and says
she'll pull together a potlatch. We'll probably cry for him, too,''
she announces before hanging up. Snooks finishes the casket the
same day. They take it to the Vocational Educational building to
line it. Colored signs appear all over town, announcing that they
still need grave diggers and the time of the funeral service on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pessimistic elder from the kitchen table conversation has
discreetly leaked word of the inappropriate attire of the deceased
to the right channels. An elder woman appears at the door of the
mission house with a shirt, pants, tie, vest, socks, even
underwear. Every other body in the graveyard is buried in his or
her own clothes. Still, this beats a paper nightgown. The grave is
almost finished. Four more inches. The pessimist asks the grave
diggers (leaking muddy snow from their boots all over my kitchen
floor) if they really need those last 4 inches.
</P>
<P>
   One of the diggers is his profligate son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta do it right,'' the son answers.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's nobody to dress the body, which by this time, in
addition to having been embalmed, is frozen solid. Usually a
grandma does this, or a daughter. But for an unrelated woman to do
it is unheard of, and J.G.'s grandma is already in the churchyard.
I actually know how to dress the dead, because my grandparents were
morticians and Granny told me how. But I cannot look at death.
George and the pessimist head for the morgue with the clothes while
the grave diggers head out to light one last fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds strange, but it felt good to get those socks on his
feet. ...'' George trails off. The profligate bursts in for the
20th time that day. The grave is finished.
</P>
<P>
   We buried John Gabriel at 2 p.m. on Wednesday. The church was
packed. I got to preach the easiest funeral sermon of my life. ``If
we, who did not know John Gabriel, have welcomed his body home so
well, how much more will God, who knew and loved him, welcome his
spirit home? Fort Yukon is a mirror of heaven today.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day was Thanksgiving. This time, I celebrated and
George preached. The church was pretty full for that service, too.
The pessimist was helping to collect the food offerings at the
altar. At the end of the service he stood up straight and addressed
the people gathered there. ``When we first heard that John Gabriel
was being sent here, I was worried. I didn't know how we were going
to manage. But having seen everything that all of you did, I can
say it made my Thanksgiving complete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Should have had HIM preach!'' George whispered to me.
</P>
<P>
   Love, Hunter

   TAKE-BOS  
 LOS ANGELES: ... this character.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travolta is no stranger to Boston. Before appearing here in the
national company of ``Grease,'' he journeyed from his hometown of
Englewood, N.J., to the same Shubert Theatre 12 years earlier to
see an older sister in ``Gypsy.'' After he became a TV star in
``Welcome Back Kotter'' as greaser Vinnie Barbarino, and went on to
play disco king Tony Manero in ``Saturday Night Fever,'' he got
Harvard University's Hasty Pudding pot. Travolta credits his late
mother, Helen, for encouraging him. ``She was a director, a
teacher, an actress. She taught for years. She acted up through the
'50s. She hooked me up early on with a group of actors in New
Jersey that were a spinoff from the Actors Studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sisters Ellen, Ann, and Margaret are still professional
actresses, still making a living. Both my sister Ann and my mother
were in `Saturday Night Fever.' Ellen had a few lines in `Grease'
and Margaret had a little bit in `Michael.' All three girls were
doing quite well long before I was famous. I'm the baby of six
children. In our home, if the arts weren't admired, you were kind
of odd. We were definitely the avant-garde family on our block.''
</P>
<P>
   Englewood was also in La Guardia's flight pattern, which
accounts for Travolta's other love, flying. ``I actually have four
planes,'' Travolta says. He's licensed to fly them all, plus other
planes. ``I probably have logged more time in jets than some
captains on airlines, at least 4,500 hours in jets alone. I've gone
to professional school over the last 18 years at least 30 times.
When you're basically treating it as a profession and not a hobby,
the insurance companies let up, so now I get the normal rate. I
remember as a kid watching a plane come into view and I'd always
imagine who was on the plane and where they were going. I tried to
build a plane in my back yard. I wrote a little book called
`Propeller One Way Night Coach,' about a little boy's impressions
going cross-country when the prop age was moving into the jet
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Flying subliminally filled Travolta's nerve endings, just as the
original cast album of ``Gypsy'' did all those years ago. If acting
were to dry up tomorrow, Travolta says he'd only have to pass a few
more tests to work for an airline. ``Within a few months I could be
flying for them,'' he says. During weekends on the ``Civil Action''
shoot, Travolta flew himself, his wife, actress Kelly Preston, and
their 6-year-old son, Jett, to their 20-room home near Camden,
Maine, an area he discovered when he was invited there by his
``Look Who's Talking'' co-star and friend, Kirstie Alley, who was
summering there with her then-husband. The Travoltas just spent the
Christmas holidays there.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta's affinity, and his wife's, for Maine govern his wish
to shoot much of the ``The Shipping News'' there when the script of
the E. Annie Proulx novel has evolved to their liking. It will be
the first film in which they'll co-star. Travolta just finished
``The General's Daughter.'' Due next summer, it's a suspense
thriller in which Travolta plays a military police investigator.
Also on the drawing boards is a film of ``Battlefield Earth,'' by
sci-fi author L. Ron Hubbard, who also founded the sometimes
controversial religion, Scientology.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta and Tom Cruise are its two most famous practitioners.
Travolta learned of it in 1975 when he was shooting his first
movie, ``The Devil's Run,'' in Durango, Mexico. The movie, in which
he plays a character denouncing a blasphemer, is forgettable. But a
young actress, Jaan Prather, introduced Travolta to Scientology,
which he says has helped him immeasurably. He credits it for his
virtual singlehanded avoidance of the '70s drug scene in LA and the
help it gave him during periods of grief over the deaths of family
members and others close to him.
</P>
<P>
   These included stars of the past, most notably, Travolta says,
Jimmy Cagney. ``I had the privilege of spending a lot of time with
him,'' Travolta says. ``The old-timers liked me. Barbara Stanwyck,
Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Gregory Peck, Marlon Brando. They all had
a special feeling for me, and I always felt more comfortable with
that group than I did with my peers because I didn't know what my
peers felt about me. I didn't know what I was to them. I gained a
lot of strength from Cagney. He taught me that a man can take a
knock and still hang in there.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Travolta shares with those earlier stars is their
industry. They used to make films assembly-line fashion. So does
Travolta, ever since his career dwindled, then was reborn when
Quentin Tarantino cast him as a hit man in ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, Travolta turned down ``American Gigolo,''
``Arthur,'' ``Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' ``An Officer and a
Gentleman,'' and ``Splash!'' Then Tarantino cast him as Vinny Vega.
If ``Saturday Night Fever'' was the film that made him, ``Pulp
Fiction'' was the film that remade him. He got paid $100,000. But
having his wife and son on location with him in a more expensive
hotel than the budget allowed left him $30,000 in the red. But his
instincts, and Tarantino's, were right. After ``Get Shorty'' and
``Broken Arrow'' subsequently proved ``Pulp Fiction'' was no fluke,
Travolta joined the $20 million club. He has worked nonstop ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   So the '90s will not be the story of missed opportunities that
marked the '80s? ``Kind of,'' Travolta says. ``I used to say no to
a lot of films. I don't want to say no again to a great
opportunity. And to be honest, these are better opportunities than
the kinds I had when I started in the '70s, so I really wanted to
make up for lost opportunities. I like it better now because
they're better scripts. Anyone's career, the best parts are in
their 40s, 50s and 60s. You have time to rub elbows with other
people. It makes the performances that much richer.''

PAT O'CONNOR PAYS TRIBUTE TO IRELAND, AND MERYL STREEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

   ``Who's that idiot with the braces on? That guy is a (expletive)
fruitcake. You can't take a man seriously when he's 80 or 90, and
he's wearing braces. Can't he hold up his trousers some other
way?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Braces'' are suspenders, and the ``idiot'' and ``fruitcake''
Pat O'Connor was referring to is better known as CNN talk show host
Larry King. O'Connor was in Boston last fall during the Boston Film
Festival to do the meet-and-greet thing for his latest film,
``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' a project he had wanted to do for years.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to talk about the film, and was eager to chat about
working with its star, Meryl Streep. But nothing could begin until
he let off steam about what he calls ``the Billy Clinton
situation,'' and what's been happening to the man O'Connor says
``has been more important than any other American president to my
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very bad it has come to this. It's a terrible waste of
a bright man. I don't care. . . . I think it's a pity,'' he said.
``It's terrible nonsense. He's very bright _ look how many dummies
who've been running this country. If he weren't in office, that
peace treaty wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's native country is Ireland, and his affection for his
homeland is evident in his best films such as ``Cal'' and ``Circle
of Friends,'' the 1995 film that introduced moviegoers to Minnie
Driver. ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' (pronounced ``loo-na-sa'') is also
set in Ireland, this time in a rural parish in the 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Brian Friel's award-winning play, it is the story of
the Mundy sisters, all unmarried, all living under the same roof.
Kate (Streep) is the eldest, and the most severe. She is a teacher,
but is so far removed from the joys of youth, it seems as if she
never enjoyed them. Her sisters, while respectful of Kate, want
something more. They long to love, to dance, to experience the
sweetness that has somehow passed them by. There's Maggie (Kathy
Burke), Rose (Sophie Thompson), Agnes (Brid Brennan), and Christina
(Catherine McCormack), the youngest and prettiest, and also the
mother of a young son, Michael (Darrell Johnston). All of their
lives are altered when their brother Jack (Michael Gambon), a
missionary priest, returns home after 25 years in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was attracted to these women in this quietly desperate
world,'' said a more sedate O'Connor, between sips of merlot at a
Back Bay restaurant. ``But there was also a tremendous spirit, and
self-respect, and respect for each other despite the difficulties
surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in things that are slightly difficult to
define, but are a little bit outside of us,'' he said. ``It's a
triumph of spirit, the struggle against adversity, all of these
things for me are what real drama is. I'm not interested in
testosterone-driven stuff. I'm always interested in the doubts in
people, rather than the certainties.''
</P>
<P>
   The women in ``Lughnasa'' are not unlike those O'Connor knew
when he was growing up in rural Ireland. He left his homeland to
see the world at 18, because ``there was nothing around.'' But he
has never forgotten the honest, decent people who forged his
identity, and the casual kindness they would extend to strangers as
well as friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were ordinary. They weren't showy or high-flying or
fashionable,'' he said. ``They were strong women who knew how to
cope with the difficulties around them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the role of Kate, O'Connor always knew he wanted Streep, who
mastered yet another accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so good. She happens to be a star, but first and
foremost, she's a very good actress,'' he said. ``She's extremely
likable, but people tend to think she might be a bit of a diva. But
she's very warm, a giggler, and highly intelligent. She does plenty
of research, but she's not self-indulgent. She knows posturing is
for fools. I adore her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' is O'Connor's first film since 1997's
``Inventing the Abbotts,'' which costarred two of his favorite
young actors, Billy Crudup and Joaquin Phoenix. For O'Connor, two
films in two years is downright prolific, considering he's made
only eight films since his directorial debut, ``Cal,'' a movie of a
doomed romance set amid the Troubles in Northern Ireland in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor prefers to take his time between films. He is more
committed to a stable life with his wife, actress Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio, and their two children. They live in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never work when she works, she never works when I work. The
trouble is we can never work together either because of that,''
said O'Connor, who last worked with Mastrantonio in 1990 on ``Fools
of Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been working on anything because I just returned
from Alaska, where she's making a John Sayles film (`Limbo'),'' he
said. ``But we like our life the way it is. I don't need to make
huge bucks all the time, but I do need to have a normal life. I
have a life outside of film, and I intend to keep it that way.''

MUSIC FUTURE HERE IN THE FORM OF MP3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I have listened to the future, and its name is MP3.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat after me: MP3. MP3. MP3.
</P>
<P>
   Got it? Don't forget it. This is going to be huge _ unless big
business kills it.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 stands for MPEG 1 Layer 3. It's technical mumbo-jumbo for a
new audio compression format that can squeeze music files down to
between one-fourth and one-twentieth their normal size _ with
little loss of quality.
</P>
<P>
   A three-minute song, for example, can be compressed into an MP3
file of less than 3 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the programs needed to make and play MP3 files,
not to mention hundreds of thousands of MP3 files themselves, are
available to anyone _ free.
</P>
<P>
   What's all this mean? Computer users the world over can now jump
on the Internet, download as many MP3 files _ songs _ as they want
and play them to their heart's content on their home or office
computer. The quality is phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't stop with your PC or Macintosh. MP3 files can be
transferred via a parallel cable to a device like the Diamond Rio,
a palm-sized player much like a Sony Walkman, that can hold up to
an hour's worth of MP3 music in its 32-megabyte memory.
</P>
<P>
   Just plug in a set of headphones and you're off. Unlike other
portable music devices, the Rio contains no mechanical or moving
parts. So no amount of jostling can make the music skip.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio, which sells for about $200, is available for purchase
online and is expected to be in retail outlets in Phoenix and other
major U.S. cities by the time you read this.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Internet is awash in music. People are trading
songs like never before.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 isn't like previous Internet-related advancements in
technology, such as streaming audio. Remember the first time you
checked that out? Yeah, it was kinda neat, but it still sounded
like a short-wave radio dispatch from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is different. Believe me when I say: It's really cool!
</P>
<P>
   Now, before we go on, we have to address an all-important
question: Is all this MP3 stuff legal?
</P>
<P>
   The quick answer is yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's legal to make MP3 files for your own enjoyment
using CDs you own. It's really no different than recording some of
your favorite CD tunes on a cassette tape that you use for personal
entertainment on a long vacation.
</P>
<P>
   It's also legal to visit Web sites and download licensed MP3
files _ music the artists have agreed to make available for
distribution in the MP3 format. One good site to find such files is
MP3.com at www.mp3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with MP3 files becomes illegal if you make MP3 files
from commercial CDs and put the MP3 files online or share them with
other people.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody with half a brain should know that. I mean, you should
know something is wrong when the latest CD from your favorite group
is on sale at Target for $16.99, but also is available free online
in the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming we all have at least half a brain, then, we'll also
assume that if you run across Web sites full of Top 40 hits in MP3
format that the person behind the site knows full well that he or
she is breaking the law and that you know you'll be breaking the
law if you download any of the files.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this has kept pirates from opening sites all
over cyberspace to trade illegal MP3 files. Some music industry
executives have gone so far as to say they believe the majority of
MP3 files online are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's true, nobody knows. But, as you can imagine, the
record companies and the artists they employ are not very happy
about this MP3 business.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Associa tion of America (www.riaa.com)
views MP3 as little more than a tool for music pirates. The group
has helped close some of the more obviously illegal Web sites and
has even tried to block the sale and distribution of the Rio MP3
player.
</P>
<P>
   Where will all this end? I'm not sure, but I believe record
companies will be forced to climb aboard the MP3 bandwagon _ or
develop something better _ because MP3 works, works very well and
it's free.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, thanks to MP3, high-quality music can be
traded across the Internet quickly and with relative ease. The
implications for electronic commerce are monumental.
</P>
<P>
   While that's being sorted out, I encourage you to give MP3 a
try.
</P>
<P>
   The technology has actually been around for more than a year,
but finally has caught on thanks to the widespread availability of
Pentium-class PCs and similarly powered Macintosh computers that
can decode and play MP3 files on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com offers a wealth of information for the beginner,
including answers to frequently asked questions, links to get the
necessary software, a huge library of MP3-related articles and, of
course, hundreds of legal MP3 files you can download free.
</P>
<P>
   A few well-known artists have made songs available for
distribution via the MP3 format. (Billy Idol had two songs on
MP3.com until his record label forced both to be removed.)
</P>
<P>
   But most of the legal stuff you find online is from unknown
artists who want you to sample their work. The thinking is that
maybe you'll like what you hear and buy one of their complete CDs
somewhere down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let this throw you. There's some great music out there.
MP3.com has tunes in many genres, ranging from rock to country,
from New Age to R&AMP;B. There's also folk, swing, classical,
experimental, comedy and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   I dove into the MP3 experience one evening last week. The first
thing I had to do was download and install a program to play MP3
files. I chose a shareware program called WinAmp 2.05. There's a
similar program for the Macintosh called MacAmp. MP3.com offers
links to both.
</P>
<P>
   WinAmp, which costs $10 to register for personal use (do it!),
provides a really cool interface. It looks like a small stereo rack
system, complete with an amplifier, a powerful equalizer and handy
playlist window.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I went to MP3.com's music area and started downloading
titles. By the end of the night, I'd grabbed 11 songs ranging in
size from about 1.3 megabytes to just over 4 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   The music sounded great. I couldn't believe my ears.
</P>
<P>
   Audiophiles, of course, will debate the quality of MP3 files
until they die. After all, they still haven't given up on vinyl!
But I think most people with decent sound cards and speakers on
their computers will find most MP3 files close to CD-quality.
</P>
<P>
   I also liked MP3 right off the bat because it allowed me to work
at the computer and listen to some nice music without tying up my
CD-ROM drive with CDs.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't guessed by now, I'm hooked on MP3. And I think
you might get hooked, too, if you give it a try. &QL;

JOHN BAYLEY, ON LIFE WITH IRIS MURDOCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ELEGY FOR IRIS 
By John Bayley. 
St. Martin's, 275 pp. $22.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If memory is both the treasure and the drafting table of human
consciousness, then the tragic loss of it manages to annihilate
experience even as it exalts its timeless present. Without the
hindsight to digest and take note of our existence, by which we
turn it into life's narrative, there is nothing left but the
transience of the moment _ the fleeting aroma of the garden, the
feel of a hand upon the cheek, the taste of coffee or sherbert
almost immediately forgotten. This amnesic state is particularly
tragic because we understand its counterpoint: understand that the
world we have built _ art and God and the blessings of love and all
the triumphs of human accomplishment _ has little value without the
power to comprehend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take short views,'' the English literary critic John Bayley
reminds himself, borrowing the phrase from an adage for depression.
``Never further than dinner or tea.'' Alzheimer's disease afflicts
millions of people each year, and, with the violent egalitarianism
of most illnesses, cares not whether its victims are 52 or 84,
poets or madmen. It struck Bayley's wife, the philosopher and
novelist Iris Murdoch, in 1994, when she was 75, and in the few
infinite years since, as she has said to Bayley, she has been
``sailing into the darkness.'' He is with her on the voyage.
Sometimes the seas are stormy and terrifying; more often, they are
known but endless, granting an occasional sense of peace. There is
little else there now but these two devoted people, the one helpful
and the other helpless, clinging to each other and staring at the
far horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elegy for Iris'' is Bayley's restrained and elegant love song
to his wife of 42 years, with whom he first became enchanted when
she rode a bicycle past his window at St. Anthony's College, where
he was teaching in Oxford. She was 34; he, 28, a young man in love
with literature and the promises of the intellectual life. When
they met again, at the home of a colleague, she was sporting brown
cotton stockings and unwashed hair, and she charmed everybody in
the room. She was a philosopher at Oxford, Bayley knew; later, when
they bicycled home together, she confided to him that she was
working on a novel. Thrilled with this privileged information, he
learned soon enough that she had revealed the same secret to easily
a dozen friends. It didn't matter, by then: He was hopelessly in
love, and when he took her to a dance, she appeared wearing garish
lipstick and promptly fell down the stairs. She got up smiling, and
later wrote in her diary: ``St. Anthony's Dance. Fell down the
steps, and seem to have fallen in love with J. We didn't dance
much.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't time for dancing: There were instead novels and
critical studies and works of philosophy, and country houses and
foxes and long swims in the river, and all the braided pleasures
that constitute a shared life. Bayley had to convince this sterling
mind and free soul to marry him; Murdoch seemed far wider and
wilder than that, and only succumbed, he now believes, because she
found a house in the country where he, too, seemed to fit. For the
next several decades, they found together the blissful solitude for
each that Bayley describes, not incongruously, as ``one of the
truest pleasures of marriage.'' And from the beginning, they seemed
to possess a language of intimacy _ a thick communication,
childlike in the best sense _ that superseded the brilliant
critical and creative faculties they each possessed. Today they
rely on that secret language, creating from necessity a kind of
jabberwocky to communicate the feelings between them, if not the
words themselves. ``Now we are together for the first time,''
writes Bayley. ``. . . In a way, like Orids Baveis and Philemon,
whom the gods gave the gift of growing old together as trees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elegy for Iris'' is beautiful and heartbreaking, though it
isn't really elegiac _ it's more a love poem writ in melancholy, an
ode to the past and the stratosphere of commitment that such a past
ensures. Relayed with the fluid style and even humor of that old
admirable school of British critics, most of whom write as though
they were playing ragtime piano, Bayley's memoir is candid about
the depth and severity of Murdoch's incapacity and yet riven with
dignity. More than anything, it is respectful: This is a woman,
after all, whom he has adored for nearly half a century, and adore
her he still does. In reminiscing through their decades together,
he takes us to Italy and the artwork of Piero della Francesca and
Titian, the writing of Lawrence and Proust, the rivers, beckoning
on a summer day, where he and Murdoch left their clothes to swim.
And in recapturing the past, he has delivered his Iris to us wholly
formed, throughout the cumulative beauty of her life day by day.
When the quite tall novelist Barbara Pym met Murdoch and Bayley,
she later wrote to Philip Larkin about the encounter, saying she
feared she had ``seemed to tower above Iris (though only in height,
of course).''
</P>
<P>
   Exercising restraint about the specific ravages of Alzheimer's,
Bayley is nonetheless never euphemistic; he admits after a
particularly tender passage that ``most days are for her a sort of
despair.'' Like ``Patrimony,'' Philip Roth's brilliantly moving
memoir about his father's death, the tribute and beauty of the
words here are stronger than the pain and mess they describe.
Bayley concedes that he knows nothing of the spiritual life, but it
isn't quite true: The whole lifetime shared in ``Elegy for Iris''
is full of spirit, generous and resilient and partaking of the
bounty, before the darkness began to fall. During the early days of
their love affair, when things between them were difficult or
ill-resolved, Murdoch used to remind Bayley of the myth of Proteus,
who had the power to assume different shapes; when Hercules gripped
him firmly, he returned to his original shape. ``Remember
Proteus,'' she would say to Bayley. ``Just keep tight hold of me
and it will be all right.'' This reassurance, wrenching now,
contains the essence of their life together _ what it was and,
perhaps on the better days, still is.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
 
!!! ``Central Station'' Classic humanist art cinema from Brazil.
Fernanda Montenegro is magnificent as a crusty old woman whose
heart is thawed when she accompanies a motherless boy (Vincius de
Oliveira) on a literal and symbolic journey to find his father in
Walter Salles's road film about contemporary Brazil finding its
identity, too. (R) 
 
!!! 1/2 ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' A beautiful film of a beautiful
play (by Brian Friel) about five unmarried sisters in Donegal and
the refusal of their hearts and spirits to be crushed by the
grinding hardship they face and the return, in disgrace, of their
brother, a missionary priest who no longer sees any need to
distinguish between pegan religions and Catholicism. Meryl Streep
is the presiding sister. Michael Gambon is the spiritual pilgrim.
(PG) 
 
!!! ``Down in the Delta'' Richly-textured film directing debut of
poet Maya Angelou. In it, a single mother whose life is falling
apart in Chicago rights herself and her family after she returns to
her relatives and her roots in Mississippi. Alfre Woodard delilvers
a strongly-arched performance as the woman who becomes whole again.
You've never seen Wesley Snipes as he appears here in the role of a
soft-spoken, educated, prosperous Atlanta businessman. (PG-13) 
 
!!! ``Hurlyburly'' David Rabe's houseful of Hollywood loose cannons
make more dramatic sense here than they did on the New York stage.
Sean Penn is intense, yet sympathetic, as Eddie, trying to lose
himself in the fast-lane life, yet also wondering if he shouldn't
be keeping his ear cocked for a wakeup call. Strong support from
Kevin Spacey, and from Chazz Palminteri, Garry Shandling, Robin
Wright Penn, Anna Paquin, and Meg Ryan _ the latter three as women
too strong to be destroyed by the misogynistically destructive men.
(R) 
 
!!! ``Little Voice'' Captivating tale about a reclusive young woman
in a crumbling seaside town in the north of England, squelched into
silence by her mother, except when she uncannily reproduces the
voices of Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Shirley Bassey, and others
she spends her days listening to from her dead father's record
collection. Jane Horrocks is amazing as the girl whose voice is not
little; Michael Caine is wonderful as the sleazy agent who wants to
exploit her talent. (R) 
 
!!! ``Mighty Joe Young'' Solidly-crafted, family-friendly remake of
the 1949 film about a sensitive gorilla who suggests King Kong's
kid brother and is highly unhappy in so-called civilization.
Charlize Theron is the primatologist who turns it into a
beauty-and-the-beast story, and Bill Paxton is another plus in the
role of the guy who wants to save them both. (PG) 
 
!! ``Patch Adams'' This film about a nonconformist doctor who
clowns around with patients in the name of treating them more
humanely and effectively would seem to be made to order for Robin
Williams. But the manipulativeness of the clunky script keeps
getting in the way by stacking the deck. The docs are either rigid
martinets or compassionate shaker-uppers. (PG-13) 
 
!!!! ``Shakespeare in Love'' The best backstage comedy ever made.
It's delightful for other reasons, too. Joseph Fiennes is an
amusingly soulful Shakespeare, Gwyneth Paltrow is luminous as the
high-born woman he was thinking of when he wrote Juliet and the
supporting players are unfailingly zestful, too, from Judi Dench's
high-spirited Elizabeth to Ben Affleck's droll matinee idol to
Geoffrey Rush's desperate theater owner. (R)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If being a certified genius is a load, Mary Zimmerman _
director of the current production of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''
at the Huntington Theatre Company _ bears it lightly. A
Chicago-based director, and a visiting professor at Northwestern
University in Evanston, Ill., Zimmerman was named a MacArthur
Fellow early last year, a generous financial award that carries the
sobriquet, or ``handle'' as they say out West, of ``the genius
award.'' Her particular specialty is adapting, creating new works
out of non-stage classics, including ``The Odyssey'' and ``The
Arabian Nights.'' At the Huntington in 1996, she directed ``Journey
to the West,'' her adaptation of a novel translated from an ancient
Chinese epic.
</P>
<P>
   This legitimate-stage genius really likes television. Rather
late in an interview (these things happen), the subject of British
actors arose, and Zimmerman slapped it down:
</P>
<P>
   ``I will, to my death,'' she hyperbolized, ``defend the
reputation of American actors. That is a myth, that British actors
are somehow superior. I am perpetually patriotic on the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that somehow the illusion of top-to-bottom
competence, nay, little `g' genius, seemed to characterize even
British television (``Inspector Morse'' or the ineffable Helen
Mirren's vehicle, ``Prime Suspect,'' or the recent ``Nicholas
Nickleby'') wherein even the lowliest of cast members seems ready
to step onto the stage at the Old Vic, Zimmerman heated to her
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is this,'' Zimmerman simplified: ``In America, you
have to make a choice between the legitimate stage _ live theater _
and television and movies. There is no theater in Los Angeles and
there's hardly any television production in New York. Bill Cosby
could get away with it, but that's rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Britain is so small, everything is so close. You can do
television and stage at the same time. Here, it's coast or coast,''
she said, illustrating the vast gap with widespread arms at the
ends of which were, from left to right, a diet soda and a forkful
of salad, an oddity explained by the fact that her only free
moments for interviews are during lunch breaks at the Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are great shows on American television,'' she
emphasized with a stab of a suddenly lettuce-free fork. `` `Law and
Order,' that's a great show with superb acting.'' It is also the
exception that proves her rule _ it's the only prime-time drama
filmed on location in New York City, giving it access to a
metropolis filled with aspiring and successful actors.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's affection for television is really an appreciation
for acting, not for the subject matter of crime and punishment.
``Do you watch `Homicide'?'' she challenged. Disappointed that the
response was negative, Zimmerman offered the opinion that Clark
Johnson (Detective Meldrick Lewis, the dogged, back-to-basics cop
with the dry-as-fingerprint-dust humor) was ``the best actor in
America.'' She explained to the abashed nonviewer that Johnson had
the greatest of acting talents: ``You never catch him acting. I met
him a little while ago, and he's absolutely nothing like the
character on screen. Totally different. That's acting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicide'' is filmed entirely on scene in Baltimore, making it
the only other East Coast prime-time drama, and one that can also
draw on actors from New York's on- and off-Broadway talent ocean.
``And there's `3rd Rock from the Sun,' '' Zimmerman said, switching
effortlessly from homicide to humor. ``John Lithgow is fabulous.
You want a British comparison?'' she challenged. ``Lithgow is
America's John Cleese.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at the Huntington performance workshop, actors
waited for another grueling afternoon of being funny, the hardest
work in theater. ``I am taking this play for what I really think it
is,'' Zimmerman said, ``a brilliantly conceived comedy, a play you
can't change a line in, or rearrange a scene in, without spoiling
it. And I take it as a play about the meaning of true love. You
could take it cynically, take it darkly, you could make it question
the existence of love. Well, I take it as a serious look at the
question: `Is love real?' That is a fundamental question, even if
the device for asking it includes a magic flower and a healing
herb.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one thing is turning out to be true. Everyone says this is
a play that brings out the best in everyone. In this play, you
really are asking whether the enchanted world is real, or is the
real world the real world? Well, in the theater, and this is always
true when theater succeeds, the fantasy world and the real world
are reconciled.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, artistic associate at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago,
is responsible for casting, directing, and also designing
``Midsummer,'' which, she says, will be done with a minimum of
stage scenery and a maximum of costume. What kind of costumes?
Modern? Elizabethan? ``What I tell everyone is this,'' she said:
``I insist that the official answer to that question is `The
costumes are from the Gorgeous Period.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed as to when in the vast landscape of history one might
stumble upon the Gorgeous Period, Zimmerman allowed it might be
near the Victorian (the ladies will be ladies in long dresses) but
not quite. Perhaps a little on the Pre-Raphaelite edge of
Victorian/Edwardian. But gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been done in modern dress,'' Zimmerman remarked. ``It's
been done in every imaginable way, and it can survive any staging.
I think the only thing that would spoil it would be to direct it
with a dark, cynical view. We won't do that. We will, as I said,
look for the meaning of true love.''

MCCAIN'S COMPLEXITY WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The human puzzle makes his familiar stiff walk to the
dais. The gleaming Republican faces lay down their salad forks. The
guest draws loud, unsurprising applause. The crowd _ wonks and D.C.
types _ admires his conservatism, his patriotism, his heroism.
</P>
<P>
   You like the human puzzle, apart from -isms, because maybe he is
the most fascinating political game in America today.
</P>
<P>
   Because maybe _ I peg his chances at one in 20 _ he can win
election as America's next president.
</P>
<P>
   Because maybe, mostly, it is impossible to unpuzzle Arizona's
senior senator, John Sidney McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Such fun, though. And suddenly such a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Solving McCain turned urgent last Wednesday, when he formed an
exploratory committee for the 2000 presidential race. McCain called
this a prelude to a decision, a way to stick his toe into the river
of cash needed for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Friday, he headed to the Arizona Biltmore, to a
conservative group-grope billed as ``The Weekend,'' and you could
hear him trying out themes, taking rhetorical baby steps.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller government. Coherent foreign policy. Reformed campaign
finance. An end to the Internal Revenue Service. A return to the
America of Ronald Reagan. A restoration of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even amid today's peace and prosperity, the people know that
something is terribly wrong with the country,'' went one McCain
thrust. ``Ask any American one simple question: `Are you proud?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely the relevant question. It will be asked all this
year and into the next, not only about the country, but about the
quasi-candidate for president, the human puzzle, John Sidney
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Are you proud of him? Always, or merely sometimes?
</P>
<P>
   Or are you confused?
</P>
<P>
   With McCain, the admirable stands have been many, the courage
unquestionable, the contradictions disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   You must applaud him for speaking hard truths to his peers who
crowd the congressional trough, who can't get their fill of pork.
McCain can, and regularly does, cite million-dollar outrage after
million-dollar outrage. He is a conscience on spindly legs. Then
there is his stand against tobacco. You can disagree, but you must
admire his willingness to buck his party and its biggest donors.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can you question McCain's valor. Consider this my allusion
to his Vietnam heroics _ if you need to know more, read every other
article in any other national publication. Or ask McCain himself.
He will get around to telling you, mostly while refusing to tell
you.
</P>
<P>
   If that last sentence sounds like a contradiction, it isn't the
only one.
</P>
<P>
   Since shucking the Keating Five label, the senator has made much
hay over fixing campaign finance, all the while raising much loot _
more than $4 million last election, to beat someone named Ed
Ranger, who barely banked $340,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nary a special interest was missed: 46 grand from US West
donors, 26 large from Bell Atlantic workers, $16,000 more from
Phelps Dodge employees.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the moral high ground is one pricey piece of real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are McCain's contradictions solely political: During the
Senate ethics hearing concerning his Keating involvement, McCain
raged about the personal nature of the attacks on his character.
The same was true in 1994, after his wife's addiction to and theft
of prescription painkillers was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Given that sensitivity, how do you explain McCain's too-public
joke last June about Chelsea Clinton being ``so ugly''?
</P>
<P>
   You don't, can't. Such is life in the wake of the human puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   He has a temper. He is as human, as authentic, as a politician
gets. At his best, he fights his own party. At his worst, he fights
your best perceptions of him.
</P>
<P>
   Are you proud, he asks? Maybe every American voter will get a
chance to answer that question.
</P>
<P>
   They will see John run. They may never solve what makes John
tick. &QL;

40-YEAR-OLDS WORRY ABOUT RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 42 and my husband is 49. We wish to retire at age 65
with a monthly income of $5,000. Unlike many of your readers, we
started investing for retirement way too late. To date our
investments include $14,430 in my company's 401(k) plan, $8,307 in
Fidelity Growth Company fund, $8,307 in Neuberger and Berman
Guardian fund, and $14,000 in a credit union money market account
earning 3.17 percent interest. In addition to my regular job, my
husband and I have also owned a small business since 1993, and it
has a current capital equipment value of $80,000 to $100,000. As an
owner of the business, a few years ago I also opened a $1,000
SEP-IRA account, but haven't added to it since. Any investment or
monthly savings advice would be greatly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   D.M., Arlington, Texas &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You not only need to work out a budget that involves
substantial retirement savings, but you need to adhere to it
religiously.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the goal of a $5,000 monthly income stream in
retirement. What Social Security benefits will the two of you
likely get? You can call Social Security and ask for a form that
allows you to request a statement of your estimated benefits, and I
suggest you do that.
</P>
<P>
   But let's estimate that between the two of you Social Security
probably will bring in $2,000 a month. That means you will need to
produce a $3,000 monthly income stream from your investments.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, as well as to leave a bit of money working so you
will have some protection against inflation, you will need a pool
of about $750,000. If we presume that your husband's business will
have at least the same liquidation value at the time of his
retirement as it does now, we can cut that figure to $650,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's presume that you'll put together a retirement
portfolio that is likely to achieve average annual returns of 10
percent. To get from your current $41,343 savings to $650,000 over
16 years will require monthly additions of $1,019 to your savings _
either through your 401(k) or SEP-IRAs, Roth IRAs, or some other
tax-advantaged savings vehicle such as variable annuity accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And to get the 10 percent average returns upon which that
projection is made, you will have to invest a bit more aggressively
than you've been doing.
</P>
<P>
   The current allocations in your 401(k) account give you a pretty
good idea of the kind of total portfolio you should seek: You have
30 percent in the Merrill Lynch Growth fund, a similar amount in
Merrill Lynch Corporate High-Income fund, and 20 percent each in
Merrill Lynch Basic Value and Merrill Lynch Global Allocation
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The two taxable mutual fund holdings are also fine. But that
$14,000 loafing at the credit union is a terrible investment. Even
if you have mentally put that aside as emergency money, there's no
reason you should tolerate that 3.17 percent yield.
</P>
<P>
   With just a little shopping around the money market funds
offered by mutual fund companies, you can boost that yield to 5
percent or a bit more. And as far as I'm concerned, the tiny level
of additional risk inherent in a mutual fund money market when
compared to a bank or credit union offering is so small as to be
negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you can divert any part of that $14,000 from the
money markets into a more growth-oriented investment such as your
mutual fund portfolio, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 44-year-old self-employed artist who needs additional
income. Currently I have $60,600 in Janus High-Yield fund and
$48,000 in Vanguard's Prime Money Market fund. I have several other
funds set aside for retirement, but I need income now. What do you
suggest I could do to produce a better income?
</P>
<P>
   A.H., Escondido, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What you are employing now is frequently called a ``barbell
strategy'' _ balancing a higher-risk investment at one end (the
high-yield, or ``junk'' bond fund) with the very conservative,
low-risk money market fund at the other.
</P>
<P>
   I calculate the effect is a portfolio average of 6.96 percent,
using current yield rates. This comes in a little higher than most
investors who use the barbell strategy, since you've given heavier
weighting to the junk bond fund. (My favorite approach to building
such a portfolio is to put about a quarter of the portfolio in a
money market fund, a similar amount in junk bonds, and the balance
in a good GNMA fund, ending up with a portfolio average yield in
the neighborhood of 6 5/8 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the only way you can increase the yield from such a
portfolio is to move it further toward the higher-risk end of the
spectrum. One way would be to give the portfolio a still-heavier
weighting in junk bonds. Another approach would be to move the
money market funds into a somewhat more venturesome investment. A
small step in that direction might take you to Vanguard's
Short-Term Corporate Bond fund, where you could expect a yield of
about 6.1 percent, which compares to 5.06 percent from the money
market fund..
</P>
<P>
   Or you could increase the risk (and likely return) a bit more by
moving into Vanguard's GNMA fund, where you could expect a yield in
the 6.6 percent area.
</P>
<P>
   But I have a warning if you're contemplating increasing yield by
assuming higher risk _ don't do it unless you're very confident
that you can leave the principal alone for a number of years _ say
five at a minimum, and better yet a decade. The higher the risk
with bond funds, the more the funds will fluctuate when interest
rates change.
</P>
<P>
   With funds such as junk bonds and Ginnie Maes, you can expect
that the sledding will be very tough about two years out of every
ten _ they will keep distributing the yield checks during those
years, but your principal value is likely to fall fairly sharply.
The thing to do when this happens is simply ride out the storm. The
long-term track records show that eventually interest rates change
course again, and the funds then recover. But if you are compelled
to withdraw funds at a bad time you can end up a pretty substantial
loser.
</P>
<P>
   So if your budget is subject to the vagaries of the art market
and you do indeed find yourself drawing upon your principal from
time to time, my suggestion would be to leave the maximum that you
can imagine yourself withdrawing over a five-year period in the
money market fund, only moving the balance into the riskier and
higher-yielding funds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I, aged 60 and 62, are selling our primary
residence and anticipate netting approximately $180,000. We will
live in our summer home temporarily until we decide upon another
primary residence more suitable to our early retirement status.
What do you recommend as a safe, easily accessible investment
vehicle with a reasonable return?
</P>
<P>
   R.V., Andover, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since I'm assuming that you're likely to find your new home
within a period no longer than three or four years, I would treat
this money very cautiously. It is short-term money, and if you go
beyond vehicles such as money market funds or CDs, you could find
that the interest rate changes that affect even very conservative
bond funds, such as those holding short-term corporate debt
obligations, can bring declines that more than outweigh the
slightly higher returns that these offer when compared to CDs or
money markets.
</P>
<P>
   So you basically find yourself in the same position as a banker,
who must balance his short-term assets (loans and investments) with
liabilities (borrowings or deposits) of the same duration. Yes,
longer-term investments have a better potential for gain, but
mismatching the duration of an investment and the time frame during
which you will likely need to call upon it can cause agonies that
far outweigh to potential gains. So play it the strait, albeit
boring, way _ through the banks or the money markets.
</P>
<P>
   (But also note what I explained to D.M. above about the
difference between bank and credit union money market accounts and
those offered by mutual fund companies.)

BOWEL ILLNESS CAUSES PAIN AND EMBARRASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ On some days, she has constant diarrhea. On
others, it strikes only after eating a piece of chocolate or
something containing milk.
</P>
<P>
   Her symptoms include bloating, gas and abdominal pain, sometimes
so severe that the only relief is staying in bed or close to a
bathroom. A trip to the doctor revealed nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received every test known to man,'' said the 28-year-old
Albany communications specialist. ``When it turned out to be
irritable bowel syndrome, there were no answers.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the biggest frustration for people with this condition.
This young woman didn't want to use her name because she's
embarrassed about an illness so common it strikes an estimated one
of out every five people.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies indicate that irritable bowel syndrome is the
second leading reason why people miss work, behind only the common
cold. Yet IBS is often a difficult illness to pinpoint. Besides
diarrhea, it may cause constipation and excessive flatulence in
some. For others, it's a combination of diarrhea and constipation.
</P>
<P>
   Gastroenterologists often will rule out other potential
problems, like inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or colon
cancer, before coming up with a diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from an inside look at their colon, someone with IBS has
absolutely nothing wrong. There are no pockets, polyps or
inflammation. The problem is functional, not physical.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the colon as a hollow tube that pushes it contents
forward with muscle contractions, a process known as peristalsis.
People with IBS have contractions that are disordered or that move
in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   That's why an attack can sometime strike without warning.
Triggers may include specific foods, stress and hormones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying problem is a malfunction of the smooth
muscle,'' said Dr. David Lyon, a Schenectady gastroenterologist and
chair of the Department of Internal Medicine at Ellis Hospital.
``It's extraordinarily common.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever had diarrhea before a big exam or an important
interview, you can understand better how IBS works.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Quarrier, a gastroenterologist with Kaiser Permanente,
explained that people with IBS are extremely sensitive to normal
events, like hormonal changes in the body or stress. ``People who
have irritable bowel are more sensitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean the problem is in the head? In the past, it was
common for physicians to refer patients with IBS symptoms to a
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, patients were made to feel or told outright
they ought to get a grip on things and other unhelpful
suggestions,'' Lyon said. That doesn't mean relaxation and
visualization techniques can't help someone with IBS manage their
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in your head, it's in your gut,'' said Edward
Blanchard, a psychologist and director of the Center for Stress and
Anxiety Disorders at the University at Albany. ``I think there's a
connection between the head and the gut.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the premise of a study that Blanchard plans to undertake
in January looking at what sort of meditation strategies may be
helpful for people with IBS. For more information, call (518)
442-4025.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Salt II, an Ohio gastroenterologist and author of
the book ``Irritable Bowel Syndrome &AMP; the Mind-Body Brain-Gut
Connection,'' is convinced there's a link between brain and bowels.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for people with IBS and their physicians is coming
up with ways to manage the symptoms. Unfortunately, there is no
cure for IBS. Fiber supplements and some prescription relaxants may
help ease symptoms, but there's no specific remedy.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Salt outlines various strategies for identifying
and treating IBS, like keeping a food diary and trying to identify
the triggers.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the 28-year-old communications specialist is learning
to manage her symptoms. She's cut out caffeine, milk, chocolate and
soda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a daily challenge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some days are especially trying. ``It's like having the stomach
flu,'' she said. ``After you go to the bathroom 10 times, you want
to shoot yourself.''

MOST ANY PC CAN BE FIXED TO DEAL WITH Y2K BUG 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As an exterminator, Alan Friedman kills insects for a
living. But there's one pest that's got him stymied.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of Houston Pest Management is now grappling with the
Year 2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   He runs his small, five-person business on four personal
computers, each one from a different manufacturer and purchased in
a different year. He's not sure he wants to shell out to have a
consultant fix his problem, so he's currently trying to fix it
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to figure out whether these machines are
Y2K-compliant, whether the software I have is going to to work,''
Friedman said. ``We are sort of lost at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman is not alone. Like millions of other small business
owners who rely on personal computers, he is just now beginning to
grapple with the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   But both small business owners and home PC users don't have the
resources to hire professionals to help them. The computer industry
is just now coming around to the fact that these folks need
information, and they need it fast.
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry experts say that, when it comes to the PC, the
Y2K bug is more of an annoyance than anything else. A personal
computer is not going to become a non-functioning block of metal,
glass and plastic on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it may report dates oddly. Programs that rely heavily
on dates, if they are not Y2K-compliant, may alter important data.
</P>
<P>
   The problems, however, should be rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent or more of PCs are capable of handling 2000 as
a date,'' said Chuck Mills, director of world-wide Y2K integration
efforts at Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. ``But some cases, it
may be manual instead of automatic. You may have to manually type
the date in, but it will accept 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Y2K bug has been a reality for personal computers
since the creation of the original IBM PC in 1981, the industry
only began working on the problem in 1996. Most computer companies
say that products purchased in 1997 and on should be considered
Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   For Compaq, it's any PC sold since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in a personal computer begins in the interaction
between two components _ the BIOS and the real-time clock.
</P>
<P>
   The BIOS (which stands for Basic Input Output System) handles
the simplest functions of the computer. It is the BIOS, for
example, that starts the process of starting operating systems such
as Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The real-time clock's function is to keep track of the time and
date. The root of the Y2K problem in a PC lies in the fact that the
year is only expressed as two digits in the real-time clock.
</P>
<P>
   When the computer is turned on, the BIOS gets the time and date
information from the clock. When software programs need to know the
date for some function, they ask the BIOS, which then supplies the
century information.
</P>
<P>
   In the earliest PCs, BIOSes didn't ``know'' about the 21st
century, expressed as 20. For these systems, the real-time clock's
turnover to the year 2000 made no sense.
</P>
<P>
   On those machines that can't handle 2000 as a year, users likely
will see Jan. 1, 1980, which is considered ``Year Zero'' for
personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem does not affect Apple Computer's Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers have come up with fixes for the BIOS problems,
and are making use of the Internet and its World Wide Web to
deliver those fixes.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Tell people to check the Web first,'' said Leslie Schelp,
director of Compaq's Year 2000 program. ``That's the fastest way
they are going to get help.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal computer users such as Friedman need all the help they
can get. His systems range from two machines he bought last year
from a cable TV shopping channel to an older, 80486-based machine.
</P>
<P>
   The experts say that even fairly old systems can be made to
recognize 2000 as a year. David Cunningham, Year 2000 project
manager for Austin-based Dell Computer Corp., said the fixes he's
made available will work on PCs that use the relatively ancient
80286-era processors.
</P>
<P>
   Software and hardware manufacturers say there are a series of
steps PC owners can take to make sure 2000 rolls around smoothly:
</P>
<P>
   _ Begin by determining whether your personal computer itself is
capable of handling 2000 as a valid year.
</P>
<P>
   Check first with the maker of your PC. Many computer makers have
posted on their Web sites Y2K-compliance information about their
products. In some cases, every machine they've ever made is listed.
</P>
<P>
   If you own an off-brand PC, or one that was home-built,
determine who made the motherboard _ the main system board in the
computer _ and contact that vendor. Many clone systems come with a
manual for the motherboard that should provide contact information.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't determine who made the motherboard, you can at
least find out the maker of the BIOS. When your PC is first turned
on, the brand and model number of the BIOS appear briefly.
</P>
<P>
   You can always try to determine on your own if your PC is
Y2K-compliant. The simplest way to is advance the system clock to
11:55 p.m. on Dec. 31, 1999, then shut down the computer. Turn it
back on 15 minutes later. If the date is shown as Jan. 1, 2000,
then the hardware is ready for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   There also are software programs that will test a PC. One of
them is available as a free download from the National Software
Testing Laboratory at www.nstl.com/html/nstly2k.html.
</P>
<P>
   Computers that won't handle 2000 don't necessarily have to be
doorstops. Some BIOSes can be upgraded to make them compliant _
manufacturers make these patches available online or through
technical support services.
</P>
<P>
   For computers that have BIOSes that can't be upgraded, there are
software drivers than be inserted into a system's config.sys file.
For example, both Dell and Compaq have posted these files on their
Web sites. These patches can be used with very old PCs _ in some
cases, they will work with computers that use the Intel 80286
processor, circa 1986.
</P>
<P>
   A generic version of the driver is available from some
commercial software publishers. Symantec's Norton 2000 includes
one, for example.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do the same kind of research on your operating system. All of
Microsoft's operating systems have some problems _ mostly minor _
with 2000 as a year.
</P>
<P>
   And that includes Windows 98, the company's newest.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has released patches for Windows 95, 98 and NT, but
MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 are considered legacy operating systems and
have not been patched. Consider upgrading to one of the newer
versions if you are still using DOS and Windows 3.1.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it's important to make sure you have the latest for
your operating system. Several fixes in the latest service pack for
Windows NT 4.0 are required to bring it into Y2K compliance, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Year 2000 Web site is at www.microsoft.com/year2000.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent versions of IBM's OS/2 operating system, Warp 3
and 4, also require available patches to be Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Most versions of Unix either are or can be made Y2K compliant,
including Linux, the increasingly popular Unix-like operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a list of your frequently used software, starting with
the ones that are most important to you.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a home-PC owner, that might include your personal
finance program, your e-mail software and any productivity titles
you use, such as a word processor or a spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   A small business owner would look at accounting and inventory
packages, spreadsheets and databases, word processors and
communications software.
</P>
<P>
   Most up-to-date software applications are Y2K-compliant. Some
companies have issued software patches to make older versions of
their titles compliant, but others require users to upgrade to the
latest version.
</P>
<P>
   Check the Web site of the software publishers in question, or
contact the companies' phone technical support. As with operating
systems, make sure you have the most recent upgrades to your
current applications.
</P>
<P>
   _ Both types of users should check the documents made with those
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Are you using two digits to indicate the year in your
spreadsheets and word processing documents? Better change those to
four digits. And if you exchanged spreadsheet information with
other businesses, alert them to your changes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's Schelp warns that, with older machines and software,
the simplest and possibly even most cost-effective solution is to
buy your way into Y2K compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do a cost-analysis,'' Schelp said. ``If you can replace that
PC for $1,500, and it will cost you twice that in time and effort,
you're better off just getting a new PC.''

   _ The computer industry has known about the Y2K problem since
the early 1980s, but only began working on the problem in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ An estimated 150 million microchips could be problematic.

</P>
<P>
   _ Apple Computer's Macintosh is immune to the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   _ To determine if your computer is Y2K compliant, set your
system clock to 11:55 p.m., Dec. 31, 1999. Turn it off and then
back on 15 minutes later. If the date is shown as Jan. 1, 2000,
your system is Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some estimate the Y2K problem will generate $100 billion in
litigation costs alone.
</P>
<P>
   _ As of Nov. 13, 61 percent of the federal government's computer
systems deemed ``mission critical'' had been repaired and tested.
</P>
<P>
   _ Small businesses may be the hardest hit by the Y2K problem.
About 330,000 small businesses may have to close until a technician
is available to solve the problems, and 370,000 others could be
incapacitated.

BUG OF THE CENTURY PUTS BITE ON WALLETS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   History is full of dramatic technology screw-ups, ranging from
building the Tower of Pisa on sodden soil in Italy to the optical
flaw that made the Hubble Space Telescope a myopic wonder.
</P>
<P>
   But few are on as grand a scale as the so-called millennium bug,
in which many computers of all types are unable to understand that
the ``00'' coming after ``99'' in the year field represents the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to a civilization largely run on computers at
the stroke of midnight Jan. 1, 2000, is anyone's guess _ and
everyone's guessing something different.
</P>
<P>
   Extremists believe we'll be confronted with the end of modern
society as we know it. Voices of reason say there will be some
problems here and there, but nothing widespread and major. Those
with their heads in the sand say it's a big fat hoax cooked up by
greedy, unscrupulous computer consultants.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one thing everyone agrees on. As 1999 begins, the
world's attention will sharply focus on trying to fix the Y2K
problem. So will the world's resources.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, businesses and individuals will spend billions,
maybe trillions, of dollars to fix what is simply a bone-headed,
preventable mistake. That's money that could have gone into
something really useful, other than re-employing the old COBOL
programmers who are being brought in to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   This should not have happened. But it did, and now someone has
to pay for it. That will be you and me.
</P>
<P>
   We'll pay for it in higher taxes, as governments spend cash they
likely don't have to make sure crucial services remain available.
</P>
<P>
   We'll pay for it through increased costs of goods and services
as companies hike prices to make up for Y2K-related expenses.
</P>
<P>
   We know who gets the bill. Who gets the blame?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the programmers trying to scrimp on system resources, or
merely out of laziness, who chose to designate the year with only
two digits?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the managers of those programmers, who didn't foresee that
the software and hardware they were building would be used far
enough into the future to pose a hazard?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the heads of government agencies and captains of industry
who, trying to save a buck, kept ancient computers in place long
after they should have been retired?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that last note doesn't explain why, even as late as
1997, some computers and software were being sold that still could
not handle 2000 as a year.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, sorry. Better make that 1998, because Windows 98 and
Windows NT 4.0 have Y2K problems, too. They've been fixed with
patches, but the notion that any mainstream software introduced 18
months before the dawn of 2000 is not Y2K-compliant is disturbing,
at least. Bill Gates should be ashamed of himself.
</P>
<P>
   I think the blame lies with all involved. Programmers should
have known better. Their managers should have insisted that the
software and hardware be engineered to handle four-digit year
designations.
</P>
<P>
   And bureaucrats and corporate titans should have heeded the
first rule of both evolution and technology: Upgrade or die.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of attention has been paid to those on the fringe who are
panicking over the Y2K bug. The coming of a new millennium has
always attracted the attention of the less rational among us who
believe that a simple change in the calendar means the end of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug has given the fringies more fodder. The worst-case
Y2K scenario has embedded processors failing in airplanes and
causing jetliners to fall out of the skies; banks losing all
electronic evidence of customers' assets; computer-controlled power
plants failing; food and consumer-good distribution systems being
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this, some people are stocking up on a year's worth of
food; buying property high in the mountains; and brushing up on
their marksmanship so they can pick off marauding hordes of
looters.
</P>
<P>
   There's concern that Y2K hysteria may cause a run on banks late
in 1999, as people become more nervous about having access to their
funds. In fact, the federal mints will be printing more currency to
handle such an occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that the Y2K bug is likely to cause minor
annoyances in this country. Banks are doing very well when it comes
to fixing their Y2K problems. The utility companies are
successfully replacing embedded controllers that may cause
problems. And airplanes that haven't been fixed yet don't have to
take off.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's not the end of the world _ literally or
figuratively. The Y2K bug is simply a mistake that we should not
let happen again.

DOWNLOADING FILES IS RATHER EASY, BUT TAKE NOTE WHERE THEY'RE
SAVED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently bought a new computer. The operating system is
Windows 98. I set it up yesterday and it's just great. I wanted to
download Winamp so I could play MP3 music on my computer. The only
problem is I don't know how to download things. Could you tell me
how to go about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Downloading is simple. There's just one tricky part if you
are a novice computer user, and that's knowing where you saved the
file.
</P>
<P>
   Before you do anything, open up My Computer, open on your C:
drive and create a new folder there called download. (Right-click
in an empty space in the C folder, choose New, then Folder, then
name it Download.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, use your browser to download a file you want. Find the link
on a Web page for the file, click on it, and a Save As box will
appear. (If you use Internet Explorer instead of Netscape
Communicator/Navigator, you may get an extra dialogue box asking if
you want to open or save it to disk _ always choose Save, in this
case.)
</P>
<P>
   You'll get the Save As box and at the top will be the name of
the folder in a little window, with an arrow next to it. Click on
the arrow and you'll be able to scroll through the various parts of
your computer. Find C:, click on it, then find the Download folder,
and double-click on that.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the file should already be in the Save as: field, so
click Save or OK, whatever is there. It will start saving. When
completed, the download window will go away.
</P>
<P>
   Now, go back to the download folder and find the file. If it's
an executable (with an .EXE extension), you'll just launch it like
any other program and it will start its install routine.
</P>
<P>
   It may, however, be a Zip file (.ZIP extension), which is a
compressed collection of the files used by the program. You'll need
to get a copy of an unzipping utility, like Winzip at
www.winzip.com. Of course, you'll have to download it ... but
Winzip comes as an EXE file. Run Winzip, then use it as a program
to open the other file you downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Within my 730-megabyte hard drive, 137 hidden files take up
about 19 MB of space. The main culprit is a file, W95UNDO.DAT, that
uses about 10 MB alone. What role does W95UNDO.DAT play in Windows
95's life? Will Windows 95 live if this file is deleted?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you have W95UNDO.DAT on your hard drive, then you upgraded
that system from Windows 3.1. That file is a compressed archive of
the Windows 3.1 files necessary to restore your system back to its
original, pre-Windows 95 state.
</P>
<P>
   You can delete it, but the safest way to do so is not by simply
nuking the file. Instead, look in the Add/Remove Programs module in
the Control Panel. You should see an item called ``Old Windows 3.x
and MS-DOS system files'' in the list of removable files. Choose it
and click Remove.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to other hidden files on your system _ don't remove
them if you are not absolutely certain what they are. For example,
one very large file in your Windows folder, with an extension of
SWP, is your Windows 95 swap file _ your system's virtual memory.
If you remove it, you'll be in a world of pain.
</P>
<P>
   You might be able to find out more about some files at the
Microsoft Knowledge Base at support.microsoft.com.
</P>
<P>
   I just got a new portable computer. I travel a lot, and am very
nervous about letting security guards run this laptop through the
X-ray machine. I have been told it's safe, but is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it's safe. An airport X-ray machine does not put out a
strong enough magnetic field to damage what's on your notebook
computer's hard disk. If you remain nervous about it, and if your
portable has a removable hard drive, pack that away separately in
luggage that you check.

SMALL BUSINESSES MAY BE AMONG MOST VULNERABLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By REBECCA MOWBRAY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The most painful sting of the millennium bug may be
felt at small businesses, where those who own and operate their own
companies rely heavily on computers but can't afford to have
someone fix the problem for them.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Wells Fargo Bank study released in April, 82
percent of small businesses risk Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   About 330,000 of these may be forced to close until a technician
is available to solve the problems, and 370,000 others could be
incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case has not yet been made to a large number of small
business owners that it is worth it to devote resources to find out
if you have a problem,'' said study author William Denny, senior
researcher at the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Denny will release a follow-up analysis in January to see if small
businesses have begun to consider Y2K an urgent problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem is real, and there is no magic patch to fix it.
The insurance industry warns that upgrading computers is a routine
cost of doing business, and policies won't cover Y2K disasters that
strike companies that ignored warnings, said Robert Hartwig, chief
economist at the Insurance Information Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is companies can do most of their Y2K
inventories themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In hunting for the millennium bug, companies can evaluate their
business operations and make them more productive.
</P>
<P>
   By making Y2K preparations, Christopher Talley, general manager
of the Fleishman-Hillard communications firm in Houston, said that
companies generate a marketing opportunity. A company should
advertise its streamlined, Y2K-ready operation as the one to
deliver the goods on Jan. 1, 2000, when competitors can't.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration advises small businesses to
start now. Companies should allow time to assess their situations
so they don't have to make important decisions about operational
equipment under duress.
</P>
<P>
   Most small businesses can fix their Year 2000 problems for less
than $1,000, SBA spokesman D.J. Caulfield said.
</P>
<P>
   But as the clock ticks, repairs may get more expensive because
technicians will be in short supply. If a business is forced to
close because of Y2K failures, when it can reopen may depend on how
soon a technician is available, Denny said.
</P>
<P>
   A company's Y2K investigations shouldn't end with computers.
Machinery and electronic devices such as security systems or cash
registers also may have Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   The level of Y2K risk at a business depends on how heavily the
company relies on computers and automated systems. Older or
custom-designed systems are the most likely to cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   Industry associations are a good source of information about
solving Y2K problems in software or machinery special to the field,
the SBA said, and may be able to recommend technicians who have
already found the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Some fixes may be tax deductible. The Internal Revenue Service
is allowing businesses to deduct the full cost of repairing or
converting existing software with a Y2K problem in a single year.
However, if that fix also makes non-Y2K improvements to the system,
the deduction must be spread across the usual three years.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA recommends a broad assessment of possible candidates for
Y2K problems because electronic components interface with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the major steps of the process it advocates:
</P>
<P>
   _ Awareness: Educate everyone in the company about Y2K issues
and keep them informed about progress.
</P>
<P>
   _ Organization: Create a team of people to lead the company's
Y2K efforts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inventory: Make a list of all hardware, software and anything
else that may have a chip with a date function. Record the vendor,
model and product identification numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Priorities: Label each piece of hardware critical, somewhat
critical, or not critical to the functioning of your business.
Start with the items that are most essential to the core business.
</P>
<P>
   _ Assessment: Determine if the most critical items are
date-sensitive and if they will fail when the century changes.
Companies may need to work with the vendor on specialized systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Action: Repair, replace or retire each system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Testing: Test whether each repaired or replaced system works
properly when interfacing with other devices in the work
environment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Contingency: In case something goes wrong on Jan. 1, 2000,
companies should make contingency plans for what they will do.
Companies may want to buy a generator or have the extra supplies on
hand that are most critical to their operations. Have some plan of
what to do and what to say to customers if in case the company's
Y2K efforts aren't foolproof.

PROBLEM ALREADY CREATING VIRTUAL NEW WAVE OF OF LITIGATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By REBECCA MOWBRAY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As Year 2000 problems surface, a wave of litigation is
expected to flood the courts and keep lawyers swimming for years.
</P>
<P>
   But with careful representation of Y2K preparations, companies
can stay out of court.
</P>
<P>
   One year before the millennium bug reveals its strength, 39 Y2K
lawsuits already have been filed, according to the Information
Technology Association of America, which maintains a database.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawsuits have been directed at software vendors who haven't
offered solutions for Y2K glitches, but the first lawsuit, filed in
August 1997, was brought against a company whose cash registers
crashed whenever they processed a credit card with a ``00''
expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   After Jan. 1, 2000, lawyers say a wide range of corporate
defendants will face breach of contract, fraud, product liability,
personal injury and shareholder suits for products or operations
that failed because of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, law firms in Houston and across the nation are
building Y2K practice groups. Vinson &AMP; Elkins has a Y2K practice
group of 40 to 50 lawyers. The Y2K team at Bracewell &AMP; Patterson
has been working with banks for several years on Y2K issues. Baker
&AMP; Botts' Y2K network has been advising corporate clients on
disclosure issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last six months, it seems like everybody and their
brother has formed a Y2K practice group,'' said Vito Peraino,
chairman of a 12-lawyer practice group at the California firm
Hancock, Rothert &AMP; Bunshoft, which maintains a Web site tracking
Y2K legal filings.
</P>
<P>
   After the turn of the century, the millennium bug will cost $497
billion in litigation, damages and recovery damages, said Capers
Jones, author of ``The Year 2000 Software Problem'' and chief
scientist at Massachusetts consulting firm Software Productivity
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Jones estimates that $100 billion of that total will be straight
litigation costs, but that proportion may rise because companies
don't appear to be spending enough now to prevent problems later.
</P>
<P>
   Moves are afoot to minimize legal entanglements. In October,
President Clinton signed the Year 2000 Information and Readiness
Disclosure Act, which said that companies can't be sued for
disclosures about their Y2K readiness.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawyers and legislators say Y2K litigation reform
didn't go far enough. Vinson &AMP; Elkins advises clients to sign
confidentiality agreements with each other before disclosing their
Y2K preparedness in case the law doesn't provide enough protection,
partner Clark Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, state senators Robert Duncan and Troy Fraser and Rep.
Brian McCall hope to introduce legislation before the Legislature
convenes Jan. 12. The Year 2000 Working Group bill would create a
window in which the defendant must try to solve the problem before
the claimant can sue, encourage sellers to make repairs and notify
buyers of upgrades, narrow the statute of limitations on claims,
limit reliance on representations of Y2K compliance, and limit
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Others see mediation and arbitration as the answer. The CPR
Institute for Dispute Resolution in New York has assembled a panel
of 77 lawyers to mediate in Y2K disputes. Nineteen global companies
and their subsidiaries, including Bank of America, General Mills
and Sony Electronics, have pledged to submit to alternative dispute
resolution to solve Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K problems are just that: problems to be solved. The
I-win-you-lose of the courts don't lend themselves to
problem-solving,'' said James F. Henry, president of CPR Institute
for Dispute Resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Making Y2K preparations is the best defense against ending up in
court, Y2K lawyers say. A company can buck a negligence charge by
making reasonable preparations to solve the problem and adhering to
standard industry practices for confronting Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Zembek, an attorney with Fulbright &AMP; Jaworski, offered
this advice to participants in a Y2K seminar sponsored by the Texas
Manufacturing Assistance Center in November:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Y2K committee: A company should have a committee to
spearhead Y2K preparation efforts. The committee must be empowered
to take steps to solve the problem, have the support of senior
management, and have the time and financial resources to tackle the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Documentation: The Y2K committee should have a clear and
consistent plan about how it plans to document the company's Y2K
efforts. A company should carefully document the steps it has taken
to solve the problem, but keep e-mails calling the boss a blockhead
for not minding the committee's recommendations out of the file.
Juries don't look kindly upon shredding, deleting or omitting
records, so companies should be consistent and complete.
</P>
<P>
   _ Attorney-client privilege: A company may want to invite its
corporate counsel to some of the Y2K planning meetings if it wants
to invoke attorney-client privilege over some of its Y2K
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Representation: No one will know for sure if their Y2K efforts
solved the problem until Jan. 1, 2000, so a company should not
claim that it is ``Y2K compliant.'' A company should come up with
its own definition about what it means to be Y2K ready, and then
fill it. Look up technology company Web sites for ideas about
wording the definition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Communication: The Y2K committee should update employees with
a simple, clear message about what the company is doing. When a
customer asks a salesperson about what the company is doing about
the Y2K problem, the salesperson should know what to say.

   ISRAEL-CULT _ MEVASSARET ZION _ Other than the fact that they
were Americans and that their children were not in school, their
Israeli neighbors did not find anything unusual about the family
that moved into this Jerusalem suburb a few months ago. They were
friendly, asked a lot of questions about Israeli current events and
did the usual sightseeing. But, Israeli police raided this villa
and another in a nearby town this weekend, arresting eight adults
and four children believed to be in a Denver-based Christian
millennium cult that planned to die in suicidal attacks at the end
of this year. Police said Monday that three members of the group
would be held while the rest are deported to the United States.

MANY PEOPLE QUIETLY PREPARING FOR POSSIBLE YEAR 2000 DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a cluttered attic corner in his Poestenkill,
N.Y., home, 36-year-old Doug Roseberger is quietly preparing for
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a year since the private school teacher and his wife
Susan first heard about the computer problems that could ensue at
12:01 a.m. Jan. 1, 2000. Since then, he's learned all he could
about Year 2000, or Y2K, threats: power outages, food shortages, a
major recession or, depending on whose web site you read, the
entire collapse of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Roseberger wants to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, he's been attending monthly meetings of the
Year 2000 Interest Group in Albany. Meanwhile, in his attic, he's
cached enough supplies to sustain his family, friends and neighbors
for weeks: cans of soup, cases of toilet paper, pasta, sauces,
peanut butter. Enough to stock a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Roseberger and his wife are hoping for the best. And preparing
for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to put your faith in a system that can crash in
seconds,'' Roseberger said. ``I've chosen to take it seriously.''
In the Capital Region, dozens are taking similar steps. Enough are
worried about Y2K that they have formed a monthly club to help
prepare for next year.
</P>
<P>
   But while some extremists say Y2K will cause The End Of The
World As We Know it, often shortened to EOTWAWKI, most other
experts are taking a much calmer approach. Learn what you can about
how Y2K can affect you, they advise. If you're a business, do what
you need to do to get your computers compliant.
</P>
<P>
   And while you're at it, you might want to get printouts of all
your financial records before the year 2000 and save up two weeks
worth of food. Just in case.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to believe that a calendar flipping from Dec. 31,
1999 to Jan. 1, 2000 could have such devastating effects. On the
other hand, it's even harder to shrug off the impact of this
simple, but extremely expensive, problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 ``bug,'' for those few who haven't heard, is not a
computer virus per se. It is a programming problem that seems to
exist in most of the world's major computer systems. When mainframe
computers were developed decades ago, programmers found they could
save limited memory space by lopping off the first two numbers of a
given year: the date 12.16.1974, for instance became simply
12.26.74.
</P>
<P>
   But when 1999 rolls over to 2000, that space-saving technique
will cause a major problem. Computers will read the ``00'' that
refers to 2000 as ``1900.'' Suddenly, in the mind of the mainframe,
someone who is 34 years old becomes negative 66 years old. And as
companies around the country tested their equipment for Y2K
``compliance,'' they found the change of dates can cause computers
to crash and equipment to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The problem extends to all computer users, from nuclear power
plants and the Department of Defense to corner banks and your own
PC.
</P>
<P>
   After ignoring the problem for years, businesses are suddenly
sparing no expense to solve it _ which often involves hours and
hours of searching through dense program lines for offending codes.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers from the 1960s (some of whom knew this was going to
happen decades ago) have been lured from retirement with pay as
high as $75 per hour or more, plus bonuses. Others are being hired
from countries like Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
   The costs are mind-boggling. Chevron, the petrolium giant,
expects to pay between $200 million and $300 million to achieve
compliance. International Paper, $135 million. Merrill Lynch, as
much as $400 million. And the federal government? A whopping $4.6
billion, triple the original estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the final cost of solving the Y2K bug around the
world could run from several hundred billion dollars to as much as
$3.6 trillion (according to the book The Year 2000 Problem, by
Capers Jones, a software expert).
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Y2K has been featured in such prominent
places as 60 Minutes, CNN, the front page of the Sunday New York
Times, a feature story in Vanity Fair and the comic Ziggy.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of Y2K has convinced the British government to tell
its citizens to stock up a two-week supply of food. And Canada
recently announced ``Operation Abacus,'' which allows for the
deployment of as many as 32,000 troops to deal with Y2K's
worst-case scenario.
</P>
<P>
   It's the worst-case scenerio that scares people like Roseberger.
It's the realization that so much in the world operates on a
delicate web of interrelated electronics. The thought that
everything, from the stock market to banking, planting crops to
landing airplanes, could be brought to a screeching halt if enough
computers fail.
</P>
<P>
   To some, it's so ironic it's almost funny. After a century of
fantastic technological achievements, the world will host history's
greatest New Year's party _ and then could wake to this planet's
first scheduled disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K Interest Group in Albany meets monthly in a quiet corner
room at the University of Albany Campus Center. The group, which
has been getting together for more than a year, is a well-dressed,
mostly-gray-haired bunch. Many are computer programmers, but the
group also counts a futurist, a teacher and a business manager
among its three dozen members.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Noticably absent are the survivalists who the group's president,
Dick Mills, calls the ``doom and gloom'' types.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really into the inflammatory rhetoric that they want
to hear,'' he said. ``So they don't come back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the group watched a presentation by John Gibb of the
New York State Emergency Management Office about emergency planning
(``Why wait?'' the overhead transparencies said. ``Get ready for
next week.'').
</P>
<P>
   Gibb's point was to teach the group that disasters can happen
anytime. He said families should prepare by keeping two weeks worth
of food in the house and have an emergency heating source and other
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope next year we can look back and say, `What a colossal
waste of time that was,''' Gibb said. ``But why wait? Individuals,
communities, businesses need to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy for Gibb to finish his speech. Several people
kept asking questions he couldn't answer, demanding to know, for
instance, what the state was doing to make sure cities and towns
were Y2K compliant (answer: they are providing information and Y2K
audits, but have little authority to demand readiness).
</P>
<P>
   Doug Roseberger, the schoolteacher from Poestenkill, also
attended the meeting. A few nights later, sitting with his wife
near a wood-burning stove in his country home, he recalled how he
first heard of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   It was fall of 1997, and a pastor handed Roseberger a pamphlet
about Y2K. He had a hard time believing what he read. ``It seemed
like a cruel joke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took Roseberger a few days of denial, and then some research,
to discover that there were many people who were taking this cruel
joke very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Roseberger keeps a large box filled with Y2K information
from the Internet. ``Power,'' says one folder. ``Military.''
``Power and gas.'' ``Y2K and the Church.'' And, in a slim folder,
``Rosy Scenarios,'' which is filled with diatribes from groups like
the John Birch Society, which believes the Y2K scare is nothing but
hype.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, Roseberger and his wife Susan have been
busy preparing for what, 12 months from now, could be a very rude
New Year.
</P>
<P>
   They already have enough food and other supplies to feed a large
family for a few weeks, but they plan to add much more to the
stock. They also plan to install a hand pump in their backyard well
to ensure access to fresh water and, in case things are really bad,
plans to plant a garden this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Roseberger been warning everyone he knows about
the threat of Y2K. It's an uphill process. Few people even glanced
at the Y2K literature he tried to give away. And his previous boss
told Roseberger he would lose his job if he continued to tell his
co-workers about Y2K (Roseberger later quit).
</P>
<P>
   The more he looked into it, the more worried he became. It was
so easy for San Francisco to suffer a blackout from a simple
breakdown of the electric grid. So easy for nearly all the pagers
in the country to go off-line when a satellite went down. So easy
for computer crashes to have a domino effect, taking down industry
and government pitilessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of fear at first,'' said Susan. ``It's very
overwhelming. We've prayed about it a lot, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Many are doing more than praying. A look at Albany Medical
Center shows how extensively businesses are attacking Y2K - and how
much it's costing them.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Albany Med staff have examined 8,000
machines used in the care of patients. They've also looked at
elevators, the heating system, security devices, the high-tech fire
alarms, thousands of desktop PCs, the pneumatic tube system (used
for delivering items to different departments), lighting equipment
and machines used to clean the floors.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Rounds, vice president for plant management, said the
hospital expects all non-compliant computers and machines to be
replaced by the new year, at a cost of several million dollars.
However, as a precaution, more than 100 key employees will be
celebrating New Year's Eve 1999 at the hospital, just in case their
skills are needed.Other organizations are following suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is no surprises,'' said Gary Schwartz, who is on
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Y2K team. ``It's okay for it not
to work, if you know it's not going to work.'' Smaller companies
that need their computers fixed are going to places like the
Compaq/Digital Year 2000 Expertise Center on Washington Avenue
Extension. The quiet office, where computer experts examine systems
and repair or replace any programs that won't work next year, is
one of 19 Compaq operates around the world.
</P>
<P>
   One expert is Mills, the president of the local Y2K group.
Mills, 54, has been a programmer for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very responsible,'' he said. ``I feel absolutely awful
that our profession has let this damned calamity happen to the
world. That's why I'm involved so much - conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills is also the member of the group Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility - which is currently involved in debunking
Y2K misinformation and stopping the spread of panic.
</P>
<P>
   This group does not believe that the stock market will crash,
governments will collapse and the world will fall into anarchy.
However, they do believe there is the possibility power could go
out for a few days. So Mills is installing a wood stove in his
home, and is following advice to keep two weeks worth of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems are substantial,'' he said. ``We are saying
people want to have 14 days of self-sufficiency. But don't prepare
for the end of the world.''

A STATE TOUR OF NEW AND IMPROVED TEXAS MUSEUMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turn any which way in Texas these days and you bump into another
new art museum. Or plans for another new art museum. Actually,
we're talking about $254 million in projects recently completed,
currently under construction, in development and recently proposed
_ from El Paso to Dallas, Corpus Christi to San Angelo, and a
number of points in between.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the numbers that impress: The architects
involved rank high in an international community that values art
museum commissions above all others. And some of their projects
potentially may compare with Louis Kahn's Kimbell Art Museum in
Fort Worth and Renzo Piano's Menil Collection in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There is Rafael Moneo's new building for the Museum of Fine
Arts, Houston; Tadao Ando's plans for a new Modern Art Museum of
Fort Worth; The Blanton Museum at the University of Texas in
Austin, which will be designed by Herzog &AMP; de Meuron; and Philip
Johnson's new wing for the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Too, Texas boasts prime examples of adaptive reuse of buildings
for visual art exhibition _ two of which opened last year, one in
El Paso, another in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   So, herewith, a survey of new Texas art museum architecture:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON MUSEUM OF ART
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1952
</P>
<P>
   Director: Joan Davidow
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Neil Denari, Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Construction cost: $2.5 million
</P>
<P>
   The project: Museum officials are conducting a feasibility study
of Denari's plan to renovate and expand the 45-year-old former J.C.
Penney department store that is the museum's home in downtown
Arlington _ with the project anchoring general plans for downtown
revitalization. Blending classical and techo-modern styles, the
plan expands gallery space, from 8,000 to 10,000 square feet. But
more than that, it would transform the quality of space and its
relationship to its environs. A concurrent campaign would raise $2
million in operating endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Information: 275-4600
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN MUSEUM OF ART
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1943
</P>
<P>
   Director: Elizabeth Ferrer
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Richard Gluckman, New York
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: Estimated at $35 million
</P>
<P>
   The project: Gluckman will complete his design this year for the
new facility _ his first free-standing museum _ with groundbreaking
scheduled for 2000 and dedication hoped for in 2002. Featuring
25,000 square feet of gallery space, the facility will occupy a
full city block in downtown, fulfilling patrons' longtime dream of
a centrally located museum. The museum will maintain its longtime
site at Laguna Gloria, the historic suburban estate that it shares
with the Texas Fine Arts Association.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JACK S. BLANTON MUSEUM OF ART, AUSTIN
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1963
</P>
<P>
   Director: Jesse Otto Hite
</P>
<P>
   Architects: Herzog &AMP; de Meuron, Basel, Switzerland
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: $30 million
</P>
<P>
   The project: Scheduled to open in late 2002, the building will
serve as a gateway to the University of Texas campus. Historically,
the Blanton (formerly the Huntington Gallery) was divided between
the school's art building and the ground floor of the Ransom
Humanities Research Center. Team spokesman Jacques Herzog envisions
tiled canopies, watercourses and filtered light as responses to the
area's intense heat. He also is pondering a courtyard for
pedestrian flow between campus and Austin proper.

</P>
<P>
   TEXAS FINE ARTS ASSOCIATION, AUSTIN
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1911
</P>
<P>
   Director: Sue Graze
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Gary Cunningham, Dallas
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: $1.1 million
</P>
<P>
   Building: Cunningham adapted a 2-story commercial building in
downtown Austin; built in the 1850s, it may be the oldest brick
building in the city. Planned in two stages, with only stage one
completed, the building (in which Cunningham deconstructs the
present and reveals much of the past) ultimately will feature about
10,000 square feet of exhibition space.

<P>
   ART MUSEUM OF SOUTH TEXAS, CORPUS CHRISTI
</P>
<P>
   Founded: Early 1940s
</P>
<P>
   Director: William G. Otton
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Ricardo Legorreta, Mexico City
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: $4 million
</P>
<P>
   The project: Legorreta has been commissioned to design a new
education building near Philip Johnson's 1972 museum, which is on
the Corpus Christi ship channel and features 15,000 square feet of
exhibition space. Specific plans have not been presented, but the
new structure needs to address Johnson's sculptural,
poured-in-place concrete building, whose window walls open the
museum to sky and water.

   MEADOWS MUSEUM, DALLAS
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1962
</P>
<P>
   Director: John Lunsford
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Hammond Beebe and Babka, Chicago
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: $22 million
</P>
<P>
   The project: Now housed in residential-style rooms in the
Meadows School of the Arts at Southern Methodist University, the
new Meadows will occupy a so-called collegiate Georgian facility
that is a safe bet to blend into SMU's campus. Scheduled to open in
early 2001, the desperately needed new building will feature about
14,000 square feet of exhibition space that will permit exhibition
of the museum's splendid permanent collection of Hispanic art, in
addition to borrowed shows.

   EL PASO MUSEUM OF ART
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1930
</P>
<P>
   Director: Becky Duval Reese
</P>
<P>
   Architect: BKM Architects, El Paso
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: $8 million
</P>
<P>
   Building: Constructed on the foundations of a downtown bus
terminal, the new home of the El Paso Museum of Art features 30,000
square feet of gallery space. It will allow the museum to exhibit
its surprisingly rich permanent collection of European Old Masters
and contemporary regional works, as well as present temporary
shows.

   MODERN ART MUSEUM OF FORT WORTH
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1892
</P>
<P>
   Director: Marla Price
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Tadao Ando, Osaka, Japan
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: $60 million (including $10 million for
site)
</P>
<P>
   Building: Ando's building is scheduled to open in 2002,
replacing the museum's longtime home designed by Herbert Bayer,
with an addition by O'Neil Ford. A 2-story pavilion of poured
concrete encased in glass, it will feature about 50,000 square feet
of gallery space, with special areas for sculpture, oversize
paintings and works on paper.

   AMON CARTER MUSEUM, FORT WORTH
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1961
</P>
<P>
   Director: Patrick Stewart
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Philip Johnson, New York
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: Estimated $25.5 million
</P>
<P>
   The project: Philip Johnson's original memorial to Amon G.
Carter opened in 1961; two later additions will be demolished for
the architect's new wing, scheduled to open in the early 21st
century. Clad in granite and limestone, it will feature about
27,000 square feet of gallery space. Yet another Texas project for
Johnson, it has prompted the architect to say he should have based
himself here rather than in New York.

   MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS, HOUSTON
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1900
</P>
<P>
   Director: Peter Marzio
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Rafael Moneo, Madrid
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: $57 million
</P>
<P>
   The project: The MFAH occupies a number of buildings, spread
over two campuses. Its decorative arts collections and gardens are
in River Oaks, while its fine arts and education operations live in
Houston's Montrose neighborhood _ the site of Moneo's new Beck
wing, with its 85,400 square feet of gallery space. Boxy and
masculine, the Beck will be linked by a James Turrell-designed
tunnel to the museum's main building, which comprises William Ward
Watkins' 1924 beaux-arts structure and Mies van der Rohe's soaring
pavilion, completed in 1974. Then there's the museum's glass-brick
Glassell School, designed by Eugene Aubrey; the children's
education building, designed by Carlos Jimenez; and Isamu Noguchi's
Cullen Sculpture Garden.

   Director: Howard Taylor
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Malcolm Holzman of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer, New York
and Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: $6 million
</P>
<P>
   The project: Scheduled to open in 1999, Holzman's new $6 million
building features 3,500 square feet of gallery space, as well as a
ceramics studio and kiln yard that serves the museum's focus as a
major center for contemporary ceramics. The building is covered by
a copper saddleback roof and has facades of regional limestone.

   THE ART CENTER, WACO
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1972
</P>
<P>
   Director: Joe Kagle
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Short list of contenders for the commission is
composed of Philip Johnson and Alan Ritchie of New York; William
McDounough of Charlottesville, N.C.; and Rich Sundberg of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: About $2.5 million
</P>
<P>
   Building: The Art Center plans a new 20,000-square-foot
exhibition space to be constructed near its facility in a historic
former residence. (That will be converted to a children's art
museum). The Art Center also has a number of off-site exhibition
spaces, with their policy of openness symbolized by an immense door
sculpture by Waco native Robert Wilson.

 &HT;    LOCAL TV NEWS: GOOD OR BAD PAYS OFF IN RATINGS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories.

   WASHINGTON _ Local newscasts can win ratings wars by being
either tony or trashy in their coverage but not by being
wishy-washy, a national media study showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report ranked TV newscasts at 61 stations in 20 cities and
discovered a complex correlation between quality news programming
and viewership. The stations with rising ratings either featured
more in-depth, so-called serious reporting or they specialized in
``tabloid'' news and were ranked lowest in ``quality'' by the
study's panel of news professionals and journalism scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The stations least likely to be gaining viewers were those
ranked in the middle in terms of quality.
</P>
<P>
   The survey indicated that ``the important thing is that whatever
you do, go whole hog,'' said Carl Gottlieb, deputy director of the
Project for Excellence in Journalism, the Washington, D.C.,
institute that conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   The finding ``suggests that audiences are not schizophrenic _
they are segmenting,'' the report concluded. ``There is a group
that embraces news full of revelation, scandal and celebrity. There
is another group that prefers a more serious, information-based
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar observations can be made about newspapers, said
Gottlieb, a 23-year veteran of local TV news including stints at
Fox News and Tribune Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have The New York Times and The New York Post in New York
City'' with vastly different approaches to covering the news and
little overlap in readership, he explained. ``It's not so
surprising that the same thing occurs in TV news.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding that was deemed surprising was the rising ratings
for high quality newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that viewer preference for murder and mayhem in
local news is just another urban myth,'' said Tom Rosenstiel,
director of the project and former media critic for the Los Angeles
Times. ``There's still a market for tabloid news, but quality
sells, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There also was a debunking of the notion that viewers prefer
shorter stories. The stations with improving ratings produced more
long stories and fewer very short ones (under 20 seconds) than did
the stations with falling ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions were reached after the panel of experts analyzed
the most popular half-hour news timeslot in 20 cities ranging from
Atlanta to Wichita during a sweeps week and non-sweeps week in
March and April. In all, about 8,500 stories from 600 broadcasts
were studied.
</P>
<P>
   A ``design team'' of news professionals and academics developed
criteria for measuring ``quality'' that included the newscast
closely reflecting the community, covering a wide range of issues,
containing balanced stories, focusing on significant issues and
ideas, citing multiple sources and quoting authoritative people.
The ``quality'' scores of the newscasts were then correlated to
their Neilsen ratings trends over the three-year period from July
1995 to May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the stations with rising ratings tended to
get either an ``A'' or an ``F'' in their grade for quality. Those
least likely to be gaining viewers were in the middle _ often
hybrid newscasts featuring part tabloid, part ``serious''
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, for instance, the study's lowest ``quality'' grade _
an F-plus _ went to the CBS affiliate, WGNX, which was also the
city's only station in the study with rising ratings over the
studied period. In its comments, the study said WGNX had ``the
highest story count in Atlanta'' _ which translates to short
segments _ and ``little investigative reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   The station in Atlanta with the highest ``quality'' grade _ a D
_ was WXIA, which had flat ratings. The report said this NBC
affiliate ``covered institutions and big players in town'' and was
``heavy on unusual events.''
</P>
<P>
   The third Atlanta station studied in the survey was WSB _ with
received a grade of D-minus and had declining ratings. ``Fast-paced
shows. Lots of breaking news. Nearly a third of all stories on
routine crimes,'' was the assessment. WSB is owed by Cox
Broadcasting _ a corporate cousin to Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the dichotomy of the effect on ``quality'' on ratings
are KARE of Minneapolis/St. Paul and WABC in New York City. Both
are gaining viewers. However, KARE was given an A-plus and declared
the ``best among big city stations.'' Meanwhile, WABC received an
F-plus and was critiqued as ``heavy on crime and law stories. Lots
of scandal and sensation. Not very local.''
</P>
<P>
   Stations were studied in Atlanta; Albuquerque; Boston; Buffalo;
Burlington, Vt.; Chicago; Evansville, Ind.; Jacksonville, Fl.;
Lansing, Mi.; Los Angeles; Louisville, Ky.; Minneapolis/St. Paul;
New York; Pittsburgh; Seattle; St. Louis; Tallahassee; Tuscon;
Washington, D.C.; and Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   The stations weren't told about the study ``until after the
fact,'' said Gottlieb. ``We were not looking for cooperation'' from
the newscasts being analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts. The Project
for Excellence in Journalism is an affiliate of the Columbia
University Graduate School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Local newscasts feature a lot of ``journalism on the run.''
Almost half (46 percent) of the stories were about commonplace
events such as crimes and crashes. In stories involving
controversy, 43 percent presented only one side.
</P>
<P>
   _ Local news is not the same everywhere. While many stations do
``produce a formulaicconsultant-driven style'' of coverage, the
range of quality is wider than most critics contend.

TIME TO DISCARD THIS VENOMOUS POLITICAL BREW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our country needs healing, not vengeance; reconciliation, not
revenge. The nation is still in shock from the events of Dec. 19,
when the House voted for only the second time in history to impeach
a president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The public perception of a thoroughly partisan proceeding was
heightened by the predetermined refusal of House leaders to allow a
vote on the motion to substitute censure for impeachment. Several
Republicans have since declared that they'd have supported the
censure option. Apparently it would have passed.
</P>
<P>
   All this has set off widespread lamentation about what has
happened to open-mindedness, bipartisan cooperation, mutual respect
and due process in Congress. Suddenly, commentators everywhere are
decrying the ``slash-and-burn'' politics of ``mutually assured
destruction.'' It's as though the vicious polarization that divides
the parties into hostile camps, each committed to taking no
prisoners, had sprung full blown just this year.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a deadly virus of calculated character assassination
has been gradually infesting our body politic for a decade or more.
A cult of personal disparagement has littered the national
landscape with the wreckage of broken careers and ruined
reputations. Its victims include the guilty and the innocent, their
good names assaulted in campaign ads and deliberate news leaks and
sometimes by overzealous prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The growing list of political assault victims includes former
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy and former HUD Secretary Henry
Cisneros, forced to cut short their promising political careers
over charges involving things as petty as having accepted tickets
to a football game and as personal as making a generous settlement
from one's own money with a former paramour.
</P>
<P>
   Espy, although legally exonerated by unanimous jury verdict,
suffered loss of his job, damaging personal publicity and legal
bills reportedly near a million dollars. On being acquitted, Espy
recalled former Labor Secretary Ray Donovan, who in a similar
situation asked: ``Where do I go now to get back my reputation?''
</P>
<P>
   Nor have Republicans been left unscathed. The epidemic of
negativism, once unloosed, finds few mortals immune to injury.
Ironically, two of those who sat in judgment on President Clinton's
peccadilloes _ Reps. Dan Burton and Henry Hyde _ were themselves
subjected to public disclosure of embarrassing events in their
personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Hate begets hate. Vengeance breeds vengefulness. It is of these
that history's most destructive deeds are made.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always thus at the top levels of American political
life. Once the personal honor of a president was precious even to
the leaders of his domestic political opposition, and jealously
protected by them. Other presidents have committed marital
infidelities. Others have obfuscated, fudged, misrepresented facts
_ lied, if you will. Not even their harshest critics clamored for
their impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   For most of my 35 years in Congress there was a bond of
fellowship and mutual honor between leaders of rival parties. Sam
Rayburn never would tolerate a disparaging remark about Republican
leader Joe Martin. Everett Dirksen and Lyndon B. Johnson
collaborated.
</P>
<P>
   John Rhodes of Arizona was the House minority leader when I
became majority leader. Occasionally I accompanied him to plead his
case to President Jimmy Carter in matters of importance to Rhodes'
state. When he ran for governor of Arizona, I contributed to his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual respect is the essential oil that lubricates the
machinery of a democratic society. It is what separates us from the
world's tinpot dictatorships in which leaders of the vanquished
party routinely end up in prison. It's what makes a party-line
impeachment alarming.
</P>
<P>
   When I called Speaker-designate Bob Livingston in early December
to congratulate him on his selection by the Republican conference,
Livingston told me that he wanted to try to heal the ugly wounds of
dislike, distrust and accusation that so angrily divide his party
from mine in the House these days.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure he meant it. It's a pity he was denied that chance by
the same slobbering greed for personal scandal that some members of
his party have exploited in their unrelenting drive to destroy
Clinton's presidency. It is a vastly different House than the one I
knew.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago I stood where Speaker-designate Dennis Hastert
stands today, poised to take the oath as speaker. Then, as now, the
nation was numbed by a major scandal. The illegal Iran-contra
scheme had violated at least six laws. Some administration
spokesmen had lied to Congress. Evidence was being hastily shredded
in a feverish cover-up attempt. This was the most alarming
revelation since Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   A volcanic lava of hot anger began boiling inside Congress. Some
Democrats growled that these were ``impeachable'' offenses. Several
committees were clamoring to open hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The public interest, as I saw it, would not be served by
whipping a media frenzy into a constitutional crisis. The last
thing our country needed, I believed, was an impeachment outcry
impugning the president's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan, deeply shaken, insisted that he'd neither
condoned nor known of the illegal covert deeds. Although Reagan and
I disagreed on policy, I wanted to believe him and chose to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, then Senate majority leader, agreed with me
that even to entertain discussion of impeachment would be a grave
national disservice. We appointed one joint high-level
investigating committee composed of committee chairmen, with equal
numbers of Democrats and Republicans; we established a reasonable
time limitation for its proceedings; and we told our appointees
that we wanted no talk of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   May the Senate be mindful of its capacity for good or lasting
harm. And may it recall the ancient prayer of Aristophanes. Walking
among the ruins of the Greek temples destroyed by the fratricidal
Peloponnesian wars, he begged: ``From the murmur and subtlety of
suspicion with which we vex one another, give us rest. Make a new
beginning ... and with some finer essence of forbearance temper our
minds.'' To this, amen.

A STATE TOUR OF NEW AND IMPROVED TEXAS MUSEUMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turn any which way in Texas these days and you bump into another
new art museum. Or plans for another new art museum. Actually,
we're talking about $254 million in projects recently completed,
currently under construction, in development and recently proposed
_ from El Paso to Dallas, Corpus Christi to San Angelo, and a
number of points in between.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the numbers that impress: The architects
involved rank high in an international community that values art
museum commissions above all others. And some of their projects
potentially may compare with Louis Kahn's Kimbell Art Museum in
Fort Worth and Renzo Piano's Menil Collection in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There is Rafael Moneo's new building for the Museum of Fine
Arts, Houston; Tadao Ando's plans for a new Modern Art Museum of
Fort Worth; The Blanton Museum at the University of Texas in
Austin, which will be designed by Herzog &AMP; de Meuron; and Philip
Johnson's new wing for the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Too, Texas boasts prime examples of adaptive reuse of buildings
for visual art exhibition _ two of which opened last year, one in
El Paso, another in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   So, herewith, a survey of new Texas art museum architecture:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON MUSEUM OF ART
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1952
</P>
<P>
   Director: Joan Davidow
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Neil Denari, Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Construction cost: $2.5 million
</P>
<P>
   The project: Museum officials are conducting a feasibility study
of Denari's plan to renovate and expand the 45-year-old former J.C.
Penney department store that is the museum's home in downtown
Arlington _ with the project anchoring general plans for downtown
revitalization. Blending classical and techo-modern styles, the
plan expands gallery space, from 8,000 to 10,000 square feet. But
more than that, it would transform the quality of space and its
relationship to its environs. A concurrent campaign would raise $2
million in operating endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Information: 275-4600
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN MUSEUM OF ART
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1943
</P>
<P>
   Director: Elizabeth Ferrer
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Richard Gluckman, New York
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: Estimated at $35 million
</P>
<P>
   The project: Gluckman will complete his design this year for the
new facility _ his first free-standing museum _ with groundbreaking
scheduled for 2000 and dedication hoped for in 2002. Featuring
25,000 square feet of gallery space, the facility will occupy a
full city block in downtown, fulfilling patrons' longtime dream of
a centrally located museum. The museum will maintain its longtime
site at Laguna Gloria, the historic suburban estate that it shares
with the Texas Fine Arts Association.

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JACK S. BLANTON MUSEUM OF ART, AUSTIN
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1963
</P>
<P>
   Director: Jesse Otto Hite
</P>
<P>
   Architects: Herzog &AMP; de Meuron, Basel, Switzerland
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: $30 million
</P>
<P>
   The project: Scheduled to open in late 2002, the building will
serve as a gateway to the University of Texas campus. Historically,
the Blanton (formerly the Huntington Gallery) was divided between
the school's art building and the ground floor of the Ransom
Humanities Research Center. Team spokesman Jacques Herzog envisions
tiled canopies, watercourses and filtered light as responses to the
area's intense heat. He also is pondering a courtyard for
pedestrian flow between campus and Austin proper.

</P>
<P>
   TEXAS FINE ARTS ASSOCIATION, AUSTIN
</P>
<P>
   Founded: 1911
</P>
<P>
   Director: Sue Graze
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Gary Cunningham, Dallas
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: $1.1 million
</P>
<P>
   Building: Cunningham adapted a 2-story commercial building in
downtown Austin; built in the 1850s, it may be the oldest brick
building in the city. Planned in two stages, with only stage one
completed, the building (in which Cunningham deconstructs the
present and reveals much of the past) ultimately will feature about
10,000 square feet of exhibition space.

<P>
   ART MUSEUM OF SOUTH TEXAS, CORPUS CHRISTI
</P>
<P>
   Founded: Early 1940s
</P>
<P>
   Director: William G. Otton
</P>
<P>
   Architect: Ricardo Legorreta, Mexico City
</P>
<P>
   Construction budget: $4 million
</P>
<P>
   The project: Legorreta has been commissioned to design a new
education building near Philip Johnson's 1972 museum, which is on
the Corpus Christi ship channel and features 15,000 square feet of
exhibition space. Specific plans have not been presented, but the
new structure needs to address Johnson's sculptural,
poured-in-place concrete building, whose window walls open the
museum to sky and water.

THIS IS A `STEPMOM' A GIRL COULD LOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't care if my colleagues, the movie critics, and my best
friend dismiss ``Stepmom'' as a cheap, manipulative tear-jerker of
a film. I still understand why it's packin' em in to theaters.
After all, what movie title better characterizes American families
in the '90s?
</P>
<P>
   We can blame ``Cinderella'' for the bad rap placed upon
stepmoms. The storybook stepmonster is everything from annoying to
wicked, a characterization that is not only unfair but actually
untrue. The stats prove it: With one out of three Americans a
stepparent, stepchild, stepsibling or stepsomething, the state of
stepness is, like it or not, almost average.
</P>
<P>
   Stepmoms, on the average, are, well, pretty normal, too. Meaning
they come in good versions and bad, just like real moms.
</P>
<P>
   And I know from stepmoms; I've had three.
</P>
<P>
   I got my first stepmom when I was 8. She was 19, so it was a
tricky proposition for both of us. How she knew what to do to win
me over is still a mystery, because I was hugely unlovable at that
age _ and remained so, perhaps predictably, for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the little girl in the movie ``Stepmom'' was much
nastier to Julia Roberts than I ever was to my stepmom No. 1 _ a
fact even she admitted after we saw the movie together last week _
my stepmother still had to find a well of patience within her to
put up with me. She continues, as one of my greatest friends now,
to tell the story of the time I was so bored that I took the funny
papers into my bubble bath with me. (Who knew the ink would stain
the bathtub?)
</P>
<P>
   Like the Julia Roberts character, my stepmom was young, hip and
cool. She let me wear a little lip gloss and fixed my hair into a
sassy flip. It was with her that I first experienced McDonald's
french fries, shopping for no reason at all and making a pallet on
the floor to watch bad TV, late into the night, with squealing
girlfriends. She taught me how to laugh to the point of tears over
stupid things like buying the ugliest Christmas tree on the lot
because it was the cheapest, and how we could use the money we
saved for other fun stuff _ like a new purse!
</P>
<P>
   My own Mom adored this stepmom because she made my dad happy
again; Mom was rational enough to know Daddy deserved that. She
also found it wonderfully amusing that my stepmom made fun of my
Dad's dark moods. When Mom loaned all her ski clothes to my
stepmom, my friends thought the whole thing was way too weird, but
I loved it. In my family, it made perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   But statistics show that 60 percent of marriages end in divorce,
and second marriages are not immune. My first wonderful stepmom
quit that job when I was 16, leaving me with two terrific
stepsiblings, but also, in time, with Stepmom No. 2, about whom it
is best to say nothing, except perhaps that her arrival shot the
stepmom pendulum back toward the evil end. Fortunately, she
eventually unblended from our family, opening the doors for Stepmom
No. 3 _ statistically speaking, yet another happy confirmation that
75 percent of divorced persons eventually do marry again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, my personal stepmom-o-meter reels again to the positive
side. She and my dad seem to listen to each other like married
people should, they make each other laugh long and hard, and she's
a rocket scientist, which I find very, very cool.
</P>
<P>
   So kill me if I cry real, not manipulated, tears as Julia
Roberts stitches together a relationship with her stepkids on the
big screen, showing that stepmoms can be good. I know perhaps
better than anyone that stepmoms can indeed be fabulous _ but it's
a tough, tough job, and one that is mostly thankless.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I'm not surprised, and I'm even thrilled, that
``Stepmom'' is the first film endorsed by the Lincoln, Neb.-based
Stepfamily Association of America. OK, so the film is heavy-handed,
but isn't it time society finally smashed that stepmonster myth?
Because life after remarriage, while often complicated, can be a
decent, even very happy, place.

RELIGION WRITERS CHOOSE CLINTON, POPE AS YEAR'S TOP NEWSMAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who was the top religion newsmaker of 1998? We members of the
Religion Newswriters Association couldn't make up our minds.
</P>
<P>
   So President Clinton and Pope John Paul II, for dramatically
different reasons, finished in a tie for the honor.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the ritual of welcoming in the new year, the 200
members of our association vote on the top religion newsmakers and
top 10 religion stories.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton finished in a tie with the pope because the debates over
his possible removal from office have forced the nation into an
introspective look at moral behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He forced us to reflect on sin, broken promises and
forgiveness,'' states a news release summing up the association's
decisions. ``He also helped expose national fault lines on
questions of morality and repentance.'' The association is made up
of religion writers for secular newspapers, magazines and
broadcasting outlets.
</P>
<P>
   I cast my vote for the pope, because of the impact of his visit
to Cuba last January. Speaking before 1 million people in one of
the world's last outposts of communism, he called on Cuban leader
Fidel Castro to give more freedom to the people of the island
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Castro did what the pope asked, to a point. While still vowing
to keep communism, Castro released dozens of political prisoners.
Also, he brought joy back to the island by re-establishing
Christmas as a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 religion stories of the year also lean toward Pope
John Paul II and Clinton. Here they are, in order of importance:
</P>
<P>
   1. President Clinton's sexual entanglements with former White
House intern Monica Lewinski provoke a national debate over moral
issues.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pope John Paul II visits Cuba and meets with Castro.
</P>
<P>
   3. A church court fails by one vote to convict the Rev. Jimmy
Creech, former pastor of the First United Methodist Church of
Omaha, of violating church law by performing a same-sex
``marriage'' for a lesbian couple. The action explodes into a
churchwide controversy. Meeting in a hotel in Irving, Texas, the
United Methodist Judicial Council, the highest court of the
denomination, stiffens the penalties against such conduct. They
rule that Methodist statements barring clergy from conducting
same-sex ceremonies have the force of church law.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in Salt Lake City,
approves a new church statement on the family that has caused a
furor among defenders of equal rights for women. The most volatile
part of the statement declares that wives should ``submit
graciously to the servant leadership of their husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   5. The killing of Matthew Shephard, a gay student at the
University of Wyoming, provokes outrage from many quarters. Also,
debate intensifies over ads by the Family Research Council and
other groups declaring that homosexuals can change their sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   6. A Vatican statement on the Holocaust expresses remorse over
the failure of some Christians to take a stand against the Nazi
regime. But the Vatican's defense of Pope Pius XII, the pontiff
during World War II, brings criticism from some Jewish groups.
Also, Pope John Paul II canonizes Edith Stein, a German Jew who
converted to Catholicism and died in Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   7. Led by a few conservative American bishops and many more from
Africa and other nations, the world's Anglican and Episcopal
bishops approve a statement at the Lambeth Conference in
Canterbury, England, that states that homosexual practice is
incompatible with biblical teachings. The statement is not binding.
</P>
<P>
   8. Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the Michigan physician who believes
euthanasia is merciful, is charged with murder after the television
news show ``60 Minutes'' airs a tape of Kevorkian helping a man
commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   9. The Rev. Henry Lyons, president of the National Baptist
Convention, U.S.A., is indicted on 56 federal charges, including
extortion and fraud. He also admits to an ``improper relationship''
with a female former employee of the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   10. Karla Faye Tucker, who became an eloquent and persuasive
born-again Christian on Texas' Death Row, provokes more debate on
the death penalty. Tucker, who was convicted of a pickax slaying,
publicly pleads for her life, and Pope John Paul II and Christian
Broadcasting Network leader Pat Robertson, among others, join in
asking for clemency. Despite their pleas, Tucker is put to death by
lethal injection.

HIGH RATES OF ASTHMA ARE FOUND IN ATHLETES

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How common is undiagnosed asthma among athletes? Worried about
the risk the increasingly common lung disease poses, Temple
University researchers have come up with a straightforward method
of finding out: they asked a group of high school football players
to run a mile, and then used a simple breath test to quantify the
huffing and puffing afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The results from one recent survey were disconcerting, but they
could provide a basis for a simple program to help coaches and
trainers detect and treat the condition, the study's author, Dr.
Gilbert D'Alonzo Jr., said in a telephone interview. Of the 214
players tested _ none of whom had received diagnoses of asthma _ 9
percent had exercise-induced bronchospasms, a serious form of
airway obstruction that is typical of asthma. While the finding is
not the same as a definitive diagnosis, which takes observation
over time, it is regarded as a useful stand-in.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alonzo, the deputy director of pulmonary medicine at Temple
University in Philadelphia, said he found that percentage
surprisingly high. ``To get to varsity football you need pretty
decent talent,'' he said, ``and you would have thought that most of
the kids with breathing problems would have been filtered out.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that the rate of undiagnosed asthma was
highest _ 13 percent _ among African-American athletes at the
inner-city schools included in the study, which was published last
month in Chest, the journal of the American College of Chest
Physicians. A host of earlier studies have found higher rates of
the disease among minorities, inner-city residents and the poor.
``In the suburban groups, the players knew about their asthma,''
D'Alonzo said. ``The kids in the inner city had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   But D'Alonzo found that the affluent suburban and the poor urban
athletes who had been given diagnoses of asthma had one other
worrisome problem in common: None of them were bringing their
medication to the field.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, he said, awareness of asthma's dangers was
raised this fall when a high school cross country runner nearly
died during a training run. The student had left her asthma
medication at home. Fortunately, she was with a friend, who flagged
down a motorist who got her to an emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alonzo said that years of study have convinced him that asthma
attacks are ``by far the greatest threat to the student athletes
today.'' Dr. Jordan Metzl, a sports-medicine pediatrician at the
Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, agreed. ``Asthma is the
most common chronic disease among children,'' Metzl said, ``and an
acute asthma attack is life-threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is compounded by the reluctance of athletes to tell
their coaches about shortness of breath. ``I played college
basketball with asthma,'' D'Alonzo said, ``and I never said
anything: I thought I'd have to sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some ``drug-free'' schools include inhaled asthma
medication on their list of banned substances, D'Alonzo recommends
that athletes with asthma be allowed to take two puffs of
albuterol, a widely used prescription medication that clears the
air pathways, before a game and once again during competition if
needed. But if wheezing persists, the player should probably sit
out the rest of the game. He also recommends that all trainers have
an albuterol inhaler in their medicine bag.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Madden, a health educator with the National Center for
Environmental Health in Atlanta, emphasized that having asthma
``doesn't mean you have to give up sports. It's a chronic disease,
but one that can be managed.'' Coaches need to be on the lookout
for players with undiagnosed cases, and to be aware of the
abilities, limitations and warning signs for athletes with asthma
on their teams.

USING MAGNETS ON CORNERS OF THE MIND

   A team led by a St. Louis neurosurgeon has performed the first
surgery on a human using superconducting magnets to direct a
surgical instrument into the brain, around corners or on a curved
path, to reach and perform a biopsy on a tumor. The technique
enabled the surgeons to eliminate the requirement _ and the danger
_ of pushing a needle through important areas of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ralph Dacey, head of neurosurgery at Washington University
School of Medicine in St. Louis, said the new magnetic-surgery
system is less invasive and should prove safer than traditional
methods. It combines several high-technology devices _ computers,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI's), live X-rays, and small
superconducting magnets to place surgical instruments or medication
in precisely the right spot without disturbing sensitive areas
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Quest, a neurosurgeon at Columbia Presbyterian
Medical Center in New York, and others said the new operating
system raised the potential of developing a variety of new medical
treatments for illnesses like Parkinson's disease and other motor
disorders centered in the brain, cancer there and elsewhere in the
body and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Universities and national laboratories throughout the United
States have been experimenting with and developing magnetic
technology for more than a decade. Until now, though surgeons have
been able to use images of the brain to locate a tumor with
precision, they have generally had to push a rigid needle manually
toward a tumor through whatever vital section lay in the pathway.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, under the Food and Drug Administration's Phase I
human trials, was performed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis
on Dec. 17 on a 31-year-old man to determine whether tumors in his
brain were malignant and to help plot the course of treatment. He
was the first of five patients with tumors in the upper front part
of the brain to undergo the new procedure.
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of a series of MRI images of the patient's brain,
Dacey and his team mapped out the least invasive route to the tumor
and created computerized instructions that would direct a sharp
plastic surgical instrument to the right place. The team then
placed the patient's head inside a titanium frame and within three
sets of the superconducting magnets.
</P>
<P>
   Dacey drilled an opening about one-third of an inch wide through
the patient's skull to the edge of the brain. Sitting at the
computer console, he instructed the magnetic system to move a
flexible plastic catheter, somewhat narrower than a straw, into the
brain. Another, tiny magnet, attached to a guidewire, was inside
the catheter. Preprogrammed electronic impulses from the computer
set up a sequence of magnetic fields around the head to guide the
tiny magnet on course to the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, one millimeter at a time, Dacey allowed the catheter to
advance through the soft matter of the brain, constantly stopping
it to check its path, ready to adjust it if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   When the catheter reached the tumor, which took about five
minutes, he gently pulled it with the guidewire, leaving the hollow
catheter in place. Then, he moved the surgical tool in through the
catheter to cut out tissue samples from the tumor and remove them.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said the next step for magnetic surgery would be
to seek FDA approval to begin Phase II of human trials, after
demonstrating that the first phase was safe and effective. The
number of patients will be expanded in the next trials to 30.

FACING MULTIPLE BIRTH FEARS IN FERTILITY CASES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Fertility drugs provide a mix of hope and fear to those who are
taking them _ hope that the treatment will result in pregnancy and
fear that it will cause high-order multiples, defined as triplets
or more. This fear has been heightened recently with the birth of
the Chukwu octuplets in Houston, whose mother took fertility drugs.
With the spotlight on fertility medication, a long-standing debate
has been reignited: Who is responsible _ the physician or the
patient _ when fertility drugs result in high-order multiple
births?
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, patients desperate for babies insist on
aggressive treatment that is more likely to result in high-order
multiples. In others, primary care physicians write prescriptions
for these drugs without the training or resources needed to fully
manage the patients.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the insurance companies? Some experts in the
field insist that insurers who refuse to cover a full-range of
infertility treatments or timely referrals to specialists carry
some of the burden of responsibility and that covering these costs
would ultimately save money.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Perloe, director of the Atlanta Reproductive Health
Center, said fertility treatment has to be a shared responsibility.
``The physician is responsible for educating the patient regarding
treatment options before initiating therapy,'' he said. ``That way
the correct decisions can be made _ decisions that have profound
economic and moral implications for the couple. The couple can't
make those decisions alone, but as physicians we can't make those
decisions for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Venet Grant, president of the International Council on
Infertility Information Dissemination, places the responsibility
for high-order multiple births squarely on the shoulders of the
physicians and the insurers. While ``it's the physicians'
responsibility to help a couple make responsible choices,'' she
said, ``couples are often driven to do these things out of
desperation because their insurance does not provide them with
adequate medical coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The drugs that carry the greatest risk of high-order multiple
fertilizations are the injectable hormones known as human
menopausal gonadotropins, or hMG, which are probably the drugs Nkem
Chukwu took, although her doctor has not released that information.
Trade names for these drugs include Pergonal, Humegon, Repronex,
Follistim, Fertinex and Gonal-F.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of multiple gestations depends on many factors,
including the dosage and duration of treatment, the woman's age,
and the quality of the sperm, but generally the risk of multiple
births ranges from 10 to 20 percent, the majority of which are
twins, according to Resolve, a nonprofit advocacy group for people
experiencing infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Although large doses of these drugs are used during in-vitro
fertilization, the risk of multiple births is not as high for this
procedure as it is when fertility drugs are used alone, said Dr.
Gary Berger, medical director of the Chapel Hill Fertility Center
in Chapel Hill, N.C., and author of ``The Couple's Guide to
Infertility'' (1995, Doubleday). During in-vitro fertilization, the
eggs are removed from the ovaries and fertilized outside the
woman's body. A known number, usually only two or three, are
returned to the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   That level of control is not possible with drug treatment alone,
Berger explained. However, vaginal ultrasound can provide detailed
pictures of the ovaries and inform physicians how the body is
responding to the hormones. Dr. Perloe said that experienced
physicians look for the number of follicles that are developing in
the ovaries, what size they are and how crowded they appear. The
more follicles there are, the more eggs there may be. In addition,
the estrogen levels in the woman's blood are measured frequently, a
sudden rise indicating that multiple follicles might have
developed.
</P>
<P>
   If an ultrasound reveals many mature follicles, there are
several ways to prevent the release of the eggs and their
fertilization. The physician can cancel the cycle, either by
withholding the final injection of hCG, a hormone that releases the
eggs from the follicles, or by withholding the introduction of
sperm.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to remove some of the follicles before
fertilization, a procedure that is less known but that Dr. Berger
said ``is a better option than selective reduction.'' Most
physicians agree that selective reduction, the removal of
fertilized eggs between 9 and 12 weeks gestation, is the last
resort. This is the procedure that Ms. Chukwu and her husband
reportedly refused due to their religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   But these options are often overshadowed by financial
considerations. Each cycle costs thousands of dollars, making
cancellation an expensive decision. ``People are making choices not
based on quality medical care but on what their insurance will
cover,'' Ms. Grant explained.
</P>
<P>
   She recommended choosing a physician carefully. ``What matters
most is that the physician devotes his or her practice to fertility
issues, she said. ``Find out what their success rate is and how
many high-order multiple births they have come out of their
practice.'' She recommends contacting Resolve for its physician
referral list.
</P>
<P>
   Patients need to take responsibility too, Berger said. ``Medical
care is best when the patient is fully informed and
participating.'' Ms. Grant emphasized that women need to become
involved in their own treatment. ``Don't just lie there and let the
ultrasonographer write things down in the chart,'' she advised.
``Don't go home without knowing what they saw that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Perloe added that patients' responsibilities extend to making
the commitment to the treatment agreed upon. ``You've got to be
willing to devote the time to treatment,'' he said. ``You can't
miss an ultrasound because you had to go to a business meeting. It
has to become your highest priority.''

IMPEACHMENTESE: A FULL (NOT FULSOME) COMPLEMENT OF SYNONYMS FOR
REBUKE, SOME MORE PURIFYING THAN OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, January 10.)  
 (EDS: Items in boldface should be set in italics.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Even in survival,'' wrote Jim Hoagland of The Washington Post,
``Clinton will emerge from this experience chastised if not
chastened, humiliated if not humbled.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a serious challenge to synonymists by a serious
foreign-affairs columnist (even though he uses the reader-friendly
``Jim'' in his byline, which would raise the eyebrow of a bygone
era's Walt Lippmann).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chaste  &LR; is from the Latin  &UR; castus,  &LR; ``pure,'' and  &UR; chasten
 &LR; means ``to make pure'' by some mode of discipline, with the
positive connotation of being strengthened by moral correction
(``whom the Lord loveth he  &UR; chasteneth &LR; '').  &UR; Chastise,  &LR; as well as
 &UR; castigate,  &LR; comes from the Latin  &UR; castigare,  &LR; which adds the force
of -igare, or agere, ``to drive'' to the purifying. Although both
verbs mean ``to correct by punishment or reproof,''  &UR; chastise  &LR; adds
coercion or severity to the moral instruction in  &UR; chasten. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the synonymy of censure, then,  &UR; punish  &LR; implies ``to penalize
for disobedience to authority''; the verb  &UR; discipline  &LR; suggests
``to subjugate or bring under control'';  &UR; chasten  &LR; means ``to
strengthen by setting straight'';  &UR; chastise,  &LR; ``to inflict some
coercion in correction'';  &UR; correct,  &LR; ``to straighten for the
purpose of reform''; and  &UR; castigate,  &LR; ``to tongue-lash or rebuke
severely.''
</P>
<P>
   As I parse the subtle Hoagland, his `` &UR; chastised  &LR; if not
 &UR; chastened &LR; '' &UR;  &LR; means ``corrected but not truly purified,'' or
``punished but not made  &UR; chaste. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   What about `` &UR; humiliated  &LR; if not  &UR; humbled &LR; ''? If you're a
gardener, you know what  &UR; humus  &LR; is: that deliciously decomposed
plant or animal manure that, mixed with your back yard's flavorless
dirt, gives an organic boost to the roots of your flowers. It is
also the Latin word for ``earth, ground,'' and is the root of both
 &UR; humble  &LR; and  &UR; humiliate &LR; , &UR;  &LR; words that suggest the bringing of
someone down to the ground, sometimes to the extent of figuratively
grinding his face in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The verb  &UR; to humble &LR;  originally meant ``to make meek,'' as in
Valentine's profession of awed affection in ``The Two Gentlemen of
Verona'': ``O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,/And hath so
 &UR; humbled  &LR; me, as, I confess,/There is no woe to his correction.''
Now, however, it is part of the lingo of abasement.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms has an uplifting entry
on  &UR; abasement &LR; . After running through  &UR; demean  &LR; (loss of dignity),
 &UR; debase  &LR; (deterioration in value) and the Pentagon's favorite new
word,  &UR; degrade  &LR; (``conveys a strong implication of the shamefulness
of the condition to which someone or something has been reduced'' _
take that, Saddam), M-W comes to  &UR; humble &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently used in place of  &UR; degrade &LR; ,'' synonymizes the
philological hairsplitter, ``in the sense of  &UR; demote  &LR; when the
ignominy of the reduction in rank is emphasized ... [but) often
suggests a salutary increase of humility or the realization of
one's own littleness or impotence.'' But  &UR; humiliate,  &LR; which used to
be a synonym of  &UR; humble,  &LR; has gained a more forceful meaning of
taking someone down: ``comes closer to  &UR; mortify,  &LR; for it stresses
chagrin and shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, when Hoagland writes that Clinton has been
 &UR; ``humiliated  &LR; if not  &UR; humbled &LR; ,'' I think he's saying that others
have  &UR; demeaned, debased, degraded &LR;  the president, but he remains
neither  &UR; defeated  &LR; nor newly possessed of a sense of meekness and
humility.
</P>
<P>
   Whew! What a spectrum of meaning some columnists can pack in a
single burst of alliteration.
</P>
<P>
   FULSOME APOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   When Sen.-elect Charles Schumer of New York told the House
Judiciary Committee that the president had already made a ``fulsome
apology'' _- intended to mean ``copious, complete, full'' _
usagists like Alistair Cooke winced. Throughout nine decades of
speaking good English, the former BBC commentator knew that the
word meant nothing of the sort. On almost the contrary, he and
other incensed hearings-watchers told me on voice mail,  &UR; fulsome
 &LR; means ``excessive, cloying,'' even ``disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Centuries ago, the original meaning of ``full'' in that word had
been influenced by  &UR; foul &LR; . Surely the Clinton defender could not
have intended to leave the impression that the apology reeked. Had
the senator-elect erred?
</P>
<P>
   Two great dictionaries disagree. Webster's New World, now
published by Macmillan, has as its first definition, ``disgusting
or offensive, especially because excessive or insincere  &UR; (fulsome
 &LR; praise).'' But then it reports a second meaning: ``(apparent
revival of the original sense, obsolete since 16th century) full;
ample; abundant: usage objected to by some.''
</P>
<P>
   Now to Merriam-Webster, whose patron saint, Noah himself,
defined it in 1828 as ``gross: disgusting by plainness, grossness
or excess; as  &UR; fullsome  &LR; flattery or praise.'' In the 10th
Collegiate Edition, M-W turns the tables. Its first definition is
``characterized by abundance: copious.'' Only in its second sense
do we get ``esthetically, morally or generally offensive.'' It then
gives other pejorative senses as ``effusive'' and ``overdone''
before swinging back to ``generous in amount.'' A usage note is
added: ``Unless the context is made very clear, the reader or
hearer cannot be sure whether such an expression as  &UR; `fulsome
 &LR; praise' '' means  &UR; copious  &LR; or  &UR; offensive &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   This commentator says: If you mean  &UR; full &LR; , &UR;  &LR; say  &UR; full &LR; , &UR;  &LR; or if
you want to put your thumb on the upscale,  &UR; copious &LR; . But if you
mean  &UR; gross &LR; , &UR;  &LR; say  &UR; gross  &LR; or  &UR; yucky &LR; , &UR;  &LR; or try an expletive like
 &UR; feh &LR; ! Never refer to a  &UR; fulsome  &LR; bosom unless you want to get
slugged by an intelligent woman. Indeed, cross  &UR; fulsome  &LR; off your
list entirely. Phooey on ambiguity. Never be of two minds about
ambivalence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't see it, hear it, smell it, taste it or feel it. But it
can poison or even kill you without you ever realizing it's around.
It is the deadly gas, carbon monoxide, and winter is the season it
does most of its damage. Despite annual warnings about the many
sources of carbon monoxide and how problems can be prevented and
detected before it's too late, this product of combustion kills an
estimated 2,100 people who did not intend to die and sickens 10,000
others in the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, the flu-like symptoms that are early warning
signs of carbon monoxide poisoning are mistakenly attributed to a
viral infection, and victims are sent home or back to work to
breathe yet more of the deadly gas. Babies and small children
(including unborn children), those with chronic heart or lung
diseases and the elderly are especially sensitive to the harmful
effects of carbon monoxide and are among those who are least likely
to respond appropriately to the first signs of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Although it had long been assumed that those who survive carbon
monoxide poisoning suffer no lasting effects, studies in recent
years have documented permanent problems that may not show up for
weeks or months after an apparent recovery in a large minority of
victims. They can experience long-lasting, even permanent,
neurological and psychological damage that disrupts careers and
families and destroys lives. These findings make all the more
important the need to protect yourself and your family from the
dangers of carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon monoxide forms when hydrocarbons burn incompletely, such
as in wood-burning fireplaces, oil and gas appliances and
fuel-powered vehicles. Once in the air it is readily absorbed
through the lungs. It can also be formed in the liver from
methylene chloride, a common component of paint remover and other
solvents that are easily absorbed as vapor through the skin and
lungs. This is one reason these products warn people to use them
only with adequate ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the blood, carbon monoxide latches tightly onto
hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen to
every cell in the body. The affinity that carbon monoxide has for
hemoglobin exceeds oxygen's attraction by about 240 times. To make
matters even worse, once carboxy-hemoglobin, as the carbon
monoxide-hemoglobin complex is called, forms, the remaining
hemoglobin molecules that carry oxygen are less likely to give up
this vital gas to the tissues that need it.
</P>
<P>
   Most people normally have at most only a few percent of their
hemoglobin as carboxyhemoglobin. Smokers have much more than
nonsmokers, and those who live or work in environments polluted by
tobacco smoke are likely to have even higher levels of
carboxyhemoglobin than smokers themselves. As levels rise to 10
percent or more, symptoms of poisoning start to appear. At first,
they are vague and nonspecific _ headache, dizziness, weakness,
nausea _ and easily mistaken for a touch of the flu. As
carboxyhemoglobin levels rise, victims may experience shortness of
breath, rapid heart beat, difficulty concentrating, confusion,
visual problems, chest or abdominal pain and muscle cramps. The
most severe cases of carbon monoxide poisoning result in loss of
consciousness and death.
</P>
<P>
   The more advanced the poisoning, the more likely
neuropsychiatric damage will result, including such effects as
impaired memory, learning problems, sudden personality changes,
incontinence, Parkinson-like symptoms, dementia and even psychosis.
One-half to three-fourths of those affected recover within a year
from these effects, but for the remainder the damage is permanent.
</P>
<P>
   In your home, it is critically important to be sure that all
fuel-burning appliances are in proper working order. Furnaces
should be inspected and chimneys cleaned annually and kept in good
repair. Gas stoves must be properly adjusted (the flame should be
blue, not yellow), burners kept unclogged and, if possible, fumes
should be vented to the outside or at least circulated through a
hood fan. Gas ranges or ovens should be used only for cooking,
never to heat a room. Newer gas stoves that have low-heat-input gas
pilot lights, and nongas ignition systems are safer than those with
older pilot lights. If you have a gas range, you can have the gas
company turn off the cook-top pilots and instead light the burners
each time with a flicker device that produces a spark.
</P>
<P>
   Charcoal-burning devices, including hibachis, should never be
used indoors for cooking or heating. Last fall, three campers died
in New Jersey because they used a hibachi to heat their zippered
tent.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a gas-fueled or wood-burning fireplace, make sure the
flue is open when fuel is burning and that the doors on wood stoves
fit tightly so that smoke does not escape into the room.
</P>
<P>
   Always sleep with the bedroom window open. Even a few inches can
help prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The garage is another common source of trouble. Never idle your
car inside the garage, even if the door is open. Lethal levels of
carbon monoxide can accumulate in just 10 minutes in a closed
garage. Leaving the engine running is especially dangerous to the
entire family if the garage is attached to your house.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the garage, many people succumb unintentionally to carbon
monoxide poisoning when they sit or sleep is a closed car with the
engine running to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, install one or more carbon monoxide detectors in your
home as well as in your car. Safety experts suggest using a audible
alarm installed in a hallway or near the bedrooms. Newer models are
less likely to produce false alarms than ones purchased five or
more years ago.
</P>
<P>
   According to ratings by Consumer Reports, the best detectors
continuously display the level of carbon monoxide present, which
allows you to detect problems before they make anyone ill.
Top-rated models include three that operate on ordinary household
current _ Nighthawk, Lifesaver and S-Tech _ and one that is battery
powered, Safety 1st. There are also inexpensive chemical detectors
available that change color in the presence of increasing amounts
of carbon monoxide, but these cannot help you if you are asleep
when trouble arises.
</P>
<P>
   If your carbon monoxide detector alarm sounds, open windows and
doors, call 911 and ask for the fire department and get out of the
house. If you develop symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, see a
physician without delay, perhaps at a local emergency room, and
make sure your blood is checked for levels of carboxyhemoglobin. Be
especially suspicious of carbon monoxide poisoning if several
members of the household develop similar symptoms at the same time
or if a small pet in the house dies. If relatively advanced
poisoning is diagnosed, the doctor should order a neuropsychiatric
examination _ a battery of tests that takes about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the source of trouble must be detected and
corrected by a licensed professional before anyone re-enters the
house, workplace or vehicle.

   Sea otters are appealing, no doubt about it. In recent decades
they have cruised the cold waters off the Aleutian Islands and the
Alaskan mainland in robust numbers, like crowds of carefree
vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   They float around luxuriously on their backs, all the while
solicitously tending the babies that rest on the mothers' chests.
They do barrel rolls and cartwheels. They dive down into the kelp
beds that are their main feeding ground, where they gather up a
gourmet feast of sea urchins, clams and mussels, tuck them under
their arms, head for the surface and resume their backfloat.
</P>
<P>
   They demonstrate their skill as tool users (the only mammals
except primates that can do so) by putting rocks on their chests
and cracking the clams and mussels on them. They roll the spiny
urchins between their paws to make them go down better. Then they
pop the succulent marine morsels into their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   So it came as a shock to many people when Dr. James A. Estes, a
marine ecologist with the United States Geological Survey, and his
colleagues discovered that the otter population in the Aleutians
had plunged sharply. Wild animal populations are always fluctuating
to some degree or other _ that is nature's way _ but Dr. Estes and
his co-researchers at first could find no reason for the otters'
unusually sharp decline.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a detective hunt that did not just uncover the cause
of the decline: it opened a rare and revealing window on nature's
complexity and interconnectedness _ in this case, a huge slice of
ecological reality encompassing both the broadest dimensions and
most spectacular inhabitants of the marine environment as well as
its most minute creatures and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it turned out that orcas, or killer whales,
had started eating the otters after decades and possibly centuries
of peaceful coexistence. The new and lethal relationship between
orcas and otters, the researchers concluded, was occasioned by
ripples running from one end of this elegant web of existence to
the other. And the otters, they found, were the crucial species
holding the web together.
</P>
<P>
   It is not often that ecologists are able to get a clear fix on
such a big and complicated chunk of the natural world, or on the
full sweep of the dynamics operating within it. Most ecological
research projects are too short and too small to come to grips with
such expansive dimensions. But Dr. Estes and his colleagues, who
are based at the University of California at Santa Cruz, have been
using the Aleutians and Western Alaska, a stretch of some 2,000
miles, as their research laboratory for nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In that period they have tracked the otters' movements and
population dynamics by tagging the otters and in some cases
surgically implanting small radio transmitters in them. The
researchers found that on some of the islands, otter populations
had recovered strongly since they were nearly extinguished a
century ago by a long-defunct fur trade. The Estes group had every
reason to expect that they would continue to be robust. So when
they began to notice in the 1990s that some populations were
instead declining, he said, ``it was unexpected and perplexing.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the researchers just did not believe it at first. ``We
wrote it off to sampling error, just the imprecision of the data,''
he said. But the numbers continued to drop, and it seemed clear
that something unusual was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Could the otters simply have migrated from one part of the
region to another? To find out, the researchers analyzed
populations over a 500-mile-long stretch of the Aleutians from
Kiska to Seguam. Sure enough, by 1993 otter numbers in that whole
stretch had been cut by half. Here the geographical scope of the
research effort became critical; a smaller region would not have
been large enough to reveal the decline. In 1997, they repeated the
surveys and found that the population decline had worsened, to
about 90 percent. In the 500-mile stretch, otter numbers had
dropped to an estimated 6,000 from 53,000 in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``That told us for sure it was a very large-scale decline, but
we were still trying to understand the cause,'' Dr. Estes said.
Early on, the researchers had ruled out reproductive failure. Their
studies enabled them to keep track of how often otters gave birth
and how many young survived, and this revealed that reproduction
was continuing to re-supply the population.
</P>
<P>
   With other possible causes eliminated, the Estes team reasoned,
mortality had to be the explanation. In the past, they had seen
temporary declines in otter populations because of starvation,
pollution or infectious disease. ``In all those cases,'' Dr. Estes
said, ``we find lots of bodies. They get weak and tired and come
ashore to die.'' This time not a single dead otter was found _ a
clue, he said, that ``something really weird was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1991, a member of the team had seen an orca eating
an otter. Killer whales normally ignore otters as prey in favor of
seals and sea lions, which give them more food for less expenditure
of hunting energy. So at first, no one made the connection between
a single otter's bad luck in meeting a killer whale and the
shrinking otter population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd watched them swimming around with otters for decades and
never saw them eat one,'' Dr. Estes said of the orcas. Then the
researchers began seeing more attacks. Soon the count of sightings
reached nine, Dr. Estes said, and it became clear that ``something
was going on with whales in terms of their behavior toward
otters.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the detective story was described in a recent issue
of the journal Science by Dr. Estes and other members of his team:
M.T. Tinker, a graduate student at the university in Santa Cruz;
Dr. Terrie M. Williams, a physiologist in the university's biology
department, who is also Dr. Estes' wife; and Dr. Daniel F. Doak, a
population biologist at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Through statistical analysis, the researchers determined that
the observed increase in attacks could not be attributed to chance
alone. Then they compared otter population trends in two places on
Adak Island where circumstances had by chance created experimental
and control groups. In one place, Clam Lagoon, the entrance from
the sea was too narrow and shallow for orcas to enter. In the
other, Kuluk Bay, they could enter easily. There was virtually no
movement of otters between the two areas. Almost two-thirds of the
otters disappeared from the unsheltered bay in a year's time, while
only 12 percent disappeared from the sheltered one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made us perk up our years and think it really was the
killer whales,'' Dr. Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the researchers calculated what the likely rate of
observed attacks would be if whales were responsible for the 90
percent reduction in the otter population. The rate was close to
the number of attacks actually seen.
</P>
<P>
   But this conclusion only raised new questions. What made the
whales attack the otters? The researchers have proposed the
following chain of events, which begins in the open ocean:
</P>
<P>
   First, populations of the northern Pacific's most nutritious
fish, like ocean perch and herring, declined. The reasons are
uncertain, but several have been proposed. One is overfishing by
commercial fishermen. Another is a sudden warming of the North
Pacific climate that began in the late 1970s. A third is
competition from a predator species of fish, the pollock, which is
not as nutritious as the other, oilier species. The pollock
population grew, according to one hypothesis, when whalers reduced
the populations of whales that survive by filtering microscopic
animals from the water. The tiny animals proliferated, and the
pollock gorged on them.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the most nutritious forage fish, according to the
proposed story line, was mainly responsible for an ensuing crash in
Alaskan populations of Steller sea lions and harbor seals, for
which pollock did not provide sufficient nourishment. Numbers of
these pinnipeds, as seals and sea lions are called, have declined
sharply since the 1970s. According to a 1996 study by the National
Research Council, the decline in forage fish was probably a major
factor in the pinniped crash.
</P>
<P>
   Pinnipeds are the major food of orcas. Faced with a shortage,
the Estes group believes, some killer whales turned to the next
best thing: sea otters.
</P>
<P>
   Here the ecological web gets even more complex. The otters are
the keystone species of a coastal ecosystem called kelp forests.
These are great stretches of algae, analogous to terrestrial
woodlands, in which kelp fills the role of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Otters maintain the ecosystem by eating sea urchins, which feed
on kelp. When otters disappear, the urchin population explodes and
quickly ``deforests'' the kelp ecosystem. That is exactly what
happened in the Aleutians when killer whales removed so many otters
from the scene. As the ``trees'' of the ecosystem disappeared, so
did many other species of algae that are analogous to the
underbrush of a terrestrial forest.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have documented the decline of otters, the
proliferation of urchins and the deforestation of kelp beds. And
based on earlier studies, the scientists believe that further
ecological ripples are also under way. ``Taking the otter out of
the system has a whole cascade of effects,'' Dr. Estes said. ``Most
of them are unstudied, but we've looked at it enough to know there
are a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some examples:
</P>
<P>
   Sea stars (starfish), which prefer open water rather than kelp
and which are preyed on by otters, should thrive. But the growth
rate of invertebrates like limpets, sea mussels and barnacles is
expected to slow. Fish species that live in the kelp forest, like
rockfishes, sculpins and greenlings (a relative of ling cod) should
decline. A number of bird species are dependent on these varieties
of marine life, and they may well be affected different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Seagulls will have fewer fish on which to prey. But they are
adaptable enough to switch to invertebrates. Bald eagles, on the
other hand, are totally dependent on the fish, and their local
populations may well drop. The likelihood that America's symbol
will become locally extinct one of its main strongholds, Dr. Estes
said, ``becomes very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Many more details remain to be fleshed out before the
researchers will have a full picture of how the complicated chain
of marine life works. But one thing seems clear: If they had not
thought big by focusing on the broad scale and the long term, they
would not have gotten close. For the young science of ecology, that
may be the biggest lesson.

PATIENT OR GUINEA PIG? DILEMMA OF CLINICAL TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   When pharmaceutical companies recruit sick people for studies of
experimental drugs, what are the companies' obligations to the
patients? And once people sign up, accepting risk but hoping for
benefit, receiving free medical care and drugs, what do they owe to
science, to future patients who may be helped by the research and
to the company that may profit from it?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gail Ogden, 55, from Westmoreland, Kan., confronted
those questions firsthand, when she learned that she had chronic
hepatitis C, a viral disease of the liver.
</P>
<P>
   Although many people carry the virus for decades without
becoming sick, others develop cirrhosis, liver failure or cancer.
Because Ms. Ogden was ill and had signs of liver damage, her
doctors recommended drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Four million Americans are thought to be infected with hepatitis
C, most of them without knowing it, and 8,000 to 10,000 people a
year die of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment is expensive _ a six-month course of therapy costs
$6,400 to $8,600. Ms. Ogden's health insurance would cover only
part of the cost and she could not afford to make up the
difference. Her doctor encouraged her to volunteer for a study, in
which she would receive medication at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   In September, she entered a 48-week clinical trial at the
University of Nebraska in Omaha, designed and sponsored by
Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J. Ms. Ogden was at first
delighted to be accepted into the study, but like many people who
consent to be experimented on, she has found the transition from
patient to research subject a rough one, and her experience has put
her at odds with Schering-Plough.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ogden's case and those of other people with hepatitis C have
been taken up by patient advocacy groups, including some founded by
people with HIV or AIDS who have had long experience in challenging
drug companies over the way people are treated in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment Ms. Ogden signed up for was to enroll 600 people
at 40 to 50 medical centers around the United States. Some
participants would be given Rebetron, a treatment approved for
hepatitis C by the Food and Drug Administration. It combines two
anti-viral drugs: injections of interferon and capsules containing
ribavirin. Others would receive ribavirin with higher doses of
interferon.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was later approved for all patients, at the time the
study began, Rebetron had been approved only for people who had
relapsed after treatment with interferon alone.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the study was to test the effectiveness of
Rebetron in people who had not taken any other medication for
hepatitis C, and also to find out whether the version containing
higher doses of interferon would work better than the standard form
of Rebetron, which is effective in fewer than half of patients, in
whom it reduces the virus to undetectably low levels.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its limited effectiveness, Rebetron is the best
treatment available for hepatitis C, and Schering-Plough is its
sole manufacturer. First approved last June, the drug had earned
$46 million by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   The study that Ms. Ogden entered was not ``blinded,'' that is,
both the subjects and the doctors monitoring them knew which doses
they were receiving. Ms. Ogden was assigned at random to the group
taking the standard form of Rebetron.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers could not promise that she would benefit from the
study, but regardless of which dose she received, they knew that
for the full 48 weeks she would experience formidable side effects:
fever, headaches, nausea, fatigue, aches and pains, anemia, and
mental symptoms including depression and sometimes suicidal
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ms. Ogden said: ``I was grateful to get into this
treatment. I was delighted. I went into it thinking that not only
was I going to help myself, I'd help others coming after me. I was
all fired up. I thought this is a good thing to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her plan was to watch her test results closely, particularly her
viral load, a measurement of virus levels in the bloodstream. If it
did not drop within a few months, and if the side effects were
severe, she would consider dropping out of the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Three months into the study, she is bitter. Only after it began,
she said, did she find out that Schering would be withholding
viral-load information until the study was finished. ``I had no
idea the extent these people would go to to get their drugs to the
market. It's absolutely disgusting, the corporate greed in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering-Plough, said that the
company was motivated not by greed but by the need to determine the
best treatment for hepatitis C. In this case, he said, the company
decided to withhold viral loads in the hopes of keeping patients
from dropping out of the study. Too many dropouts would make it
hard to complete the research.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Consalvo said, being a subject in a study is not
the same as being a patient treated by a personal doctor. But, he
acknowledged, drug companies may need to do a better job of
communicating that to people who participate in experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ogden's objections to the study, echoed by other
participants, reflect a tension that has always existed between
researchers and their subjects. People who volunteer for studies
are told that the purpose of the study is not to help them, but to
gather information that may eventually help others. Participants
themselves may or may not benefit, and must accept the risks and
the possibility of side effects that are part of any experiment.
</P>
<P>
   But few people sign on out of pure altruism. They want the
experimental drugs a study provides, often regarding them as
``treatment'' even when their safety and effectiveness have not yet
been proved. Even the most unselfish cling to the hope that an
experiment will help them. And people who are feeling sick and
vulnerable, trying to beat a disease that might kill them, may
resent the feeling that their needs come second to a heartless
quest for data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sick people can't think of of themselves as research
subjects,'' said George Annas, chairman of the health law
department at the Boston University School of Public Health. ``They
don't want to feel like they're being used as guinea pigs. They
want to feel like patients. But they're not. They're guinea pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   Those like Ms. Ogden who enter studies because they cannot
afford treatment are in the worst position, he added, as they feel
at the mercy of whoever is doling out the medication.
</P>
<P>
   Her antagonism over the viral-load test developed in part
because the consent form she signed did not mention what would be
done with the results, but she assumed that they would be reported
to her, and she was counting on them to gauge her progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This treatment is tough,'' she said. ``It makes you sick. I
want to know if I'm showing signs of getting better or if nothing's
happening, and I need to make a decision about whether I continue
putting this toxic stuff into my body.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision to drop out would be inconvenient for the drug
company, which wants as many people as possible to finish the
study. But from a patient's point of view, quitting is logical.
``If they see it's not helping, they want to get out,'' Annas said.
``I don't blame them.''

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Four days after Christmas, while coming home from an errand, I
noticed that many of my neighbors had discarded their Christmas
trees. I moaned: Don't they know Christmas is not over?
 &HT;    Evidently not.
 &HT;    Secular Christmas starts the day after Thanksgiving and ends
with the Christmas sales on December 26. Some stalwarts keep their
trees until New Year's. But few preserve the Christian practice of
celebrating the Twelve Days of Christmas from December 25 through
the evening of January 5.
 &HT;    Every year, however, I refuse to dismantle the tree until the
very end. No city-wide recycling program can break my resolve to
maintain the Christian liturgical year.
 &HT;    According to tradition, Christmas' Twelve Days follow the
nativity -- making Christmas a season and not a single day.
Christmas ends when a new church season, Epiphany, begins on
January 6.
 &HT;    Although lost in a haze of post-holiday blues and the return to
school, Epiphany is actually more ancient than Christmas. As early
as the second century, Christians celebrated January 6 as a feast
to mark three events: one, the visit of the Wise Men to the infant
Jesus; two, Jesus's baptism; and three, Jesus's first miracle at
the wedding of Cana.
 &HT;    Epiphany comes from the Greek word, ``epiphania,'' meaning
manifestation or revelation. The day's three-fold commemoration
marks the revelation of Jesus as Messiah, God's long-promised one
as savior of the world.
 &HT;    Given the religious power of Epiphany's message, it is no wonder
why American secular Christmas ignores the day. Sweet baby Jesus is
tangential enough to capitalist Christmas; proclaiming him a
miracle-working Messiah unnerves even some spiritually sensitive
folks. Jesus is safer as a cuddly newborn than one to whom even
kings pay homage.
 &HT;    Yet, there it is. The culmination of Christmas is this odd
collection of stories: of Wise Men following a star and the
church's retelling of the grown Jesus being baptized and performing
his first miracle.
 &HT;    Over the years, Epiphany has puzzled me. Recently, however, I
have become convinced that Epiphany is one of the most spiritually
significant feasts on the Christian calendar. Even those who do not
believe Jesus was the Messiah can draw some spiritual insights from
this celebration. Epiphany is neither obtuse nor irrelevant.
 &HT;    At its heart Epiphany teaches two spiritual realities. First,
God manifests or reveals God's own self to the world. And second,
we need to embark on a journey to discover this God.
 &HT;    As we enter into the last year of the millennium, spiritual
journeys are ``in.'' But even when people speak of their journeys,
it seems clear that many have no idea where they are going.
Epiphany underscores a primary aspect of spiritual pilgrimage: God
went there first. The journey is one where God has travelled and
left traces and tokens of divine presence along the way. God
initiates our journeys by coming into the world.
 &HT;    As in the biblical account of the Magi, spiritual journeys
combine divine and human initiative. God reveals; humankind
responds. This is not a journey for the sake of journey. Rather, it
is a journey following a star -- a sign pointing the way --
directing us to the mystery of God's own manifestation.
 &HT;    Although we follow, that does not mean the way is fixed or
final. When the Wise Men found God's revelation, the baby Jesus was
not exactly the king they had expected. Spiritual pilgrimages are
full of unanticipated turns and surprising discoveries. The journey
itself becomes part of God's revelation in our lives.
 &HT;    Funny thing about those Wise Men -- their journey did not end
when they found Jesus. The gospel says, ``They left for their own
country by another road.'' They went back a different way than from
whence they came. Their journey to God took them home on a course
unlike their previous one. Everything about their journey was
unexpected.
 &HT;    Even Jesus. His journey probably surprised him. Imagine his
baptism as a voice from heaven announced: ``This is my beloved
Son.'' Or that miracle at Cana: ``My time has not yet come.''
 &HT;    These events in his life showed he was both follower and
revelation; a seeker of God and the one sought.
 &HT;    As 1999 dawns and the old millennium draws to a close, Epiphany
fits the spirit of the age. Epiphany celebrates journey. God
journeys to us; we journey to God. And, at the center of the
movement is the mystery of Christian faith: Jesus.
 &HT;    Y2K aside, Jesus is, after all, the one about whom all this
millennial fuss has arisen. Two thousand years after his birth, he
remains both as accessible and enigmatic as ever. Like the Wise
Men, we are still following that star.

 UNDATED: blame them.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After just four weeks on Rebetron, Ms. Ogden said, she developed
such severe anemia, a side effect of ribavirin, that her doctor
halted the drug temporarily, and then resumed it at a lower dose.
She also had problems with her eyesight, and the other side effects
have been so debilitating that she has taken a disability leave
from her job as business manager for a stock broker.
</P>
<P>
   Six or eight weeks into the study, Ms. Ogden and the doctor
assigned to her in the study received her test results: everything
except her viral load. When Ms. Ogden asked for it, she said, she
was told that Schering was withholding it from patients _ precisely
to keep them from quitting the study.
</P>
<P>
   Like any subject in a medical study, she had the right to quit
whenever she wanted, but the company would not give out information
that might lead people to exercise it. Ms. Ogden was outraged.
``It's not up to them to decide whether I stay in the study,'' she
said. ``I'm adamant. These are my civil rights here. Having
knowledge about your health should be a partnership. They know
what's going on. I should be informed.''
</P>
<P>
   She was further incensed when she learned that the viral-load
numbers were not being given to her doctor, either. ``How can he
take care of me if he doesn't even know?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   She could not afford to have repeated viral tests on her own:
The test costs $250.
</P>
<P>
   Consalvo confirmed that other patients and doctors had also
requested the viral-load data. And he said the information was
indeed withheld to keep patients from quitting the study. ``It's
for no reason other than to keep the viability of the clinical
trial, which is to prove safety and efficacy of the product,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If patients drop out, he said, ``it jeopardizes the data.''
Dropouts must be counted as treatment failures, he said, but they
may not really be failures, because some may quit before the drug
has a chance to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may be spiting yourself by getting out of the study
early,'' Consalvo said, adding that patients were no more qualified
scientifically to decide when to quit than they were to decide what
drug doses should be tested.
</P>
<P>
   But Annas said he believed patients like Ms. Ogden had a right
to receive viral-load test results, particularly because the
consent form for the trial did not say the information would be
withheld. To withhold them under those circumstances, he said, was
``just blatantly unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   Annas added that he was surprised that the group overseeing
research ethics at the university medical center, the institutional
review board, would allow it. But the board at the University of
Nebraska did give permission for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Gordon, chairman of the review board, said the group
had discussed the issue because another study subject had already
raised it. But researchers convinced the board that it was
reasonable to withhold the viral load because subjects should not
be basing their decisions on it.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Gordon said, ``the investigator should be able to sit
down with the patient and say, `OK, you want this number, you can
have it, but let me try to convince you that it's not important.'''
He said the board had urged doctors involved in the study to
communicate better with participants. But, he said of Ms. Ogden's
situation, ``It's a tough ethical problem. Her point of view is
valid. The investigator's is, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Consalvo said that in earlier studies, Schering had released
viral-load data, but stopped when it realized patients were using
the data to decide whether to remain in the study. ``Patients have
become much more sophisticated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Current consent forms state clearly that viral loads will not be
revealed, Consalvo said, and medical centers enrolling patients
have been sent amendments explaining the policy, though Ms. Ogden
said she never received one.
</P>
<P>
   Annas said it was not reasonable to amend a study that was
already under way. Stating the policy up front before a patient
joins a study is defensible, he said, but he added, ``even then I'd
say it's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people with chronic diseases, Ms. Ogden had been
communicating with other patients on the Internet, and now she
sought help from an advocacy group, the Hepatitis C Action and
Advocacy Coalition, which is based in San Francisco, with chapters
in half a dozen cities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Klein, one of its founders, said the group was formed in
the spring of 1998 by patients seeking to force Schering-Plough to
reduce the price and alter the marketing of its hepatitis drugs. At
the urging of Ms. Ogden and other study participants, the group
added the viral-load question to its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In an HIV study, withholding viral-load data ``would be
unconscionable,'' said Klein, who is infected with both HIV and
hepatitis C. ``It's never done.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that, he said, is that people with HIV are better
organized and more experienced at protesting than those with
hepatitis C. Many with HIV are also well enough to fight, unlike
hepatitis C patients sick enough to need treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the HIV world you also have community advisory boards at
research institutions,'' Klein said. ``This is nonexistent in the
hepatitis C world. No one has reached out to patients to ask them
to help design trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ogden said she still hopes that the company will change its
policy. At times, she describes herself as being treated like a
``lab rat,'' and has fleeting thoughts of quitting the study.
``Then I think,'' she said, ``it's the only chance I have.''

   NEW YORK _ ``Just show up with a T-shirt, workout-type
clothing,'' said Lee Roy Longenbach, a manager at Metropolis
Fencing, when I called to sign up for a few classes.
</P>
<P>
   They were not the words I wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I was interested in a good workout for my legs and
improving my coordination, but I also wanted to get to wear one of
those sleek-looking white body suits. That was just my first
misconception.
</P>
<P>
   I showed up at the studio in Manhattan and discovered that
fencing was another world altogether from the romanticized one I
had created in my head.
</P>
<P>
   And I soon learned not to call a sword a sword. ``There are
three weapons,'' Longenbach said. ``There's the foil, the epee and
the saber.'' All three are used in competition, but traditionally
fencers are trained with the foil, which is flexible, making it
easier to wield. The epee is much stiffer and has a larger hand
guard for protection _ they were once very sharp. The saber, is
considered much more barbaric and a bit more obscure.
</P>
<P>
   I changed into my rumpled gym clothes, then met Michael, the
instructor, and Valerie, the only other student, for warm-up. Out
of each one-hour session, the first 20 minutes are spent stretching
and loosening up. It is not unlike high school gym class. You roll
your neck, swing your arms, touch your toes and stretch your
hamstrings. As the minutes passed during the stretching, I was
beginning to wonder if I was ever going to get my hands on a foil.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Michael told us to get suited up. The fencing uniform,
my motivation, was within grasp. Or, at least, half of it.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolis Fencing provides you with the jackets, which upon
close inspection I discovered were something of a cross between a
straitjacket and a catcher's chest protector. There is a strap
between your legs and it zips up the back. You are also given soft
leather gloves and a thimble-shaped helmet with a black face
screen. I felt like I was wearing a bad Halloween costume.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no time to fret; it was time to get down to
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you fence you must work all five fingers,'' Michael said,
holding a foil to show us. ``But it is these three that control the
foil,'' he said referring to the thumb, index and middle fingers.
It is a little like holding a large chopstick. Up until this point,
the only knives I had ever wielded were in the kitchen. And even my
largest fish knife suddenly seemed small and insignificant _ but
sharper: the weapons we used were dull, generally not sharp enough
to cut the skin.
</P>
<P>
   First, Michael taught us the en garde position. You stand with
one foot forward, facing your opponent, one foot behind,
perpendicular to the front foot, the foil out in front and your
other arm held in the air for balance. The forward foot is for
movement, the back foot for balance. At this angle, you give your
opponent the narrowest target.
</P>
<P>
   We began repetitions of various positions. Following Michael in
the en garde position, we waddled forward, we waddled backward. We
advanced, lunged and recovered. We jumped, lunged and recovered.
This was fun until my thighs began to burn and my arm holding the
foil turned to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then Valerie and I stood opposite one another and learned how to
defend ourselves. Rolling your wrist to the left and blocking the
opponent's sword is one of fencing's most fundamental moves, called
the ``four parry.'' To the right, it is called the ``six parry.''
</P>
<P>
   Once we got that down, we learned, with a straight and fluid
movement like a boxer's punch, to strike one another. This was
difficult to get used to. Valerie was much older; I felt like I was
stabbing my mother.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, though, when Michael gave us the go ahead to bout,
that feeling suddenly left me. I wanted to go in for the kill.
Soon, my movements no longer resembled the jump-lunge-recover we
had practiced. I was flailing my foil at Valerie. But Valerie was
just as vicious. Her foil was a constant presence in my face. I
forgot to ``four parry'' and ``six parry,'' and instead resorted to
swiping her weapon out of my way.
</P>
<P>
   We charged and poked at each other for a few minutes, then
Michael pulled us apart and told us our session was over. ``Yeah,''
Longenbach shouted from across the studio, ``It's not like it is on
TV. It's more difficult than it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   And I was not a natural. Fencing, I realized, requires a strong
foundation of technique, a lot of strategy and incredible agility.
</P>
<P>
   The grace and poise I had hoped for would come with time. But
only after coordination and speed kicked in. And though it might
not seem so when you're watching Errol Flynn, fencing requires
aggressiveness. It is not just a matter of catching your opponent
off guard. Like chess, it is about planning a few moves ahead to
outwit them, then being extremely quick and agile on your feet so
you can go in for the point.
</P>
<P>
   What is perhaps unusual about fencing is its openness and
equality. Fencing is a sport for all ages and, despite its image
for attracting slim men, all body types. Professional foil fencers
usually do not hit their prime until ages 25 to 35, and epee
fencers continue for many years after that.
</P>
<P>
   It is as much about strategy as it is about physical strength.
The steel is the great equalizer, Longenbach said. At Metropolis
Fencing, I once saw a skinny teen-age girl take on a much older
man, who looked like he belonged on a wrestling mat. It was a tight
match, and each fencer, though aggressive, would score with just a
gentle touch of the sword against the other's metallic vest to set
off the scoring buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like punching with a knife,'' Longenbach said. ``It's
just the touch. It's like flicking the cigarette out of the
person's mouth with a whip.''
</P>
<P>
   The second time I went was a Tuesday evening. The place was
packed. Music thumped in the background. Experienced fencers were
bouting in every inch of the place. Some were charging at each
other, some stood completely still, their foils just touching,
tensely waiting for the other to make the first move. This time,
the movements came easier for me, but only slightly. I don't think
I'll be flicking cigarettes any time soon.

   NEW YORK _ With a little extra boron, these diamonds turned
blue, like the famous Hope Diamond. With nitrogen, they went
yellow. And when radiation somehow hit the crystal structure of the
carbon, these diamonds-in-the-rough shifted to shades of green.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of 260 of these rare flukes in the diamond-making
process, with 12 distinct color varieties, are regularly displayed
at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, where about
a million people a year see them, said Dr. George E. Harlow, the
museum's curator of gems and minerals.
</P>
<P>
   But 1998 was no ordinary time for these stones, formed millions
of years ago as carbon was subjected to great heat and pressure.
Known as the Aurora Collection, these colored diamonds were
prominently featured in a major diamond show at the museum, ``The
Nature of Diamonds,'' which ran through August, and again in a
742-page, 9.8-pound book, ``Collecting and Classifying Colored
Diamonds: An Illustrated Study of the Aurora Collection'' (Ashland
Press, New York, $300). The book is the culmination of a seven-year
effort to examine, photograph and catalog the gems by Stephen C.
Hofer, the author and a gem expert from Stockbridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harlow called the work ``the most comprehensive to date in
the field'' of colored diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Bronstein, a New York gem merchant who assembled the Aurora
Collection, said the book created new systems for measuring and
classifying colored diamonds. ``It pushes the envelope on
diamond-grading science,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, owned by Harry Rodman, a 90-year-old New York
gold refiner, has been on loan to the museum and displayed almost
continuously since 1988, with new stones being added periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the New York museum will temporarily lose a little of its
luster. The Aurora Collection and the other diamonds from ``The
Nature of Diamonds'' exhibit will travel to the San Diego Natural
History Museum, where they will be on display from March 27 until
Sept. 7.

<P>
   Two Columbia University marine geologists, inviting incredulity,
came forward in 1996 with astonishing evidence suggesting that a
catastrophic flood of the Black Sea 7,600 years ago could have
played a pivotal role in the spread of early farming into Europe
and much of Asia. The deluge also may have cast such a long shadow
over succeeding cultures that it inspired the flood account in the
Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh and, in turn, the story of Noah in the
Book of Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   Now the geologists, Dr. William B. F. Ryan and Dr. Walter C.
Pitman III of Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in
Palisades, N. Y., say they have even more archeological, geological
and climate data to support their provocative thesis. They argue
their case in ``Noah's Flood: The New Scientific Discoveries About
the Event That Changed History,'' a book being published next week
by Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   While the authors have yet to win over skeptics of the Black Sea
flood's possibly sweeping influence on history, other scientists
have weighed in with new findings that seem to confirm the fact of
the flood itself. In about 5600 B.C., with rising global sea
levels, salt water from the Mediterranean and Aegean seas
apparently burst into the Black Sea, then a landlocked freshwater
lake. The Black Sea rose with terrifying swiftness, inundating more
than 60,000 square miles of coastal plains and giving the body of
water its current size and configuration.
</P>
<P>
   The thesis, however it is ultimately judged, has already
inspired a wave of archeological and other scientific research in
the previously neglected Black Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has captured the archeological community's attention and
enthusiasm,'' Ryan said in a recent interview. ``The atmosphere has
changed in just two years. People from many countries are keen to
take part in exploring the idea in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Working on Turkey's Black Sea coast at Sinop, Dr. Fredrik T.
Hiebert, a University of Pennsylvania archeologist, has detected
possible ruins of a Stone Age village that was submerged in the
flood. He is planning an expedition this summer to expand the
search for preflood settlements. One objective is to determine if
the people were farmers and so, as refugees from the deluge, might
have spread the practice of agriculture into Europe for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert D. Ballard, the oceanographer who used modern
underwater technologies to find and explore the Titanic wreck, is
preparing an ambitious survey of submerged Black Sea archeological
sites this summer. Ballard, formerly with the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod, is president of the
Institute for Exploration in Mystic, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Until Ryan and Pitman advanced their hypothesis, archeologists
had little reason to believe the preflood Black Sea shore was
particularly hospitable.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, moreover, new cores from the Greenland
ice cap have revealed that the world underwent a cold, arid period,
beginning in 6200 B.C. and ending about two centuries before the
flood. Archeological digs in the Middle East appear to show many
Neolithic settlements' being abandoned during this drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We speculate that this cold and arid period may have driven
people to the Black Sea as an oasis,'' Pitman said. ``They would
have brought farming with them to this water hole, so to speak, and
also exchanged ideas and languages.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the flood, Pitman said, happened to coincide with
archeological evidence of newcomers in the Balkans and in
northeastern Europe and with some of the earlier signs of
agriculture in these regions. Some pottery at these sites is
similar to that found near the Sea of Marmara in Turkey from around
the time of the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Making connections between people displaced by the flood and the
rise of agriculture in Europe _ even in Egypt and Central Asia _ is
the most controversial aspect of the Ryan-Pitman thesis. In a
review of the book in the current issue of Archaeology magazine,
Mark Rose, the managing editor, said the farming connection ``is
predicated on a huge archeological assumption'' that there was a
drought and it did force Middle Eastern farmers to find refuge on
the preflood Black Sea coast. He also noted that some farming had
already begun to appear in parts of Europe 500 years before the
putative flood.
</P>
<P>
   Rose concluded: ``If Ryan and Pitman are right about the
inundation of the Black Sea, they have made a real advance in our
understanding of the region's past. But making it Noah's flood and
claiming it was the `event that changed history' was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In other recent research, Dr. Gilles Lericolais, a French
oceanographer, led an expedition last spring that conducted more
seismic and echo-sounding probes of the submerged shelf off the
Black Sea coast. He discovered deep underwater canyons where the
Danube and Dnieper rivers had once cut deep to reach the declining
waters of the preflood Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish geologists recently reported evidence that, contrary to
most assumptions, the Bosporus Strait was cut at the time of the
flood and not before. At the end of the last ice age, more than
12,000 years ago, the outlet connecting the freshwater Black Sea to
the Mediterranean was probably a channel through the Sakarya River
to the Gulf of Izmit, an eastern arm of the Sea of Marmara. But
this passageway had closed well before the flood, leaving no outlet
for Black Sea's steadily evaporating and diminishing waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no way of knowing what caused the change,'' Ryan said.
The Sakarya outlet ``is on the Anatolian fault, so a slip of the
fault may have choked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, where the Bosporus flows today by Istanbul,
separating Europe and Asia, there was a low valley just before the
flood. Ryan and Pitman propose in their book that a natural dam
across the valley kept the ocean waters, rising since the melting
of ice-age glaciers, from entering the Black Sea basin. This, they
said, would explain why the world ocean did not make contact sooner
with the lowered Black Sea and why, when it did break through, the
event was so catastrophic and left such a deep scar as the Bosporus
Strait.

 By JOHN PEET  
 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It will be a crunch year for Europe's Union, the most important
since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957. The venture's biggest
step yet, the single currency, arrives in the shape of the euro on
Jan. 1, 1999.
 &HT;    Last May, when Europe's leaders picked 11 countries to join the
euro in the first wave, the mood was euphoric: economies were
growing strongly, inflation had been tamed, unemployment was
falling.
 &HT;    The Brussels summiteers congratulated themselves that the timing
set for the euro's birth was, perhaps fortuitously, the best they
could have dreamt of choosing.
 &HT;    How times have changed. For a while, European politicians
thought they were immune to the economic virus that first attacked
Asia and then spread to all other emerging markets. Many even
claimed that the euro was helping to protect them.
 &HT;    Now it is clear that the euro will come into the world at a
highly dangerous moment. The world economy is teetering on the
brink of its worst recession since the Second World War. The
financial markets have taken collective fright at anything smacking
of the remotest risk.
 &HT;    Neither Europe, nor its planned single currency, will escape.
Already, there are disturbing hints that the recoveries that began
in Germany and France in 1997 may peter out swiftly.
 &HT;    The euro could experience an unwelcome baptism of fire.
 &HT;    Yet although it will be singed in the process, it will not be
destroyed. That is, at least, because so much political capital and
practical business preparation have already been invested in it.
 &HT;    A failure of the euro now would provoke such a crisis as to tear
apart the European Union itself. That alone makes it unthinkable.
 &HT;    Even so, unless Germany, France and Italy, in particular, press
ahead with structural reforms to their labor markets, they will
find that the euro's impact on their economies is far more painful
than they currently expect.
 &HT;    Labor shakeouts and the competitive forces that the euro will
unleash may increase unemployment, just when European voters,
having put left-leaning parties in power in no fewer than 13 of the
EU's 15-member countries, are looking for it to fall.
 &HT;    Popular faith in the euro and in the new central bank will be
tested to the limit. It will become clear throughout 1999 just how
huge a change the euro will make in European business life: in
marketing or in accounting, in purchasing or in pricing, in bond or
stock markets, the euro will become ubiquitous.
 &HT;    Its main impact, which will not be fully felt until the currency
itself is in circulation in 2002, will be to increase competition,
to narrow prices, to save costs. Combine it with the impact of the
Internet, and European business is in for a revolutionary few
years.
 &HT;    The arrival of the euro would occupy a fullish agenda for the
European Union in any normal year. But in 1999, it will be only one
challenge among several.
 &HT;    By midyear the Union is supposed also to have sorted out the
farm-policy and budgetary reforms that are needed to prepare it for
eastward enlargement. This is likely to occasion a fight over money
between the Germans (with the Dutch acting as seconds) and the
French (with Spanish support).
 &HT;    The Germans hold that it is unjust that they, who have since
unification been merely the fifth-richest people in the EU, should
provide nearly 60 percent of all net contributions to the budget.
The Dutch, who pay even more per head, are equally aggrieved.
 &HT;    Expect this particular battle to end, after much shouting and
table-thumping, with the Germans backing down. Germany will remain
Europe's paymaster.
 &HT;    This row will further retard the Union's tortuous negotiations
over enlargement. But these have anyway been proceeding at a
snail's pace.
 &HT;    The unpalatable truth is that, although all European governments
subscribe to the strategic and moral case for admitting Poles,
Czechs, Hungarians and the rest to their club, none is comfortable
with the huge cost of such an expansion. And in the EU, money has
always, in the end, counted for more than idealism.
 &HT;    The chances of any aspiring country actually joining the Union
before 2005 are slight.
 &HT;    There will be no idealism in the third big piece of EU business:
the choice of new people at the top. A high representative for the
EU's common foreign policy will be chosen by early 1999.
 &HT;    Elections to the European Parliament will take place in June.
And a new European Commission president and membership, picked by
the 15 EU governments acting unanimously, will need to be in place
by the year's end.
 &HT;    This will see much nationalistic bargaining _ far from the
European dream.

   It will be a crunch year for Europe's Union, the most important
since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957. The venture's biggest
step yet, the single currency, arrives in the shape of the euro on
Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, when Europe's leaders picked 11 countries to join the
euro in the first wave, the mood was euphoric: economies were
growing strongly, inflation had been tamed, unemployment was
falling.
</P>
<P>
   The Brussels summiteers congratulated themselves that the timing
set for the euro's birth was, perhaps fortuitously, the best they
could have dreamt of choosing.
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed. For a while, European politicians
thought they were immune to the economic virus that first attacked
Asia and then spread to all other emerging markets. Many even
claimed that the euro was helping to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is clear that the euro will come into the world at a
highly dangerous moment. The world economy is teetering on the
brink of its worst recession since the Second World War. The
financial markets have taken collective fright at anything smacking
of the remotest risk.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Europe, nor its planned single currency, will escape.
Already, there are disturbing hints that the recoveries that began
in Germany and France in 1997 may peter out swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   The euro could experience an unwelcome baptism of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Yet although it will be singed in the process, it will not be
destroyed. That is, at least, because so much political capital and
practical business preparation have already been invested in it.
</P>
<P>
   A failure of the euro now would provoke such a crisis as to tear
apart the European Union itself. That alone makes it unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, unless Germany, France and Italy, in particular, press
ahead with structural reforms to their labor markets, they will
find that the euro's impact on their economies is far more painful
than they currently expect.
</P>
<P>
   Labor shakeouts and the competitive forces that the euro will
unleash may increase unemployment, just when European voters,
having put left-leaning parties in power in no fewer than 13 of the
EU's 15-member countries, are looking for it to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Popular faith in the euro and in the new central bank will be
tested to the limit. It will become clear throughout 1999 just how
huge a change the euro will make in European business life: in
marketing or in accounting, in purchasing or in pricing, in bond or
stock markets, the euro will become ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   Its main impact, which will not be fully felt until the currency
itself is in circulation in 2002, will be to increase competition,
to narrow prices, to save costs. Combine it with the impact of the
Internet, and European business is in for a revolutionary few
years.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the euro would occupy a fullish agenda for the
European Union in any normal year. But in 1999, it will be only one
challenge among several.
</P>
<P>
   By midyear the Union is supposed also to have sorted out the
farm-policy and budgetary reforms that are needed to prepare it for
eastward enlargement. This is likely to occasion a fight over money
between the Germans (with the Dutch acting as seconds) and the
French (with Spanish support).
</P>
<P>
   The Germans hold that it is unjust that they, who have since
unification been merely the fifth-richest people in the EU, should
provide nearly 60 percent of all net contributions to the budget.
The Dutch, who pay even more per head, are equally aggrieved.
</P>
<P>
   Expect this particular battle to end, after much shouting and
table-thumping, with the Germans backing down. Germany will remain
Europe's paymaster.
</P>
<P>
   This row will further retard the Union's tortuous negotiations
over enlargement. But these have anyway been proceeding at a
snail's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The unpalatable truth is that, although all European governments
subscribe to the strategic and moral case for admitting Poles,
Czechs, Hungarians and the rest to their club, none is comfortable
with the huge cost of such an expansion. And in the EU, money has
always, in the end, counted for more than idealism.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of any aspiring country actually joining the Union
before 2005 are slight.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no idealism in the third big piece of EU business:
the choice of new people at the top. A high representative for the
EU's common foreign policy will be chosen by early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Elections to the European Parliament will take place in June.
And a new European Commission president and membership, picked by
the 15 EU governments acting unanimously, will need to be in place
by the year's end.
</P>
<P>
   This will see much nationalistic bargaining _ far from the
European dream. &QL;

   &UR; When Vegetarianism Raises a Red Flag &LR;  There are many legitimate
reasons for eating vegetarian. But according to a recent article
published in the journal The Physician and Sports Medicine, the
practice of vegetarianism may be a red flag for eating disorders in
young athletic women.
</P>
<P>
   The article cited numerous studies that found an association
between meatless diets and eating disorders, including a 1997
Michigan survey of 107 female adolescents who did not eat meat and
214 who did. Those who did not eat meat were found to diet twice as
often, vomit four times as often and use laxatives eight times as
often as those in the meat-eating group. All of these practices are
commonly linked with eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and
bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Davis, vice president of research and program
development at the Renfrew Center, an eating disorder clinic, said
that young female athletes, especially competitive runners and
gymnasts, have a particularly high risk of developing an eating
disorder because of pressures to maintain lower body weight for
their sport. A study at the University of Akron found that more
than one quarter of female adolescent runners were unhappy with
their weight and felt pressure from their parents and coaches to be
thin.
</P>
<P>
   Though young men are much less likely to develop eating
disorders than women, athletically competitive boys may be at
higher risk than their nonathletic peers.
</P>
<P>
   A vegetarian diet by itself is not a cause for concern, Davis
said. ``It is not a problem unless coupled with superstitious
behaviors related to food and eating, which may indicate an
unhealthy, distorted relationship with food,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Elizabeth Somer, a registered dietitian, worries that
abstaining from meat without making suitable nutritional
replacements can result in serious problems like protein, iron and
zinc deficiencies, she is quick to point out that not all young
active women who remove meat from their diets do so as a prelude to
an eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   For young athletes who want to follow a vegetarian regimen,
Nancy Clark, a nutritional counselor at the Sports Medicine Clinic
in Brookline, Mass., recommends eating plenty of soy, beans and
other plant-based protein sources to replace meat protein; an
abundance of dark green leafy vegetables and tofu to meet iron
requirements, and generous amounts of whole grains and cereal
products to reach adequate zinc intake. She also advises taking a
daily multivitamin geared toward those on vegetarian diets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Taking Care of Those Bumps on the Head &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Like that favorite nursery rhyme egg, children commonly suffer
great falls not only off walls, but they also tumble from changing
tables, jungle gyms and down stairs. Older children bump heads on
playing fields or fall off bicycles. Most end up with only a bad
headache, but sometimes complications require emergency treatment
and hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves parents with this often perplexing question: When is
a head injury minor and when should it involve a trip to the
emergency room?
</P>
<P>
   The first thing a parent should do after a fall is find out what
happened, said Dr. Mary Aitken, lead author in a survey of what
physicians do when a head injury involves little or no loss of
consciousness or behavioral changes. This may include minor
concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anything other than the most minor blow, at least call the
doctor and observe the child carefully,'' she said. Nausea,
vomiting, dizziness, headache, loss of consciousness, seizures,
lethargy, irritability, swelling, bruising, bleeding and memory
loss may be signs of a serious problem. Most symptoms, she said,
surface within 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the doctors (82 percent) in the survey, published in the
December issue of The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent
Medicine, chose observation over more aggressive treatment like
X-rays or tomographic scanning. Of that group, most preferred that
observation take place at home over the hospital. Aitken urges
parents to call their doctor, discuss the child's symptoms, ask
what to do if the child's condition changes and, if it does, how to
reach the doctor. ``Generally, parents know their children best and
should help to assess them and to observe them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Minor head injuries, affecting about 375,000 American children a
year, involve children of all ages but most often active children
and those between 5 and 7, Aitken said. Prevention is even more
important than treatment, she said, pointing to the importance of
proper sports equipment, playgrounds designed for safety and
supervision. ``The main thing is to prevent the head injury in the
first place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Traffic-Ticket Writers as Stress Magnets &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever become livid at the sight of a parking
ticket anchored under the windshield wiper of his or her car will
not be surprised by what scientists have recently quantified: An
average of three times a day, a traffic-enforcement agent has a
hostile confrontation with a member of the public. Taking advantage
of this real-life laboratory, researchers at two New York
universities used parking-ticket writers to understand how heart
rate and blood pressure may change during verbal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   After equipping 115 New York traffic agents with blood pressure
cuffs that took readings every 15 minutes during the work day,
scientists discovered that any communication the agents engaged in
_ conversations with supervisors, the public, or co-workers _ led
to increases in blood pressure and heart rate when compared with
baseline readings taken at the start of the work day. Blood
pressure readings were highest during interactions with members of
the public, and the effects remained after contact ended, according
to the study, which appears this month in the journal
Psychophysiology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic agents unfortunately have a lot of interpersonal
conflicts with motorists who are angry about receiving tickets,''
said Dr. Elizabeth Brondolo of St. John's University in New York
City, who led the study along with researchers from the State
University of New York at Stony Brook. Negative interactions were
described as incidents in which agents were harassed, threatened,
yelled at, spit on, flirted with, insulted, pushed, followed or
hit. ``We wanted to see what their blood pressure was while they
were having these conflicts,'' Brondolo said.

   The world economy will grow faster in 1999 than it did in 1998.
Unfortunately, in Europe and America, it won't feel that way:
growth is going to be a bit slower in Europe and a lot slower in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery will happen mainly in Japan, the rest of Asia and
the other developing countries. The western industrial economies,
preoccupied with their own slowdowns, will hardly notice that
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   And the risk of a much worse outcome _ that of an outright
recession in the world economy _ does for once need to be taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is unavoidable, but this is less comforting than it
should be: governments have a proven ability to see a bad situation
and steer straight for it.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook and the risks turn mainly, as ever, on what happens
in the United States. Growth there is likely to slow from this
year's 3.5 percent to less than half as much in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly for cyclical reasons (after seven consecutive
years of growth, the American economy has run out of spare
capacity) and partly because of the financial squeeze that began in
the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders are shunning risk: the spread between what blue-chip
companies must pay for their loans and the rates charged to
less-safe borrowers is wider than for years.
</P>
<P>
   At least for the next few months, risky borrowers will find it
hard to get credit at any price. This will hit personal consumption
and corporate investment, the twin motors that have powered
America's expansion during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   If the fuel of easy credit has been cut off, why suppose that
growth in the United States will be even as high as, say, 1.5
percent? The answer is that monetary policy can be, and will be,
eased by enough to keep the motor running, albeit more gently than
of late.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in demand is going to slow in America, but if it slows
too much, the Federal Reserve can keep cutting interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being neither the risk of inflation nor
international considerations impinge on the Fed's freedom of
action. In the unlikely event that monetary stimulus fails to buoy
the economy, fiscal policy can be loosened.
</P>
<P>
   This is a rare luxury. America's budget is in surplus: cuts in
taxes and increases in public spending should they be needed, are
readily affordable.
</P>
<P>
   So far as the rest of the world is concerned, the more American
interest rates fall, and the dollar with them, the better. This
will allow greater scope for monetary easing elsewhere, without
renewed pressure on currencies or debt burdens.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has already
shown that he is willing to act. And Congress will not need to be
told twice to loosen fiscal policy (always popular) should an
abrupt slowdown require it.
</P>
<P>
   This blend of competence at the Fed and opportunism on Capitol
Hill should be enough to keep American economic policy on about the
right course.
</P>
<P>
   The main danger that governments will make matters worse, out of
either neglect or stupidity, lies elsewhere: in Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Henceforth interest rates for the 11 members of the euro system
will be set not by national central banks but by the European
Central Bank in Frankfurt. The new institution will want to
establish its reputation as a fighter of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Under ordinary circumstances it would be right to emphasize
monetary rigor. But today's circumstances are extraordinary.
Europe's stock markets are nervous and its banks are under strain.
Undue concern for credibility may lead the ECB to err on the side
of higher interest rates. It would be better in the first half of
1999 if it erred the other way.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Japan. Its irrepressibly incompetent leaders,
having done so much harm to their own economy and to others in the
region, may yet succeed in bringing on a global recession.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the Fed does the right thing, Japan remains the biggest
single danger in the global outlook.
</P>
<P>
   If the government had acted promptly to resolve its banking
problems when they first surfaced years ago, the economy would have
recovered already, and the Asian emerging-markets' slump would have
been far milder.
</P>
<P>
   The illness might not have spread to Russia, and from there to
other developing countries. The flight from risk worldwide, and the
astonishing volatility in financial markets witnessed towards the
end of 1998, might never have happened.
</P>
<P>
   On balance Japan is likely to recover in 1999, assuming that the
government does no more than muddle through. However, when the
government at last comes to execute its plan, such as it is, for
reviving the country's crippled banks, it may fumble.
</P>
<P>
   If the misplaced confidence of Japanese savers finally
evaporates, and runs on the banks begin in earnest, the prospect of
even a puny Japanese expansion will evaporate too.
</P>
<P>
   In the balance lie not just the prospects for growth but a
question that matters even more in the longer term: whether the
newly established pro-market consensus in economic policy worldwide
will be entrenched or swept away.
</P>
<P>
   The decade since the dismantling of the Berlin Wall has
witnessed a shift towards liberal trade and market economics in
Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, even in the once-socialist
parties of the West European ``left.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, unconverted collectivists all over the world are rejoicing
at what they see as the failure of global capitalism. In a way,
they are right.
</P>
<P>
   It is futile to point out that the forces causing the slowdown
have been failures of government more than failures of the market:
politically, that counts for nothing. If the present slowdown
becomes the depression of 1999, watch out for a backlash against
the liberal consensus.
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising and encouraging that, so far at least, the
collectivists have not been getting their way. Much of Asia has
experienced a savage recession: only Malaysia has deliberately set
its face against the new orthodoxy (by introducing draconian
controls on capital flows).
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the region, less government rather than more is
still thought to be the best way forward. There are no signs yet of
rising demand for protection in trade. Europe's ``new left''
governments remain _ in some cases reluctantly, in others out of
conviction _ conservative pro-market governments cloaked in
harmless ``third way'' rhetoric. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   If the misplaced confidence of Japanese savers finally
evaporates, and runs on the banks begin in earnest, the prospect of
even a puny Japanese expansion will evaporate too.
</P>
<P>
   In the balance lie not just the prospects for growth but a
question that matters even more in the longer term: whether the
newly established pro-market consensus in economic policy worldwide
will be entrenched or swept away.
</P>
<P>
   The decade since the dismantling of the Berlin Wall has
witnessed a shift towards liberal trade and market economics in
Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, even in the once-socialist
parties of the West European ``left.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, unconverted collectivists all over the world are rejoicing
at what they see as the failure of global capitalism. In a way,
they are right.
</P>
<P>
   It is futile to point out that the forces causing the slowdown
have been failures of government more than failures of the market:
politically, that counts for nothing. If the present slowdown
becomes the depression of 1999, watch out for a backlash against
the liberal consensus.
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising and encouraging that, so far at least, the
collectivists have not been getting their way. Much of Asia has
experienced a savage recession: only Malaysia has deliberately set
its face against the new orthodoxy (by introducing draconian
controls on capital flows).
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the region, less government rather than more is
still thought to be the best way forward. There are no signs yet of
rising demand for protection in trade. Europe's ``new left''
governments remain _ in some cases reluctantly, in others out of
conviction _ conservative pro-market governments cloaked in
harmless ``third way'' rhetoric. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For much of the 1990s America enjoyed a
``Goldilocks'' economy: hot enough to keep unemployment falling and
profits high, but not so sizzling that inflation sparked.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by this magic combination, stock prices and consumer
confidence reached unprecedented highs.
</P>
<P>
   That will all change in 1999, when Americans will be rudely
reminded that Goldilocks was, after all, a fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   Buffeted by turmoil abroad and tetchy financial markets at home,
the economy will slow sharply. But only if American consumers lurch
from irrational exuberance to an equally exaggerated pessimism will
the country face a recession.
</P>
<P>
   And only if policymakers show an extraordinary ineptitude will
the recession be a bad one. For America will be well placed to deal
with the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Slower economic growth in 1999 was always to be expected. With
unemployment at historic lows, America is simply running out of
workers required to fuel the 3.5 percent growth rates of recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   A return to trend growth rates (2-2.5 percent), or even slightly
below, would be a welcome relief. Unfortunately, 1999's slowdown
will go much beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   One big drag will come from the trade deficit. With much of Asia
in economic depression and Latin America facing sharp recession,
the demand for American exports will plummet. Imports from
countries with cheap currencies will remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, America's current-account deficit will balloon,
perhaps reaching $300 billion in 1999, almost twice its level of
1997. This will hurt manufacturers of every stripe _ from Coca-Cola
to Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Although emerging markets usually provide only a small share of
big corporations' profits, they helped underpin rosy forecasts.
With recession across the globe, expect disappointing earnings and
headline-grabbing layoffs from big multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Main Street will also hunker down, as America's
firms finally end the capital-spending spree that has characterized
the expansion so far. Encouraged by easy access to finance and
strong earnings, business investment rose by an average of 10
percent a year in real terms between 1993 and mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors will ensure that capital spending is, at best,
flat in 1999. The prospects of a slowdown and lower levels of
capacity use will limit firms' incentives for further investment.
</P>
<P>
   Even if America is spared a full-blown credit crunch, finance
will be more expensive and harder to come by for all but the most
blue-chip corporate borrowers. Declining profits will mean that
firms have fewer internal resources to fund their capital spending.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1999, the Y2K phenomenon may buoy capital spending as
laggard firms still race to get their computer systems in order.
Towards the end of the year it will dampen investment as firms
delay their spending until the millennium's uncertainties are over.
</P>
<P>
   America's shoppers, fortunately, will do no such thing. The man
from Peoria will react to the increasing economic gloom with
prudence but with none of the panic that has afflicted the denizens
of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer confidence will wane in 1999 but, judged by historical
standards, will remain on the high side. The growth in consumer
spending will fall back in line with growth in incomes. The saving
rate will stabilize and perhaps rise slightly. But it will not
shoot up.
</P>
<P>
   Most spending is done by the affluent, whose piggy banks _
despite recent stock market losses _ have still posted remarkable
gains during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of joblessness will be too small to affect consumer
demand, for even with a sharp slowdown the unemployment rate will
barely top 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this decade Americans' appetite for consumption has
exceeded expectations, and 1999 will be no different.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Alan Greenspan, a man concerned with his place in
history, the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates vigorously
in 1999. With inflation regarded as a distant threat, the key
short-term interest rate will be below 4 percent by the end of the
year. This will shore up the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   It will, however, mean a more volatile and generally weaker
dollar, as the credibility-conscious European Central Bank follows
a stricter monetary policy than the Federal Reserve, and as
investors fret about the size of America's current-account deficit.
</P>
<P>
   1999 will also see much talk of tax cuts. As the economy slows,
Republicans especially will be pushing hard to boost consumer
demand through lower taxes. Although the Clinton administration
will continue with the rallying cry of ``Save Social Security
First,'' it will be keen to boost the economy in the year before a
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Given America's labyrinthine budgetary system, it will be autumn
1999 before any tax cuts are enacted. Add this fiscal stimulus to
the accommodating monetary policy and America will end 1999 with
all the preconditions in place for a sharp bounce-back in
confidence and spending. &QL;

   &UR; Avoiding Colds &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there any way to keep from getting a cold?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are no guarantees, but there are some ways to cut your
risks. The most important are avoiding crowds, especially during
the peak cold seasons of September, late January and April;
avoiding people who obviously have colds; avoiding shaking hands
with people who might have them; avoiding rubbing the nose and
eyes, and washing your hands, washing your hands, washing your
hands.
</P>
<P>
   These precautions may help because of the way colds are often
spread: not just through infected droplets in the air but through
virus particles carried by hand to eye and nose membranes, which
the viruses can cross to invade the body.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Medical Association, the greatest
share of colds are caused by rhinoviruses (about a third) and
coronaviruses (about 10 percent.) Rhinoviruses seem to spread best
in droplets from a runny nose, though they may also be sprayed by
coughs and sneezes.
</P>
<P>
   Once virus particles land on a surface or someone's hands, they
may remain active for several hours. Then the virus can go from
hand to face to eye and nose membranes.
</P>
<P>
   Someone with a cold can be contagious even before signs of
illness appear and for a couple of days after it is obvious, so one
cannot entirely prevent colds by avoiding people with symptoms, but
it helps.
</P>
<P>
   Other useful measures are eating a balanced diet, which is
associated with a lower susceptibility, and staying away from
children, who get five to eight cold infections a year. Those
younger than 2 have the most.
</P>
<P>

a stricter monetary policy than the Federal Reserve, and as
investors fret about the size of America's current-account deficit.
</P>
<P>
   1999 will also see much talk of tax cuts. As the economy slows,
Republicans especially will be pushing hard to boost consumer
demand through lower taxes. Although the Clinton administration
will continue with the rallying cry of ``Save Social Security
First,'' it will be keen to boost the economy in the year before a
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Given America's labyrinthine budgetary system, it will be autumn
1999 before any tax cuts are enacted. Add this fiscal stimulus to
the accommodating monetary policy and America will end 1999 with
all the preconditions in place for a sharp bounce-back in
confidence and spending. &QL;

AMERICAN WORDS ENRICH THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANK ABATE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ever since Oxford University Press set up a
U.S.-based office for dictionaries in 1996, its American
lexicographers have been compiling lists and gathering evidence
from newspapers, magazines, broadcast sources, the Internet and
World Wide Web _ even from advertising such as billboards and
grocery coupons.
</P>
<P>
   All are legitimate sources for documenting new-word use. This
American material, along with citations from Oxford's North
American Reading Program (which, from its inception in the
mid-1980s, now has collected nearly a million terms of U.S. origin)
adds richly to the language resources that make up the global scope
of the Oxford Database of World English.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford lexicographers in America are tracking these recent
additions to the language, each of which has some popularity, and
watching developments closely:
</P>
<P>
   _ 24/7 _ hours a day/days a week, as in, ``we are on duty
24/7.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Casual Friday or dress-down Friday _ catching on in more
offices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Duh! _ now widespread as an expression of mocking disbelief
over someone else's folly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Laser pointer _ gadget once used only in presentations, now
maliciously.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mouthfeel _ used to describe the texture of a food in the
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Plus size _ of larger clothing sizes, especially in women's
fashions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pop-up video _ a cable channel is devoted to these.
</P>
<P>
   _ Slamming _ illicit switching of one's long-distance telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Other words under consideration are not really that new, but do
not appear in current editions of Oxford dictionaries, sometimes
because of their informal status:
</P>
<P>
   _ Class act _ classy person as in ``What a class act she is!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Designated driver _ when a group goes out for drinks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fat city _ ``Now we're in fat city!'' meaning, ``We've really
made it big.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Hissy fit _ ``She had a hissy fit over it''; used by and of
women, disparagingly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nowheresville _ ``This town is nowheresville''; i.e., a real
one-horse town.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parse _ to analyze language, now used of political speech.
</P>
<P>
   _ Piece of work _ ``He's a real piece of work!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Punkin _ as a term of endearment; for ``pumpkin.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Take-no prisoners _ adjective, of a ruthless attitude.
</P>
<P>
   _ Timeout _ a form of discipline for children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Worst nightmare _ usually said as a threat: ``I'm your worst
nightmare!''
</P>
<P>
   Oxford also looks to technical and specialist fields, always
rife with new developments. For example, the field of alternative
medicine has taken off, and many plants, long entered in
dictionaries for their botanical status, now have a medicinal use,
and these entries now need editing (e.g., St. John's wort, saw
palmetto).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the following (from electronics and computers) may be
unfamiliar, but are often just the words someone needs to look up
when reading an article, etc.:
</P>
<P>
   _ Closed-captioned _ as seen on TV.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cyber- and e- _ as in cyberspace and e-mail; these prefixes
continue to be productive.
</P>
<P>
   _ HDTV _ high-definition television, now available commercially.
</P>
<P>
   _ USB port _ newer type of connection for computer peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   _ XML _ latest generation of computer mark-up language for
multimedia.

<P>
   BANGKOK _ The past year was the most miserable that South-East
Asia has suffered in a generation. 1999 could be worse; certainly
it will be no better.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the financial markets have seen their most
panic-striken days. The runs on regional stock markets and
currencies that began with the devaluation of the Thai baht in July
1997 have given way to what looks almost like stability.
</P>
<P>
   But it is like the calm of a city devastated by an air-raid. The
rubble keeps piling up even as the rebuilding work starts. And
there is still the fear of unexploded bombs.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1998, total market capitalization on the Thai Stock
Exchange was worth, in dollar terms, less than 15 percent of its
value three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian market had achieved a similar drop in little more
than a year. Across the region, banks find themselves sinking under
the growing weight of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Crippled by a collapse in domestic demand, high interest rates,
and foreign borrowing made prohibitively expensive by currency
devaluations, more and more companies are unable to pay their
debts. Many banks have become insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   1999 will be a year of overdue political change _ throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand the fragile government of Chuan Leekpai is unlikely
to wait until 2000 before calling polls under a new constitution
that, in theory, should curb vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
   In Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, is expected to
call elections in early 1999, ahead of the triennial leadership
contest in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Having purged himself of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who was also
his most likely successor, Mahathir's grip on power seems secure.
But the reaction to Anwar's dismissal, amid a bewildering array of
allegations of sexual, financial and even treacherous wrongdoing,
showed how even Mahathir may have underestimated the latent
opposition to his rule.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada, elected in May
1998, may be wishing he had stayed in show business, where he made
his name playing tough guys.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines, initially among the more robust regional
economies when the crisis struck, is looking weaker, partly because
of doubts about Estrada's own ability, and his apparent penchant
for cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   The poorest countries in the region _ Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia
and Myanmar _ appear, on the surface, least affected by the
economic downturn. They are less vulnerable to capital flight if
only because their opening to the outside world is so much more
inchoate.
</P>
<P>
   But 1999 will be a disaster for them, too. Cambodia and Myanmar,
in particular, are governed by thuggish soldiers and bandits who
face external revulsion and the loathing of many of their own
people.
</P>
<P>
   In both places a confrontation between the state and the people
is likely to erupt in 1999; an explosion made more likely by the
drying up of foreign business interest and languishing economies.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia and Myanmar are also at the heart of a debate about the
way countries in the region behave towards each other.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of expanding the regional club, the Association of
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to include all ten countries of
the geographical area may well be achieved in December 1998, with
Cambodia's admission. But the coup there in July 1997, and
Myanmar's international isolation, have raised questions about
ASEAN's ``cardinal principle'': non-interference in other
countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   At ASEAN's annual meeting in Singapore in July 1999, the more
democratic members, notably Thailand and the Philippines, will
renew their campaign for a less inhibited approach to other
countries' domestic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The more authoritarian members, such as Vietnam and Myanmar,
will resist changing club rules so soon after their own accession.
But ASEAN is acutely conscious of its own failure to contribute to
economic recovery _ partly a result of its hands-off approach.
</P>
<P>
   It is galling for leaders who expected to be riding the crest of
the wave of the ``Pacific century'' to find themselves reduced to
international beggars, hoping the West, and the United States in
particular, will rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   There is also, increasingly, the risk of a nationalist backlash.
Already Mahathir, its foremost spokesman, has imposed strict
capital controls, in the hope of isolating his country from market
forces, and forestalling a cap-in-hand call on the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   His experiment may succeed in the short term, by postponing,
Japanese-fashion, a painful but essential economic restructuring.
That will lead to mounting pressure for similar measures in those
countries _ that is, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines _ which
have adopted IMF orthodoxy, and have tried to combat collapse by
opening, rather than closing, markets.
</P>
<P>
   But in the whole region there is a feeling that recovery is now
out of their own hands. The biggest threats lie in Japan, which may
remain bogged down in its own financial quagmire; in China, where
devaluation may be the only way to stimulate a moribund domestic
economy; and in the markets of the West, which woke up belatedly to
the deflationary forces swirling out of Asia. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fresh off the launching pad, two new spacecraft are heading for
Mars as part of a 16-year effort to determine once and for all if
life ever arose on the red planet. The two probes make up a second
wave of inquiry, the first having begun in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Mars harbors life was first asked
centuries ago when astronomers turned increasingly powerful
telescopes on the heavens and found that the reddish planet has
seasons, icy poles and other Earthlike features. Such similarities
have made Mars the main place in the solar system to look for signs
of extraterrestrial life. So far, however, no convincing evidence
has come to light.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Climate Orbiter was launched from Florida on Dec. 11,
and the Mars Polar Lander followed two days ago, on Jan. 3. Both
were designed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
The pair, which cost the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration $357 million to build, launch and run, are to arrive
at the red planet this September and December.
</P>
<P>
   While unlikely to top the Mars Pathfinder rover in terms of
action and spectacle, which riveted millions of computer and
television viewers in July 1997, the pair of spacecraft are meant
to advance the exploratory hunt in important ways. For instance,
the lander spacecraft is to probe deep beneath the Martian surface
in search of water, which is considered the crucial ingredient for
life.
</P>
<P>
   Over at least 16 years, and perhaps longer, the new explorations
of Mars are to involve more than a dozen spacecraft, thousands of
scientists and billions of dollars. No other effort so large and
systematic has marked the recent history of planetary exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Only once before has the United States fixed its powers so
intently on a single planetary body _ the Moon. That series of
spacecraft included the Rangers, Surveyors and Apollos, each one
more ambitious than its predecessor. The effort culminated in
manned landings from 1969 to 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, exploration of the planets evolved haphazardly over
the decades as American probes flew to Mercury, Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the victim of the next program we had to sell,''
Daniel S. Goldin, the NASA administrator, said of previous decades
of space exploration. ``Now we have a vision and a strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The piecemeal nature of previous projects caused designers to
make each craft big and costly, and that often inadvertently left
them vulnerable to political whims and uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people involved thought they'd never go again, so they'd
put on every possible instrument,'' said Dr. Bruce C. Murray, a
former director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and now a
scientist at the California Institute of Technology. ``Missions got
too complicated, and cost too much, because there was a feeling
there was no tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Mars undertaking involves a series of relatively
low-cost probes compared to earlier spacecraft, which cost about $1
billion each.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of the new probes are to build upon one another to
form a scientific foundation for finally answering the life riddle.
</P>
<P>
   Pathfinder studied rocks. Mars Polar Lander will look for water
by digging into icy terrain near the planet's south pole. If the
funding continues, later craft are to collect rocky samples from
promising sites and return them to Earth. Scientists will then
search for signs of microscopic life, either fossil or extant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become the intellectual centerpiece of NASA's space
exploration program,'' said Dr. Bruce Jakosky, a planetary
scientist at the University of Colorado who does research for NASA.
A series of science breakthroughs in the past decade, he added,
have made the discovery of life on Mars ``very plausible.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerted push to solve the life puzzle has prompted Japan,
France and the European Space Agency to add their own spacecraft to
the fleet, at times in partnership with the United States.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Relatively warm and wet in its early days billions of years ago,
the surface of Mars is now an icy red desert etched by old river
beds and flood plains that bespeak torrents of water. Scientists
see the planet as a possible home for microbial life, especially if
the planet's interior is still warm and if water is still flowing
through rocky regions down below, as it does on Earth in aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   Mars Polar Lander, the most recent craft to join the hunt, is to
zoom across 470 million miles of space, traveling about 2,000 times
farther than the distance between the Earth and the Moon. It is
remarkably compact, as was evident last month inside a cavernous
building at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of the squat bundle being readied for launching
suggested that the spacecraft would be able to extend tripod legs,
solar panels, a camera mast and a long arm to form a gangly robot
some 12 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John McNamee, the program manager for the lander and
orbiter, moved around the folded craft in a clean suit, booties,
plastic gloves and a face mask meant to keep his germs from
inadvertently making the trek to Mars and contaminating the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The compact lander, he said, is a good example of NASA's resolve
to do more with less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about half the price, half the mass and able to do much
more science'' than its forerunner, Mars Pathfinder, McNamee said.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless push for lower costs, McNamee added, means the
lander will use regular rockets to slow its descent rather than
innovative air bags, as Pathfinder did when it repeatedly bounced
on the rocky surface before coming to a halt. Air bags weigh more,
and thus cost more to hurl into space.
</P>
<P>
   Bulging outward from the craft were two spheres about the size
of basketballs. These were microprobes, hitchhikers that will be
fired from the lander just before it enters the Martian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The microprobes will get there faster because they don't have
parachutes or rockets,'' McNamee said. ``They just go right in.''
</P>
<P>
   A first for the exploration of space, the microprobes are to
slam into Mars at about 400 hundred miles per hour, shattering
their protective shells.
</P>
<P>
   The wide upper part of each probe, with antenna, circuits and
batteries, will stop abruptly at the surface. But an inner,
bullet-shaped projectile, linked to the upper part by a cable, will
crash through soil, rock and ice as deep as three or four feet.
</P>
<P>
   The projectile is laden with sensors. An accelerometer will
measure how fast it comes to rest, telling of soil hardness and
revealing any layers of dust, rock and ice. Temperature sensors
will tell how well the Martian soil conducts heat, giving clues to
its composition.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a tiny drill will emerge from the side of the
projectile to sample the soil, heat it and look for water vapor.
That finding would be a first, greatly improving the odds that
microbes might thrive in the alien soil.
</P>
<P>
   About a minute or so after the probes hit, the lander is to
settle down gently some 60 miles away but still near the icy south
pole. A stereo camera atop a five-foot mast will scan the
surrounding landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The lander's flexible arm is more than six feet long and can dig
down as much as two or three feet to retrieve soil samples . In
eight tiny ovens on the lander, soil will be heated and analyzed
for the presence of icy water and carbon dioxide, the main
component of the thin Martian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Ice at the poles, never before sampled, is thought to be a mix
of water and carbon dioxide in a sort of frozen seltzer.
</P>
<P>
   The lander is to operate for up to 90 days, and the microprobes
for a few hours or days. Their downward probing is expected to
reveal layered terrain that, like tree rings, sheds light on the
seasonal variations of Mars, its climatic past and whether
conditions there were ever favorable for the maintenance of life.
</P>
<P>
   Readings from the microprobes and the lander will be relayed to
Earth by the Mars Climate Orbiter and the Mars Global Surveyor, an
orbiting craft that reached the planet during the first exploratory
wave. Both orbiters are to map the planet and search for good
landing sites.
</P>
<P>
   The surveyor craft has already discovered a region some 300
miles wide that contains large deposits of the mineral hematite, a
rock consisting of tiny crystals of iron oxide that on Earth
typically originate in hot or standing water. Scientists consider
the region a good place to look for evidence of life and are
discussing whether to send a lander there, and possibly one of the
missions meant to return rocky samples to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists say that Mars, despite its deserts and hostile
surface, may ultimately be found to harbor regions aswarm with
alien microbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big believer that there is life elsewhere,'' McNamee
said. ``Out of the billions of places that there are in this entire
universe, I don't believe that this is the one lucky place where it
happened.''

<P>
   BANGKOK _ The past year was the most miserable that South-East
Asia has suffered in a generation. 1999 could be worse; certainly
it will be no better.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the financial markets have seen their most
panic-striken days. The runs on regional stock markets and
currencies that began with the devaluation of the Thai baht in July
1997 have given way to what looks almost like stability.
</P>
<P>
   But it is like the calm of a city devastated by an air-raid. The
rubble keeps piling up even as the rebuilding work starts. And
there is still the fear of unexploded bombs.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1998, total market capitalization on the Thai Stock
Exchange was worth, in dollar terms, less than 15 percent of its
value three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian market had achieved a similar drop in little more
than a year. Across the region, banks find themselves sinking under
the growing weight of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Crippled by a collapse in domestic demand, high interest rates,
and foreign borrowing made prohibitively expensive by currency
devaluations, more and more companies are unable to pay their
debts. Many banks have become insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   1999 will be a year of overdue political change _ throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand the fragile government of Chuan Leekpai is unlikely
to wait until 2000 before calling polls under a new constitution
that, in theory, should curb vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
   In Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, is expected to
call elections in early 1999, ahead of the triennial leadership
contest in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Having purged himself of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who was also
his most likely successor, Mahathir's grip on power seems secure.
But the reaction to Anwar's dismissal, amid a bewildering array of
allegations of sexual, financial and even treacherous wrongdoing,
showed how even Mahathir may have underestimated the latent
opposition to his rule.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada, elected in May
1998, may be wishing he had stayed in show business, where he made
his name playing tough guys.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines, initially among the more robust regional
economies when the crisis struck, is looking weaker, partly because
of doubts about Estrada's own ability, and his apparent penchant
for cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   The poorest countries in the region _ Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia
and Myanmar _ appear, on the surface, least affected by the
economic downturn. They are less vulnerable to capital flight if
only because their opening to the outside world is so much more
inchoate.
</P>
<P>
   But 1999 will be a disaster for them, too. Cambodia and Myanmar,
in particular, are governed by thuggish soldiers and bandits who
face external revulsion and the loathing of many of their own
people.
</P>
<P>
   In both places a confrontation between the state and the people
is likely to erupt in 1999; an explosion made more likely by the
drying up of foreign business interest and languishing economies.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia and Myanmar are also at the heart of a debate about the
way countries in the region behave towards each other.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of expanding the regional club, the Association of
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to include all ten countries of
the geographical area may well be achieved in December 1998, with
Cambodia's admission. But the coup there in July 1997, and
Myanmar's international isolation, have raised questions about
ASEAN's ``cardinal principle'': non-interference in other
countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   At ASEAN's annual meeting in Singapore in July 1999, the more
democratic members, notably Thailand and the Philippines, will
renew their campaign for a less inhibited approach to other
countries' domestic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The more authoritarian members, such as Vietnam and Myanmar,
will resist changing club rules so soon after their own accession.
But ASEAN is acutely conscious of its own failure to contribute to
economic recovery _ partly a result of its hands-off approach.
</P>
<P>
   It is galling for leaders who expected to be riding the crest of
the wave of the ``Pacific century'' to find themselves reduced to
international beggars, hoping the West, and the United States in
particular, will rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   There is also, increasingly, the risk of a nationalist backlash.
Already Mahathir, its foremost spokesman, has imposed strict
capital controls, in the hope of isolating his country from market
forces, and forestalling a cap-in-hand call on the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   His experiment may succeed in the short term, by postponing,
Japanese-fashion, a painful but essential economic restructuring.
That will lead to mounting pressure for similar measures in those
countries _ that is, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines _ which
have adopted IMF orthodoxy, and have tried to combat collapse by
opening, rather than closing, markets.
</P>
<P>
   But in the whole region there is a feeling that recovery is now
out of their own hands. The biggest threats lie in Japan, which may
remain bogged down in its own financial quagmire; in China, where
devaluation may be the only way to stimulate a moribund domestic
economy; and in the markets of the West, which woke up belatedly to
the deflationary forces swirling out of Asia. &QL;

   &UR; Order on the Asphalt &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Highway traffic often resembles an amateur Indy 500, with
drivers speeding up, slowing down, changing lanes and passing in an
effort to reach their destinations sooner. But all that competitive
activity, it turns out, can work toward a collective good.
</P>
<P>
   Using computer simulations, scientists from the University of
Stuttgart and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in California
have discovered that a disorganized mix of cars and trucks,
traveling at different speeds and maneuvering to get ahead,
transforms itself into a coherent, and safer, block of traffic as
vehicle density reaches a certain point.
</P>
<P>
   In the simulations, which were backed up by real data from Dutch
highways, cars are able to pass without slowing down when there are
relatively few vehicles. As the density increases, with a
corresponding increase in slower-moving trucks and fewer large gaps
that allow for lane-changing, some cars will get stuck behind
trucks and have to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   When the critical density is reached, there are essentially no
large gaps, so all the vehicles are staying in their lanes and
traveling at a relatively slow speed.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers, writing in Nature, noted that once this
density is exceeded, some vehicles have to slow down even more to
maintain safe separation. This creates larger gaps, which allows
once more for lane-changing. Normal highway chaos ensues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Cosmic Panatela &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers studying the center of the Milky Way have found ...
a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   That is, a team of radio astronomers from Taiwan and the United
States has found that a region of hot gas at the center of the
galaxy is cigar-shaped, only one-fourth as wide as it is long.
</P>
<P>
   Most astronomers believe a black hole exists at the heart of the
Milky Way. In this view, the region of hot gas is a result of the
hole's immense gravitational pull. But the shape of the region is
puzzling and does not match theories about black holes. The
American-Taiwanese team suggests that some other mechanism _
perhaps a jet or a wind _ may be at work to explain the odd shape.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sudden Shift in the Forest &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ecological change often occurs slowly, over long periods. But a
study of a New Mexico forest shows that nature can sometimes do
fast work.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists studying 50 years of aerial photographs of a
6,000-acre site in Bandelier National Monument have shown that the
boundary zone between two ecosystems _ one dominated by ponderosa
pine, the other by pinon and juniper _ shifted more than a mile in
less than five years during the 1950's. The chief cause, they say,
was a severe drought that killed off many ponderosa pines.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers noted that studies of similar longer-term shifts
had focused on birth and growth of vegetation. Their study draws
attention to the role played by death and could have implications
for other regions as they undergo climate changes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ 1999 will be the year of Russia's disintegration. It
will not be complete. It is unlikely to be dramatic. But it will
certainly be damaging, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever happens in Moscow, whether Yevgeni Primakov
survives, or Boris Yeltsin lives, whether elections are held early,
on time, or at all, the big story in Russia will lie outside the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple. Russia's central government (federal by
name, but not by nature) is so corrupt and incompetent that all the
things which help hold big countries together _ patriotism,
economic self-interest and, ultimately, force _ have been weakening
catastrophically.
</P>
<P>
   1999 will be the year when regional leaders realize just how
powerful they are, and how weak is Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Disintegration is already further advanced than the West
realizes. Most of Russia's 89 constituent parts have passed local
laws which contradict, sometimes flagrantly, the Russian
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Their elected leaders already enjoy far more legitimacy in the
public eye than the squabbling cronies and has-beens who dominate
political life in the capital. In large chunks of Russia, the
center is at most a nuisance, in some cases all but irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's disintegration is driven not by nationalism, but by
economics. When the central government is rendering the currency
worthless, extorting unfair taxes, confiscating export revenues and
strangling imports, greater economic autonomy looks like the only
solution.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effects will be bad. The dead hand of the center
will be replaced by a no less pernicious bunch of meddlers in
regional government.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of 1998's financial crisis has been to speed up the
balkanization of Russia's internal market.
</P>
<P>
   Once a few local bosses start, for example, banning the export
of locally produced food, others lose out if they do not follow
suit. Why should Omsk send things to Tomsk, if only valueless
rubles come back in return?
</P>
<P>
   Trade between Russia's regions will therefore plunge _ at least
until they hit on a stable, trusted currency in which to do
business. That is hardly likely to be the ruble, and the planned
coupons and currencies which some regions have been planning look
equally unattractive substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   How much would a Urals franc be worth in Rostov-on-Don, or a
Saratov mark in Perm? Not a lot, at least at first. Eventually,
trade will have to be cleared in dollars or euros, or even a newly
stabilized ruble. But that will take time. Meanwhile, the Kremlin's
tax revenues and importance will shrivel even further.
</P>
<P>
   What will the center do? Not a lot. The sinews of power are
withered. The subsidies that Moscow pays to most regions have been
devalued. Primakov is trying to bring regional leaders into his
government. That is splendid for them, less so for the center's
ability to act decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn's collapse has also loosened Moscow's chokehold on
the financial system. The handful of banks with a nationwide
presence have lost any credibility. Why transfer money through the
center if it risks being stolen? The collapse in the Kremlin's
creditworthiness does the same for foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
   The use of force looks ever more unlikely _ what local soldier
or policeman will risk death to restore the Kremlin's rule? And any
appeal by the center to Russians' national feelings will rouse
nothing more than a cynical shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Yet foreign invasion, albeit of a peaceful and benevolent kind,
is exactly what Russia's regions should want. Foreign governments
and companies already find it easier to deal with regional
authorities than central government.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is greed and incompetence but there is also
competition. Stroppiness or sticky fingers among local leaders mean
that investment, or aid, goes elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Competition between regions will be the single most powerful
force for better government. It will also bring a simplification of
Russia's complicated structure. For small, impoverished bits of the
country, cozying up to one of Russia's dozen or so rich regions is
a better bet than hoping for help from the center. Expect some
mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase will be a clearer political engagement by the
outside world. Foreign governments are already aware that they
concentrated too much on the ``center'' in the past. Now they are
busy chatting up regional leaders, such as the go-ahead Vladimir
Prusak in Novgorod, whose region is home to a promising cluster of
new western factories.
</P>
<P>
   For all the Kremlin's squawks, nothing is more natural. After
all, foreign states dealing with Germany take the Bavarian
government seriously; in the United States the governors of
California and Texas are considerably more powerful and important
than plenty of politicians in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Expect a crop of new consulates, and plenty of high-level visits
to and fro as the world starts rethinking its political map of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And what will that map look like? Clearly, industrial countries
neighboring Russia, such as Japan and the United States in the far
east, or Scandinavia in Russia's northwest, will be ever more
heavily engaged with their next-door regions, both in trade and
investment, and in strengthening democracy and civil society.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's core, the cold muddy places a long way from anywhere,
risks being neglected. That is a pity. Without the friendship of
the outside world, or any restraining hand from the center, some of
Russia's new semi-independent regions will be pretty nasty places.
The corrupt, lawless and impoverished Maritime Territory, in
Russia's far east, is an ominous example.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the danger of ugly conflicts. These will not be
full-scale wars _ Russians' national feeling is still too strong.
But there will be arguments about infrastructure (``I've got the
pipeline, you've got the oil'') which will be fatal for business
confidence, if not for actual lives.
</P>
<P>
   Most worryingly, these new games take place amid many dangerous
toys _ tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, and a dozen or so
rusty nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping them safe and well-looked after as the country
rearranges itself is much more than Russia's crippled central
government can manage. Outsiders have already put money and effort
into this. More will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The probable decline in Russia's wealth in 1999 will be around
10 percent. Its banks are, without exception, bust. Its stock
markets, down to about one-tenth of the levels reached early in
1998, are dead in the water.
</P>
<P>
   It will take far longer than the coming 12 months for Russia to
win back the confidence of western investors or the IMF. So expect
yet another bleak and miserable year. &QL;

   Israeli police and secret service raided the two houses Sunday
night, arresting eight adults and six children. Monday, 11 were
ordered deported within three days back to the United States and
three were held for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the group was part of the Denver, Colo.-based
Concerned Christians cult and intended to commit ``violent acts''
late this year that would hasten the return of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that the three men brought before
a court Monday said they were peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not here to hurt anybody,'' a detained John Bayles told
the court.
</P>
<P>
   For the Israeli government, the Americans appeared to be a
preview of what this country of 5 million Jews -- and 1 million
Muslims -- may face during the upcoming anniversary of the
Christian millennium.
</P>
<P>
   As the government prepares for an expected 4 million visitors to
Israel this year -- twice the annual figure -- officials are on
alert about fanatics who connect the year 2000 with Biblical
predictions of the world's end.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Mansfield, director of the Religious Movement Resource
Center, which follows the Concerned Christians, said that these
members of the group may not be violent.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said their leader, Monte Kim Miller has recently
threatened people inside and outside the group. Miller, whose
whereabouts are unknown, tells his several dozen followers that he
will die in Jerusalem late this year and be resurrected. Mansfield
said the arrests would be useful if they cause even these 14
followers to leave Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli political scientist Ehud Sprinzak, who studies religious
extremists, said concern over the millennium fanatics is justified.
But, he said police overreacted to this group. A response
attributed to the Israeli police's lack of experience with
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Police evidence about those arrested Sunday is undisclosed and,
a police source said, much of the impetus for the raid came from
information about the group's beliefs passed on by U.S. law
enforcement officials, rather than crimes committed here. No
charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israeli Police Spokesman Elihu Ben-Onn said the group may
have been planning to attack police in the hopes of starting a
suicidal shoot-out that would send themselves to heaven and bring
them back resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that the group planned violence on Jerusalem's
Temple Mount. The site of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third most holy
site in Islam, this high ground in Jerusalem's walled Old City is
coveted also by some Jews who see it as the sacred site of their
ancient temple.
</P>
<P>
   Officials fear an attack on the mosque could provoke a
world-wide bloodletting between Moslems and Jews -- which some say
is the final conflagration before Christ returns.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Ben-Onn said the arrests Sunday might be ``just
the beginning'' of an effort by police preparing for the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Concerned Christians were first on their list. They were
sought in Israel since October, when about 80 members of the group
were known to have sold their homes and are missing.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Begin optional add.)
</P>
<P>
   Police took boxes of files from the house Sunday. A manila
folder found on the ground Monday contained loose-leaf notes and
diagrams, apparently for a presentation, connecting the sayings of
Charles Manson, a 1971 Los Angeles earthquake and Florida's 1992
Hurricane Andrew as signs ``of the impending judgment of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The literature seemed out of place in a neighborhood on the
western outskirts of Jerusalem that seemed peacefully like suburban
America.
</P>
<P>
   At the home in Mevasseret Zion, the children used to play in the
park across the street, with swings, slides and rocking horses on
springs.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors said they were friendly, but one disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were totally unsociable,'' said Rami Hanouni, 60. ``They
would even turn their heads when you looked at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanouni said the group had been there three or four months and
twice had brought in crates of food for dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, one bedroom of the house seemed sparse. There was
nothing on the walls and there were a few suitcases in a corner.
The bed was disheveled, possibly having been turned up in the
police search.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor contradicted Hanouni's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't seem weird in any way,'' said a 25-year-old
neighbor who would only identify herself as Hila.
</P>
<P>
   But, she agreed that the children were not in school and they
had vague reasons for coming there. The man introduced himself as
Terry Smith, from Colorado, who had sold his business and come to
Israel for a year because it was ``interesting.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ 1999 will be the year of Russia's disintegration. It
will not be complete. It is unlikely to be dramatic. But it will
certainly be damaging, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever happens in Moscow, whether Yevgeni Primakov
survives, or Boris Yeltsin lives, whether elections are held early,
on time, or at all, the big story in Russia will lie outside the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple. Russia's central government (federal by
name, but not by nature) is so corrupt and incompetent that all the
things which help hold big countries together _ patriotism,
economic self-interest and, ultimately, force _ have been weakening
catastrophically.
</P>
<P>
   1999 will be the year when regional leaders realize just how
powerful they are, and how weak is Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Disintegration is already further advanced than the West
realizes. Most of Russia's 89 constituent parts have passed local
laws which contradict, sometimes flagrantly, the Russian
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Their elected leaders already enjoy far more legitimacy in the
public eye than the squabbling cronies and has-beens who dominate
political life in the capital. In large chunks of Russia, the
center is at most a nuisance, in some cases all but irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's disintegration is driven not by nationalism, but by
economics. When the central government is rendering the currency
worthless, extorting unfair taxes, confiscating export revenues and
strangling imports, greater economic autonomy looks like the only
solution.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effects will be bad. The dead hand of the center
will be replaced by a no less pernicious bunch of meddlers in
regional government.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of 1998's financial crisis has been to speed up the
balkanization of Russia's internal market.
</P>
<P>
   Once a few local bosses start, for example, banning the export
of locally produced food, others lose out if they do not follow
suit. Why should Omsk send things to Tomsk, if only valueless
rubles come back in return?
</P>
<P>
   Trade between Russia's regions will therefore plunge _ at least
until they hit on a stable, trusted currency in which to do
business. That is hardly likely to be the ruble, and the planned
coupons and currencies which some regions have been planning look
equally unattractive substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   How much would a Urals franc be worth in Rostov-on-Don, or a
Saratov mark in Perm? Not a lot, at least at first. Eventually,
trade will have to be cleared in dollars or euros, or even a newly
stabilized ruble. But that will take time. Meanwhile, the Kremlin's
tax revenues and importance will shrivel even further.
</P>
<P>
   What will the center do? Not a lot. The sinews of power are
withered. The subsidies that Moscow pays to most regions have been
devalued. Primakov is trying to bring regional leaders into his
government. That is splendid for them, less so for the center's
ability to act decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn's collapse has also loosened Moscow's chokehold on
the financial system. The handful of banks with a nationwide
presence have lost any credibility. Why transfer money through the
center if it risks being stolen? The collapse in the Kremlin's
creditworthiness does the same for foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
   The use of force looks ever more unlikely _ what local soldier
or policeman will risk death to restore the Kremlin's rule? And any
appeal by the center to Russians' national feelings will rouse
nothing more than a cynical shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Yet foreign invasion, albeit of a peaceful and benevolent kind,
is exactly what Russia's regions should want. Foreign governments
and companies already find it easier to deal with regional
authorities than central government.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is greed and incompetence but there is also
competition. Stroppiness or sticky fingers among local leaders mean
that investment, or aid, goes elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Competition between regions will be the single most powerful
force for better government. It will also bring a simplification of
Russia's complicated structure. For small, impoverished bits of the
country, cozying up to one of Russia's dozen or so rich regions is
a better bet than hoping for help from the center. Expect some
mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase will be a clearer political engagement by the
outside world. Foreign governments are already aware that they
concentrated too much on the ``center'' in the past. Now they are
busy chatting up regional leaders, such as the go-ahead Vladimir
Prusak in Novgorod, whose region is home to a promising cluster of
new western factories.
</P>
<P>
   For all the Kremlin's squawks, nothing is more natural. After
all, foreign states dealing with Germany take the Bavarian
government seriously; in the United States the governors of
California and Texas are considerably more powerful and important
than plenty of politicians in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Expect a crop of new consulates, and plenty of high-level visits
to and fro as the world starts rethinking its political map of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And what will that map look like? Clearly, industrial countries
neighboring Russia, such as Japan and the United States in the far
east, or Scandinavia in Russia's northwest, will be ever more
heavily engaged with their next-door regions, both in trade and
investment, and in strengthening democracy and civil society.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's core, the cold muddy places a long way from anywhere,
risks being neglected. That is a pity. Without the friendship of
the outside world, or any restraining hand from the center, some of
Russia's new semi-independent regions will be pretty nasty places.
The corrupt, lawless and impoverished Maritime Territory, in
Russia's far east, is an ominous example.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the danger of ugly conflicts. These will not be
full-scale wars _ Russians' national feeling is still too strong.
But there will be arguments about infrastructure (``I've got the
pipeline, you've got the oil'') which will be fatal for business
confidence, if not for actual lives.
</P>
<P>
   Most worryingly, these new games take place amid many dangerous
toys _ tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, and a dozen or so
rusty nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping them safe and well-looked after as the country
rearranges itself is much more than Russia's crippled central
government can manage. Outsiders have already put money and effort
into this. More will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The probable decline in Russia's wealth in 1999 will be around
10 percent. Its banks are, without exception, bust. Its stock
markets, down to about one-tenth of the levels reached early in
1998, are dead in the water.
</P>
<P>
   It will take far longer than the coming 12 months for Russia to
win back the confidence of western investors or the IMF. So expect
yet another bleak and miserable year. &QL;

<P>
   SEATTLE _ For almost as long as it has existed, the television
business has been trying to transform inactive couch potatoes into
interactive program participants.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 1950s, American children's TV shows toyed with
interactivity, offering crude cellophane screen overlays on which
young viewers could sketch their own scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Television is now on the brink of a new interactive era. This
time it will fulfill its promise.
</P>
<P>
   Television has seen amazing progress in its half-century of
prime-time _ a period in which the number of TV sets worldwide has
soared to around 1.4 billion. Color TV, VCRs, stereo sound, cable
and satellite have transformed the way we watch the box.
</P>
<P>
   Yet its underlying technology has hardly changed. Most
transmissions still use the same old analog technology that
broadcast America's first TV shows in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Programs are displayed on the same old-fashioned cathode-ray
tubes. And a modern TV set still has no way of telling who, if
anyone, is watching the programs and advertisements flickering
across its screen. Magazine publishers know more about their
readers.
</P>
<P>
   All this is about to change, as terrestrial broadcasters, cable
companies and satellite operators begin moving to a new digital-TV
standard.
</P>
<P>
   1999 will see the start of a broad roll-out of digital
infrastructure and transmissions in both the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, broadcasters and cable companies will
offer digital TV in the top 30 markets in the United States, and
trials are already under way in several European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Digital TV, in turn, makes possible other significant
technological advances. It makes the lifelike images of
high-definition television (HDTV) a reality. It means that all the
shows you watch will start out as bits _ the same kind of ones and
zeros that are processed by your computer, making the two truly
compatible technologically.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to universal software and Internet standards, a new
generation of intelligent TV will blend the entertainment of
television with the interactivity of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors are also working in favor of intelligent TV. To
transmit instantaneously all those bits into and out of the TV in
your home or office, you'll need a high-bandwidth connection.
Usefully, the global supply of bandwidth is starting to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Cable-TV operators, telecoms companies and numerous new players
are building vast new fiber-optic networks that will, in time, link
almost every home and office in the United States and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Constellations of satellites will within a few years start
offering broadband two-way transmissions around the world. And
thanks to technologies such as ISDN and ADSL, even the aging
twisted-copper telephone line now packs more handwidth than
Alexander Graham Bell could ever have dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp pictures, better sound, instantaneous interactivity and
seamless integration between TV and the Web will all be for nothing
if the programming does not meet viewers' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the intelligent-TV industry has learned a lot from its
earlier unsuccessful interactive trials, and from what works best
on the Web. That is why the pilot programming which is now being
enhanced for this coming generation of intelligent TV will offer
viewers much more than another way to order in pizza.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while watching your favorite football team, you
will be able to click on the remote control and call up a menu on
your TV screen, much like the ones computer users are familiar
with.
</P>
<P>
   It will wrap around two sides of a slightly shrunken picture, so
you will still be able to watch the game. But at the same time you
will also be able to do lots of other things.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you could call up details from a related Web site
about players, watch replays and get scores from other games; order
merchandise related to the game; or simply read the general news
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps you will be watching a favorite sitcom, and want a
reminder of last week's plot, or a biography of one of the
characters, or to buy a sweater just like the one you've seen on
the screen. And during the commercial break, you may go on another
online shopping spree, thanks to the prompting of an interactive
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Then your children might want to watch an educational program,
and again they'll be able to download information, do online
research to help with their homework, and ask questions
interactively.
</P>
<P>
   Many TV shows these days are deficit-financed, and rely on broad
syndication to make a profit. Interactivity offers new revenue
streams _ for example, from commissions on online merchandise
sales, which are likely to become one of the biggest sources of
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent TV also allows program makers to add value to
reruns. Thanks to universal Internet and software standards, it
will be possible to add interactive content to existing programs at
very low cost. That will attract additional viewers and, as a
result, extra advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Three generations of adults grew up expecting TV to be a
passive, one-way experience, but today's viewers are increasingly
living a Web lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   They expect their entertainment to be interactive, two-way and
customized to meet their needs _ which is why more than 400,000
people already use Microsoft's WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   Some research shows that those children who have a computer at
home watch less conventional TV _ they prefer interactivity, they
want to be in control.
</P>
<P>
   But for intelligent TV to succeed, it will also have to be easy
to use. The biggest market, at least initially, may be for what
some observers have called ``lazy interactive TV.''
</P>
<P>
   So the interface must be really simple _ nothing more
complicated than today's remote control. And eventually the
television, like computers, will use a more natural interface. It
will respond to voice commands and incorporate an ``intelligent
assistant'' that will learn your likes and dislikes, and help you
find programs.
</P>
<P>
   The TV will also become one of the main interfaces for your
home's local network, controlling everything from lighting and
heating to the security system.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of what you can now do on a computer in your office _ such
as e-mail _ you will also be able to do via TV from the comfort of
your couch. Flat-screen technology will make it possible for an
unobtrusive wall-mounted TV screen to be built into every room.
</P>
<P>
   Within a decade intelligent TV will be as familiar as the Web is
today. &QL;

generation of intelligent TV will blend the entertainment of
television with the interactivity of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors are also working in favor of intelligent TV. To
transmit instantaneously all those bits into and out of the TV in
your home or office, you'll need a high-bandwidth connection.
Usefully, the global supply of bandwidth is starting to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Cable-TV operators, telecoms companies and numerous new players
are building vast new fiber-optic networks that will, in time, link
almost every home and office in the United States and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Constellations of satellites will within a few years start
offering broadband two-way transmissions around the world. And
thanks to technologies such as ISDN and ADSL, even the aging
twisted-copper telephone line now packs more handwidth than
Alexander Graham Bell could ever have dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp pictures, better sound, instantaneous interactivity and
seamless integration between TV and the Web will all be for nothing
if the programming does not meet viewers' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the intelligent-TV industry has learned a lot from its
earlier unsuccessful interactive trials, and from what works best
on the Web. That is why the pilot programming which is now being
enhanced for this coming generation of intelligent TV will offer
viewers much more than another way to order in pizza.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while watching your favorite football team, you
will be able to click on the remote control and call up a menu on
your TV screen, much like the ones computer users are familiar
with.
</P>
<P>
   It will wrap around two sides of a slightly shrunken picture, so
you will still be able to watch the game. But at the same time you
will also be able to do lots of other things.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you could call up details from a related Web site
about players, watch replays and get scores from other games; order
merchandise related to the game; or simply read the general news
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps you will be watching a favorite sitcom, and want a
reminder of last week's plot, or a biography of one of the
characters, or to buy a sweater just like the one you've seen on
the screen. And during the commercial break, you may go on another
online shopping spree, thanks to the prompting of an interactive
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Then your children might want to watch an educational program,
and again they'll be able to download information, do online
research to help with their homework, and ask questions
interactively.
</P>
<P>
   Many TV shows these days are deficit-financed, and rely on broad
syndication to make a profit. Interactivity offers new revenue
streams _ for example, from commissions on online merchandise
sales, which are likely to become one of the biggest sources of
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent TV also allows program makers to add value to
reruns. Thanks to universal Internet and software standards, it
will be possible to add interactive content to existing programs at
very low cost. That will attract additional viewers and, as a
result, extra advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Three generations of adults grew up expecting TV to be a
passive, one-way experience, but today's viewers are increasingly
living a Web lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   They expect their entertainment to be interactive, two-way and
customized to meet their needs _ which is why more than 400,000
people already use Microsoft's WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   Some research shows that those children who have a computer at
home watch less conventional TV _ they prefer interactivity, they
want to be in control.
</P>
<P>
   But for intelligent TV to succeed, it will also have to be easy
to use. The biggest market, at least initially, may be for what
some observers have called ``lazy interactive TV.''
</P>
<P>
   So the interface must be really simple _ nothing more
complicated than today's remote control. And eventually the
television, like computers, will use a more natural interface. It
will respond to voice commands and incorporate an ``intelligent
assistant'' that will learn your likes and dislikes, and help you
find programs.
</P>
<P>
   The TV will also become one of the main interfaces for your
home's local network, controlling everything from lighting and
heating to the security system.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of what you can now do on a computer in your office _ such
as e-mail _ you will also be able to do via TV from the comfort of
your couch. Flat-screen technology will make it possible for an
unobtrusive wall-mounted TV screen to be built into every room.
</P>
<P>
   Within a decade intelligent TV will be as familiar as the Web is
today. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Economies that account for more than one-third of global output
enter 1999 either already in recession or seriously stuttering.
</P>
<P>
   World output has grown by under 2 percent in 1998, down from an
average rate of 4 percent in the previous four years. But the
outlook for the next twelve months is grimmer: the world economy
will grow by only 1-1.5 percent _ its slowest rate since the early
1980s. By past standards that would count as a recession.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous three world ``recessions'' _ in 1975, 1982 and
1991 _ global output never actually declined, but expanded by an
average of 1.5 percent. Most rich developed economies suffered a
fall in GDP, but the developing world continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   This time, by contrast, it is the developing world that could
drag the rich economies into recession.
</P>
<P>
   The above forecasts imply that 1998 and 1999 could be the
weakest two consecutive years for the world economy since the
1930s. And even this assumes that America merely suffers a sharp
slowdown. If America dived into a full-blown recession, then the
outlook for the world economy would be grim indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The economic casualty list gets longer by the day. Japan and
most of the rest of East Asia are suffering a slump; Russia has
defaulted on its debt and its economy is imploding. High interest
rates and budget cuts will push Brazil into recession in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last, but not least, there are growing fears that the huge
losses made by banks and hedge funds will cause a credit crunch
that could push the developed world in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   When the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 triggered the
East Asian crisis, nobody expected that the global consequences
could be so serious. After all, most economies' trade with East
Asia is small compared with the total size of their economies.
</P>
<P>
   However, there have been other more powerful channels of
contagion. One is commodity prices. East Asia is a big importer of
raw materials, and so the region's slump has depressed the prices
of oil and other raw materials. This has hurt commodity producers
such as Russia, Latin America and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Another, even more important route through which Asian flu has
spread is investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Bruised by big losses in Asia and Russia, investors and lenders
lost their appetite for risky assets of any sort _ not only
emerging markets, but equities and corporate bonds in rich
countries, too. This has raised the cost of capital.
</P>
<P>
   More dominoes may yet fall in the emerging world _ China, for
instance, remains worrying _ but the fate of the world economy
really hangs on America and Western Europe, which together account
for two-fifths of world output.
</P>
<P>
   Both grew by a healthy 3 percent or so in 1998, but they will
not remain immune. A credit crunch and a slump in exports to
emerging economies could add to the forces that will cause a sharp
slowdown in America in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of years, easy credit and surging share
prices have driven borrowing and spending by American firms and
households to unsustainable levels. Even without the fallout from
Asia, America's financial bubble would eventually have burst.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the 11 economies which adopted the single European
currency, the euro, on Jan. 1 look less vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Western Europe is less dependent on exports to emerging
economies, and it has not seen the same frothy _ and hence
unsustainable _ sort of growth as in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest worry is that the new European Central Bank, eager
to build up its anti-inflationary credibility, will try to be
tougher than the Bundesbank and be slow to cut interest rates if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   To judge how severe the global slowdown will be in 1999, keep
your eye on four crucial factors: First, will Japan's $500 billion
package to bail out its sick banking sector _ and thus revive its
economy _ work?
</P>
<P>
   Second, is an end to the East Asian crisis in sight? Falling
interest rates and rising export volumes could mean that these
troubled economies will start to turn up in the second half of
1999, but their massive debt burdens will constrain growth.
</P>
<P>
   Third, will Wall Street crash? If share prices drop by 30-40
percent from their peak, this would severely depress spending in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And fourth, how quickly will central banks cut interest rates if
growth does slow sharply?
</P>
<P>
   The world faces its most serious financial crisis since the
1930s. Indeed, there are disturbing parallels between now and the
eve of the Great Depression, such as overvalued share prices,
falling commodity prices and excess industrial capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also some big differences: countries are no longer
on the gold standard, which limited their ability to ease monetary
policy as output slumped; public spending is today a much higher
share of GDP, which automatically helps to stabilize demand; and,
most important of all, policymakers have hopefully learned their
history lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Depression was largely the result of some huge policy
mistakes. In the 1930s, America's Fed failed to act as lender of
last resort, so widespread bank failures caused a severe
contraction of the money supply. Governments also raised taxes
during the slump to try to balance their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Today policymakers have a better understanding of how economies
work and how monetary and fiscal policy can be used to prevent
depression.
</P>
<P>
   If Japan fails to implement fully its bank bailout package; if
central banks fail to cut interest rates as bank lending dries up
and stock markets crash; if austere governments resist any widening
of their budget deficits as demand slumps; if economies retreat
behind protectionist barriers _ if all these things happen, then
the world might indeed face a global depression. But one would hope
that policymakers could not be that incompetent. &QL;

   It inhabits the same future universe as the TNT cable hit
``Babylon 5,'' which ended production last year after its planned
five-year run. But where that show was set in a politically wracked
space station, ``Crusade'' follows the crew of a space ship as it
searches the galaxy for a cure to a virus that threatens to
exterminate humans. Depending on the fate of the NBA playoffs,
which TNT also televises, the show will debut sometime between
April and June.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time the storied JPL rocket scientists have
consulted on a television series, said Joan Horvath, the
laboratory's business alliances manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a lot of fun for all the people working on
the project for the exposure between the two cultures,'' Horvath
said.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration started after ``Crusade'' producer-director
John Copeland took a special tour of JPL, where, it turns out, many
``Babylon 5'' fans can be found.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations there turned into a formal technical advisory
role when Copeland and partners J. Michael Straczynski and Doug
Netter began envisioning the new show.
</P>
<P>
   JPL put together a team of scientists _ with many others lined
up wanting to volunteer _ to help the ``Crusade'' creators. Their
first task was to help imagine what the ultimate killer virus would
be like.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses are simple things, mostly a sheath of protein wrapped
around a squiggle of DNA. But that simplicity has allowed nature to
create some devastating plagues on its own, including the AIDS and
Ebola viruses.
</P>
<P>
   So what would happen if an ancient, vengeful alien race wanted
to build a particularly nasty virus that would target humans and
resist cures. If the aliens used nanotechnology techniques now
being explored by researchers, the JPL scientists said, they could
construct the ultimate plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat down and said, `If we designed a virus (250) years from
now, what would it look like?''' said Straczynski. ``It got pretty
scary. But the JPL people said what they came up with theoretically
could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's underlying premise gives it a tension and an urgency
that many shows lack, said star Gary Cole, who plays ship's Capt.
Matthew Gideon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a strong choice, a simple definition of a mission
so anyone can hop on,'' Cole said, talking in his trailer outside
the cavernous, anonymous industrial building in Sunland that has
been home for both ``Babylon 5'' and ``Crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   With species-wide annihilation looming, Cole said, ``the stakes
can't get any higher than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Straczynski, the main writer of both shows, had always tried to
keep the science straight on ``Babylon 5,'' part of what built the
show's fan base at JPL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks a lot better,'' said Straczynski, whose small office
inside the building is crammed with ``Babylon 5'' games, videos,
posters and other products. ``It was part of the sense of wonder:
That's what it would be like in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Envisioning the future has stimulated the JPL scientists'
imaginations as well, Horvath said.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, even in their consulting work, the lab's 5,000
employees focus on solving near-term technical problems, like
getting the Pathfinder to Mars or detecting leaks on the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a good thing because it's forced us to think
a bit about what things are going to look like in 250 years,''
Horvath said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same period separates us from (18th-century explorer)
Capt. James Cook as separates us from this (show's) time period,''
Horvath said. ``If you look at the distance in that way, how would
they have thought about us (from the past) and how should we think
about these people (in the future)? What will be easy that was
almost impossible (before)?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, each week's script is delivered to Horvath, who parcels
specific questions out to team members.
</P>
<P>
   They in turn create a fat report outlining such things as the
atmosphere, gravity and geology of the planet being explored in
that week's show, and Netter, Copeland and Straczynski cull details
that can be incorporated into the show.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the acting is done in the sprawling sets in Sunland that
make up the ship's ``interior,'' and house backdrops for some
planet-side scenes each week as well.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles down Lankershim Boulevard at Netter Digital Studios
in North Hollywood, those sets and the JPL suggestions get further
dressed into TV reality at the hands of the same special-effects
artists who helped ``Babylon 5'' win two Hugo science-fiction
awards for best dramatic presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the huge physical sets, the effects artists tweak even
many interior shots, replacing ``blue screen'' backgrounds with
computer-generated scenes of, say, the view through a spaceship's
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can take Joe's imagination and go as far as he wanted to
go,'' Netter said.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the show's creators are counting on pulling in ``Babylon
5's'' rabid fan base, they are reluctant to call it a spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Babylon 5' was sort of like `Bus Stop' in that the stories
came to the station,'' said producer-director John Copeland. ``In
`Crusade,' we go to the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship does sometimes stop at the Babylon 5 space station,
whose characters will make guest appearances, though only Tracy
Scoggins' Capt. Elizabeth Lochley has a substantial presence.
</P>
<P>
   Scoggins, whose character only appeared in the last year of
``Babylon 5,'' said during a break in shooting a scene with Cole
that she was excited to be asked back on the new show because she
so enjoyed playing Lochley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very flattered by that,'' said Scoggins. ``This is a
character I very much wanted. I'm usually very nonchalant about
whether I get a role _ but not this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating the show has been easy in one sense: Virtually the
entire off-screen crew from ``Babylon 5'' has stayed on for
``Crusade,'' creating a familylike stability uncommon in first-year
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Scoggins, who joshes warmly with Copeland and crew members
during shooting breaks and at lunch in the eating area outside the
building, said it makes for a much more welcoming environment in
which to work.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, who previously starred in ``Midnight Caller'' and
``American Gothic,'' called his role the ``trickiest'' he's ever
attempted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're very often talking a lot about stuff that's
imaginary,'' Cole said. ``The language, the lingo, the techno-garb
have to seem familiar. It's finding the right tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right tone has sometimes been a challenge for the
JPL collaboration, too, because reality doesn't run all of the
show.
</P>
<P>
   One good example is the use of faster-than-light space travel.
Though it makes a galaxy-wide search for a cure possible, Albert,
Robert and Richard still say you can't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland cites recent research on the possibilities of
interstellar travel for scientific cover, but even Horvath says
dramatic license still is required sometimes in even the most
accurate of science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a plot that he wants, you have no choice,'' Horvath
said. ``We wave our hands and say that's alien technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, said Horvath, most of the time, the scientists'
suggestions become part of the dramatists' creations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a drama,'' Horvath said. ``But by and large, when
you come up and say, `Wouldn't this be more interesting?' he stands
there and scratches his head and says, `Well, cool'.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Economies that account for more than one-third of global output
enter 1999 either already in recession or seriously stuttering.
</P>
<P>
   World output has grown by under 2 percent in 1998, down from an
average rate of 4 percent in the previous four years. But the
outlook for the next twelve months is grimmer: the world economy
will grow by only 1-1.5 percent _ its slowest rate since the early
1980s. By past standards that would count as a recession.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous three world ``recessions'' _ in 1975, 1982 and
1991 _ global output never actually declined, but expanded by an
average of 1.5 percent. Most rich developed economies suffered a
fall in GDP, but the developing world continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   This time, by contrast, it is the developing world that could
drag the rich economies into recession.
</P>
<P>
   The above forecasts imply that 1998 and 1999 could be the
weakest two consecutive years for the world economy since the
1930s. And even this assumes that America merely suffers a sharp
slowdown. If America dived into a full-blown recession, then the
outlook for the world economy would be grim indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The economic casualty list gets longer by the day. Japan and
most of the rest of East Asia are suffering a slump; Russia has
defaulted on its debt and its economy is imploding. High interest
rates and budget cuts will push Brazil into recession in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last, but not least, there are growing fears that the huge
losses made by banks and hedge funds will cause a credit crunch
that could push the developed world in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   When the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 triggered the
East Asian crisis, nobody expected that the global consequences
could be so serious. After all, most economies' trade with East
Asia is small compared with the total size of their economies.
</P>
<P>
   However, there have been other more powerful channels of
contagion. One is commodity prices. East Asia is a big importer of
raw materials, and so the region's slump has depressed the prices
of oil and other raw materials. This has hurt commodity producers
such as Russia, Latin America and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Another, even more important route through which Asian flu has
spread is investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Bruised by big losses in Asia and Russia, investors and lenders
lost their appetite for risky assets of any sort _ not only
emerging markets, but equities and corporate bonds in rich
countries, too. This has raised the cost of capital.
</P>
<P>
   More dominoes may yet fall in the emerging world _ China, for
instance, remains worrying _ but the fate of the world economy
really hangs on America and Western Europe, which together account
for two-fifths of world output.
</P>
<P>
   Both grew by a healthy 3 percent or so in 1998, but they will
not remain immune. A credit crunch and a slump in exports to
emerging economies could add to the forces that will cause a sharp
slowdown in America in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of years, easy credit and surging share
prices have driven borrowing and spending by American firms and
households to unsustainable levels. Even without the fallout from
Asia, America's financial bubble would eventually have burst.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the 11 economies which adopted the single European
currency, the euro, on Jan. 1 look less vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Western Europe is less dependent on exports to emerging
economies, and it has not seen the same frothy _ and hence
unsustainable _ sort of growth as in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest worry is that the new European Central Bank, eager
to build up its anti-inflationary credibility, will try to be
tougher than the Bundesbank and be slow to cut interest rates if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   To judge how severe the global slowdown will be in 1999, keep
your eye on four crucial factors: First, will Japan's $500 billion
package to bail out its sick banking sector _ and thus revive its
economy _ work?
</P>
<P>
   Second, is an end to the East Asian crisis in sight? Falling
interest rates and rising export volumes could mean that these
troubled economies will start to turn up in the second half of
1999, but their massive debt burdens will constrain growth.
</P>
<P>
   Third, will Wall Street crash? If share prices drop by 30-40
percent from their peak, this would severely depress spending in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And fourth, how quickly will central banks cut interest rates if
growth does slow sharply?
</P>
<P>
   The world faces its most serious financial crisis since the
1930s. Indeed, there are disturbing parallels between now and the
eve of the Great Depression, such as overvalued share prices,
falling commodity prices and excess industrial capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also some big differences: countries are no longer
on the gold standard, which limited their ability to ease monetary
policy as output slumped; public spending is today a much higher
share of GDP, which automatically helps to stabilize demand; and,
most important of all, policymakers have hopefully learned their
history lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Depression was largely the result of some huge policy
mistakes. In the 1930s, America's Fed failed to act as lender of
last resort, so widespread bank failures caused a severe
contraction of the money supply. Governments also raised taxes
during the slump to try to balance their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Today policymakers have a better understanding of how economies
work and how monetary and fiscal policy can be used to prevent
depression.
</P>
<P>
   If Japan fails to implement fully its bank bailout package; if
central banks fail to cut interest rates as bank lending dries up
and stock markets crash; if austere governments resist any widening
of their budget deficits as demand slumps; if economies retreat
behind protectionist barriers _ if all these things happen, then
the world might indeed face a global depression. But one would hope
that policymakers could not be that incompetent. &QL;

THE OTHER DOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Those who think the wrong Dole ran for president
two years ago _ and to judge by the polls that's a lot of people _
got a political break Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When Elizabeth Dole announced that she was leaving her post as
head of the American Red Cross, she did not fully commit herself to
a campaign for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination. But she
said, ``There may be another way for me to serve the country,''
which sounded as though she is preparing to take up where her
husband Bob left off.
</P>
<P>
   The female Dole, 62, will inevitably be suspected of going after
the GOP vice presidential nomination as a more realistic option
than reaching for the top spot. Elbowing her way into the political
dialogue and demonstrating she can compete for votes with the big
boys would be a good way to get a male GOP nominee's attention.
</P>
<P>
   But that may underestimate her. She would come to the
presidential contest with formidable credentials for the White
House, not the least of which are her national name recognition and
her perpetual popularity with both men and women.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll recently ranked her the third most admired female
in America. With a 6 percent rating, she trailed only First Lady
Hillary Clinton at 28 percent and television star Oprah Winfrey at
8 percent. Losing 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole, by
contrast, was named most admired by only 1 percent of those
surveyed, ranking low alongside Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Elizabeth Dole has never indicated much interest in
seeing her own name on the ballot, preferring instead to serve in
appointive posts and to promote her husband's career. Not that this
was small stuff. Her posts were high ones, including two Cabinet
spots. And Bob Dole's career nearly rose to the pinnacle of
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is a practiced speaker and campaigner, she has
avoided becoming directly involved in many of the most contentious
issues that divide the GOP today and would bedevil her as a
candidate. If she has disagreed with any of her husband's
positions, she has been silent about it.
</P>
<P>
   During Bob Dole's losing 1996 campaign against President
Clinton, she was his chief surrogate on the road. But Scott Reed,
Dole's campaign manager, insisted, ``We have never had her out
breaking new ground on policy. She never would.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet times, and opportunities, change. At this moment in history
the country desperately longs for a return to political civility.
It is an elusive quality she has come to symbolize with her
gracious manner and her resistance to personal insults and cheap
partisan shots.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the Republican Party suffers from a stubborn gender
gap. (Women have voted Democratic in substantially higher
percentages than they have voted Republican in the past three
presidential elections.)
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, the quintessential southern belle with the
honeyed tongue and the piquant brains, may be just what the doctor
ordered. She is serious and professional, respected and renowned.
But she has fewer hard edges than Hillary Clinton and is less
threatening to conservatives still uncomfortable with female
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   She speaks North Carolinian fluently. The creamy language of her
native state has a comforting cadence that sells well throughout
the South, where the primaries can be crucial to a GOP candidate.
It may be lost on the North, but every politician needs a foreign
language.
</P>
<P>
   She has more credibility with female voters than her party in
general, which is stuck with positions on family-related issues
that offend many women. These include opposition to affirmative
action, abortion rights, family leave and federal funding for
child-care assistance, prenatal and postnatal care, and more
teachers and better school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Her efforts to identify with women's rights have been erratic,
although she correctly points to her own career as pioneering in
the political world. Regarding abortion, she said during Bob's 1996
campaign that ``I'm where he is _ I'm pro-life.'' That may help to
mollify the religious right, but it will not win her any feminist
points.
</P>
<P>
   If she does not develop an agenda separate from that of her
husband, she is unlikely to get very far. His congressional
prestige allowed him to tower over his party rivals without having
to shape an appealing platform to run on, a lack that voters
noticed. And he found himself trapped in the coils of the
domineering GOP right wing. This undercut his reputation as a
sensible moderate and killed him at the polls in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   How she could overcome the litmus tests of the intolerant right
wing to win the nomination without changing her pleasant image is a
mystery. Perhaps experience taught her husband a trick or two he
could pass along.
</P>
<P>
   But her real problem could be getting past Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the current frontrunner. This is nepotism heaven: a spouse of
a presidential nominee and a son of a president running against
each other. But maybe not against each other very long.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a Bush-Dole ticket, or a Dole-Bush ticket, could be just
the thing to revive Republican fortunes. At a minimum, it would
sound familiar.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are a misogynist, tough luck.
</P>
<P>
   Since women make up slightly more than half the world's
population, it has never been possible to avoid them altogether.
But at least there was a time when most of them were safely tucked
away in their homes or were confined to the factory floor or the
lower reaches of corporate life.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, however, their advance continues remorselessly. Now
they account for half the labor force of most rich countries. And
they are coming to get you higher and higher up the corporate
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   They may even pinch your job in 1999, if you are a high-flying
man about to join the senior management of your firm.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 there will be more women nearer the top of the corporate
world than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Women's conquest of the workplace has been remarkably rapid.
Fifty years ago, only a third of working-age women in America _ and
an even smaller proportion in many European countries _ had jobs
outside the home. It was a way of bridging the gap between the end
of school and the start of marriage or arrival of the first child.
</P>
<P>
   Now in some rich countries, particularly in America and
Scandinavia, the number of women in paid jobs is getting close to
that of men.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Europe, particularly in the south, they have been
slower to catch up, but numbers everywhere are rising.
</P>
<P>
   Single or married, childless or mothers, women have discovered
the joys of a working life _ and the reassurance of having their
own pay packets.
</P>
<P>
   True, on average those pay packets are still more modest than
men's, but watch them getting fatter. Women's pay used to be
scandalously lower than men's, even for the same work, but thanks
to equal-pay and equal-opportunities legislation in many countries
their relative pay is rising all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Better qualifications have helped too: in developing countries,
as many women as men now enter higher education.
</P>
<P>
   In America, women's hourly pay rates over the past 20 years have
risen from two-thirds to four-fifths of men's, and are still moving
upwards.
</P>
<P>
   Young professionals with sought-after skills _ say in
information technology, accountancy or consulting _ are already
enjoying a unisex rate of pay.
</P>
<P>
   All that is fine as far as it goes, but it does not yet go far
enough. At the very top of the corporate tree, female fat-cats
remain remarkably elusive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Catalyst, a New York-based think-tank, only 3
percent of the most senior jobs (chairman, chief executive or
similar) in Fortune 500 companies are currently held by women.
</P>
<P>
   Expect a marked increase in 1999. Already, over 400 of the
Fortune 500 companies have at least one woman on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Among highfliers in rich countries, many more women than men
remain unmarried, and an even larger proportion childless. Even
women with more workaday jobs are cutting back on babies.
</P>
<P>
   Except in America (where immigrants push up the birth rate),
hardly any of the developed countries will produce enough offspring
in 1999 to maintain their populations.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expect that in the next decade or two the share of
women in rich countries who choose to have no children at all will
rise, to perhaps one in four.
</P>
<P>
   But who says that the best jobs come only in large, unwieldy
lumps that require 80-hour weeks and lots of travel? Employees are
prepared to pull out all the stops when they are needed, but they
also want more time and flexibility for themselves, be it to look
after children, to care for an elderly relative, to study for a
further qualification, to work for a local charity, or just to lead
a more balanced life.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, it is men as well as women who are asking for
such deals. There is more to life than a spreadsheet. &QL;

   TOKYO _ What are the latest gizmos that well-heeled executives,
media celebrities, net-savvy teenagers and technophiles everywhere
will be sporting in 1999 _ filling the rest of us with awe and
envy?
</P>
<P>
   Following on from its success in Japan, expect to see more
palm-sized digital video disk (DVD) players being toted by
jet-setters tired of the fuzzy picture, tinny sound and heavy
editing of in-flight movies.
</P>
<P>
   These portable devices, which play optical discs that look like
a CD but store vastly more data, come with flip-up screens which
have the new 16x9 proportions of the modern cinema (instead of
television's dreary old 4x3). Better still, they provide pin-sharp
pictures and digital sound even clearer than a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, the major studios have reissued thousands of
titles from their film libraries in the DVD format as the video
industry prepares to ditch the venerable VHS cassette and prepare
for the new era of digital television.
</P>
<P>
   The rush into portable DVD has been led by Panasonic. The price
will come down from today's $1,000 as manufacturers churn out
export models.
</P>
<P>
   Global travellers will also be among the first to flaunt the
iridium satellite telephone that is being introduced widely by
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-held Iridium phone can operate anywhere in the world _
even in places where there are no telephone lines or cellular
services _ thanks to a constellation of 66 low-orbit satellites
that now blanket the earth.
</P>
<P>
   When a user is within range of a conventional telephone or
cellular system, the Iridium phone handles incoming and outgoing
calls by hooking itself up to the local terrestrial service. But in
the middle of the jungle, desert, ocean or simply on a lonely road
far from civilization, the Iridium phone communicates with the rest
of the world via the network of satellites overhead. Not cheap:
handsets start around $3,000 and calls $5 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   The recent phenomenon among college students of roll-your-own
digital-music albums from tracks downloaded from the Internet has
spurred a number of manufacturers to start marketing portable MP3
players.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-literate teenagers have taken the Motion Picture Expert
Group's audio compression technique known as MPEG-I Level 3 (or MP3
for short), developed for high-definition television, and used it
to scrunch CD tracks to a sixteenth their size without any loss of
quality.
</P>
<P>
   This allows them to swap CD-quality songs over the Internet in
minutes instead of the hours needed for downloading a typical
four-minute track of uncompressed music.
</P>
<P>
   For copyright reasons, the process is largely illegal _ though a
number of music publishers (Goodnoise, MusicMatch and MP3.com) have
begun distributing their wares in MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, MP3 tracks had to be kept on a hard-drive and
played back through the computers's audio system. Now downloaded
songs can be stored in a little portable gizmo and carried around
all day.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3 player of choice is the Rio PMP300 from Diamond
Multimedia Systems. For $199, digital music addicts get a
Walkman-like device that uses microchips to store up to 64 minutes
of crystal-clear music and runs for 12 hours on two AA batteries. A
similar product called MPman, from Saehan Electronics, costs $299.
</P>
<P>
   Another little gadget that will be flying off the shelves is a
portable GPS (global positioning satellite) receiver from Magellan
called the Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-held devices that use America's GPS to tell you your
position on the earth's surface to within a few tens of meters have
been around since the Gulf War. Yachtsmen, explorers and
mountaineers have willingly plonked down the $1,000 or more for the
reassurance they provide.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny GPS receivers also feature in the $1,500 dashboard
navigation systems that have become all the rage among car buffs
over the past year or two. Hertz rents cars fitted with Magellan's
PathMaster system for an additional $6 a day.
</P>
<P>
   By getting the price below $100, Magellan has taken a piece of
scientific apparatus and turned it into an executive toy. The
Pioneer also happens to be hugely useful as well as fun _ the mark
of all great gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   The Pocket-sized Pioneer, with an actual recommended price of
$139, has a waterproof rubber case, unbreakable antenna and runs
for 24 hours on two AA batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same price but even more useful are the new generation
of tapeless recorders that are no bigger than a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, tapeless recorders _ which store sound on
microchips instead of magnetic tape _ have been limited
memo-takers, capable of recording no more than a minute or two's
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   What has turned these novelties into full-blooded audio
recorders is the arrival of the $120 Panasonic RR-DR60, capable of
storing an hour's worth of conversation at a time. With its
built-in screen, up to 99 audio files can be sorted and replayed at
the press of a button. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Wall Streeters are unusually pessimistic about the
coming year. But many of them are in for a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas 1998 started well, only to turn bad with a vengeance,
1999 is likely to develop from unpromising beginnings into a
vintage year, at least for the best banks and securities houses.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street _ and other major financial centers _ is still
reeling at the suddenness of 1998's downturn. The most devastated
were partners at Goldman Sachs. In August they were looking forward
to picking up a truck-load of money from the investment bank's
initial public offering in the autumn; a month later, the flotation
was postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   But the turmoil in financial markets hurt everybody to some
degree. Bonuses were down sharply, hard-boiled eggs compared with
the golden ones of the preceding few years.
</P>
<P>
   The share price of many financial companies fell by half to
two-thirds between July and September, crushing the value of
equity-linked pay for many workers.
</P>
<P>
   But, above all, two things underpin the pessimism. The year-old
market difficulties abroad have finally arrived in America _ which
had seemed immune to them. Worse still, the downturn has hit Wall
Street on several fronts all at once.
</P>
<P>
   In other recent bad years, there was one main source of trouble
_ the stock market in 1987, real-estate loans in 1991, and bond
prices in 1994. But in 1998, the Dow plunged from July's all-time
high, and prices tumbled even more sharply for other risky assets,
ranging from emerging-market debt to mortgage-backed securities to
junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, none of this is likely to last long. In the early
1990s, Citibank came within a whisker of going bust, and several
other banks were barely any better off. But today, thanks to
several years of record-breaking profits during the 1990s, most of
the bigger Wall Street firms remain in reasonable financial health
despite their recent knocks.
</P>
<P>
   Once confidence starts returning to the markets, they are
well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   And what superb opportunities they will be. In the autumn of
1998, the prices of many securities fell to levels that, by
historic standards, look to be once-in-a-lifetime bargains.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the yield on double-B rated U.S. corporate bonds
was nearly 700 basis points more than Treasuries _ a spread last
seen in recession, when companies were defaulting in droves.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between the price of a 30-year Treasury bond and a
similar Treasury issued a year earlier rose to levels never seen
before, which made no economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   Prices fell to these absurd levels for reasons that look
temporary and technical, not fundamental. Many investors had to
reduce their risk-taking because trading losses had hurt their
balance sheets. They sold heavily.
</P>
<P>
   In general, there was a reluctance to trade in risky assets.
This was partly for balance-sheet reasons and partly because the
near failure of Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund, made
would-be buyers nervous that they could be on the wrong end of a
big, forced sale of the fund's huge portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Yet once these fears subside, and once risk-management models
give the green light to resume risk-taking, it would be astonishing
if Wall Street firms do not invest heavily in assets that, judged
on their fundamentals, are available at give-away prices.
</P>
<P>
   True, there may be exceptions to this happy trend.
Emerging-market debt prices may recover much more slowly than
Treasuries and other developed-country fixed-income securities.
</P>
<P>
   More visibly, American shares may not resume their bull market.
Yet even this will not hurt Wall Street as much as might be
supposed, given the prominence of the stock market in the public
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Investment firms do much of their trading in other sorts of
assets. They do not necessarily need the stock markets to go up to
make a profit; they just need to be good judges of which direction
it will go.
</P>
<P>
   As for underwriting and advisory work, it needs only a period of
calm and stability in the markets to kick-start the waves of
mergers and initial public offerings and securitizations that
stalled during the market downturn. The volumes could be large, as
there is now a large backlog of deals.
</P>
<P>
   This new business will be more profitable than before, because
firms will be leaner. When things are going well, nobody wants to
spoil the fun by doing nasty things like downsizing. But when the
going gets tough, there is no more ruthless _ or less loyal _
employer than a Wall Street investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Downturns are an opportunity to both cut and upgrade the work
force, axing the worst performers and poaching star performers from
firms hit harder by the difficult market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 this will be done with even greater zeal. Top management
in most Wall Street firms own more shares and options than ever.
The simplest way to boost a damaged share price is to swing the axe
hard and often.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything on Wall Street, the spoils of recovery will not
be shared out equally. The bigger firms will bounce higher than
their smaller rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has long had too much capacity _ but because times
were so good, firms that should have died survived.
</P>
<P>
   American firms will do better than their foreign rivals. The
downturn comes at the worst possible time for the big European
banks, which are already struggling to make an impact on Wall
Street. Now it will become clear which of them are serious in their
global ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   It will be no surprise if some choose to concentrate their fire
on Europe _ where they hope to benefit from the launch of the
single currency _ leaving the rich pickings to be had elsewhere to
their American rivals. &QL;

WHERE ARCHITECTURE IS MULTILINGUAL IN BUENOS AIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 10) 
(mk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the walls of Buenos Aires could speak to me, I know they
would speak in French, Italian, German, Hungarian and English.
</P>
<P>
   A clock tower that is a knockoff of Big Ben tells commuters how
late they are for work as they pick up their taxis at the Retiro
train station, the largest Edwardian terminal in the world.
Galerias Pacifico, the fashionable mall on the Calle Florida, is
modeled after the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in Milan. Entire
neighborhoods, like La Boca or San Telmo, feel like blue-collar
Italy, while Palermo Chico and swathes of Recoleta feel like
upscale France.
</P>
<P>
   As a new resident of Buenos Aires, I sometimes feel as though I
am in the Disney World of European architecture. Only three blocks
from my apartment, the Circulo Militar military club on Plaza San
Martin mixes the trademarks of the chateau at Chantilly, the
Luxembourg Palace in Paris and a pavilion of the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   The immense Inmaculada Concepcion church in the northern barrio
of Belgrano is a copy of the Pantheon in Rome. The Teatro Colon,
the epicenter of opera and ballet for all of Latin America since
its inauguration in 1908, mixes the architectural styles and
acoustical devices of La Scala with those of the grand opera houses
of Vienna and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the ancient Indian ruins and colonial baroque churches of
Mexico City or Lima, Buenos Aires architecture may seem hopelessly
derivative. (Argentina was a cultural and economic backwater until
the 19th century.) But you would have to travel to London, Paris,
Milan, Rome, Vienna and Budapest to see all the rich derivations of
European architecture that you can see in Buenos Aires alone.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's mix of styles reflects the broad impact of waves of
European immigration in the 19th century (which included many
distinguished architects and artisans) and the cattle and
foreign-investment bonanza of the early 20th century. It financed
the building of scores of lavish mansions and palaces as well as
giant government offices, shopping arcades, railroad stations and
banks in the European taste.
</P>
<P>
   The mixing of diverse European styles in the same block, even in
the same building, is as Argentine as the tango. The city's
signature dance form mixes African and Latin rhythms with the tangy
lyrics of lunfardo, a local slang mixing Spanish and Italian.
</P>
<P>
   There are no neighborhood architectural tours in English, and
all the architectural guides to the city are in Spanish. A mere
inconvenience; here are three walks you can take at an easy pace
over two days.
</P>
<P>
   One place to begin seeing the great buildings of Buenos Aires is
along the Avenida de Mayo, still the political heart of Argentina,
if no longer its cultural heart. The great thoroughfare is
frequently compared to the Champs-Elysees for its lasting vitality
and to Budapest's Andrassy Avenue for its architectural
eclecticism.
</P>
<P>
   On one end of the avenue is the grand Congress building,
inspired by the Reichstag in Berlin, with an imposing green dome
shooting into the sky like the cupolas of Turin. On the other end
of the avenue, crossing Avenida 9 de Julio, is the Casa Rosada, the
presidential palace where Eva Peron stole many Argentine hearts
from a balcony.
</P>
<P>
   The palace is graced by French mansard roofs, a grand Italian
baroque central arch, and galleries of columns and arches straight
out of the Italian Renaissance. And, in between, there is the Cafe
Tortoni, where the poets and literati sip coffee in demitasse cups
under a stained-glass skylight inspired by the one in Maxim's in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   There are English-language tours of the Congress, as well as the
building that once housed La Prensa, a major newspaper, and now is
used as a government office building. This latter building is a
derivation of the Palais Garnier, Paris' ornate opera, with a roof
crowned by a gilded statue celebrating press freedom and an
interior graced by an assortment of French and Italian murals of
the Fragonard variety.
</P>
<P>
   But the best idea is a long walk along the avenue, stopping at
the antique bookshops, cafes and ice cream parlors, and late at
night, the lively Avila flamenco club. Just above the Avila, it is
worth taking a look inside the bizarre Barolo office building. The
soaring skyscraper was designed in the early 1920s by an Italian
architect, Mario Palanti, whose imagination inspired undulating
balconies and sculptures, multiple domes within domes, and wall
inscriptions from Dante's ``Divine Comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabio Grementieri, an architectural historian who works for the
City of Buenos Aires, showed a friend and me around Avenida de Mayo
recently. We toured one building that is a smaller version of
Vienna's central postal building, as well as buildings with
European architectural motifs ranging from German Jugendstil to
Italian Liberty Style. At 747 Avenida de Mayo, an office building
worth seeing for its ornate grillwork, is a typical hodgepodge of
splendor: The classical-looking pediments on the second floor are
Flemish, while the tower, spire and mansard roof are obviously
French.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking up Avenida de Mayo feels like Paris, but it's really
like Budapest,'' Grementieri said. ``That is why when Alan Parker
wanted to finish filming `Evita' after he left Buenos Aires, he
went to Budapest.''
</P>
<P>
   Francophiles who like to shop at Nina Ricci and Louis Vuitton
will like this second tour: a stroll along the Avenida Alvear from
the Plaza Francia to Plazoleta Carlos Pellegrini. It is Buenos
Aires' most elegant avenue, well worth taking the short walk after
the obligatory visit to the Recoleta cemetery. It's a way to
combine a visit to the grave of Argentina's greatest populist,
Evita Peron, with a view of the mansions once owned by the very
oligarchy she loathed. Snacks are recommended in between: coffee
and pastry (Viennese or French) at the Cafe La Biela or a drink in
the lobby bar at the handsome Alvear Palace Hotel, Buenos Aires'
answer to the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly a dozen blocks of French architectural gems on
the Alvear. Architectural historians bemoan the fact that that so
many of the turn-of-the-century mansions built by the great cattle
families of Argentina _ grand examples of late Victorian,
Beaux-Arts and Italian Renaissance _ were destroyed during the
city's several urban renewals since the 1930s. Most of the lost
mansions were replaced by neoclassical apartment houses that are
French in feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mansions left standing, the most impressive are the
Vatican Embassy on the corner of Montevideo Street, and the eerie,
ivy-draped Residencia Duhau at 1671 Avenida Alvear. The Vatican
Embassy has a marvelous mansard roof, as does the Brazilian
ambassador's residence in the Plazoleta Carlos Pellegrini.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is a nice copy of the Jacquemart-Andre Museum on
Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, with a sprinkling of accents added
from the chateau at Fontainebleau. It was built in the 1920s by the
Peredas, one of several Argentine cattle families who visited
Europe and made copies of the buildings they liked most when they
returned. ``Rich as an Argentine'' was a popular phrase in Europe
in the 1920s.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PAULO _ It will be a difficult year for Latin America. There
will be little or no economic growth; currencies will remain under
pressure; foreign financing will remain scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Americans have spent the past decade implementing painful
free-market reforms, which were just starting to bear fruit. Many
of them will feel, with some justification, that their countries
are the innocent victims of flighty financial markets beyond their
control. Some of them will start to doubt whether the reform effort
was worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The question that will dominate Latin American political life in
1999 will thus be whether or not to retreat into the economic
nationalism that was the region's response to a past world
recession, that of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the answer will be a qualified no. Latin Americans
may have little enthusiasm for extending market reforms, but
neither will many of them endorse radical adventures which threaten
economic stability.
</P>
<P>
   The big exception could be Venezuela, perhaps because stability
has not been achieved there. Its next president, due to take over
in February after an election in December, will be Hugo Chavez, a
populist nationalist and a former lieutenant-colonel who narrowly
failed to take power by force in a bloody coup effort in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez will probably step back from implementing the debt
moratorium and siege economy he once threatened. But Venezuela is
set for continuing instability, a headache for Washington given its
strategic importance as an oil supplier.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of South America, voters are likely to opt for
change, but of a less fundamental kind. Presidential elections in
Argentina in October and in Chile in December 1999 could mark a
swing to the moderate left. But both contests will be very closely
fought.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, the opposition alliance, probably headed by
Fernando de la Rua, the Radical Party mayor of Buenos Aires, ought
to beat the likely Peronist candidate, Eduardo Duhalde.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, General Pinochet will inevitably cast a shadow but
Ricardo Lagos, a market socialist, should still beat conservative
and Christian Democrat opponents. But both men's chances of victory
may be lessened if the economic outlook remains stormy.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation that discontent does not necessarily mean
radicalism may come in elections in three of the region's smaller
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In both El Salvador in March and Uruguay in November, left-wing
parties which include former guerrillas may be defeated by
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Panama, if (a big if) the conservative opposition remains
united, it should beat the ruling nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   This underlying voter caution will reinforce the determination
of policymakers in many countries to preserve the hard-won gains of
reform, even if that requires tough measures.
</P>
<P>
   Growth will be sacrificed: taken as a whole, Latin America will
be lucky to grow by 1-2 percent, down from around 2.5-3 percent in
1998 and 5.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Many governments will proclaim their commitment to free trade
while quietly clamping down on imports. They will hope that after a
fairly orderly pause, their countries will be poised to resume
faster growth by the end of the year, with their democracies and
their economic reforms intact. But it could yet be much worse than
that. Whether it is depends on two factors.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the world economy. Latin America will be hit hard
by low prices for its exports of commodities (oil, minerals and
grains) as the world economy slows. Commodity prices are unlikely
to improve much until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, a sharp slowdown in the United States economy will
hit Latin America's exports of manufactures. But lower interest
rates in the United States could cause investors to look more
kindly on emerging markets once again.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, external financing will remain scarce and expensive for
Latin America, with any thaw coming only towards the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The second key to Latin America's year is Brazil, which accounts
for 45 percent of the region's GDP. In 1999 Brazil will be the
southern hemisphere's biggest question-mark.
</P>
<P>
   As he embarks on his second term in January, President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso will have only a few months at most to implement
the Draconian fiscal measures he was unable and unwilling to take
in his first term.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to do so would make almost inevitable a disorderly
devaluation of the currency, the real, and Cardoso would struggle
for the rest of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Success in bringing the fiscal deficit under control would still
mean that Brazil will face a bleak 1999. &QL;

 &HT;    Medical breakthroughs intrigue weeklies
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is little science can do to relieve Bill Clinton's
political headache, but doctors do offer new hope for migraine
sufferers. Newsweek ($2.95) reports on the latest breakthroughs in
treatments for those throbbing headaches, which affect 18 percent
of all women and 6 percent of men. Researchers still haven't
figured out what causes migraines, but triptans, a new group of
synthetic compounds, may be just what the doctor ordered to make
the pain disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Time ($2.95) also pushes the impeachment story inside for a
cover package on the future of medicine. Breakthroughs in genetic
engineering may conquer cancer, grow new blood vessels in the heart
and create new organs. Lifespans will be increased and parents will
be able to choose children's traits. All this is possible, says
Time managing editor Walter Isaacson, but are there ethical
problems?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the federal project to map the human genome is
expected to be completed by 2003, and scientists will be able to
identify genetic error ``as quickly as a supermarket scanner,''
says Time's Frederic Golden. The question is how such information
can be kept secret so it won't be used by potential employers or
insurers. Why should that matter? Well, knowing that you are
susceptible to cancer or diabetes or some other disease would allow
HMOs to keep their costs down by screening out risky candidates.
</P>
<P>
   HEARTBEAT: Even The New Yorker ($3) devotes a chunk of its Jan.
11 issue to medicine. Jerome Groopman takes us into the operating
room at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for an
over-the-shoulder look at a new kind of coronary bypass. Instead of
stopping the heart and hooking the patient to a heart-lung machine,
as is the common practice, surgeon Billy Cohn operates on the
beating heart. Such a procedure, Groopman says, is safer, cheaper
and easier.
</P>
<P>
   On a lighter note, Christopher Buckley writes the headlines we
may _ or may not _ see in 1999. Some examples: ``Poll: Most No
Longer Care Who Is President''; ``In British TV Interview, Lewinsky
Tells of Anger Over Her Secret Service Name, `Humidor'''; ``Clinton
Says He Was `Only Trying to Comfort' Widow After Funeral''; and
``White House Calls Widow a `Scheming Slut.'''
</P>
<P>
   CLASS ACTS: Movies such as ``Scream'' and ``The Faculty'' are
aimed at more sophisticated teens than those of earlier
generations, but the basic elements of youth rebellion and sex
haven't changed since the teensploitation flicks of the 1950s and
'60s. Spin ($2.99) presents a celebration of the tight T-shirts and
out-of-control baby-sitter genre. Not only are the TV networks
airing nine teen-driven programs, but also 11 films about high
school high jinks will open in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   THE ROYAL MISTRESS: She's been called ``the Rottweiler'' and
worse, but Camilla Parker Bowles has survived the epithets and the
gossip. Now More ($2.99), the magazine for women older than 40,
shows the other side of Prince Charles' companion. According to
Robert Lacy, the romance is genuine and the couple seem genuinely
suited for each other. And along with the profile is an intriguing
sidebar on ``the other woman'' and what types are attractive to
middle-aged men. Besides the younger ``new trophy,'' there's the
``soul mate,'' who taps into a man's spiritual or artistic
passions, and the ``old friend,'' a woman who has been around for
years.
</P>
<P>
   AND THE NOMINEES MAY BE: If this is January, it must be time to
start thinking about the Academy Awards. Oscar nominations won't be
announced until Feb. 9, but that doesn't stop Entertainment Weekly
($2.99) from jumping the gun with its predictions. EW's choices for
best picture are ``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``Shakespeare in Love,''
``Life Is Beautiful,'' ``Waking Ned Devine'' and ``The Truman
Show.'' In the best actor and best actress categories, favorites
are Tom Hanks (``Private Ryan),'' Cate Blanchett (``Elizabeth'')
and Gwyneth Paltrow (``Shakespeare'').

 UNDATED: the 1920s. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regrettably, the Brazilian ambassador's residence is only open
to the public for tours on rare occasions, as is the neighboring
French Embassy, one of the more complex Beaux-Arts buildings in the
city. The latter was set to be bulldozed in the 1970s under the
military junta, to expand the Avenida 9 de Julio. Residents
complained bitterly. President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France
agreed, stood up to the generals, and said his diplomats would not
move.
</P>
<P>
   It just goes to show that interesting buildings usually have
interesting stories. And the Plaza San Martin, the heart of a third
walking tour, has many of both. It is Buenos Aires' most beautiful
plaza, especially in early November when the brilliant purple
jacaranda trees are in bloom. The jacarandas were transplanted from
the tropical north and are an integral part of the landscaping by
Charles Thays, a French architect who also worked on Parisian parks
at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   A slow walk around the Circulo Militar, the Louvre spinoff, is a
good place to start a tour of the Plaza San Martin. This wonder of
opulence was once owned by Jose Paz, publisher of La Prensa, who
built the grandest palace he could in order to entertain there once
he became president. Paz never won the presidency, but he did give
one very special party in his mansion during which he introduced
the tango to Argentine high society in the 1920s _ shortly after it
won acceptance in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The only part of the old Paz mansion open to the public is a
small military museum.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Plaza San Martin is the mansion built by
the Anchorenas (a branch of the same family that built what is
today the Vatican Embassy), now the ceremonial center of the
Argentine foreign ministry. Designed by Alejandro Christophersen _
the Argentine architect who was born in Spain to Norwegian parents
in 1866 and trained in Brussels and Paris _ the mansion takes up a
block and is a galloping mix of French classicism and Art Nouveau.
It is closed to the public, but a peek through the gate reveals the
cobblestoned cour d'honneur with its understated grillwork and
columns designed to reflect the Louis XIV and XV periods. Around
the block, on Calle Basavilbaso, an enchanting little black iron
and glass pavilion juts out of the Anchorena mansion with a terrace
on top.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes Castellanos de Anchorena wanted her palace to have a
view of the Rio de la Plata and the austere neo-Romanesque
Santisimo Sacramento church across the plaza that she had
simultaneously built with an imposing marble altar lavishly
decorated with bronze, mosaic and onyx. The glorious view lasted
about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1930s, an aspiring oligarch named Corina Kavanagh
fell in love with New York's Art Deco skyscrapers. When she
bankrolled construction of an Art Deco behemoth at 1065 Calle
Florida, it spoiled the Anchorenas' view, starting a feud that has
been called ``the war of the socialites.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kavanagh Building, in any case, is a nice reminder of home
for any New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   No trip is complete without a visit to the Teatro Colon. Like
seeing a tango show, attending the opera at the Colon is a rich
window on Argentine glamour and style. The opera season that just
ended was plagued by bad labor relations, financial problems and
sometimes awful reviews.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter the quality of the music, a big part of the
experience of attending a performance at the Colon is partaking in
the luxury and history of the building. It is a monumental mix of
Italian, Viennese and French styles that is massive even by the
dimensions of the Avenida 9 de Julio, one of the widest avenues in
the world at almost 600 feet across, on which it stands. The
exterior displays layers of arches, mouldings, sculptures,
balconies and columns that some critics have characterized as more
severe than beautiful. But it is the interior that really shines _
even if most of the marbled walls are really only painted stucco.
</P>
<P>
   For those who cannot attend an opera, there is a one-hour tour
of the theater given in English and several other languages. I have
taken the tour twice, and my only complaint is that there was not a
mention of the sordid crime that changed the architectural destiny
of the Colon. But the guides are courteous and knowledgeable,
pointing out details from the Venetian mosaics on the floors and
the beautiful mix of white Italian marble and pink Portuguese
marble on the stairways to the boxes and orchestra seats still
covered in their original burgundy velvet and gold brocade.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Francisco Tamburini, an Italian architect, just
before his death, the auditorium has virtually perfect acoustics.
The crystal chandelier has 700 bulbs, and there is a thin circular
corridor at the top of the muraled domed ceiling that allows 15
musicians and singers to perform above the heads of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The guides like to quote Pavarotti, who once said after
performing there that the theater had only one defect: ``It is so
perfect you can easily hear every mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But for me the best part of the tour is the several floors below
ground, where you get a rare chance to see world-class ballet
dancers practice and several historic opera costumes on display.
The heaviest of them is a gown from Mussorgsky's ``Boris
Godounov''; inlaid with faux jewels, it weighs 50 pounds. And there
is a dress worn by the soprano Claudia Muzio in a 1933 performance
of ``Tosca.''
</P>
<P>
   And the theater's tragedy and scandal are operatic in scale.
Sadly, Tamburini did not live long enough to hear a formal concert
in his masterpiece. And before his protege, a fellow Italian named
Victor Meano, could complete Tamburini's work, he was murdered _
shot by a man he found uninvited in his house one night in 1904. It
was the former butler who did it, one fired a few months before,
who was having an affair with Meano's wife.
</P>
<P>
   The third architect to lead the project, a Belgian named Julio
Dormal, was no fan of Meano's and scotched most of the remaining
designs for the interior, including Tamburini's and Meano's desire
for a corridor of stores in the lobby. Dormal junked that in favor
of a grand entrance, and he looked to Versailles for the fabulously
ornate, mirrored hall on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect for strolls at intermission and for Friday afternoon
recitals, it is considered one of the great rooms in Argentina. It
never would have existed had Meano's butler been more discreet.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative tour schedule at Teatro Colon for the first months
of 1999 includes one-hour tours Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.,
every hour on the hour. From March to November, tours will be
Monday to Friday 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.; Saturday 9 a.m. to noon, every
hour on the hour. Tours are in English and Spanish. The cost is $5.
Show up at 1180 Viamonte, next to the box office, 10 minutes early.
Call (54-1) 382-6632.
</P>
<P>
   Fabio Grementieri conducts personal four-hour city tours ($150);
call (54-1) 163-4011. Gustavo Brandariz of the University of Buenos
Aires offers group tours, $30 a person, that last two and a half
hours; Espacio Verde travel agency, (54-1) 374-2222.

</P>
<P>
   At the other end of South America, voters are likely to opt for
change, but of a less fundamental kind. Presidential elections in
Argentina in October and in Chile in December 1999 could mark a
swing to the moderate left. But both contests will be very closely
fought.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, the opposition alliance, probably headed by
Fernando de la Rua, the Radical Party mayor of Buenos Aires, ought
to beat the likely Peronist candidate, Eduardo Duhalde.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, General Pinochet will inevitably cast a shadow but
Ricardo Lagos, a market socialist, should still beat conservative
and Christian Democrat opponents. But both men's chances of victory
may be lessened if the economic outlook remains stormy.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation that discontent does not necessarily mean
radicalism may come in elections in three of the region's smaller
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In both El Salvador in March and Uruguay in November, left-wing
parties which include former guerrillas may be defeated by
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Panama, if (a big if) the conservative opposition remains
united, it should beat the ruling nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   This underlying voter caution will reinforce the determination
of policymakers in many countries to preserve the hard-won gains of
reform, even if that requires tough measures.
</P>
<P>
   Growth will be sacrificed: taken as a whole, Latin America will
be lucky to grow by 1-2 percent, down from around 2.5-3 percent in
1998 and 5.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Many governments will proclaim their commitment to free trade
while quietly clamping down on imports. They will hope that after a
fairly orderly pause, their countries will be poised to resume
faster growth by the end of the year, with their democracies and
their economic reforms intact. But it could yet be much worse than
that. Whether it is depends on two factors.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the world economy. Latin America will be hit hard
by low prices for its exports of commodities (oil, minerals and
grains) as the world economy slows. Commodity prices are unlikely
to improve much until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, a sharp slowdown in the United States economy will
hit Latin America's exports of manufactures. But lower interest
rates in the United States could cause investors to look more
kindly on emerging markets once again.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, external financing will remain scarce and expensive for
Latin America, with any thaw coming only towards the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The second key to Latin America's year is Brazil, which accounts
for 45 percent of the region's GDP. In 1999 Brazil will be the
southern hemisphere's biggest question-mark.
</P>
<P>
   As he embarks on his second term in January, President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso will have only a few months at most to implement
the Draconian fiscal measures he was unable and unwilling to take
in his first term.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to do so would make almost inevitable a disorderly
devaluation of the currency, the real, and Cardoso would struggle
for the rest of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Success in bringing the fiscal deficit under control would still
mean that Brazil will face a bleak 1999. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PAULO _ It will be a difficult year for Latin America. There
will be little or no economic growth; currencies will remain under
pressure; foreign financing will remain scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Americans have spent the past decade implementing painful
free-market reforms, which were just starting to bear fruit. Many
of them will feel, with some justification, that their countries
are the innocent victims of flighty financial markets beyond their
control. Some of them will start to doubt whether the reform effort
was worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The question that will dominate Latin American political life in
1999 will thus be whether or not to retreat into the economic
nationalism that was the region's response to a past world
recession, that of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the answer will be a qualified no. Latin Americans
may have little enthusiasm for extending market reforms, but
neither will many of them endorse radical adventures which threaten
economic stability.
</P>
<P>
   The big exception could be Venezuela, perhaps because stability
has not been achieved there. Its next president, due to take over
in February after an election in December, will be Hugo Chavez, a
populist nationalist and a former lieutenant-colonel who narrowly
failed to take power by force in a bloody coup effort in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez will probably step back from implementing the debt
moratorium and siege economy he once threatened. But Venezuela is
set for continuing instability, a headache for Washington given its
strategic importance as an oil supplier.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of South America, voters are likely to opt for
change, but of a less fundamental kind. Presidential elections in
Argentina in October and in Chile in December 1999 could mark a
swing to the moderate left. But both contests will be very closely

   &UR; Never on Sunday, Says Cayman Islands &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this year, cruise ships will no longer be allowed to
dock at the Cayman Islands on Sundays, Christmas Day and Good
Friday, apparently because of complaints from church officials. The
decision, by the islands' department of tourism, was conveyed to
the cruise lines in a letter last month from L. Angela Martins, the
director of tourism. While Grand Cayman, the islands' capital, is a
familiar stop on cruises to the western Caribbean and through the
Panama Canal, only a few ships call there on Sunday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Royal Caribbean's Splendour of the Seas docks there on its
10- and 11-day Caribbean itineraries, and has six Sunday visits
scheduled for this year, through April 18. Cayman Islands officials
have waived the ban for those six visits, and in return Royal
Caribbean has agreed to move its scheduled Good Friday call on
April 2 to April 1, stopping on Good Friday at Ocho Rios, Jamaica.
At press time Royal Caribbean and Celebrity officials were still
discussing whether Celebrity's Mercury would stop at the Cayman
Islands on Good Friday, as scheduled, or also switch days or skip
that port. Princess and Costa cruise lines are also talking with
Cayman Islands officials, while Norwegian Cruise Line, with only
one Sunday call at Grand Cayman scheduled for this year, says it
will abide by the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Florida Caribbean Cruise Ship Association has
asked Cayman Islands officials to delay the ban, since published
itineraries for 1999 already include Grand Cayman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Silver Collections On View in Virginia &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two galleries displaying fine silver have opened in eastern
Virginia within an hour's drive of each other. One is at the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, the other in Colonial
Williamsburg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The objects in the Richmond gallery, named Discover Silver, are
a gift from Rita Gans, a New Yorker who collected silver with her
husband, Jerome, who died in 1986. The Ganses put together a
notable collection of 17th- and 18th-century British ceremonial
silver. The museum is open every day except Monday from 11 a.m. to
5 p.m. except on Thursday, when it closes at 8 p.m. It suggests an
admission donation of $4. Information: (804) 367-0844. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Williamsburg installation is named the Mary Jewett Gaiser
Silver Gallery, honoring its principal benefactor. Mrs. Gaiser's
first husband, George F. Jewett, with whom she developed the
collection, was chairman of the Potlatch Corporation, a lumber and
paper company in San Francisco.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gallery's first show, called ``Treasure Quest: Great Silver
Collections From Colonial Williamsburg,'' will run through 1999 and
features feature both silver and silver plate in flatware, skewers,
marrow scoops and Scottish silver chalices. One feature is an
epergne, or large table centerpiece, with covered dishes and a
matching platter. Mrs. Gaiser saved the epergne from destruction by
buying it in 1943. Had she not bought it, it would have been taken
back to Britain on a ship that was torpedoed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Gaiser gallery is part of the DeWitt Wallace Gallery. It is
open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Admission is by any of the
various passes sold by Colonial Williamsburg or by a one-day ticket
to all four museums costing $10. Further information: (757)
220-7724.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Last Holdout Joins Airline Smoking Ban &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All flights, both domestic and international, on United States
airlines are now completely smoke-free, according to the Department
of Transportation. In 1989, Congress banned smoking on all domestic
flights. Since then more and more airlines have been instituting
no-smoking policies on their international flights. Last month the
last holdout, Tower Air, eliminated smoking on all its
international flights.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most foreign airlines with flights to the United States have
also banned smoking on all or most of their flights. A list of
foreign carriers and their smoking policies is available on the
Department of Transportation's Web site at ostpxweb.dot.gov.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ski Web Site Lists Resorts, Snow Reports &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Winter-sports enthusiasts can now plan their vacations at
www.ski-resorts.com on the Internet. One feature of the site, begun
in late October, is an online booking directory for more than 400
resorts throughout the world that allows comparison shopping and
room reservations. The site also includes information about
weather, snowfall, lift ticket prices and trail maps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, about 2,000 vacation properties, including hotels,
condominiums and rental homes, can be reviewed and booked directly.
Twice-daily snow reports are provided for some 500 mountains, with
hourly weather updates for more than 1,500 places.. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Information about lodging, dining, transportation, child care
and activities is available for featured ski towns _ currently Vail
and Aspen, Colo.; Lake Tahoe and Mammoth, Calif.; Park City, Utah;
Jackson Hole, Wyo.; Sun Valley, Idaho, and Whistler in British
Columbia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Discounts are offered regularly on the site, and last-minute
travelers can sign up for e-mail alerts of special deals. A related
site, www.mountainzone.com, provides news about skiing and
snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Letting Your Fingers Reserve a Campsite &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Camping reservations for the most popular National Park areas
can be made on the Internet, using a Visa, Mastercard or Discover
credit card. The secure Internet address is reservations.nps.gov.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The site, which was launched Jan. 5, provides data, including
what is available, for 23 parks and 3 tours. Bookings may be made
five months in advance. The service operates from 10 a.m. to 10
p.m., Eastern time. Reservations can still be made by phone; the
number for most campsites is (800) 365-2267; for Yosemite, it is
(800) 436-7275, and for Carlsbad Caverns, Mammoth Cave and
Frederick Douglass tours, (800) 967-2283.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In New Orleans, Madame John's Legacy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For more than 200 years, the house at 632 Dumaine Street in New
Orleans has survived fire, floods and hurricanes to become a French
Quarter landmark and rare example of the classic Creole cottages
built by families that settled the city in the 18th century. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After being closed for more than a decade, the small museum
known in the neighborhood as Madame John's _ its official name is
Madame John's Legacy _ is freshly restored and open to the public,
still a model of adaptation to life in the subtropics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its design resembles the 18th-century architecture found in the
French West Indies. High ceilings mitigate the stifling summer
heat. The living quarters were raised from the ground to escape
dampness and flooding. Tall, carefully placed windows capture
breezes from the Mississippi River, which flows nearby.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The house dates to 1789, when it replaced a similar structure
built in 1730 that had been ruined by a fire that destroyed most of
New Orleans in 1788. In 1794 a fire that leveled much of the
rebuilt city spared Madame John's Legacy. The name was taken from a
book of short stories, ``Old Creole Days,'' by George Washington
Cable, who used the cottage as the setting for a melodramatic tale
about a woman of mixed racial ancestry.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Madame John's Legacy was closed more than 10 years ago by the
Louisiana State Museum system, which owns it, largely because of a
money shortage. It reopened in November with a permanent exhibition
of folk art, 70 paintings, drawings, sculptures and mixed-media
pieces by self-taught Louisiana artists, donated by two New Orleans
collectors, Dr. Kurt Gitter and Alice Rae Yelen, his wife. The
ground floor, enclosed by thick brick walls and once used as a wine
cellar, contains a series of exhibits explaining the history of the
house, using reproductions of old paintings, documents and pottery
found in excavations of the site. The museum, (800) 568-6968, is
open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday to Sunday; admission is $3.

TIME IS ON OUR SIDE, YES IT IS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   Time dissipates to shimmering ether
the solid angularity of facts. _ Ralph Waldo Emerson
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ According to a commonly used calendar (the
Gregorian), we are now in the ultimate home stretch of the second
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   In the small scheme of things _ our lives _ this is a major
deal. All that remains of the only century most of us have ever
known is a year, one official clump of 365 days in which we can use
``19'' and still signify the present. Even more dramatic, only one
more official clump remains in which we can use ``1'' to signify
our entire millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This time next year _ Lord willing and the Y2K bug don't rise _
our documents, dossiers, diaries and detritus will carry the
utterly new and strange (to us) date of ``2000.''
</P>
<P>
   In the big scheme of things _ the 4.5 billion years in which
Earth has existed _ all of this means nothing. Millennium
schmillennium. What is ``a thousand years'' really? And who got to
start the official countdown clock?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind ``a year,'' time itself is not only relative, it's
fabricated, made up by human beings who want to impose our idea of
``order'' on what we perceive as ``chaos.'' (Tell it to the Milky
Way.)
</P>
<P>
   Worse, human beings, as we know us today (upright in posture if
not always in deed), have been around only about 100,000 years _
give or take a millennium or two. While we likely have spent most
of that 100,000 years trying to ``order'' the universe, we didn't
even get around to formalizing the attempt with an actual calendar
until about 6,200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When I say ``we,'' that is also relative. The ancient Egyptians,
not Hallmark or the Sierra Club, came up with the first recorded
calendar in 4241 B.C. The ancient Jewish calendar crossed the
finish line second in 3760 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. stands of course for ``Before Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the people who lived during the tens of thousands of
years before Christ thought of themselves as existing ``B.C.'', but
that's where we've stuck them. All of them. The Neanderthals, the
Cro-Magnons, the Egyptians (with and without calendars), the kings
(Tut and Nebuchadnezzar), the warriors (Alexander and Hannibal),
the poets and holy men (Homer and Buddha), the Caesars and the
millions of just-folks.
</P>
<P>
   Christ's birth came to signify the beginning of modern time and
the first millennium, so tough on the folks who didn't make the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   The ironic thing is, even Christ's birthdate is relative. Jerry
Falwell, Pat Robertson and U.S. Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma do
not tend to dwell on the subject, but the best that scientists and
Biblical scholars can do is pin down Jesus' actual birth to
sometime during an 11-year period about 2,000 years ago. He could
have been born four years before we've always said he was born or
as many as seven years after.
</P>
<P>
   Since no one wants to think about re-doing the time lines of
history to reflect this variance, those of us who follow the
Gregorian calendar have basically opted to pretend: Modern time and
the first millennium began the year we say that Jesus was born.
Life, love, commerce and international airline schedules shall
unfold accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   As an old (but not ancient) Italian saying puts it: Se non e
vero e ben trovato _ If it's not true, it's to the point.
</P>
<P>
   Our point now is to fasten our gaze upon an official beginning
of the third millennium and to imbue that beginning with meaning.
Technically, the new millennium will not begin until Jan. 1, 2001,
but _ true to form _ the majority of us is ignoring the
technicality. So, as of this day, we have only 362 remaining clumps
of 24 hours in which to review and assess our place in the universe
and to plan for our individual commemoration of the momentous (to
us) event.
</P>
<P>
   In the big scheme of things, such an exercise is decidedly dumb.
But in the small scheme, where most human beings have always spent
most of their time, it makes perfect sense. Relatively speaking.

CASES: WHEN RULES FOR BETTER CARE EXACT THEIR OWN COST
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times)

 By SANDEEP JAUHAR, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  NEW YORK _ I recently spent a week as a ``night float'' at a
major New York City teaching hospital, staying up all night while
other residents slept. My shift began at 5 p.m., when residents
departed for the day, and ended at 7 the next morning, when they
returned. Meanwhile, I was responsible for up to 80 very sick
patients.
</P>
<P>
   One night, shortly after sign-out, a patient with colon cancer
began thrashing about wildly and hallucinating. What might be wrong
with him? I had no clue. What were the results of his blood tests?
I did not know. Could I reassure his family about the results of
his brain scan? I would have to get back to them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical situation for a night float, grappling with a
potentially serious problem with not enough information.
Paradoxically, though, it was the result of changes meant to
improve, not diminish, the care newly-minted doctors give to
patients in New York hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The changes arose from a chain of events that began late one
spring evening in 1984, when a young woman, Libby Zion, entered the
emergency room at the New York Hospital. She was agitated and
running a high fever. Eight hours later, she was dead.

<P>
   Though the exact cause of her death remains a mystery, her case
aroused intense debate over what until then had been little
discussed: the way young doctors are trained in New York State. If
the residents who cared for her had been more rested, many
wondered, would they have been able to save her life?
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, a special commission, led by Dr. Bertrand M. Bell,
proposed a number of changes in residency training in New York
State: closer supervision of residents in emergency rooms, more
help with routine tasks like drawing blood and strict work limits
on residents. Residents were prohibited from working more than 24
hours at a stretch or more than 80 hours a week. Eventually, these
changes spread to residency programs throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals that had relied on interns and residents as
medical staff, often working 36 hours at a stretch every two or
three days, were forced to grapple with the problem of
cross-coverage: providing care to patients when their primary
doctor was not on duty. As a result, many hospitals created night
floats _ residents who worked night shifts for specified periods of
time, usually a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the medical profession, including most residents,
applauded the changes. Studies show that, under the old system,
residents after a call night score lower on tests of simple
reasoning, response time, concentration and recall. Many, both
inside and outside medicine, argued that residents could not
provide proper care for patients if they were chronically fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1988,
Dr. Timothy McCall wrote: ``Few would choose to ride in a car
driven by a resident coming off a 36-hour shift. It should come as
no surprise that the public would question the ability of
sleep-deprived residents to make life-and-death decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators also hoped the changes would reduce the toll exacted
on residents in the form of broken marriages, cynicism and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too few residents emerge from training thankful for the
opportunity to practice in a fascinating and intellectually
challenging field,'' Dr. McCall wrote in his editorial. ``Instead,
many believe that the world owes them something for what they've
been through.''
</P>
<P>
   But now it is apparent the changes have brought their own
problems. For one thing, they have left night floats taking care of
large numbers of patients about whom they may know very little.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Bell regulations have argued that there was no
scientific evidence showing that tired residents harm patients,
either by increasing mortality rates or complications. Indeed, a
1993 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association
appeared to indict the very cross-coverage hospitals were relying
on to conform with the new regulations. It showed that increasing
cross-coverage in a large urban hospital caused delays in tests
because of resident oversight and increased preventable
complications like drug reactions and infections.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman Levinsky, a residency director at Boston University
Medical Center, wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine in
1988: ``My own experience in staffing our intensive care unit both
in the traditional manner and with a ``night float'' suggests that
errors due to faulty transfer of information are at least as
frequent as those due to fatigue from being on call overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some educators have also argued that work limits were
detrimental to a resident's training, by interrupting learning and
creating a kind of shift-work mentality that is inconsistent with
one of medicine's ideals: that a doctor should assume
round-the-clock responsibility for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents I know support the changes, as they have
definitely made residency more tolerable. Call nights are no longer
so terrifying when admissions by on-call residents end at 10 p.m.
And post-call days are no longer a fatigue-ridden blur.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefits are sometimes easily forgotten on the night
shift, when inexperience, ignorance and sickness mix in unsettling
ways.
</P>
<P>
   One night during my week as night float, a middle-aged man
hospitalized with colon cancer began to bleed severely from
somewhere in his intestinal tract. At 3 a.m., in his dimly lighted
room, he was asking me questions, but I knew so little of his
complicated case there was not much I could tell him. I felt like a
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The results of his tests, the site of the bleeding, when he
might go for radiation therapy that could save his life _ all that
information was deep in his chart, and in the mind of his sleeping
resident.
</P>
<P>
   At another point that night, I ordered a drug to relieve the
severe hiccups of a patient with esophageal cancer. The drug is
widely used, but as I walked by the nursing station, I casually
checked his chart. There, amid his papers, was a brief note. The
patient had suffered a severe reaction to this particular drug. I
immediately canceled the order, relieved that I had caught this
mistake but alarmed by how easily another could slip through the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents like the night float. You work hard and under
fire most of the night _ residents joke that your beeper goes into
status epilepticus, with constant seizures _ but in the morning
your responsibility is lifted. ``I walk into the hospital
empty-handed, and I leave empty-handed, and I like that,'' one
resident told me.
</P>
<P>
   Most cross-coverage problems stem from inadequate sign-out, as
residents rush to leave the hospital and cross-covering residents
forget to ask important questions. At my hospital, we use a
computerized sign-out program for detailing patients' major medical
problems, hospital course and medications. And a recent small study
showed that standardized sign-out sheets can also help prevent
unnecessary complications.
</P>
<P>
   But more efforts are needed to insure proper information
transfer between residents so that the Bell regulations, intended
to protect patients, do not end up endangering them in new and
different ways.

SEARCH FOR CAUSE OF DIET PILL'S RISK YIELDS NEW WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (The Science Times)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   A scientist who helped to develop Redux, one of two weight-loss
drugs taken off the market in 1997 after they were linked to heart
damage, is now suggesting that the problems were not due to Redux
alone, but rather to its being combined with other drugs that had
unrecognized effects.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Dr. Richard Wurtman, director of the Clinical
Research Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said
his investigation into Redux had led him to believe that
phentermine, a prescription diet drug that was taken with Redux but
is still on the market, might be unsafe if taken together with the
antidepressant Prozac or similar drugs. This risk, he said, might
also exist with some over-the-counter cold medicines and
weight-loss pills.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the current issue of The Lancet, an international
medical journal published in Britain, Wurtman and two other
researchers recommended that the labels on phentermine and the
other medicines be changed to warn consumers of the possible risks
of combining medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Food and Drug Administration did not return
telephone calls seeking comment on Wurtman's suggestion. But other
scientists said his recommendation, based on experiments in just 17
people, needed much more study. It appeared in The Lancet as a
brief ``research letter,'' a category assigned to reports that are
not as comprehensive or scientifically rigorous as full-length
articles. Wurtman's co-authors were Timothy Maher, of the
Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Sciences, and
Ismail Ulus, of the Department of Pharmacology at Uludag University
in Bursa, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's speculative,'' said John Foreyt, an obesity researcher at
the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ``But it's
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Phentermine has been on the market in the United States for
decades to treat obesity. Two other drugs were approved later:
fenfluramine, sold as Pondimin, and dexfenfluramine, sold as Redux.
None was a smashing success, but people lost more weight if they
took phentermine with one of the other two, in the combination that
became known as fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in 1997, when doctors began reporting cases of
heart-valve damage in fen-phen users, fenfluramine and
dexfenfluramine were taken off the market. Phentermine was left in
use, because it had been around for a long time without causing
problems, and because none of the reported cases of valve damage
had occurred in people taking phentermine alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine were widely suspected
of causing the heart damage, scientists have yet to determine how
it actually occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reservations, Foreyt said Wurtman's report made an
important point about the risks people take when they mix medicines
in ways that have not been tested or approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. The fen-phen combination, for instance, was never
tested or approved, even though the individual ingredients were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combinations of drugs should not be used unless they've been
approved,'' Foreyt said. ``You don't know the effects of the
mixture. That should be common sense.'' But, he acknowledged, many
people are so desperate to lose weight that they will try almost
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Experts like Foreyt say it is important for people to discuss
all drugs they take with their doctors, even if they are
over-the-counter medications or supplements, because many seemingly
helpful drugs can have dangerous side effects when taken in
combination. ``There is a general belief in this country that if
something is over the counter it's harmless,'' Foreyt said.
``That's not necessarily so.''
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers are wary of The Lancet report, given Wurtman's
connection to Redux. In addition to helping develop it, he is a
director and shareholder of Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. of
Lexington, Mass., one of the companies to which the drug was
licensed.
</P>
<P>
   But Wurtman said there were no plans to try to return Redux to
the market. ``If something that I had a part in inventing as a
scientist turned out maybe to be dangerous to people, then I'd be
obligated to spend a little time trying to figure out what was
going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wurtman and his colleagues decided to study phentermine, and
found that it had an effect that was neither mentioned on its label
nor widely recognized. Phentermine interferes with the body's
ability to break down the hormone serotonin. Fenfluramine and
dexfenfluramine also increase serotonin levels, so that taking
either of them with phentermine effectively blocks all of
serotonin's exits from the bloodstream. It is not known whether
patients taking the drugs have developed excesses of the hormone,
but very high levels, caused by certain illnesses, have been shown
to damage heart valves.
</P>
<P>
   Phentermine inhibits an enzyme, monoamine oxidase, that normally
breaks down serotonin. Other drugs also inhibit the same enzyme,
and they are considered unsafe when combined with other drugs that
raise serotonin, like Prozac and related antidepressants like Paxil
and Zoloft. All the drugs that either inhibit the enzyme or raise
serotonin in some other way carry labels warning that they must not
be used together.
</P>
<P>
   Phentermine, however, is not labeled as an inhibitor of the
enzyme, because that effect was not proved. Wurtman and his
colleagues contend that it has a relatively weak effect on the
enzyme, but might nonetheless cause harmful interactions in some
patients. The research team said it had also found that several
other drugs were weak inhibitors of the enzyme, and urged that they
also be labeled so that doctors prescribing Prozac or related drugs
might warn their patients. The other medications included
pseudoephedrine, the decongestant in cold medicines like Sudafed,
and ephedrine and norephedrine, which are found in over-the counter
diet pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to scare people about this,'' Wurtman said. ``But
doctors who prescribe drugs that block serotonin uptake, like
antidepressants, should have in the back of their minds the
interaction between them and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.''
</P>
<P>
   A particular concern to obesity experts is that some doctors are
prescribing phentermine and Prozac, in a combination known as
phen-pro, to people who want to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never use it,'' said Foreyt, calling it a good example
of a combination that has never been studied.

ABC ENLISTS SAWYER, GIBSON TO BOOST `GMA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson have been recruited as a new _
but temporary _ anchor team by ABC in a dramatic shakeup announced
Monday by the network to rejuvenate its sagging ``Good Morning
America.'' Both are taking on the assignments in addition to their
existing duties.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are to be effective Jan. 18. Lisa McRee, one of the
current anchors, is expecting a baby in August and will return to
Los Angeles for special assignments and projects for ABC News. Her
co-anchor Kevin Newman has been named a correspondent for ABC
News's ``Nightline.'' He'll be based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a hastily convened teleconference from Manhattan Monday, ABC
News president David Westin disclosed the choice of Sawyer and
Gibson, who appeared with him and seemed as surprised as anyone by
the turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked if they tested around here for amphetamines,'' Sawyer
joked. ``I have more stamina than you might expect if you saw me
without makeup in the morning. Everyone in the news division has a
stake in `Good Morning America.' I've been getting too much sleep,
anyway. It's not good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, Gibson, who ended 11 years as ``GMA'' host in
April, admitted he couldn't tell his wife what the advantages were
in returning to the show. ``I'll continue to be tired on Friday
Mornings,'' he said. Gibson said his reaction when Westin first
proposed the teaming was a laughing ``Yeah, wouldn't that be a
hoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Westin said Sawyer told him: ``If the news division needs me to
do it, then I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Morning America'' has sunk well behind NBC's ``Today''
show in the ratings over the past few years. ``Today'' now draws
more than twice as many viewers as its rival. The slide continued
after McRee took over for Joan Lunden in September 1997 and Newman
replaced Gibson last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sawyer and Gibson, who are ``20/20'' anchors, will continue
those duties while taking on their new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Westin said they were recruited because the network felt the
struggling two-hour Morning show was threatening the image of its
news division, of which ``GMA'' is a part.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer, who joined ``20/20'' last September after her
``Primetime Live'' broadcast was folded into it, has been
broadcasting in prime time since hosting ``CBS Morning News'' from
1981 to 1984. Sawyer said she'll ``cut back'' on travel assignments
with ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Westin said the changes include the naming of Shelley Ross as
new executive producer of the show, replacing Shelley Lewis, and of
Phyllis McGrady as ABC News executive in charge. McGrady was ``Good
Morning America'' executive producer from 1984 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, Westin said, had been prompted by the loss of the
show's ``core values'' in the last two years and of its loss of
``soul.'' He said the show needs to ``return to its warmth and its
sense of family values'' after wandering ``too far off.'' He said
he and network management accept responsibility for failure to
respond more quickly to the show's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Westin characterized the moves as the first step in a plan to
shore up the show's sagging status. Although Sawyer said she
expected to be doing the show for ``several months,'' Westin
declined to give a timetable and said he interprets Sawyer's
``several'' as ``more than three.''

</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my prediction for 1999: at some point during the year,
Dennis Rodman will do something weird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New Year's Eve is celebrated differently around the country.
Here in New York City, people go to Times Square and watch the ball
drop. In California, people go out to Malibu to watch Robert Downey
Jr. drop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York City if you want to celebrate New Year's Eve, you
have two options: one, you can go down to Times Square and watch
the ball drop...Or, you can go down to Dunkin' Donuts and watch the
mice drop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this morning, on the front page of one of the New York
City papers, they had a full page photo of mice crawling around at
a Dunkin Donuts here in Manhattan. Mice inside the display case...
Time to disinfect the donuts!''

<P>
   ``I was in Dunkin' Donuts earlier today and they tried to tell
me that the mouse running around my box of donuts was part of a
Disney promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, our entire balcony is full of fired NFL coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, five NFL coaches were fired and then next week
they'll be tried by the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This NBA lockout, this strike, this labor action has really
been devastating. Listen to this: over the weekend, Madonna had to
have sex with a professional golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme restaurants here in New York City...they're all
going out of business. And you know why? Because nobody goes there,
they're losing money. And so now I'm thinking to myself, great, now
that these theme restaurants are out of business, where the hell
are you going to go for a bad hamburger and a $40 t-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I came out here, the Department of Sanitation asked me
to make the following announcement regarding Christmas tree
disposal, always a problem. Here's what you do: take the Christmas
tree out of your living room, your game room, your family room,
your den, wherever the hell you have it, put it on the sidewalk in
front of your house, that's where you put your Christmas tree --
right next to last year's Christmas tree, and they'll pick them
both up this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a busy time for Dick Clark. Thursday is New Year's Eve,
and then after that he goes right down to Washington for Dick
Clark's Rockin' Impeachment.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton, you know, he's all smiles, all
happy-go-lucky. Insiders claim that he's very depressed over this
Impeachment thing, and how could you blame the guy? I mean, here he
is, getting impeached for heaven's sake, so depressed today that
Patch Adams made a house call to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton had a nice Christmas. You know, he received the new
1999 White House intern calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting more and more details about Christmas at the
White House. For example, apparently President Clinton gave his
wife Hillary an alarm clock. And I'm thinking, well, isn't that
kind of an unnecessary gift. I mean, honestly, don't you believe
she woke up to him years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton had an excuse for why he bought his wife such a cheap
Christmas gift, the alarm clock. He said that he spent all of his
chick' money on interns.''

   My friend Steve Efron was waiting in line at a bar cart by the
tracks at Grand Central Terminal on his way to Hastings-on-Hudson.
A woman rushed up, cut into the line and ordered a gin and tonic.
She then turned and announced to the waiting line, ``I'm sorry but
I have to catch a train.'' Steve didn't miss a beat. ``And I just
come here to drink,'' he said, sotto voce.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost a glove, I rushed off to Bloomingdale's to buy
another pair. I located what I wanted, decided to buy several pairs
and went to a cashier's station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm buying so many because I always seem to be losing my
gloves,'' I said. ``Just like `The Three Little Kittens.''' I got a
blank stare. I thought perhaps I hadn't made myself clear, so I
added, ``You know, like the three little kittens who lost their
mittens.'' Another blank stare.
</P>
<P>
   By now I was beginning to feel a little unnerved. Desperate to
make a connection, I looked around and when I saw no one in the
vicinity, I began singing, ``Three little kittens they lost their
mittens and they began to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the blank stare was replaced with a look of alarm and I
decided a retreat was in order. So I added that I guess they are
teaching different nursery rhymes to the newer generation. But
internally, I was doing my own crying. I understand that the Bible
and Shakespeare no longer form a common ground for universal
discourse _ but can we now no longer even count on a shared
universe of nursery rhymes?
</P>
<P>
   Lori Moskowitz Lepler knew it was time to either re-evaluate her
work situation or learn to cook. The other morning, about 8 a.m.,
her intercom buzzer rang and her 2-year-old son, Jake, immediately
said, ``Mommy, it's dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Every weekday morning, my three dogs and I go for an early walk
in Central Park. As I wend my way, I often pass the same man
sitting on the same isolated bench in a remote area, wearing big
earphones over his baseball cap, reading a newspaper, his dog
tucked under his feet. He always restrains his dog, making sure he
doesn't move out from under the bench.
</P>
<P>
   One day as I was getting ready to leave the park, I leashed all
my dogs because we were about to cross the park drive. At that
moment, the man and his dog walked by.
</P>
<P>
   Sloane, my large muscular Rhodesian Ridgeback, by nature very
friendly, broke loose and charged joyfully up to the man's dog to
say hello. As she barked energetically at him to come and play, the
owner started yelling at me, ``Get your dog on a leash, lady,'' as
if that would have made a difference. I responded, ``She's really
very friendly; she just wants to play.'' He responded, ``Well,
how's he supposed to know? He's a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a Saturday afternoon when Lita Karp entered the Grand
Street subway station. As she approached the turnstile, she heard a
male voice singing in Chinese. An audience had gathered to listen,
most of them contributing something.
</P>
<P>
   As she went downstairs to await the train, the song ended and a
new one began. It seemed familiar and Ms. Karp couldn't understand
why she was humming along. Soon the light dawned. The song was a
Chinese translation of ``Old Folks at Home.'' Now she's left with
several unanswered questions _ why and when was it translated, and
did the singer know anything about the Swanee River?
</P>
<P>
   Clara Greenspan was watching a program on innovative school
programming in Texas on Channel 13 one Sunday evening in late
November. As one educator was interviewed, he was identified on the
screen as ``School Superintendant Munoz.'' Write ``Superintendent''
100 times.
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, Ian Murphy reports that the writers of the
news zipper at Avenue of the Americas and 48th Street might learn
something from the maxim of the pot and the kettle.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls that in early December the ribbon relayed a story
razzing Texas for having to destroy several thousand books because
of poor spelling and grammar. The next story involved Iraq's
importing Viagra even though ``its'' made in the United States, and
the item after that was about the ``vigrous defense'' made by
President Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Johnson was entertaining friends at a Sunday buffet brunch
at a restaurant that had an impressive display of fish. Along with
the salmon, lobster, oysters and other delicacies was a fish none
of them recognized. It turned out to be sable, but before they
found that out, they queried a waiter about its identity. ``It's a
Jewish fish,'' he said. ``Is it circumcised?'' Mrs. Johnson asked
in jest. ``No, it's smoked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My friend David Laibman recently called a new French restaurant
in Brooklyn to find out what credit cards they took and what their
reservation policy was. When he also asked if they had a prix fixe
menu, the young woman said, ``No, we change it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Carroll was on a business trip to Dayton, Ohio, recently
with Mark, a business associate. Mark lives in Manhattan but was
born and raised in New Zealand and has a distinct accent. As they
were touring their client's office building, their escort asked
where they lived. Mark spoke first and said ``New York City.'' She
turned to him, somewhat embarrassed, and said, ``I'm sorry, I
should have known from your accent.''
</P>
<P>
   Dora Kooby was standing in line waiting to pay for her
merchandise when she heard a woman in another line ask for the 25
percent discount offered on shoes. The cashier replied, ``Ma'am,
these are slippers, not shoes.'' The woman protested, ``Well, I
wear these outside.'' Are slippers shoes when worn outside? Did she
get her discount? We'll never know. The unresolved exchange was
still going on when our correspondent left.

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of both parties are now saying the impeachment case
against President Clinton can be resolved before spring. The
pressure is really on, because spring is when President Clinton
goes into heat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican Senator Orrin Hatch is now admitting that the
Senate doesn't have the two-thirds vote to remove President Clinton
from office. So instead, they're going to get really drunk and T.P.
the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara Walters says she's met with Monica Lewinsky twice, and
she found her very warm. Mostly because they spent the time
spooning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop star Jewel says she's a big fan of Marilyn Manson and
she'd love to do a duet with him. Meanwhile, Marilyn Manson says
he'd love to shave Jewel's skull and tattoo a pentagram on her
forehead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, President Clinton will spend his New Year's
weekend attending a seminar dedicated to personal growth.
Apparently, last year there was an awkward moment because President
Clinton asked someone to touch his personal growth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to federal laws, if President Clinton is removed
from office, he will lose his Secret Service protection. President
Clinton is very nervous because right now the Secret Service is the
only thing protecting him from Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a recent interview, Woody Allen said that because of
Soon-Yi, he no longer sees his psychiatrist. Allen said, 'Instead,
I see my psychiatrist's daughter.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's New Year's Eve. For those of you who feel you missed out
on the Times Square experience, what you might want to do is get
into a bathtub with six friends and pee on each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a new survey, President Clinton is the most
admired man living. This is a poll conducted by 'Just Kidding'
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a recent interview, Woody Harrelson admitted that when he's
stressed out, he smokes pot. Harrelson went on to say that he feels

</P>
<P>
   1. ``Thank God we're not at home watching Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my prediction for 1999: at some point during the year,
Dennis Rodman will do something weird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New Year's Eve is celebrated differently around the country.
Here in New York City, people go to Times Square and watch the ball
drop. In California, people go out to Malibu to watch Robert Downey
Jr. drop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York City if you want to celebrate New Year's Eve, you
have two options: one, you can go down to Times Square and watch
the ball drop...Or, you can go down to Dunkin' Donuts and watch the
mice drop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this morning, on the front page of one of the New York
City papers, they had a full page photo of mice crawling around at
a Dunkin Donuts here in Manhattan. Mice inside the display case...
Time to disinfect the donuts!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Dunkin' Donuts earlier today and they tried to tell
me that the mouse running around my box of donuts was part of a
Disney promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, our entire balcony is full of fired NFL coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, five NFL coaches were fired and then next week
they'll be tried by the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This NBA lockout, this strike, this labor action has really
been devastating. Listen to this: over the weekend, Madonna had to
have sex with a professional golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme restaurants here in New York City...they're all
going out of business. And you know why? Because nobody goes there,
they're losing money. And so now I'm thinking to myself, great, now
that these theme restaurants are out of business, where the hell
are you going to go for a bad hamburger and a $40 t-shirt.''

 &HT;    Zell Miller says he was 'dear friend' who gave Clinton poem
 &HT;    (Repeating in political category. Previously moved under
commentary.)
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Gov. Zell Miller's poll ratings are at an
all-time high as he leaves office. He could have gone to the U.S.
Senate. But he chose to go back to his North Georgia home instead.
</P>
<P>
   I spent some time this week, asking the governor why.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mountains have always jerked me back _ like a dog on a
leash,'' said Miller, packing up his office and trying to explain
his fierce attachment to rural North Georgia: ``There's a
groundedness there _ a certain eternity. It's a place where the
soul never dies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A few times,'' he added with a chuckle,'' I thought the voters
would send me home before I was ready to go. I never needed much
incentive to run again, you know. No outpouring _ just a couple of
nods.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is pretty good at poking fun at himself, but throughout
his 38-year political life, poking fun at his native North Georgia
was off limits. He could go into a rage over negative implications
about the hillbillies in ``them thar hills.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the governor is thin-skinned about criticism of any
kind. No question he appreciates his hard-ball political adviser
James Carville, but he's often more philosopher than politician.
That shows in the 235-page syllabus for the ``Life and Leadership''
course Miller will teach at Young Harris College in his home town
and other places.
</P>
<P>
   The selected readings are full of interesting juxtapositions:
Robert E. Lee's Farewell to his soldiers and Booker T. Wahington's
``Up from Slavery''; Genesis on creation and Rachel Carson on
ecology; the classical philosophy of Plato and Aristotle and
children's classics like ``The Little Steam Engine (that could).''
</P>
<P>
   The romantic poets are his favorites _ John Keats, Percy Bysshe
Shelley. As I skimmed through his selections, I stumbled on four
lines of recent notoriety _ the lines President Clinton read in his
last-ditch effort to fend off impeachment: ``The Moving Finger
writes and having writ/ Moves on; nor all your Piety nor Wit/ Shall
lure it back to cancel half a Line. Nor all your Tears wash out a
Word of it.'' (from ``The Rubayyat'' by Omar Khayam)
</P>
<P>
   The poetry, said the president in his televised speech, was
given to him by a dear friend. ``Yes, I am that friend,'' Miller
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Miller and Clinton seem incongruous friends _
Miller, the homespun teacher, and Clinton, the slick lawyer. But
they became friends when they were both governors of Southern
states, both focused on public education.
</P>
<P>
   Both have greater than 70 percent job approval ratings today.
But Clinton clings desperately to his polls, while Miller ignores
his. Clinton's legacy is uncertain; Miller's is sure. He is the
governor who brought the HOPE scholarships to Georgia, enabling
every youngster who earns a ``B'' high school average to go to
college. He is the governor who initiated the first universal
pre-kindergarten program, distributing free classical music tapes
to every new mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``To govern is to choose,'' Miller says, ``not just battles, but
who you want to help.'' He wanted to help children. He focused on
education to the exclusion of issues critics say he shouldn't have
neglected _ mass transit, and air and water pollution, for example.
He dropped his campaign to remove the confederate battle emblem
from the state flag when political support vanished. He believes
politicans make their greatest mistakes getting caught up in social
issues ``that don't matter at the kitchen table'' _ issues like the
flag, school prayer, abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't find average Americans on the left or on the
right,'' said Miller. ``You'll find them at K-Mart.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 66-year-old Miller returns to his roots, he confirms the
teachings of his greatest mentor, his mother. In his last State of
the State address, he told of sitting on the Miller front porch as
a child, watching car headlights disappear across Brasstown
Mountain. His mother would laugh and say, ``You know what's so
great about this place? You can get anywhere in the world from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Miller named the places, from foreign capitols to
the oval office, that his political journey has taken him. He knows
well it could have taken him to Washington. But, he said,
``Everywhere I've ever been was on my way back home.''

<P>
   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my prediction for 1999: at some point during the year,
Dennis Rodman will do something weird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New Year's Eve is celebrated differently around the country.
Here in New York City, people go to Times Square and watch the ball
drop. In California, people go out to Malibu to watch Robert Downey
Jr. drop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York City if you want to celebrate New Year's Eve, you
have two options: one, you can go down to Times Square and watch
the ball drop...Or, you can go down to Dunkin' Donuts and watch the
mice drop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this morning, on the front page of one of the New York
City papers, they had a full page photo of mice crawling around at
a Dunkin Donuts here in Manhattan. Mice inside the display case...
Time to disinfect the donuts!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Dunkin' Donuts earlier today and they tried to tell
me that the mouse running around my box of donuts was part of a
Disney promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, our entire balcony is full of fired NFL coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, five NFL coaches were fired and then next week
they'll be tried by the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This NBA lockout, this strike, this labor action has really
been devastating. Listen to this: over the weekend, Madonna had to
have sex with a professional golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme restaurants here in New York City...they're all
going out of business. And you know why? Because nobody goes there,
they're losing money. And so now I'm thinking to myself, great, now
that these theme restaurants are out of business, where the hell
are you going to go for a bad hamburger and a $40 t-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I came out here, the Department of Sanitation asked me
to make the following announcement regarding Christmas tree
disposal, always a problem. Here's what you do: take the Christmas
tree out of your living room, your game room, your family room,
your den, wherever the hell you have it, put it on the sidewalk in
front of your house, that's where you put your Christmas tree --
right next to last year's Christmas tree, and they'll pick them
both up this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a busy time for Dick Clark. Thursday is New Year's Eve,
and then after that he goes right down to Washington for Dick
Clark's Rockin' Impeachment.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton, you know, he's all smiles, all
happy-go-lucky. Insiders claim that he's very depressed over this
Impeachment thing, and how could you blame the guy? I mean, here he
is, getting impeached for heaven's sake, so depressed today that
Patch Adams made a house call to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton had a nice Christmas. You know, he received the new
1999 White House intern calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting more and more details about Christmas at the
White House. For example, apparently President Clinton gave his
wife Hillary an alarm clock. And I'm thinking, well, isn't that
kind of an unnecessary gift. I mean, honestly, don't you believe
she woke up to him years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton had an excuse for why he bought his wife such a cheap
Christmas gift, the alarm clock. He said that he spent all of his
chick' money on interns.''
</P>
<P>
   The LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN, a production of Worldwide
Pants Incorporated, is broadcast weeknights (11:35 PM-12:37 AM,
ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network. Rob Burnett is the executive

<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   My friend Steve Efron was waiting in line at a bar cart by the
tracks at Grand Central Terminal on his way to Hastings-on-Hudson.
A woman rushed up, cut into the line and ordered a gin and tonic.
She then turned and announced to the waiting line, ``I'm sorry but
I have to catch a train.'' Steve didn't miss a beat. ``And I just
come here to drink,'' he said, sotto voce.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost a glove, I rushed off to Bloomingdale's to buy
another pair. I located what I wanted, decided to buy several pairs
and went to a cashier's station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm buying so many because I always seem to be losing my
gloves,'' I said. ``Just like `The Three Little Kittens.''' I got a
blank stare. I thought perhaps I hadn't made myself clear, so I
added, ``You know, like the three little kittens who lost their
mittens.'' Another blank stare.
</P>
<P>
   By now I was beginning to feel a little unnerved. Desperate to
make a connection, I looked around and when I saw no one in the
vicinity, I began singing, ``Three little kittens they lost their
mittens and they began to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the blank stare was replaced with a look of alarm and I
decided a retreat was in order. So I added that I guess they are
teaching different nursery rhymes to the newer generation. But
internally, I was doing my own crying. I understand that the Bible
and Shakespeare no longer form a common ground for universal
discourse _ but can we now no longer even count on a shared
universe of nursery rhymes?
</P>
<P>
   Lori Moskowitz Lepler knew it was time to either re-evaluate her
work situation or learn to cook. The other morning, about 8 a.m.,
her intercom buzzer rang and her 2-year-old son, Jake, immediately
said, ``Mommy, it's dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Every weekday morning, my three dogs and I go for an early walk
in Central Park. As I wend my way, I often pass the same man
sitting on the same isolated bench in a remote area, wearing big
earphones over his baseball cap, reading a newspaper, his dog
tucked under his feet. He always restrains his dog, making sure he
doesn't move out from under the bench.
</P>
<P>
   One day as I was getting ready to leave the park, I leashed all
my dogs because we were about to cross the park drive. At that
moment, the man and his dog walked by.
</P>
<P>
   Sloane, my large muscular Rhodesian Ridgeback, by nature very
friendly, broke loose and charged joyfully up to the man's dog to
say hello. As she barked energetically at him to come and play, the
owner started yelling at me, ``Get your dog on a leash, lady,'' as
if that would have made a difference. I responded, ``She's really
very friendly; she just wants to play.'' He responded, ``Well,
how's he supposed to know? He's a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a Saturday afternoon when Lita Karp entered the Grand
Street subway station. As she approached the turnstile, she heard a
male voice singing in Chinese. An audience had gathered to listen,
most of them contributing something.
</P>
<P>
   As she went downstairs to await the train, the song ended and a
new one began. It seemed familiar and Ms. Karp couldn't understand
why she was humming along. Soon the light dawned. The song was a
Chinese translation of ``Old Folks at Home.'' Now she's left with
several unanswered questions _ why and when was it translated, and
did the singer know anything about the Swanee River?
</P>
<P>
   Clara Greenspan was watching a program on innovative school
programming in Texas on Channel 13 one Sunday evening in late
November. As one educator was interviewed, he was identified on the
screen as ``School Superintendant Munoz.'' Write ``Superintendent''
100 times.
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, Ian Murphy reports that the writers of the
news zipper at Avenue of the Americas and 48th Street might learn
something from the maxim of the pot and the kettle.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls that in early December the ribbon relayed a story
razzing Texas for having to destroy several thousand books because
of poor spelling and grammar. The next story involved Iraq's
importing Viagra even though ``its'' made in the United States, and
the item after that was about the ``vigrous defense'' made by
President Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Johnson was entertaining friends at a Sunday buffet brunch
at a restaurant that had an impressive display of fish. Along with
the salmon, lobster, oysters and other delicacies was a fish none
of them recognized. It turned out to be sable, but before they
found that out, they queried a waiter about its identity. ``It's a
Jewish fish,'' he said. ``Is it circumcised?'' Mrs. Johnson asked
in jest. ``No, it's smoked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My friend David Laibman recently called a new French restaurant
in Brooklyn to find out what credit cards they took and what their
reservation policy was. When he also asked if they had a prix fixe
menu, the young woman said, ``No, we change it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Carroll was on a business trip to Dayton, Ohio, recently
with Mark, a business associate. Mark lives in Manhattan but was
born and raised in New Zealand and has a distinct accent. As they
were touring their client's office building, their escort asked
where they lived. Mark spoke first and said ``New York City.'' She
turned to him, somewhat embarrassed, and said, ``I'm sorry, I
should have known from your accent.''
</P>
<P>
   Dora Kooby was standing in line waiting to pay for her
merchandise when she heard a woman in another line ask for the 25
percent discount offered on shoes. The cashier replied, ``Ma'am,
these are slippers, not shoes.'' The woman protested, ``Well, I
wear these outside.'' Are slippers shoes when worn outside? Did she
get her discount? We'll never know. The unresolved exchange was
still going on when our correspondent left.

MEDIA MAY NOT BE THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Very good news arrived just in time to give us
yet another reason to celebrate the coming of the new year along
with a boundless stock market. Violent crime committed by young
people, along with other malefactions, recorded a reduction for the
seventh year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   There is less violent crime among the young today than there has
been for the past 25 years, according to a Justice Department
report.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, must mean that television and the movies have
abandoned their accustomed reliance on violence to make their
products attractive especially to the young. So, too, must have
newspapers done, because experts had assured us that the exposure
of the kids to violence in the media inured them to it and
encouraged them to act out violently.
</P>
<P>
   But one looks and looks at all the media and sees business being
done in the time-honored fashion. Violence is still being peddled,
despite an occasional lapse by some of the media into civic
high-mindedness. Notwithstanding the persistence of the movies and
television to continue to purvey most unwholesome products,
violence among the young _ and not only among them _ dropped to
lows not seen for a quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that the host of experts who sought to treat
deep-seated social pathologies by undermining the First Amendment
to impose restraints on the media likely have been seriously
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   While the violence portrayed ubiquitously on the large and the
small screen has many faults, being the proximate cause of aberrant
behavior by impressionable youngsters does not appear to be among
them.
</P>
<P>
   So there is good reason to deal with the very real pathologies
in more appropriate ways that are actually effective although they
are more complex than ranting at the media.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report, along with a host of other
experts, accounted for the sudden rise of juvenile violence in the
mid-1980s and its steady decline since 1991, chiefly citing a drop
in the use of crack cocaine. Crack was sold in small quantities for
relatively little money. It produced an intense high for a short
time, and was fearsomely addictive. Kids became users and runners.
To get money to pay for their habits, they also became robbers. To
protect their crack enterprises, they resorted to guns and used
them freely against rival gangs. The result was the burgeoning
violent crime rate among kids and young people.
</P>
<P>
   With the subsiding of the crack culture, the ancillary robberies
and killings diminished. With the enforcement of stricter gun laws,
the availability of firearms was reduced. With the aging of the
boomers out of their crime-committing years, the number of
potential law breakers shrank. With the steadily improving economy,
more jobs were available to those kids who turned to the drug trade
for lack of alternatives to making a buck.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the intertwined reasons a variety of experts
propounded to explain the welcome crime reduction, in addition to
other efforts more specific to particular communities or
situations. Not one of them, at least so far, said anything about
violence in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Although the media may not be guilty as charged, they are
nevertheless not blameless. If the argument that they spawn
violence among their viewers is not factually supported, their
programming and presentations still are an offense to the
aesthetics of a good life.
</P>
<P>
   Their relentless pursuit of audiences with ever more outrageous
fare numbs minds and dulls sensibilities. Without question, parents
need to exercise their responsibilities and prevent their children
from being overexposed to this tripe. But parental dereliction is
implied by studies that show kids continuing to consume an enormous
amount of television.
</P>
<P>
   Restraining kids from overdosing on the tube may not keep them
from becoming mass killers. On the other hand, it might direct them
to alternatives, such as reading a book or drawing a picture,
building a model ship or collecting bottle caps, that will enrich
their lives, stimulate their interests in ways that apathetically
sitting in front of a TV for endless hours never could hope to.
</P>
<P>
   There are bad books and bad newspapers, just as there are bad
films and television. A major point of life is to develop the
personal discretion to be able to decide which is what.
</P>
<P>
   Parents neglect their duty if they don't help their kids learn
by making choices for them when they are too inexperienced to make
them for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment and news media sensationalize and titillate
for one reason only. They know from gauging behavior of their
audiences that is what constitutes popularity. If viewers'
attention were to be miraculously captured by serializing great
novels, then these communications moguls would just as happily
replace the violence with the likes of Trollope and Thackeray.
</P>
<P>
   They have no vested interest in violence or English masters.
They do have a stake in finding what makes them the most money.
</P>
<P>
   This harsh fact of life gives power to ordinary people, if they
only would chose to exercise it. They could put their power into
play by simply refusing to watch objectionable and exploitative
presentations at home or at the multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been the same, since the ascendancy of mass
culture, that those choices have tended more to the worse than the
better. For which, once again, folks, we can look most profitably
to ourselves for the remedy.
</P>

NOTHING BUT STARS AND BEACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 10)  
(lb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To reach Jericoacoara, you take a highway back through time,
rippling further back with each mile of Brazilian coast. From
Fortaleza, with its sleek beachfront hotels, the road grows
desolate, drought painting the savanna of the northeast dull green
and beige.
</P>
<P>
   Cars give way to horses and mules, buildings shrink to huts, and
spindly goats and cows forage over the brush. As the road goes from
asphalt to dirt to just paths in the sand, you would not be
surprised to find wagon wheels and animal skulls, the detritus of
ancient, failed journeys, strewn by the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Jericoacoara, you take a bus, an impossible, eight-hour
journey from Fortaleza, stopping at every little hiccup of a town
along the highway, or you take a four-hour ride in a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Try to sleep, because it is the middle of the night. You dream
of sand dunes 100 feet tall, massive and immutable as mountains.
You come near, and realize they are always changing shape and
moving with the winds from Africa, and you wonder if this is where
God comes to finger-paint.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Jericoacoara, you close your eyes and say it:
jeh-ree-kwah-KWAH-rah. First it sounds like a fruit, one that grows
in clusters and spills over your mouth. Say it again. It is a bird
squawking, like the roosters whose call bounces over the dunes to
rouse you at dawn. And again: It is a word within a word, like a
seashell held to your ear, calling you to a place that is distant
and familiar, inside you, mysterious and intimate, at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Though people who live here decry the onslaught of tourism, of
buggies roaring over the dunes and houses dotting the shore,
Jericoacoara remains one of the planet's hidden beach treasures. In
Jericoacoara, some 180 miles northwest of Fortaleza on the northern
coast, the trappings of modern life _ cars, buildings, phones and
fax machines _ remain remote.
</P>
<P>
   The town, a smattering of about a dozen streets, is dotted with
single-story shacks, most serving as stores, restaurants or inns.
The streets have grown outward from the Atlantic, and the town is
surrounded by green hills and vast sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Regular electricity arrived only last spring; until then, the
town of 1,400 used generators, and handwritten signs in hotel rooms
still warn of the dreaded hair dryer, which could short-circuit the
whole town for the sake of a do. Only two of the dozen or so places
to stay take credit cards, and public phones shut down at 10 each
night. The streets are all sand: Wherever you are in Jericoacoara,
you never really leave the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Roger, my fiance, and I arrived in Jericoacoara in early July.
It was the feast day of St. Peter, patron saint of fishermen. It
was also the day Brazil's soccer team faced the Netherlands in the
World Cup quarterfinals. Along the road, Catholics were building
towers of wood, some several stories high, to burn fires that night
to honor the saint. Theoretically, there would be fireworks, too _
if any were left after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the saint's humility would be tried, for his was not
the main event that day. All the stores and restaurants shut down
in midafternoon. Brazil was going for its fifth World Cup trophy,
so guests and workers of the Hotel Jericoacoara Praia, where we
were staying, crammed on benches and chairs to watch the game on
the common television.
</P>
<P>
   Picture the comparable scene on the other side of the
hemisphere, where Americans would gather to watch, say, the Super
Bowl. The beer and soda would flow, and the munchies would come in
buckets during frequent commercial breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But here, nobody ate or drank, and there were no commercials.
The concentration was so intense that asking for anything would
have been sacrilege. The only interruptions came when Brazil
scored, raising the trademark ``GOOOOL'' from sportscasters, and
raucous cheers. A busboy crouched in the courtyard, lighting
rockets and cherry bombs.
</P>
<P>
   When stores reopened after Brazil's victory, we bought soap and
shampoo from the drugstore. It was almost night, and we heard,
around the corner, the twang of a berimbau accompanying a chant
that seemed to float off the waves. On an asphalt court behind a
store, teen-agers were facing off in capoeira, a kind of martial
art almost balletic in its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Capoeira arose at the end of the 17th century among slaves, as a
preparation for insurrection or escape, masked as dance to throw
off any whites who happened upon it. While the music plays, the
movement is constant, a collage of pieces from a jigsaw puzzle, or
riddles with open answers. The two rivals cartwheel before each
other or jut in and around each others' bodies, together forming a
whole whose contours change with the next beat.
</P>
<P>
   In capoeira, punches and kicks are thrown but never land, like
the rebellion that never materialized. Freedom came only in 1888 by
royal decree, a year before the Portuguese crown finally left
Brazil and only after slavery ended everywhere else in the
Americas. Through the shifting shapes of the dancers, the view was
clear to dusk's sky, streaked orange and pink over the ocean,
framed by the palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   Starved for the sound of waves, watching for the moon, we found
a place to eat dinner by the shore. The cook sat behind the counter
watching a telenovella, and _ this being the low season _ it seemed
most items on the menu were not to be had. No bread, either. No
juice. No diet soda. It was becoming clear that this is a place
tourists bend into, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually she cooked us some fish, rice and beans, and cut up a
salad of cabbage. The waiter found a bottle of beer and one of
water. Since we were the only customers, he stopped by every 30
seconds or so to make sure everything was all right. There was no
coffee and no dessert. We found an ice cream store, but it had
already closed.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead, though, the new moon was rising in a sky so clear and
bright that even the moon's hidden side could be made out. The
patch of earth we occupied was dark, far from cities and street
lights, so much so that we felt tiny and mesmerized by the
spectacle overhead. In the sky, billions of stars like small
mirrors flashed glimmers of light across the vast nocturnal
playground. This sky was far richer, more brilliant, than any we
had ever imagined or witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the plenty, it was difficult to recognize the familiar
constellations like Orion's Belt or the Southern Cross. Venus was
lost in an ocean of her sisters. Only the Milky Way was easily
discernible, incredibly so, appearing like a river of stars
spraying white mist.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, briefly dead, come back to talk of rising toward a
white light. I wondered if all these stars were holes in the sky,
through which that brightness becomes visible, flashing us signals
in a heavenly code not yet deciphered.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Sunday, we needed as a day to let the place
sink in before plunging into serious sightseeing. We walked along
the beach, watching the children scavenging for crabs. We sunbathed
and swam in the clear, cool Atlantic. Parasailers glided in smooth
arcs from the shore, powered by winds strong as sure, steady arms.
</P>
<P>
   Past the fishermen's boats waiting for the evening tide, we
trekked to a shoreside dune. From a distance, the dune had seemed
utterly static. A closer look showed the sand cascading down
shelves formed along the dune's face, the desert's answer to a
waterfall. When we returned the next day, the dune seemed utterly
altered, as if somebody had dragged a comb in lazy waves over its
surface.
</P>
<P>
   That night, we had more success with dinner, stopping at a
charming little restaurant, Sabor e Arte (Flavor and Art), that had
opened a couple of months before, run by four young women who had
fled the industrial megalopolis of Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was the only restaurant in town with some notion of
decor, with painted starfish over the bar, tablecloths and a
central pillar open for customers' graffiti. Candlelight flickered
at the tables, while incense rose in curls around the room.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen was a small, open area behind the bar, and as they
grilled our fish, fetched and arranged, the women danced to Phil
Collins. Truth be told, the food was slow in coming but good, and _
a wonderful bonus _ we found somebody there with a dune buggy to
take us sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, at low tide, we headed for Tatajuba,
about 20 miles west of Jericoacoara. The point of Tatajuba is as
much the ride there as the lake that goes by that name. There is no
road per se; we drove along the shore, mile after mile. A makeshift
ferry, really a raft, takes the car across a small inlet, nudged
along by two boatmen digging sticks into the sand.
</P>
<P>
   We drove past a forest of desiccated trees, the roots like
antlers, whitened and dry, vaulting into the sand. Then there is
just ocean, sunlight and dunes tall as multistory buildings, blown
by the wind into dramatic shapes. Some look like bread loaves, and
others swirl into giant beehives. A few end in steep, curving walls
that stretch like bleached, sleek versions of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The road passes through the old Tatajuba, abandoned when the
dunes advanced and swallowed the houses. Here and there, the corner
of a roof is still visible, peeking out through the sand. The new
fishing village of Tatajuba is a smattering of houses, built around
the town's only television. It sits atop a 10-foot pedestal, in a
weatherbeaten wood cabinet. Each night, the double doors to the
cabinet are opened, and everybody turns out to watch the
telenovellas.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the benches in the square face away from the
television, so that the mayor's name, painted on the inside back of
the bench, can be seen by passers-by. That leaves most of the
residents sitting on the curb, their feet in the sand, to watch
television. There isn't any argument over which station to watch.
Only one, the pervasive Globo network, reaches here.
</P>
<P>
   Coming around the dune to Lake Tatajuba, we stumbled upon a
scene out of Fellini. A toothless old lady sat at a bridge table
along the shore, eager to ply us with home-made candy bars laden
with brown sugar. On an identical white plastic chair next to her
sat a young man in sunglasses and boxer shorts, lost in a book on
etiquette. Specifically lost on the chapter explaining when and how
to kiss a lady's hand.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had a society news spot on a radio station in the
interior, an oddly incongruous way to make a living, because the
Northeast is the poorest part of Brazil. He was headed for
Jericoacoara and asked if we could give him a lift.
</P>
<P>
   Also plying his living at the shore was a boy who persuaded us
to take a sail around the lake on a converted fishing boat for $1.
The candy peddler advanced, her aluminum pot swinging over her arm
like a handbag. Wouldn't we be wanting another sweet when we got
back, she urged; a couple from Sao Paulo had bought eight of them.
Take it or leave it; she'd be going home.
</P>
<P>
   There were no houses around, and I couldn't imagine where home
would be. I half-believed that the crone and the gossipmeister had
somehow just appeared, conjured from the depths of this eerie,
portable desert. The sail lasted but 10 minutes or so, with us
ducking each time the boy swung the sail around to catch a hint of
a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, we were heading back for Jericoacoara, Mr.
Manners in the front seat, deep into the proper silver setting for
formal dinners. We dropped him at the Hippopotamus hotel, where the
management had promised him a couple of free days.
</P>
<P>
   In the late afternoon, we headed out to Thunder Rock, about a
five-minute drive and a scamper down a steep, sandy hill to the
ocean. There we watched the brilliant orange and yellow of the sun
drop down the horizon through an arch in the tall rock. On July 15
each year, residents gather here to watch the sun set perfectly in
the middle of the rock.
</P>
<P>
   We wouldn't be here on the 15th, but as we watched the stars
emerge for another brilliant night, we understood the secret that
made Jericoacoara so hypnotic. Despite the occasional television,
parasail or dune buggy, Jericoacoara remains a place where
technology has not yet dominated nature's rhythms and gifts. There
was television, but it did not carry the main show. There was
electricity, but not enough to erase the starlight.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Getting There
</P>
<P>
   Remember that you'll need a visa for Brazil. VASP Brazilian
Airlines, (800) 732-8277, and Varig Brazilian Airlines, (800)
673-4561, fly to Fortaleza from Miami. VASP goes on Sunday, Varig
on Tuesday and Thursday; round-trip tickets start at $780.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're on a very tight budget, hire a private car to get
to Jeri, as it is called locally. You can do this through the
tourism desk at the airport or your hotel in Fortaleza. It will run
about $150 each way instead of $12 for a bus, but will save eight
hours and, because of the bus schedules, allow two decent nights'
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest influx of visitors comes from the December holidays
to Carnival. Other peak times are Holy Week and in July.
</P>
<P>
   There are few phones in Jericoacoara. For many places, you will
have to call the town's phone station, (55-88) 621-1144, and ask a
runner to relay your message or to get someone to come to the
phone. The Web site www.jericoacoara.com has some basic information
on the town.
</P>
<P>
   Things to Do
</P>
<P>
   To enjoy the night sky at Jericoacoara, pack an astronomy guide
for the Southern Hemisphere. A small telescope would not be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Dune-buggy excursions can be arranged at the Casa do Turismo
hotel. Five-hour trips cost $8 to $12.50.
</P>
<P>
   Boat rides can be arranged with local fishermen for a dollar or
two.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   Even the best hotels offer rudimentary lodging, and since we
encountered credit-card fraud after our visit, it might wise to pay
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   We reserved a room at the Hippopotamus, Rua do Forro,
Jericoacoara, Brazil 62598-000, but were offered rooms with a
flooded bathroom and wood shavings covered with ants. And it didn't
take credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, the Jericoacoara Praia, 115 Rua fo Forro, accepted
Visa and charged half as much as the Hippo. It has 15 rooms, and
while the flagstones on the walls and floors seemed slapped down,
and a canvas drop ceiling looked as if it had never been shaken out
or vacuumed, the management was eager to please. Doubles cost $25
to $37.50. Reservations: (55-88) 603-1602.
</P>
<P>
   Next trip, I'd try the Pousada Papagaio, which had just opened
and featured 10 lovely, simple rooms with open-air showers and a
beautiful garden of regional trees. Doubles cost $17 or $25
depending on season. No credit cards and no telephone.
</P>
<P>
   A second choice would be the Casa do Turismo, on Rua das Unas,
the largest hotel in town. This oceanfront inn has 20 rooms, rents
water-sports equipment and takes American Express, Visa and
Mastercard. Doubles: $29 to $37.50; (55-88) 621-0211.
</P>
<P>
   Pousada do Paulo, Corrego do Urub, Gijoca de Jericoacoara
(Ceara) 62598-000, is at nearby Paradise Lake. It has five rustic
private bungalows, each sleeping four, with private bath, and with
views of the lake. The restaurant is open 24 hours, serving
Brazilian and Italian dishes. Off-peak rates run $50 a night, cash
only; (55-88) 669-1181;
www.geocities.com/thetropics/1136/Paolo.html.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   There are several restaurants that don't bother with fly traps,
let alone decor or matching plates, but have wonderful food. One is
Sabor da Terra, on Rua do Forro, where we had grilled fish, served
with rice, beans and french fries for about $9. No phone.
</P>
<P>
   A close second was Sabor e Arte, where you'll have a long, if
pleasant, wait. Meals cost $7.50 to $15, there's no phone and so no
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Shop
</P>
<P>
   The state of Ceara is the place to buy anything embroidered or
crocheted. In the bar at the Jericoacoara Praia, you'll find piles
of crocheted beach covers, tablecloths and runners. At the
beachfront stalls in Fortaleza, you can find hammocks for under
$20, embroidered tablecloths for $30 and hand-embroidered linen
place-mat and napkin settings for six at about $10.

(ATTN: N.J.)  
 EURO AIRPORT IN BASEL BECOMES A REGIONAL HUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 10)  
(lb) 
 By ROGER COLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swissair has introduced nonstop service from Newark, N.J., to
Basel, Switzerland, welcome news to travelers who can now make fast
connections through a small, user-friendly airport to provincial
cities like Bilbao, Nuremberg, Dresden, Toulouse, Nice, Marseilles,
Valencia, Friedrichshafen and Rostock.
</P>
<P>
   There are also flights to major cities such as London and
Berlin, but often to business airports like London City and
Tempelhof, a short cab ride to the city center. In addition, there
are connections to megahubs like Heathrow, England; Charles de
Gaulle in Paris; Amsterdam, the Netherlands; and Frankfurt, Germany
_ if that's where you need to go.
</P>
<P>
   The six-times-weekly service, which began Dec. 17, is by
Swissair Airbus 310 (42 business-class and 143 economy seats) as a
code-share with Delta Airlines and Crossair _ Swissair's regional
subsidiary _ which is developing an extensive hub-and-spoke network
through Basel.
</P>
<P>
   Newark-Basel is the first of a dozen similar ``long, thin''
(that is, with sparse traffic) services that will be operated in
Crossair colors on routes such as Basel-Buenos Aires/Atlanta/Mexico
City/Charlotte, N.C. _ what I call regional long-haul routes.
Crossair ultimately plans to acquire a long-haul fleet of upgraded
Boeing 767s to serve these routes.
</P>
<P>
   Book a flight to Basel or Mulhouse, France, and you'll arrive at
the same airport _ Euro Airport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg _ right at
the border separating Switzerland, France and Germany in the Upper
Rhine Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Four million people live within 60 minutes of the airport, which
is 6.3 miles (10 kilometers) from Basel, 16 miles (26 kilometers)
from Mulhouse and 46 miles (75 kilometers) from Freiburg in the
southwestern corner of Germany. Zurich, Switzerland, will be 45
minutes away when a new highway is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Euro Airport, 50 years old but in the process of expansion, will
have served nearly 3 million passengers in 1998 (around 40 percent
each from France and Switzerland and 20 percent from Germany) with
12 airlines currently offering more than 45 scheduled flights to 92
destinations in 25 countries. Such carriers as Air France, British
Airways, Sabena, KLM and Lufthansa serve 36 cities in 20 countries
from Euro Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Bypassing the Megahubs
</P>
<P>
   Crossair plans to develop Euro Airport as a regional hub for
people who wish to travel between, say, Nuremberg and Bilbao, or
Dresden and Toulouse, thus saving time and avoiding the misery of
changing planes at a megahub like Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt,
London, Paris or Zurich, which give priority to long-haul
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Crossair's ``Euro Cross'' is a new strategy that provides more
than 520 connections a day between 40 cities through Euro Airport
with an expected connecting time of 20 minutes. The carrier aims to
have 1,000 daily connections linking 48 European destinations by
next year, including regional services from Euro Airport to such
destinations as Warsaw, Budapest, Athens, Ankara, Bologna,
Stockholm, Copenhagen, Glasgow, Oporto, Trieste and Moscow, as well
as long-haul routes to North America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Euro Cross flights arrive and depart in four coordinated waves:
early in the morning, midday, afternoon and evening, enabling
people traveling to and from most destinations in Europe to get
there and back the same day. For example, Toulouse-Vienna via Euro
Cross is two hours 15 minutes faster than via Zurich;
Amsterdam-Bilbao is two hours faster than via Paris; and
Friedrichshafen-Birmingham is one hour 30 minutes faster than
connecting in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone could fly point-to-point from Frankfurt to Palma at
a suitable time, he would never go via Euro Cross, or if someone in
Nuremberg could save time by flying to Bordeaux via Frankfurt, he
would not use Euro Cross,'' says Moritz Suter, president and chief
executive of Crossair. ``But people will take Euro Cross because it
is faster and easier in many cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Convenience at a Price
</P>
<P>
   Crossair flies to 82 European destinations (plus around 25
routes on behalf of Swissair) with a fleet of 80 aircraft
consisting of 33-seat Saab 340 turboprops, 50-seat Saab 2000
turboprops and 97-seat Avro RJ jets. The company carried 4.7
million passengers in 1997 _ 19 percent more than the previous year
_ and made a net profit of about $28 million.
</P>
<P>
   Small planes operating frequent flights on lightly traveled
routes and relatively high fares are the key ingredients to
Crossair's success. Round-trip fares from Euro Airport to London
City, a 15-minute cab ride from the City, or Heathrow are $1,085 in
business class, $845 in economy and $185 discounted fare.
</P>
<P>
   Crossair is what you might call a ``high frills'' carrier.
Riding the 33-seat Saab 340 Cityliner, for example, is the next
best thing to a private plane. On short flights you're served
regional specialties with wines to match, or open sandwiches of
smoked salmon and cheese with champagne from a real bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The triangle where the frontiers of Switzerland, France and
Germany intersect on the Rhine is the crossroads of ancient
north-south and east-west trading routes, in use long before the
nations were created. Alsace changed hands many times between
France and Germany over the years _ belonging to Germany from 1871
to 1918 and again from 1940 to 1944.
</P>
<P>
   From the balcony of Suter's office at the airport, you can see
the city of Basel to the south, St. Louis in France to the north,
and beyond that the German city of Weil-am-Rhein on the other side
of the Rhine and to the northeast Loerrach, in Germany. Mulhouse is
to the northeast; to the north is Mulheim in Germany and Strasbourg
in France.

</P>
<P>
   A Historical Crossroads
</P>
<P>
   The region had its genesis as a trading hub in 1226 when Bishop
von Thun of Basel mortgaged his entire fortune to build the first
bridge on the Rhine _ the tollhouse still stands in the center of
the old bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Merchant caravans from Scandinavia and northern Germany would
come down through the Rhine Valley, crossing the river at Basel on
their way south via the Alps to Italy; the silk caravans from China
came up from the Balkans, crossing the Rhine here, and continuing
to Paris and London.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-19th century, railway engineers followed the old
caravan routes: the night express from Stockholm to Palermo still
crosses the Rhine at Basel _ one of the most important railway hubs
in central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Germany and France have train stations on Swiss ground in the
center of Basel. Modern highways follow the old routes from north
to south and west to east, still crossing the Rhine at Basel.
</P>
<P>
   The Euro Airport is an intercultural experience. It is built on
French soil and run by a kind of public joint venture between
France and Switzerland with board members from each country along
with representatives from Germany _ a fast-growing sector of the
airport's business.
</P>
<P>
   There is a French-Swiss frontier within the airport, which
apparently can be shifted depending on how many departure gates are
needed on either side.
</P>
<P>
   The Eurobar straddles the frontier; the same bartender serves on
both sides. The Airport Grill offers entirely different menus on
the French and Swiss sides, with the food coming from the same
kitchen. A three-course dinner with wine could cost $55 a person on
the Swiss side, a third less on the French side.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you use the French or Swiss side depends, of course, on
where you're heading. (Each country has its own immigration and
customs channels.) But it may be a good idea to compare taxi and
car-rental prices in French and Swiss francs. There are separate
parking lots on each side.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to Germany, you can come out either side. But
the airport bus to Freiburg goes from the French exit. And a French
taxi is likely to cost a lot less than a Swiss taxi. You may like
the idea of taking a French taxi to Germany or Switzerland.

 &HT;    ELIZABETH DOLE LEAVES RED CROSS; PRESIDENTIAL BID NEXT?
 &HT;    420&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole stepped down Monday as head of the
American Red Cross to decide whether to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, speaking to hundreds of Red Cross employees at the
organization's national headquarters, hinted broadly that she plans
to run for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this important time in our national life, I believe there
may be another way for me to serve our country,'' Dole said from a
flag-bedecked, satellite-wired stage in the organization's ornate
Board of Governors Hall. ``The Red Cross has been a glorious
mission field, but I believe there may be other duties yet to
fulfill.''
</P>
<P>
   After her remarks, as she wound through the crowd past a bank of
television cameras, Dole responded to questions of whether she
would make a White House bid. ``I'm going to give it serious
consideration, along with other options,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's husband, Bob, a former Senate majority leader who lost to
Bill Clinton in the 1996 presidential election, was not present for
the announcement. He has long urged his wife to run for their
party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Elizabeth Dole is one of the most popular
figures in GOP politics and has several important assets at this
stage in the campaign. Among the most important are her famous name
and the fund-raising network that kept her husband in public office
for nearly four decades.
</P>
<P>
   She also has a long record of service with the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina native is a Harvard-trained lawyer who has
served under six presidents beginning with Lyndon Johnson. Her
quarter-century government career includes four years as
transportation secretary in Ronald Reagan's cabinet and three years
as labor secretary under President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Dole became president of the American Red Cross in 1991, three
years after her husband's loss to Bush in the 1988 GOP presidential
primaries. She took a brief leave of absence from the organization
in 1996 to help her husband campaign against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During her eight years at the Red Cross, the organization
modernized its blood operation and disaster relief services and
redesigned its fund-raising practices. The organization's board
chairman, Norman Augustine, called Dole ``a transformational
figure'' in the Red Cross and, in the event of a disaster, an
``on-site manager'' of relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've often said that the weather service tracks Elizabeth,''
he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers believe that Dole may actually be
positioning herself for the 2000 vice presidential nomination, the
office her husband sought in 1976 under Gerald Ford. A woman on the
ticket might help the GOP with women voters, although Geraldine
Ferraro's candidacy in 1984 did not appear to help the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And a pairing with the current GOP front-runner, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, could be an unhappy reminder for Republicans hungry
to regain the White House. The governor is the son of former
President George Bush, who lost to Clinton in 1992,
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dole name does not exactly connote a bridge to the 21st
century,'' said Jack Pitney, a former Republican National Committee
official who now teaches political science at Claremont McKenna
College in California. ``That would be especially true if she
accepted the vice presidential nomination under Governor Bush. A
Bush-Dole ticket would sound like a remake of the GOP's last two
electoral disasters.''

   ISRAEL-CULT _ MEVASSARET ZION _ Other than the fact that they
were Americans and that their children were not in school, their
Israeli neighbors did not find anything unusual about the family
that moved into this Jerusalem suburb a few months ago. They were
friendly, asked a lot of questions about Israeli current events and
did the usual sightseeing. But, Israeli police raided this villa
and another in a nearby town this weekend, arresting eight adults
and four children believed to be in a Denver-based Christian
millennium cult that planned to die in suicidal attacks at the end
of this year. Police said Monday that three members of the group
would be held while the rest are deported to the United States.
Left on their yard, apparently discarded by police, was a folder

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Y2K is OK by me
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ It's the first of the New Year, a time
for new beginnings. No time like the present to start preparing for
the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   You can hardly open up the newspaper without seeing a headline
warning of the impending doom of ``Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're like I am, and look no further than the headlines,
you've probably been wondering why all the commotion about a new,
improved, double-strength lubricating jelly.
</P>
<P>
   But read on. ``Y2K'' is abbreviation for the year 2000 and the
likelihood of impending doom when the century turns over and the
computers roll over and play dead.
</P>
<P>
   Apocalypse, if not now, soon.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds of our own destruction of our database were sown in the
beginning of the computer age. Youngsters may believe that in the
beginning there was Word Perfect. But this was way before then, in
the 1950s thereabouts, when computers were vast in size and vastly
limited in capacity.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that instead of, say, ``1957,'' computers were
programmed simply to recognize ``57,'' thus saving a couple of
digits. In the process, we may have lost life as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly all utilities and other such niceties of civilization
will fail if computers go kaput come the year 2000, unable to cope
when the century changes. Heaven knows I know how they'll feel.
I've been having trouble coping with change since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even as the doomsday clock ticks down, there are
those among us who believe the Y2K is much ado over next to
nothing, which in turn greatly offends that segment that believes
Y2K-liness is next to godliness.
</P>
<P>
   Religion is much involved. A Baptist church in my little
hometown, for example, is urging members to slowly begin
withdrawing their money from financial institutions during the
coming year, the idea being when the computers fail, the banks will
fail right along with them.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be surival of the best outfitted. True believers of the
worst-case scenario are hard at work stocking up and socking away
foodstuffs, kerosene and water supplies. Some are even digging
their own water wells and connecting their homes to private
generators.
</P>
<P>
   It's the fallout shelter crisis all over again, when some
families in the 1950s installed backyard concrete bunkers in
preparation for nuclear holocaust, also much preached from pulpits
to scare the hell out of us.
</P>
<P>
   What with the untimely implosion of the Soviet Union and the
godless communism therein, Y2K may be helping to fill the void left
for subject matter in sermons of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Y2K lacks the immediacy of A-bomb annihilation.
``Repent now, for tomorrow you may die'' certainly has it over
``Repent now, for 12 months from now your computer may die.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to make light of a subject taken seriously by many among us.
</P>
<P>
   I know an editor who made that mistake. Referred in print to it
as ``Y2Kookiness,'' he did.
</P>
<P>
   An outraged reader called to warn him that he'd be laughing out
of the other side of his face, as it were, come the 2000 revolution
and he finds himself sitting in his own sewage.
</P>
<P>
   I think he missed a good bet. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're right and I'm wrong, indeed, on New Year's Day 2000
I will sit in my own sewage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I'm right and you're wrong, you have to sit in my own
sewage.''
</P>
<P>
   Any takers?

SMALL TEXAS TOWN OFFERING INCENTIVES TO NEW RESIDENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Faced with the enviable problem of more jobs
than people, the Panhandle town of Dalhart is offering $1,000 and
help with home loans to those willing to move and work there.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called ``The New Millennium Opportunity,'' began in
the summer when Dalhart employers found that the town's 6,500
population simply could not fill the jobs in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10 employers got together with the Dalhart Economic
Development Corp. and put up the money as an incentive to move
here,'' said Warren Slaughter, editor of the Dalhart Texan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 25 skilled positions and about 50 non-skilled
that need to be filled, and we just thought this might be the best
way to do it,'' said Slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those jobs are at a state prison, on a hog farm or on a
potato plantation, the town's largest employers. A number of them,
however, are for accountants, mid-level executives and medical
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The giveaway is not unlike the scheme another Panhandle town
tried two years ago. Lefors, a tiny community of fewer than 600,
offered 14 free residential lots to those who promised to settle
there within six months. Winners were drawn by lottery.
</P>
<P>
   That proved only partially successful. City Secretary Judy
Williams said eight of the lots were eventually taken by people who
now occupy them.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement that owners move to Lefors was removed last
year. Four other lots have since been taken over by out-of-town
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we got a few families here and a number of children
in the school,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalhart plan calls for potential workers to be willing to
move there and work for a minimum of 12 months for one of the
participating employers. As an added incentive to the $1,000 cash,
the development corporation will help the worker obtain up to
$10,000 in home financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't advertise,'' said Slaughter. ``I ran a story on it
and The Associated Press picked it up. We got some calls and about
a half-dozen people moved here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, (last) week, a TV network did a story on it. Since then,
we've gotten about 600 calls in the past couple of days. They're
calling from all over, New York, New Jersey, Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter points out that the attractions to Dalhart may be
limited, but so are the city's drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the cultural experience in Dalhart isn't going to be
anything like a real city,'' he said. ``I mean, we're close to the
mountains in New Mexico and we've got a bowling alley, a community
theater and a movie theater, but there's not a lot of other
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand we have a low tax rate, prices are
reasonable and our crime is below just about everybody's. We've had
five armed robberies in 96 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalhart program is not without its detractors. Slaughter
said a few people felt the offer was degrading to the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they felt that paying people to move here would make
us a laughingstock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, if it works, so what?''

FOR THE GOVERNMENT: FEAR HAS REPLACED TRUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Assuming Bill Clinton finishes out his term, the
next presidential election promises to be the best _ by that I mean
closest _ since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are contained in a new poll conducted by the Kaiser
Foundation and Harvard University for the Washington Post. It shows
a country caught in an electoral crossfire, between the assault of
religious and cultural conservatives from the right and the
continued fear of tax-and-spend liberals from the left.
</P>
<P>
   How voters react to this dangerous predicament will decide the
presidential election in 2000 and the direction of American
politics in the early 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Clinton supporters in the survey is that more
voters care about ``a candidate's stands on the issues'' _ 37
percent _ than on his or her ``personal morals and ethics'' _ 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also benefit from a growing public tolerance on
matters of personal morality in government officials. While only 24
percent said ``yes'' when asked if the president has ``high
personal moral and ethical standards,'' six out of 10 said
Clinton's behavior is no better or worse than others of his
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Clinton Democrats face trouble is from an equally
pronounced decrease in public respect for government.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in 1968, that most explosive of anti-establishment years,
if they ``trust the government in Washington to do the right
thing,'' 61 percent checked ``just about always'' or ``most of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 33 percent checked those responses in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This is a devastating 30-year trend for the Democrats, a
political party that has placed its faith in positive public
solutions to national problems such as poverty, poor health care
and inadequate education.
</P>
<P>
   The antipathy toward Washington shows up in another question put
to voters in the new poll. Asked in 1965 what institution _ ``Big
Government,'' ``Big Labor'' or ``Big Business'' _ they fear poses
the largest threat down the road, 35 percent said ``Big
Government.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the same multiple-choice in 1998, ``Big Business'' scored
somewhat higher as a national pariah, ``Big Labor'' pathetically
lower. ``Big Government'' zoomed to 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What does this tell us about the 2000 presidential campaign?
First, that Democrats will do everything they can to peg
Republicans as the party of the ``religious right,'' a faction
driven to a frenzy by its ideological zeal, its social and sexual
intolerance. Meanwhile, they will seek to de-emphasize their old
reputation for ``Big Government'' solutions to national problems,
including health care.
</P>
<P>
   Second, that Republicans will do everything they can to peg
Democrats as the party of ``Big Government,'' the faction that
tried to create a giant health care bureaucracy. Meanwhile, they
try to lose their label as the party of intolerance with a dramatic
overture to minorities, especially Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties, seeing the same polls, know that the one sure way
to lose the 2000 election is to appear to voters as ``Big
Brother,'' a specter feared as much in the bedroom as in the
pocketbook.

`VEGGIETALES' FILLS A SPIRITUAL VOID FOR ONE LAPSED PARENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I relate this story with the full knowledge that you, the loyal
reader, will not judge me, lest you be you-know-whated: I take an
unorthodox approach to teaching my child about specific religious
sects. Like, I don't.
</P>
<P>
   I'm all about giving her the 4-1-1 on the things with which she
should be down, such as math and manners and Cartoon Network. But
I'd rather she learn about theology from me, and then decide how
best to apply that knowledge when she makes up her own mind and
decides for herself that she wants to become a Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Kidding. Still, I've found that imparting broad concepts of
religious beliefs to a 4-year-old is a challenge. Before I know it,
the munchkin is confused with talk about sacraments and baptisms
and that many-armed elephant Apu is always breaking out on ``The
Simpsons.'' Unfortunately, you can't count on knowledge of this
sort being received at birth, like a child's understanding of
``happiness'' or ``chocolate.'' I tried that. When she was very
young, I asked my daughter if she knew who ``God'' was. She said,
``Uh ... Mama?''
</P>
<P>
   Close, but no deity. What have proved helpful are Big Idea
Productions' ``VeggieTales,'' the hit videos in which a tomato and
a cucumber discuss God's love for everyone, even Democrats.
Computer-animated vegetables (Bob the Tomato, voiced by Big Idea
president and founder Phil Vischer, Larry the Cucumber, and Junior
Asparagus and his family) hop about, tell Bible stories and sing
ditties. The titles (my daughter particularly liked ``Where's God
When I'm S-scared,'' $12.99) have sold more than 5.5 million copies
to date, and with good reason. They're entertaining for adults,
simple and repetitive enough for small children and they relay
heartfelt, honest Christian values.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes ``VeggieTales,'' at the very least, a good-for-you
alternative to Dexter and his pals at the Cartoon Network. .MDNM/

CRITICS NAME `SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' BEST PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing its dominance of year-end critics awards, Steven
Spielberg's World War II drama ``Saving Private Ryan'' was named
Best Picture in the ninth annual Dallas-Forth Worth Film Critics
Association awards.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg was named Best Director, and ``Ryan'' star Tom Hanks
was runner-up for Best Actor. ``Ryan,'' considered the front-runner
for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, also topped the New York
Film Critics Circle and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association
awards, announced late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ian McKellan was named Best Actor for his delicately witty
performance as retired movie director James Whale in ``Gods and
Monsters''; ``Gods'' director Bill Condon placed third in the Best
Director race. Cate Blanchett, who gave a dominating, anchoring
performance as Queen Elizabeth I in ``Elizabeth,'' was named Best
Actress. Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays Shakespeare's love interest in
``Shakespeare in Love,'' was runner-up in the Best Actress
category.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting awards went to Billy Bob Thornton, for his role as a
simple Midwesterner who finds all sorts of demons surfacing when
he, his brother and his best friend find a huge cache of money in
``A Simple Plan''; and to Brenda Blethyn, who plays the man-chasing
harridan mother of the lead character in ``Little Voice.''
``Voice's'' Jane Horrocks placed third in the Best Actress
category.
</P>
<P>
   The Metroplex critics association features two unique
categories: Most Underrated Film, and the Russell Smith Award,
named in honor of the late Dallas Morning News critic. ``Love and
Death on Long Island,'' a minor spring release featuring John Hurt
as an aging Brit who falls for a teen heartthrob played by Jason
Priestley, tied with ``Babe: Pig in the City'' for Most Underrated
Film. Hal Hartley's independent epic ``Henry Fool'' won the Russell
Smith Award, which goes to the best offbeat picture.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Benigni's Holocaust comedy-drama ``Life Is Beautiful''
was named Best Foreign Language Film; U.S. director John Sayles'
fable ``Men With Guns,'' with dialogue largely in Mexican and
Indian dialects, was runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association consists of 49
print and broadcast journalists covering motion pictures in the
Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.
</P>
<P>
   The association's Top 10 films: 1. ``Saving Private Ryan''; 2.
``Shakespeare in Love''; 3. ``Gods and Monsters''; 4. ``The Truman
Show''; 5. ``Life Is Beautiful''; 6. ``A Simple Plan''; 7. ``Henry
Fool''; 8. ``Beloved''; 9. ``Pleasantville''; 10. ``Waking Ned
Devine.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After David Puttnam shifted from movies to politics, he was an
advance man in Tony Blair's campaign to become Britain's prime
minister. On his way to Torquay for a meeting before the 1992
election, Puttnam was asked to stop at a small town en route to
make a speech. The talk was scheduled for 7 p.m. at a schoolhouse,
and the train to Torquay left at 7:30. To his chagrin, there was
only one person in the audience. Puttnam talked for 20 minutes and
said he would omit the question-and-answer period because he did
not want to miss his train. The man pleaded with him to stay,
finally explaining why he was so insistent. He said: ``I'm the next
speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Telling the story recently to a class of film students at
Columbia University, Puttnam characterized it simply as his
initiation into politics. One could, however, draw several
cinematic conclusions: know your audience, be able to adapt
yourself to changing circumstances and leave in plenty of time to
catch the next train out of town. All of these might have been
applicable to Puttnam's drastically curtailed reign as chairman and
chief executive officer of Columbia Pictures in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As a phenomenally successful independent producer of ``Local
Hero,'' ``Chariots of Fire,'' ``The Killing Fields'' and other
films, he was brought over from England to Hollywood in 1986 to run
a major studio, but after little more than a year, his contract was
terminated. He was not there long enough to make many films, but he
was there long enough to be blamed for movies released on his
watch, namely ``Ishtar,'' starring Warren Beatty and Dustin
Hoffman, and ``Leonard Part 6,'' Bill Cosby's personal production.
With more dignity than is generally the case in such circumstances,
Puttnam returned to England to make a few more movies and then to
move more actively into politics. At lunch before speaking to the
film class, he said he still had not seen ``Ishtar.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Movies and Money'' (Knopf, $27.50), the
producer, who is 57, spends little time on his studio days and
instead offers an anecdotal and corporate history of the movies,
with the emphasis on the relationship between films and business _
how that relationship has changed and how it has not changed
through the years. The book begins with some curious facts gathered
during the author's research.
</P>
<P>
   As Puttnam points out, Flagstaff, Ariz., not Hollywood, was
almost the center of moviemaking. In 1913, Jesse Lasky sent Cecil
B. DeMille on a scouting mission, thinking that Arizona might be a
place conducive to making movies. DeMille sent back a telegram:
``Flagstaff no good for our purpose. ... Want authority to rent
barn in place called Hollywood for $75 a month.'' The parsimonious
Lasky wired back: ``Authorize you to rent barn but on
month-to-month basis only. Don't make any long commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Puttnam wondered what it would have meant if DeMille had stayed
in Arizona. He suggested that movies might have been called
Flaggies. In his book he adds that Los Angeles theater owners did
not like the word movies and as late as 1914 threatened to boycott
its usage. As he views the industry, its emergence and growth were
partly a matter of accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``My underlying thesis,'' he said, ``is that American cinema
started out as a retail medium. The driving forces were almost
exclusively people who sold things, people who actually sat behind
nickelodeon box office windows and eyeballed their customers.'' As
a result, movies in the United States ``evolved from the
audience.'' In Europe, in contrast, movies started with inventors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've got are two fundamentally different imperatives.
The strength of the American industry is that it was based on a
core reality, the audience, the people that paid the money at the
box office. The weakness of the European industry was that it was
based on a core fantasy, which is that there was a group of artists
that could put together a rather expensive product and hope that
somewhere out there it might find an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at his brief reign in Flagstaff, er, Hollywood, he
said that he regarded it as ``a victimless crime.'' Columbia came
to him, he said, because ``they had tried every other form of
punishment, an ex-agent, Guy McElwaine, an ex-television producer,
Frank Price, so why not have a crack at a working producer?'' That
approach had been successful in the past, he said, when Darryl F.
Zanuck and others were heads of studios.
</P>
<P>
   When Puttnam was asked to take the job, he was, he said,
explicit about his approach: he wanted to bring something fresh and
original to the studio _ ``I even wrote it down'' _ and executives
at Coca-Cola, at the time the parent company of Columbia, seemed
agreeable. He remembered one who said, ``Make us proud.'' It was an
offer he couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he found that his pursuit of quality pictures was impeded
by the studio's need for product. He believed ``all the doomsday
scenarios,'' which said the studio would be in jeopardy if it did
not release 15 pictures a year. ``Suddenly you're saying yes to
something you know you should say no to.'' In retrospect, he would
have taken his time and ``only greenlighted pictures when they were
good and ready.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, he said, ``a hopeless mismatch'' to think, given his
background, that he could be ``pitched into that environment and
work in that ethos.'' Among the many things that puzzled him about
Hollywood was the constant switching of writers on a movie. Then he
realized that the problem was more that of the executives than of
the writers. ``The executives meet every week, and everyone is
quizzed about how his project is doing. The key is to show that
you're doing something. You can't have six weeks running and appear
before a peer group and say, `Oh, it's coming along nicely, thank
you,' or the truth, `Slow but steady progress.' They have to do
something, so they panic'' _ and they hire a new writer.
</P>
<P>
   After he left Hollywood, he made movies for HBO (``The Burning
Season'') and a few films (``Memphis Belle'' and ``My Life So
Far,'' his last film, scheduled for release in May) before turning
his attention to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Knighted by the Queen, he sits in the House of Lords and is
chairman of Britain's National Endowment for Science, Technology
and the Arts and is a member of an educational task force. He is
also part of a team working on the Millennium Dome in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on his diverse career, he said that one thing he
had not done was direct a movie. ``I am not intuitively creative,''
he said. As a producer, he was ``a facilitator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have very much liked to direct if I could have
convinced myself that I'd be any good at it,'' he said. ``I had
this horror that if I directed I would discover after three weeks
that I had to fire myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Columbia film class, Puttnam spoke about his reasons for
leaving the movies. ``I had a really good 30-year run,'' he said.
He vowed that he would never be ``a 60-year-old man with a slightly
dog-eared script under my arm looking for someone to give me one
last shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I envy you,'' he said to the students, ``as long as you don't
become fixated on being the next producer or director of `Titanic'
or the next hero of an underground film festival. It's a more
plural and more interesting business than that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever made a movie, be it 16-millimeter or video or
digital, without learning something,'' he said. ``The key is not to
be trapped in the career race where you're being evaluated because
of the size or scope or importance of what you happen to be making
that week.'' He advised the students to ask questions and be
productive: ``Did I learn something? Am I pleased with what I did?
And what am I going to do Monday?''

   NEW YORK _ Leopold Damrosch did it in 1882. Gustav Mahler did it
in 1910. Walter Damrosch did it in 1920, Arturo Toscanini in 1930
and Leonard Bernstein, Thomas Schippers and Seymour Lipkin in 1959.
And now it is Kurt Masur's turn.
</P>
<P>
   What they all did was take the New York Philharmonic on tour.
The 1882 journey, the orchestra's first tour, was to the Midwest.
The 1910 tour went to New England; those in 1920 and 1930 went to
Europe, the one in 1959 to the Soviet Union. Masur, the music
director, will be leading the Philharmonic on his first U.S. tour,
beginning Tuesday night in Palm Desert, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The tour then moves to Las Vegas, Costa Mesa, Calif., Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Boston, with works by Richard
Strauss, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich.

and ``Night and Day,'' was closed after a large chunk of marble
hurtled to the floor from a column under the roof early on
Saturday. The Italian superintendent for cultural and historical
affairs, Antonio Paolucci, said the sacristy, left incomplete by
Michelangelo in 1534 and holding the tombs of Medici princes, would
remain closed until experts could determine what caused the stone,
weighing several pounds, to fall.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Didn't get enough of New Year's celebrations? Life
does offer some second chances. For those who observe the Julian
calendar, used for centuries in Russia before Peter the Great put
his country on the same Gregorian page used by almost everybody
else, the New Year falls on Jan. 13, a festive occasion in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be observed at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday at Radio City
Music Hall here, where Russian pop entertainers will appear in a
three-hour concert called ``Today's Stars: Timeless Songs.''
Featuring Igor Nikolaev, Leonid Agutin and Christina Arbakait, the
event, with scenery, costumes and traditional songs, takes the Old
Russian New Year as its theme.

`GLAMORAMA': FASHION VICTIMS TAKE TERRORIST CHIC SERIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bret Easton Ellis doesn't need the National Lampoon to turn him
into a parody _ with ``Glamorama,'' he's done it himself.
</P>
<P>
   This glutinous hodgepodge of a book takes all the most glaring
flaws of Ellis' recent work _ compulsive name-dropping, an
obsession with designer clothing, a fascination with gratuitous,
gruesome violence and a cast of interchangeable fatuous people _
and tries to pass them off as a novel.
</P>
<P>
   The book's sloppily contrived plot concerns the adventures of an
MTA (model turned actor) and his encounters (or perceived
encounters) with a group of MTTs _ that is, a group of models
turned terrorists who wear Kevlar-lined Armani suits and blow up
hotels, subways and airplanes with bombs carefully packed in Prada
backpacks and Louis Vuitton tote bags.
</P>
<P>
   The result isn't the amusing satire that such a summary might
suggest. The result is a lugubrious, repetitious tale that crams
more celebrity names (Gwyneth Paltrow, Hugh Grant, Alicia
Silverstone, Bruce Willis, Oliver Stone, etc., etc.) and more
designer labels (Prada, Armani, Calvin Klein, etc., etc.) between
two covers than any book in recent memory, with the possible
exception of Andy Warhol's ``Diaries'' _ a work, unlike
``Glamorama,'' that at least had the lure of real gossip to engage
the reader's interest.
</P>
<P>
   The sociological observation that animated Ellis' first novel,
``Less Than Zero'' (1985), has given way in these pages to mindless
W-like recitations of guest lists and celebrity sightings, gussied
up with some heavy-metal horror and pages and pages of crashingly
awful dialogue that would make Judith Krantz cringe.
</P>
<P>
   People in ``Glamorama'' say things like ``You know I put the
stud back in star-studded'' and ``Take your passion and make it
happen.'' They talk about ``power florists'' and
``spokesmannequins,'' and they boast about knowing people who
signed suicide notes with smiley faces. The most important things
in the world to them are designer clothes, good tans, great abs
(men), toned arms (women) and glossy photos of themselves in trendy
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this world of jaded narcissists will be familiar to
readers of Ellis' earlier work. In fact several of the characters
in this novel are slightly older versions of people who appeared in
Ellis' 1987 college novel ``The Rules of Attraction.'' They've left
Camden College, migrated to New York and become part of the club
scene.
</P>
<P>
   These characters and their friends spend their free time
primping at the gym and hair salon, ingesting large quantities of
controlled substances (Xanax seems to be their drug of choice) and
having sex with anyone who meets their exacting standards of
physical perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Victor, the narrator of ``Glamorama,'' is supposedly the ``It
Boy of the moment'' _ a ``hip, happening, gorgeous young thing''
who, in addition to modeling and acting, is helping his boss,
Damien, open a new club in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Victor is not only dating Chloe, a supermodel supposedly as
super as Kate Moss or Cindy Crawford, but he's also carrying on
with Alison, Damien's fiancee, and Lauren, Damien's girlfriend.
Needless to say, all these liaisons get Victor into trouble, and
when a mysterious man named Palakon offers him $300,000 to go to
Europe and find a former Camden classmate named Jamie Fields, he
readily agrees.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Victor meets a lot of celebrities, and he also meets
a famous model named Bobby Hughes who runs a terrorist cell made up
of high-profile models recruited for their ability to stand around
and take directions.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby's gang, which now includes Victor, blows up a political
studies center in Paris, a Parisian cafe, an underground train, the
Ritz Hotel and a 747 flight to New York, in the process killing and
maiming scores of people. They also torture several friends to
death and murder one of Victor's girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis uses these incidents to indulge his grisly taste for death
and mutilation. In pages reminiscent of Ellis' willfully perverse
novel ``American Psycho'' (1990), the reader is subjected to
detailed, even rhapsodic descriptions of people losing limbs and
other body parts and dying in pain and humiliation. One character
is strangled with her own intestines, another blown apart limb by
limb.
</P>
<P>
   These scenes, Ellis suggests, may or may not be part of a movie
starring Victor. It's also possible that they are scenes in a
real-life snuff film, or, given Victor's fondness for chemicals,
hallucinations in his drug-addled brain.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this interminable novel, the reader is too numb,
too bored to really care about such distinctions. Nor does one care
about the flimsy morals Ellis tries to attach to his story: that
the selfish, image-obsessed world inhabited by Victor and his
friends can easily mutate into a world in which people are treated
as disposable objects, that reality in a world based on appearances
is elusive, that narcissism is akin to nihilism and nihilism to
murder.
</P>
<P>
   In the world he's chosen to live in, Victor says toward the end
of the novel, ``people were discarded because they were too old or
too fat or too poor or they had too much hair or not enough, they
were wrinkled, they had no muscles, no definition, no tone, they
weren't hip, they weren't remotely famous.''
</P>
<P>
   It's awfully hard to make the leap Ellis wants us to make from
the world of beautiful narcissists to the world of coldblooded
killers: There are, after all, differences between models, however
self-absorbed, and bloodthirsty serial killers; there are
differences between fashion-obsessed hipsters and Hitler, whom
Ellis has the nerve to quote in an epigraph to this novel. (``You
make a mistake if you see what we do as merely political.'')
</P>
<P>
   It is equally hard to understand why Ellis wants to spend so
much time (in this novel and every other book he's written)
chronicling a world he seems to recognize as shallow, mercenary,
cynical and meaningless _ a world he glamorizes as much he debunks
it. This time around, it results in characters whom the reader and
Ellis have nothing but contempt for, and a novel, as Victor might
say, that ``equals yuck.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the country will be dry and it will not be quite as cold
in the middle of the nation. Jet stream winds from the northwest
will dominate preventing any significant moisture moving northward
from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Frosts and freezes will greet the northern half of Florida with
readings in the northern counties below 20 degrees at daybreak.
High pressure centered over Georgia will circulate chilly air into
southern Florida, but clouds and onshore breezes along with
scattered light showers will keep readings closer to seasonal
levels.
</P>
<P>
   A ridge of high pressure extending northward along the Atlantic
Seaboard will sponsor bright but cold weather into eastern New
England. Over the Appalachians, clouds and flurries are expected in
northern sections with ample sun farther south. Shifting winds over
Lakes Erie and Ontario will cause the snow squalls to move to the
favored regions just north of Syracuse and south of Buffalo, where
up to 12 inches of snow will fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clockwise winds around high pressure over the Southeast will
draw milder air from the southern Plains toward the Mississippi
Valley. Clouds will increase from the eastern Plains to the Great
Lakes. The boundary between retreating Arctic air and a milder
Pacific air mass over the western Plains will be the focus of snow
showers and flurries.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure over Nevada will produce dry and mainly mild
conditions in the West. A stream of moisture from the central
Pacific will reach the Northwest with thickening clouds. Fog will
persist in the Central Valley of California.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Perihelion &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, the earth reached perihelion, its closest
approach to the sun during the year. In the current era, perihelion
occurs in the northern hemisphere winter, contributing to a
reduction in annual temperature extremes. Aphelion, the point where
the sun and earth are farthest apart occurs in summer, helping to
moderate the heat of the warm season. However, the earth's orbital
parameters are slowly changing, so that in 11,000 years, perihelion
will occur in summer and aphelion in winter. This will accentuate
seasonal cycles, tending to make summers hotter and winters
colder. &QL;

JOSE VILLARREAL NAMED TREASURER OF GORE'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jose Villarreal, the San Antonio lawyer serving as
treasurer of Vice President Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign,
said Monday that he will work to make sure the Gore campaign's fund
raising complies with the ``letter and spirit'' of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Villarreal, a partner in the San Antonio office of Akin, Gump,
Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, began his part-time duties as Gore's
campaign treasurer on Jan. 1. He said he will ``assemble the
resources necessary to wage this campaign and do so in an
expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Villarreal said he will supervise Gore's fund raising ``in a
manner that fully complies with both the letter and spirit of the
law,'' adding: ``We'll make certain to do that. As treasurer, I'll
do everything within my power to insure that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's fund raising in the 1996 re-election campaign of
President Clinton came under scrutiny of Congress and the Justice
Department. Attorney General Janet Reno later cleared Gore of any
wrong doing.
</P>
<P>
   Villarreal, a graduate of Purdue University and the Indiana
University school of law, served as deputy campaign manager for the
1988 Democratic presidential campaign of former Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis and as deputy campaign manger for the 1992
Democratic presidential campaign of then-Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as associate director of Clinton's White House
office of presidential personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Serving as treasurer is a ``new area of responsibility for me,''
Villarreal said in an interview Monday. ``I have never been
involved in this capacity before. It's new.''
</P>
<P>
   Villarreal will be legally responsible for the Gore campaign's
filings with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Villarreal said he wanted to work for Gore's election as
president because Gore has worked in concert with Clinton to lead
``one of the greatest peacetime economies'' in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Smith, the former White House political director who now
heads Gore's presidential campaign, said Villarreal was chosen for
the assignment as treasurer because he has extensive experience in
national politics, ``he's well respected nationally and he's a big
political player in Texas and the country as a whole.''

PATAKI'S FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN DESPITE VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Before November's election, when George Pataki
seemed likely to sweep over New York City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone like that towering tidal wave in ``Deep Impact'' swept over
Manhattan, I was talking to one of the governor's aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he wins reelection,'' I predicted, ``you guys are going
to be unspeakably arrogant. You're already pushing the envelope
now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sure,` he told me. ``The minute we win, you guys in the
press will start referring to this as a lame duck administration.
That'll keep us humble enough.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Pataki won respectably enough, with 54 per
cent of the vote in a 5-3 Democratic state. No tidal wave, though.
No thundering landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Pataki had no coattails. Attorney General Dennis Vacco
went down on election day _ tightly, but down nonetheless. Former
Sen. Al D'Amato lost by a surprisingly hefty margin to Chuck
Schumer. And the Democrats did remarkably well in legislative
elections, especially considering how vigorously the Republicans
had batted them around all year on issues.
</P>
<P>
   Also, this has from the very beginning been an administration
blissfully indifferent to anything the press reports. Its policy
has been to view the press openly as an enemy, to keep the press at
arm's length and to get out the administration's message through an
arsenal of glittering broadcast ads that presents the public not
with news but with spin.
</P>
<P>
   And, hey, they must be right. They won, didn't they?
</P>
<P>
   So, on Friday, George Pataki took office for his second term not
as a lame duck _ New York governors aren't restricted by term
limits _ but as a man longing for national office whose chances for
a place on the presidential ticket seem slimmer than they might
have been before Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, the Democratic Party's strategy for
winning presidential elections has been to cede the south and west
to the Republicans and to concentrate instead on pulling electoral
votes from one or two midwestern industrial states, the Northeast
and from California.
</P>
<P>
   That means that if Texas Gov. George W. Bush ends up as the
Republican Party's presidential nominee in a year and a half, and
he's the current favorite, he's more likely to select a Californian
for regional balance on his ticket than a pro-choice, ethnic,
northeastern moderate whose most recent electoral performance would
seem unlikely to bring the Empire State into the GOP fold next
year.
</P>
<P>
   And if Bush were to look to the Northeast for a running mate, he
would seem far likelier to cast his eye on Pennsylvania Gov. Tom
Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Pataki, fellow moderate Ridge has a war record that could
make him palatable to the party's far right out in the hinterlands.
And, unlike Pataki, Ridge probably could actually deliver his state
to the Republicans. Pennsylvania has only two-thirds of New York's
electoral votes, but two-thirds of something is better than
three-thirds of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   There also exists the possibility that whoever ends up as the
GOP presidential candidate in 2000 will go for gender rather than
geography and select Elizabeth Dole as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   So, it seems likely now that George Pataki, whatever his
national ambitions, probably won't be a player in the next
presidential race. Instead, he'll have to content himself with
wrestling with Democratic Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, with an
increasingly independent senate majority leader, Republican Joe
Bruno, and with ducking an Albany press corps that his
administration views with deep, dark suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless he decides to run for Daniel Patrick Moynihan's
U.S. Senate seat next year, which would disrupt the plans of a good
many other people and could provide the electorate with some
fetching entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, it's time for the business of governing in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the blessed silence between elections.

FIT FOR YOUR FEET
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color graphic, available by e-mail, on what to look for in
a running shoe. Call 212-499-3342. 
 By BEN STEELMAN 
 c.1999 New York Times Regional Newspapers 
 American rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why does every other shop in the mall these days sell athletic
shoes?
</P>
<P>
   And why do half those shoes cost almost as much as a compact
car?
</P>
<P>
   It may be impossible to say, yet it's easier to answer these
questions: Do you have to spend $150 on your feet? How much of that
cost is fashion, and how much is fitness?
</P>
<P>
   Quality does come at a price, experts advise. If you try to work
out seriously with a pair of cheap imports, you might regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of weekend athletes apparently agree. According to the
National Sports Goods Association, nearly $8 billion is spent each
year in the United States on athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you don't have to sell your soul to get the shoes you
need.
</P>
<P>
   For example, David K. Miller, co-author of ``Fitness: A Lifetime
Commitment'' (Allyn and Bacon, 1995), never pays more than $100 for
running shoes _ and he runs between 25 and 50 miles per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most expensive shoe is not always the best shoe,'' said
Miller. By watching for sales, he often finds the shoes he likes
for $50 to $60 per pair.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sprecher, head coach for cross-country and track at the
University of North Carolina at Wilmington, generally spends $40 to
$60 per pair on his athletes' shoes. ``It's the most important
piece of equipment an athlete can have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with expensive shoes, Sprecher added, is that owners
might be tempted to hold onto them too long. Like tires, shoes wear
down after time; the feet lose cushioning and support. Since a
runner's stride hits the surface with a power of 2 1/2 to 3 times
his or her body weight, those feet need a lot of cushioning.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, according to Dr. Michael D. Carter, a sports
medicine specialist in Wilmington, N.C., is that shoes still look
good long after they're effectively worn out.
</P>
<P>
   For those who exercise regularly, then, it's a good idea to buy
modestly priced shoes and replace them regularly, Sprecher said.
For his distance runners, a typical pair might last about 500
miles: ``After that, they'll start to feel a difference,'' he said
_ and that difference might be felt as aches or pains in the knees.
</P>
<P>
   If you work out in a particular sport for three or four hours or
more a week, you probably need athletic shoes, said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, you need a pair designed specifically for your
event.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mistake, for instance, to use running shoes if you play a
lot of basketball or tennis.
</P>
<P>
   A runner's shoes are designed for continuous forward motion, not
the frequent side-to-side moves under a net or on the court.
Specifically, they're built with a slight incline in the sole;
dodge too fast after a ball, and you could twist an ankle, Carter
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most footwear chains have moved beyond the days
when ill-trained clerks would push you to buy the top of the line,
said Miller. At ``name-brand'' stores, at least, chances are the
staff will include at least one specialist knowledgeable enough to
help you find what you really need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't buy shoes in the morning,'' Carter said. Your feet
expand gradually during the day, especially after a run or workout,
so it's best to shop after work or after exercising.
</P>
<P>
   And don't expect athletic shoes to ``break in.'' They should fit
well immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers these
suggestions for buying athletic shoes:
</P>
<P>
   When trying on a pair, wear the same type of sock you will wear
for that sport, not your dress socks or hose.
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to wiggle all your toes freely. With running
shoes, there ought to be about a thumbnail's space between the big
toe and the toe of the shoe, according to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Walk or run a few steps in the new pair to make sure they're
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Always relace the shoes before trying them on, making sure you
have even pressure from the bottom to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the grip of your sole is firm. Your heel should not
slip as you walk or run.
</P>
<P>
   The most important factor in shopping for a running shoe, Miller
and Sprecher agreed, is adequate support, particularly for the
mid-sole area.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers will tout ``air'' soles or capsules or gel-based
cushioning, but whatever the material, what's important is whether
the cushioning works.
</P>
<P>
   Cushions generally come in two layers between the sole and foot.
The top cushion should normally be three times the thickness of the
bottom cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Canvas tops are generally not very supportive and may stretch.
Leather is strong but may not allow the feet to ``breathe''
adequately. Thus, the best top material is often nylon or a
nylon-leather combination.
</P>
<P>
   Training shoes will generally be heavier, with thicker soles and
higher heels, than shoes made for competition.
</P>
<P>
   Walking shoes should have a firm heel, good shock absorption, a
smooth tread, and a rocker sole that encourages the natural roll of
the foot.
</P>
<P>
   For longer walks on rough terrain, consider water-resistant
hiking boots. Good boots will have a firm heel, a flexible
forepart, heavily lugged soles for traction, padding around the
ankles and a high, wide toe box.
</P>
<P>
   Court sports _ tennis, basketball and volleyball _ require shoes
that are light and built to take heavy abuse. The key to these
shoes is in the sole, which should be designed specifically for the
sport you'll be playing. For example, serve-and-volley tennis
players may need extra cushioning on the balls of their feet, while
baseline players may need reinforcement on the heels and midfoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hightops'' can provide extra support for the ankles but should
not restrict ankle motion.
</P>
<P>
   For court players, a coach or physician can offer advice on
which sole style will be best.
</P>
<P>
   Aerobic dancers need shoes that are a cross between the
shock-absorbent running shoe and the court shoe with lateral
support. Flexibility in the forepart is especially important.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance or marathon runners _ those who can cover 80 miles
or more in a typical week _ will likely require more specialized,
more reinforced and more expensive shoes than a typical jogger.
</P>
<P>
   Within these guidelines, Miller warned, each individual foot is
different. One runner's perfect fit might not work with another.
Consumers should pay particular attention to pronation, the natural
inward roll of the foot on each step, which can vary considerably
from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   Where one walks or runs might also affect decisions, Miller
added. The ideal surface would be a level dirt road or field, with
plenty of ``give.'' Paved sidewalks or roadways might require more
cushioning. A sandy beach, on the other hand, might have too much
``give,'' which could lead to a painful stretching of the Achilles'
tendons.

<TEXT>
<P>
   We are 80 miles south of Fort Lauderdale, plodding through
mid-May heat down an abandoned road walled in by a green bramble of
hardwood hammock.
</P>
<P>
   Officially this is the Key Largo Hammock State Botanical Site,
but if you didn't know where to stop along Florida Interstate 905-A
you'd never find this spot. But just the day before in this very
thicket, local birders sighted a La Sagra's flycatcher, a pip of a
bird that's common in the Bahamas but extremely rare in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   We move in a hushed, collective clot, following Jan Pierson. An
affable New Englander with an easy manner, Pierson is a birder of
global experience, first on his own, then as a guide for Austin,
Texas-based Field Guides, the acclaimed bird touring company he
helped found in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson's hands are cupped around his ears and he is peering
into the dense foliage. One of us has a tape recording of the La
Sagra's call. He plays it at intervals, and Pierson listens
intently for the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``There it is!'' Pierson's voice is low and fast. ``Down low.
Halfway up the tree. There! He's hopped to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierson sets up a tripod and scope and we each get our chance to
view the flycatcher, a swatch of brown feathers, nonchalantly
ruffling a white breast with a tiny beak.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the van, Pierson says there might be only one or two La
Sagra's sightings a year in South Florida, which is one to two more
sightings than any place else in North America. ``Could there be
others in there?' someone asks. Pierson eyes the wall of foliage
unreeling beside us at 50 mph. ``There could be 50 La Sagra's
flycatchers in there,'' he smiles. ``You just never know what bird
is going to show up where.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up the fun of birding.
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't know much about birders, often portrayed as
binocular-toting obsessives who wear funny hats and dash madly
about saying things like, ``What luck! A pair of mangrove
cuckoos!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, many birders do wear funny hats, but only because most of
them have been around long enough to realize the ramifications of
skin cancer. It's also true that many birders keep lists of the
birds they've seen, and some of them are ardent about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``World lists, North American lists, country lists, county
lists, backyard lists,'' said David Pomerantz, a straightforward
New Yorker who was part of our group. ``I read about a birder who
kept a list of birds who landed on his hat.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most birders lists are merely an excuse to get outside,
to travel, to share discoveries with like-minded people and simply
take a keen look at the world around them. Birders notice things
the rest of us don't. Back at the Key Largo site, Pemerantz had
pointed to the low branch of a tree and said to me, ``Look here.''
I saw nothing, then I looked harder and there it was: a tree snail
no bigger than my fingernail, its lovely ivory-white shell wound
with intricate yellow rings.
</P>
<P>
   We rumbled out of Key West harbor the following morning in
starry darkness. By burnt-orange dawn, everybody had scrambled up
to the top deck of the 63-foot Tiburon, our rolling home for the
next three days. Binoculars at the ready, they scanned the skyline.
The Dry Tortugas are 70 miles from Key West. We would be at sea for
nearly six hours. No one wanted to miss anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Tortugas are seven tiny islands, some barely poking above
high tide, that form a fragile circle of coral and sand in the vast
blue of the Gulf of Mexico. In the spring they are the first fleck
of land that northward migrating birds encounter after a long,
open-ocean haul.
</P>
<P>
   Some birds don't make it. Four hours out of Key West, Pierson
had the Tiburon's captain swing over to a tower marking a shoal.
Light green water languidly rose and fell from the tower's legs. A
dozen birds clustered on a guano-stained platform. Among the
seabirds -- brown boobies and frigatebirds -- was a lone cattle
egret waiting stoically to die.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiburon bobbed softly under the piercing sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they put down, they don't usually get up,'' said Pierson
quietly. ``This is the last stop for that cattle egret. He's
migrating and he blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be plenty of dying birds on the Tortugas too,
bedraggled things perched beneath a ceiling of sky into which they
would never again lift off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some birders like birds because they give the idea of
freedom,'' observed one of our group, Everett Knapp, a Midwesterner
with 30 years of birding experience. ``Sort of an elusive idea,
though, because they're not really free.''
</P>
<P>
   A few nights before, a storm front had lashed rain across this
part of the gulf. The storm raised the possibility of a ``fallout''
of birds searching for cover on Garden Key, which lay between us
and the Tortugas. We arrived on the key in mid-afternoon and gave
the white sand beaches nary a glimpse but made a beeline for the
entrance to the ruined fort which dominates the island, crossing
its moat a dim archway to the open-air sward at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Here we found a birder's heaven: Birds were sheltering here in
droves, lighting up the crumbling brick walls like ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was pointing and sucking in their breath. Binoculars
swung this way and that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a redstart!'' said Pierson. ``Winters in the West
Indies. Look at that! That's a primo bird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a male scarlet tanager!'' exclaimed someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's three male blackpoll warblers fresh from South
America,'' said Pierson. ``Look up! There comes a purple martin!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a cuckoo! Yellow-billed!'' said Pomerantz.
</P>
<P>
   ``A male Cape May warbler!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indigo bunting!''
</P>
<P>
   For over an hour everyone moved about the sward, training
binoculars and scopes into the trees in a sort of euphoric haze.
They peered resolutely into the sky, but no one seemed to notice
the massing black clouds. Thunder rolled. The palm fronds went
still. Gnats lighted on my knuckles. The air went cool, cooler,
cooler, then fat raindrops began to plock down and everyone
returned to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the Tiburon, we gathered in the galley. Through the
windows sheets of rain ran in ribbons across the water toward ghost
sailboats. In the galley there was a drained hush.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, birding is like gold mining,'' drawled John
Huckabee, a lifelong birder from Texas. ``You look, look, look ,
and then you hit something like this and it keeps you coming
back.''

BE A SUCCESS AND LEAVE AT 5
</HEADLINE>
  By BETTY HOLCOMB 
 c.1999 Working Mother 
 North American rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a managing director at Merrill Lynch, Susan Scherbel knows
she has it good. She works full time, but no one clocks her hours;
in fact, no one even monitors where and when she gets her work
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my first child was born eight years ago, I've pretty
much worked out of my home, getting the job done as I needed to or
wanted to or could,'' she says. In that time, she's had two more
kids and been promoted. She now shows up in the office only when
it's absolutely essential.
</P>
<P>
   How did she cut such a good deal? With her background as an
attorney with a wide-ranging knowledge of both corporate taxes and
the tax aspects of employee benefit plans, she brings an expertise
to many deals that virtually no one else on Wall Street has. ``I'd
like to think that I'd have this arrangement no matter what, but I
wouldn't bet the mortgage on that. The truth is the more
indispensable you are, the more you can distinguish yourself, and
the more likely it is that you can gain some flexibility and still
move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   That's excellent advice, according to consultants and academics
who advise companies on flexible work arrangements. Though some
companies have begun to create new ways to work, most still measure
employees the old-fashioned way, by the clock. ``Many managers
still think if they can see your face, you're productive,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, vice president at Catalyst, a New York City
think tank dedicated to advancing women in the workplace. ``That's
not true, of course. Just being there doesn't mean someone is
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Kropf and other consultants have learned over the years,
it takes a big effort to move managers out of this old mind-set. So
what's a parent to do?
</P>
<P>
   As Scherbel's experience shows, even in the most demanding,
time-intensive careers, there are strategies for achieving success
when you work flexible hours or must leave promptly each day. We
surveyed readers and talked to the experts to come up with tactics
for not only surviving, but thriving if you work with
clock-watchers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make yourself indispensable. As Scherbel found, companies will
go the extra mile for you if you have an important skill that no
one else has. Toni Thompson, an occupational therapist and mother
of two from Lutz, Fla., accomplishes the same thing in another way.
``I take on projects that no one else wants to do. I am developing
a reputation as the one you can count on,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many moms say that they volunteer for special
committees, especially those that mean working with other
departments. That initiative keeps you visible, buffering you from
the misconception that you're not pulling your weight because you
leave at 5 or work flextime. ``People look to you when new projects
come down the pike,'' says one mother who works in the marketing
department of a major corporation. ``Pretty soon, they see you as
someone they really need.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Showcase your productivity. Of course, it won't help to have a
talent or an expertise unless you make people aware of it. ``I
never really used to strut my stuff,'' says Thompson. ``Now I make
a point to talk up the committees I'm on and the projects I'm
doing.'' Not only that, but Thompson is also quick to praise her
co-workers' contributions as well. ``I highlight other people's
work, and that way, I show that I am contributing and also a team
player who appreciates other people's productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose the right priorities. Productivity only counts when
you're doing the right stuff, of course. Spending hours on tasks
that don't move the firm's main agenda forward is a waste of time.
If the company's goal is to create a top-of-the-line digital camera
or to make milk the most exciting drink in the grocery store, then
that should be your priority as well, in big ways and small.
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't sure what your boss's priorities are, find out.
``It's critically important to sit down with your manager and have
clear objectives,'' says Joy Bunson, senior vice president of
organizational development at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York
City. ``Once you can focus on outcome, face time is less
important.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, having the right priorities means adapting to your
supervisor's habits and personality quirks. ``My boss is a morning
person,'' says one mom. So she does her best to make sure she's on
time in the morning. ``If I stay after 5 because I came in a bit
late, it doesn't matter to him. It's more important that I am here
on time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the focus on work. Make sure that everyone knows you're
committed to working hard during office hours. Many moms note that
they don't waste time socializing during office hours; many skip
lunch to make the most of their time. ``I let my co-workers know
that I do have deadlines,'' says Tanya Mahoney, a fund raiser for
the Dallas chapter of the American Red Cross. ``If there is a
project looming, I let them know that I am not to be bothered, that
my immediate project is the task of the day.'' With that kind of
clear-cut dedication to getting the job done, co-workers are less
likely to question your commitment or productivity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speak up when you have a problem. If you have a conflict that
makes it impossible to arrive on time or forces you to leave a
little early, talk to your supervisor. Otherwise, you're likely to
be seen as someone who doesn't care about your work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have an open conversation with your boss,''
says Kropf. Frame the issue professionally, showing that your goal
is to be more productive. ``You might say, 'I know the standard
schedule is to be here at 8:30, not 9, but that isn't working for
me. I don't want you to think I'm late because I don't care. I want
to be a good performer, and I'm hoping that we can come up with a
mutually agreeable solution.'''
</P>
<P>
   You can then suggest options, such as skipping lunch or staying
a little later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take advantage of technology. If you leave at 5, that doesn't
mean you can't still be in touch with co-workers and your boss. Use
a cell phone, voicemail, e-mail, whatever it takes to stay on top
of business that must be done after you leave the office. ``I use
my cell phone to attend meetings after 5 p.m. or before 9 a.m.,''
says one mother. That way, her boss and co-workers don't think of
her as ``leaving early''; instead, they see that she makes every
effort to be a team player.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Scherbel is evidence that a change is already under way.
``When I first started working at home, I tried to keep the
arrangement quiet,'' she says. But now she's extremely comfortable
with it, especially since Merrill Lynch has touted the arrangement
in company newsletters and to the media. Her schedule is now
considered a model, a harbinger of the future. ``I hope that's
true,'' Scherbel says, ``because it seems to be a win-win for
everybody.''

HOW TO HELP A FORGETFUL CHILD 
 BY MARGERY D. ROSEN
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Matthew has always been a sunny, curious child, but in the
past few months he's been so forgetful that my husband and I are
worried,'' says Peggy Simon of Muncie, Ind., who is four months
pregnant with her third child.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy will ask 6-year-old Matthew, her oldest, to do the
simplest thing -- clear his dishes off the table or dump his dirty
socks in the hamper -- and he can't remember to do it. ``This
morning, I asked if he could please bring me the telephone book.
When I went looking for him 15 minutes later, I found him under the
hall table watching a ladybug crawl up the wallpaper. He'd
forgotten all about the phone book.''
</P>
<P>
   During his last school conference, Matt's teacher suggested that
Matt be tested for attention deficit disorder (ADD), since his mind
wanders in class and he rarely hands in a finished homework
assignment. ``Neither she nor I thinks he has ADD, but there are
lots of unanswered questions,'' Peggy continues. ``She'll give the
kids a math packet to complete, but Matt will bring home only the
first page. Or he'll leave his notebook in his cubby so he can't
copy the spelling words.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping track of his possessions is another problem. ``So far
he's lost two baseball caps, a new pair of soccer shin guards, and,
believe it or not, his backpack,'' Peggy reports. ``When we ask him
where something is, he has no clue that he's even lost the item! Or
he'll cry. I can tell he feels bad about disappointing us.''
</P>
<P>
   A few times Matt has even mumbled that he was stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy wouldn't be so frustrated if Matt's absent-mindedness were
an infrequent thing. ``But after a while, you lose your patience.
I've run out of ways to help him,'' she confesses.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy's a believer in time-outs, but they have had no impact on
Matt's forgetfulness. Neither has the system of rewards she
instituted: ``We made a chart of the things he typically forgets to
do, and I offered a sticker for each task he did without a
reminder,'' she recalls. ``After a week he could trade in the
stickers for a toy. But it didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt's father, Mark, who manages a paint supply business, thinks
Peggy is too lenient. ``He's old enough to keep track of things,''
insists Mark. ``If we didn't let him get away with so much -- Peggy
runs out to buy whatever he loses -- he'd come around. Sometimes I
think he's purposely being defiant.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peggy believes her husband is much too harsh. ``Mark's idea
of solving the problem is to yell and say, 'Shut up!' when Matt
tries to explain himself,'' she protests. As a result, Peggy is
increasingly worried. ``I can't help wondering if Matt's just not
as bright as we thought he was,'' she says. ``Isn't he old enough
to recall simple thing, the first time we ask him?''
</P>
<P>
   The Simons consulted Theresa A. Kruczek, an assistant professor
of counseling psychology at Ball State University in Muncie.
Kruczek's analysis:
</P>
<P>
   A child's forgetfulness, though exasperating, is a normal
behavior that peaks and ebbs throughout childhood. And most parents
react to their offspring's absent- mindedness like the Simons did.
They can't comprehend how a child who, for instance, understands
the computer so well can never remember anything they ask him to
do.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that forgetfulness is usually a behavioral
problem. And that means it can be corrected. But first you have to
figure out what's triggering the absent-mindedness. The Simons'
family history revealed several factors that, taken together, were
contributing to Matthew's frustrating forgetfulness.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Peggy and Mark reported that the problem really
started only when their son entered first grade. I told them I
doubted that ADD was a factor, since children with ADD often
display signs of irritability, lack of concentration and a high
degree of distractibility from infancy. (Psychological tests had
also ruled out any other learning problems.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, first-graders are often forgetful. The curriculum
is more demanding and the school day is more structured than it is
in kindergarten. First-graders have to recall loads of information:
the names of their new teachers and friends, school routines, even
the location of the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew has a lot going on in his bead,'' I pointed out, ``and
it can be hard to keep it all straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgetfulness can be unwittingly exacerbated by high parental
expectations. Yes, kids at the age of 6 can do much more than they
used to. But they are, after all, still little. And although
parents want their children to take on increased responsibility,
many never take the time to teach them how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Matthew to draw a picture of his family, another
critical piece of the puzzle fell into place. Matthew drew a house
with his parents, his sister and the dog inside -- and he was
outside. When I asked him to tell me about his picture, he said he
felt like he was on the outside a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy and Mark were initially surprised when they learned this,
but they soon conceded that, with a new business getting off the
ground and a third child on the way, perhaps they weren't spending
as much time with Matthew as they had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this, the Simons set aside 30 minutes each day for
one of them to spend alone with Matt, doing whatever he wanted.
Mark also acknowledged that raising his voice and insulting his son
weren't helpful, and he vowed to keep his temper in check.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew knew he was forgetful and was comfortable talking about
it. Together we discussed a plan: Since be was a computer nut, I
suggested that he type into the computer a list of Rules for
Remembering:
</P>
<P>
   1. Ask myself, What am I supposed to do right now?
</P>
<P>
   2. Figure out how to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pick a way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   4. Just do it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when his mother makes a request or he starts to do his
chores, Matt recites the list like a mantra. This helps him to
concentrate so he's less likely to forget important things.
</P>
<P>
   I also enlisted Matt's teacher to help him stay focused. She
wrote down each day's homework assignment on an index card, which
he gave to his mother as soon as he got home. Peggy now knows
exactly what Matt has to do each night and can gently prompt him.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, homework had been a haphazard affair, so the next
step was to set aside a specific time for Matt to study. The Simons
chose 7 p.m. as the starting time. I suggested they allow Matt to
choose where he wanted to work and that either Peggy or Mark stay
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Within two months, not only did Matt seem much happier but his
track record for remembering had improved greatly. ``He is so much
more responsible now, we get less upset with the occasional memory
lapse,'' says Peggy. ``After all, he's only 6!''

PROFIT MOTIVE CUTTING JET FLIGHTS IN CARIBBEAN SKIES
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 10.) 
 (ms) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When American Airlines announced a year ago that it would soon
end jet service between San Juan, P.R., and five Caribbean islands,
routes on which it said it was losing millions of dollars,
officials on those five islands decried the decision as a blow to
their tourist industries. Even American's plan to replace the jets
with much smaller, turboprop planes operated by American Eagle,
American's commuter carrier, did little to mollify them for what
they regarded as an insult.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The islands that lost jet service from San Juan on American are
Antigua, Barbados, Grenada, St. Croix and St. Lucia, while jet
service between San Juan and Aruba was cut to one flight a day from
two. But Antigua, Grenada and St. Lucia were so eager to maintain
jet service that each island agreed to pay American a subsidy, said
to be $1.5 million a year. In exchange, American provides daily
nonstop jet service between Miami and all three islands, and
American Eagle provides three daily turboprop nonstops between San
Juan and Antigua and San Juan and St. Lucia.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did in San Juan was restructure,'' said Al Becker, an
American spokesman. ``We basically decided to operate fewer jets
from there to the Caribbean, but we're continuing to operate jets
between the mainland and San Juan.'' On Jan. 31, for example, a
month into the Caribbean's peak tourist season, American will add a
sixth daily nonstop between Kennedy International Airport and San
Juan and a fourth between Chicago and San Juan. Altogether,
American, the dominant carrier to and in the Caribbean, has about
45 daily jet flights to San Juan, all but a few of them from the
mainland.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines are also adding Caribbean flights or have
recently done so, including Trans World Airlines, which is making a
push to pick up some of American's slack and carve out a presence
of its own. It recently began daily service between Kennedy and
Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic and seasonal daily service
between Kennedy and St. Maarten. On Feb. 3 it will begin daily
service between Boston and San Juan, and on Feb. 11 daily service,
except Wednesday, between Kennedy Airport and Nassau. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines, which has four daily flights between
Newark and San Juan, recently added a daily nonstop between Houston
and San Juan and a weekly nonstop between Cleveland and San Juan.
Kiwi International, which serves San Juan and Aguadilla (in western
Puerto Rico) from Newark, Orlando and Miami, will begin
twice-weekly nonstop flights between Kennedy Airport and Aguadilla
on Jan. 12.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Caribbean airlines are adding flights to the
mainland. Last month Air Aruba, which already flew between Newark
and Aruba, added a four-times-a-week Baltimore-Philadelphia-Aruba
flight. Also last month, Aeromar Airlines began daily service
between Miami and Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, while
Queen Air began daily nonstops between Kennedy and Santo Domingo.
Both carriers are headquartered in Santo Domingo and fly widebody
airplanes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although a Puerto Rican carrier, Sun Airways, began daily
service from San Juan to Fort Lauderdale and Orlando in
mid-December, within a week it had canceled a number of flights and
was considering cutting back to two flights a week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad's 58-year-old British West Indies Airline continues to
fly daily jets between the Caribbean and Miami and New York, while
Air Jamaica flies to those cities as well as to Chicago and Los
Angeles. Meanwhile, several other Caribbean airlines, including
Trinidad-based Air Caribbean and St. Lucia-based Helen Air
Caribbean, have increased their scheduled service throughout the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because American's restructuring means fewer jets to
fewer Caribbean islands, United States travelers to the Caribbean _
especially those traveling beyond San Juan _ can expect fewer
nonstops and smaller planes, and therefore probably less
convenience. For despite additional flights by other United States
carriers, Caribbean air service is not likely to return any time
soon to what it was.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airlines seek to make a profit on every route _ even to the
point of redeploying planes from routes that are only marginally
profitable to those that are more profitable. That is what happened
last year at Las Vegas, where several airlines eliminated flights
or substituted smaller planes for widebodies _ not because Las
Vegas flights were unprofitable but because they provided much less
revenue per mile than did other routes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, while growing numbers of Americans visit the
Caribbean on cruises, the percentage of stopover visitors (those
who eat and sleep there) has plummeted _ to 48.6 percent last year
from 61.8 percent in 1987, according to the Caribbean Tourism
Organization. The reasons, travel authorities say, range from
familiarity with the Caribbean to increased competition for the
tourist dollar to fare sales to many Asian, European and Latin
American destinations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In at least partial compensation, European visits to the
Caribbean have almost doubled since 1987, to 22 percent last year
from 11.2 percent. Much of that increase has been driven by
low-cost package tours and charter flights, mainly to the Dominican
Republic.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than twice as many Europeans _ one million _ visited the
Dominican Republic last year as Americans, and more than four times
the number visited Barbados and Jamaica, the runner-up Caribbean
destinations for Europeans. (The top destinations for Americans are
the Bahamas, Puerto Rico and Jamaica, in that order.) That explains
why British Airways flies to 10 Caribbean destinations, and why
last September, Virgin Atlantic began six flights a week from
London to the Caribbean. &QL;

ARTS ABROAD: A PARIS SUBURB RECALLS THE '30S, ITS ERA OF GLORY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULOGNE-BILLANCOURT, France _ Even distant European cities feel
intimidated by the elegance, culture and history of Paris.
Consider, then, how difficult it is for an adjacent suburb like
Boulogne-Billancourt to establish its identity. Indeed, were it not
for the circular highway that defines the limits of the French
capital, it would be impossible today to know where Paris ends and
this town begins.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the 1920s and 1930s, Boulogne-Billancourt had its own
distinct personality. Previously known only for its laundries, it
became the center of new automotive and aircraft industries, home
to France's largest movie studio, a retreat for painters and
sculptors and a laboratory for architects and designers inspired by
the new modernist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Boulogne-Billancourt _ the two towns were fused into a
single municipality in 1925 _ has found a way of asserting its
independence from Paris by creating a Museum of the Thirties to
celebrate a time when it was truly different. The new museum,
inaugurated in early December, is part of a graceful modern
cultural center that stands beside the town hall, itself a monument
to 1930s architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Between the wars, long before President Francois Mitterrand
dared tamper with the heart of Paris with his program of Grands
Travaux, Boulogne-Billancourt was the one place where architectural
innovation was encouraged, with Tony Garnier, Auguste Perret, Le
Corbusier, Robert Mallet-Stevens and others free to experiment with
both style and the new material of reinforced concrete. Three Le
Corbusier buildings are among two dozen from that era that survive.
</P>
<P>
   With more space than was cheaply available in Paris,
Boulogne-Billancourt also drew some 30 sculptors, including Paul
Landowski (the cultural center, the Espace Landowski, carries his
name). And when the powerful art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler
moved here in 1921, writers and artists, from Gertrude Stein to
Picasso, would travel from Paris to spend Sundays at his home. Juan
Gris was among a handful who also settled here.
</P>
<P>
   Pointedly, the new museum does not aspire to present the best of
1930s art. One obvious reason is the impossibility of building a
new collection of works by, say, Picasso, Matisse, Brancusi and
Mondrian, just a few of the great artists living in Paris at the
time. But another good reason is that these artists can hardly be
encased in a single decade and, as such, are less representative of
the '30s than more obscure figures.
</P>
<P>
   While avant-garde artists were moving into abstraction and
Surrealism in the 1930s, neo-classical figurative painting and
sculpture were making a comeback under the umbrella of ``poetic
realism.'' After World War II, when the movement was seen to be
tainted by totalitarian influence, it went out of fashion. But it
nonetheless mirrored an era of both turmoil and nostalgia. And,
crucially, many of its works were within reach of the new museum.
</P>
<P>
   Although a small municipal museum has existed here since 1939,
in 1983 a new curator, Emmanuel Breon, persuaded the town council
to support something altogether more ambitious: a new museum that
would throw a spotlight on Boulogne-Billancourt's heyday in the
1930s. Thanks mainly to donations, but also to some acquisitions,
the museum can now boast a collection comprising some 800
paintings, 1,500 sculptures, 2,000 drawings and 50 pieces of
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's lobby gallery, which looks onto the Espace
Landowski's atrium, has been set aside for sculptures. Many are
romantic statues of nudes, but others evoke the neo-classical
figures that decorated the monumental architecture of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Several sculptures were well known at the time. ``Trinity,'' an
elongated geometrical statue of a father, mother and child by Jan
and Joel Martel, was displayed at the first salon of the Union of
Modern Artists in Paris in 1930. ``Tragedy'' and ``Comedy,'' two
stone figures by the Boulogne-based Portuguese artist Ernesto Canto
da Maya, were shown at the Colonial Exhibition in 1931. The
museum's two other floors are given over to paintings organized
around themes. Although all the art is figurative, one section
emphasizes the return to classicism with paintings like the ``Venus
Anadyomede'' by Georges Sabbagh, inspired by Botticelli, and ``The
Earth,'' a neo-Greek pastoral allegory by Jean Souverbie. Less
typical, although surely more topical when it was painted in 1937,
is Robert Humblot's ``Horrors of War.''
</P>
<P>
   Another section carries the title ``L'Ecole de Paris,'' the name
given to the large number of Central European artists who sought
refuge in Paris between the wars, first from the Soviet Union, then
from Nazi Germany. Prominent here are a series of portraits by
Arbit Blatas, a 90-year-old Lithuanian-born artist who fled to
Paris then and has donated some 50 of his paintings, sculptures and
drawings to the new museum. He now lives in New York and Venice.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has found a way of displaying some works by
Paris-based artists by recalling the ``Sundays in Boulogne'' spent
at Kahnweiler's home. More interesting, perhaps, is the section
dedicated to colonial art _ not folk art, but work done by European
artists visiting French colonies. The museum includes numerous
striking works by Alexandre Iacovleff, a Russian-born artist who
was the official illustrator of major ethnographic expeditions to
Africa in 1924 and to Indochina in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Until late January, the museum's temporary display area is
dedicated to the Austrian-born painter and architect Leopold
Krakauer, who moved to British-ruled Palestine in 1924 and
subsequently played an influential role in the modernist
architecture of Tel Aviv. The museum has complemented this show by
including designs and models of modernist buildings in
Boulogne-Billancourt that were no less influenced by the
international style of the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   In February, this space will become part of the permanent
exhibition when the museum's collection of 1930s furniture and
decorative arts will be put on display. Temporary shows, starting
with one dedicated to the art and design of the great ocean liners
of the era between the world wars, will then move to another large
gallery in the Espace Landowski.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the museum, which is within easy access of Paris by
Metro, prompts the inevitable observation that the collection
reaches beyond Boulogne-Billancourt to make its point. Yet if its
aim is to recreate the mood of the times, it succeeds. Greater
masterpieces can be found at the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris,
but this museum suggests what the art of the 1930s really felt
like. And, in doing so, it has provided Boulogne-Billancourt with a
past worth visiting.

TRAVEL QUESTIONS CONCERNING COINS, VIENNA AND JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 10.) 
 (ms) 
 By JOSEPH SIANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   Small Change That Counts
</P>
<P>
   Q. Whenever I travel abroad, I return with a pocketful of
foreign coins and paper currency. Is there some organization to
which I can contribute this change and know that it will help the
needy? Marilyn F. Rothstein, Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. Unicef estimates that about $72 million in foreign coins and
low-denomination bills are wasted each year because they are too
small to be converted, so it has teamed up with 19 airlines in its
Change for the Good program, to collect some of these funds and use
them to help children worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers heading home will usually find a Change for the Good
envelope on their meal tray or seat-back pocket on flights by the
participating airlines. All they have to do is put their
unconvertible foreign currency into these envelopes, and it will be
sent to Unicef. These small sums can do a lot of good: $2 in
change, for example, can buy 25 oral rehydration packets _ a
lifesaving mix of salt and sugar to prevent death by dehydration _
or enough high-dose vitamin A to protect 28 toddlers from blindness
for one year. Since 1991, Unicef says, over $19 million has been
collected through Change for the Good.
</P>
<P>
   The participating airlines are Aer Lingus, Aeromexico, Aero
Peru, Air France, Air Mauritius, Alitalia, ANA, American, Asiana,
Avianca, British Airways, Canadian Airlines International, Cathay
Pacific, Finnair, JAL, Qantas, Royal Air Maroc, Saeta and T.W.A.
</P>
<P>
   You can also drop coins off at Unicef House, 3 United Nations
Plaza, in New York, or mail them to Unicef, 333 East 38th St.,
Sixth Floor, New York, N.Y. 10016.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think all those coins will require too much postage,
you now have a use for all those odd-denomination stamps you've
collected thanks to postal-rate increases over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Vienna Architecture
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to visit Vienna in the fall, and I am interested in
seeing some of the works of Adolf Loos and Otto Wagner, leading
architects at the turn of the century. Do you know of any tours
that would cover their work during this period? Glen Mull,
Hackettstown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Viennese architect Adolf Loos (1870-1933) was one of the
pioneers of the modern European movement. He was an early opponent
of the decorative trend of Art Nouveau, believing that architecture
devoid of ornament represented pure and lucid thought. One example
of this in Vienna is his Steiner House, a three-story residence at
10 St. Veit Gasse consisting of basic flat surfaces and
different-shaped rectangular windows that give variety and movement
to the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Wagner (1841-1918), one of the most influential architects
at the turn of the century, numbers among his students the Art
Nouveau proponent Josef Hoffmann. One of Wagner's buildings in
Vienna is the Majolica House, 40 Wienzeile, whose facade of
colorful Majolica tiles reflects Art Nouveau's use of color in
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   For information on more of these two architects' work, the
Austrian National Tourist Office suggests you send a fax to the
Vienna Guide Service, (43-1) 440 2825. A private tour of about
three and a half hours costs $110 (calculated at 11.70 schillings
to the dollar); a full-day tour $219.
</P>
<P>
   For less expensive options, try Vienna Walks, which conducts a
large menu of tours that vary by month, including architectural
tours focusing on modernism and Art Nouveau. The tours last about
90 minutes and require a minimum of three participants each. They
cost about $11 a person, plus any admission fees, and are conducted
in German and English.
</P>
<P>
   More information is available at Vienna's Web site:
info.wien.at. The guide who conducts the Art Nouveau tour, Brigitte
Timmermann, can be contacted directly by telephone and fax at
(43-1) 774 8901. More information: Austrian National Tourist
Office, 500 Fifth Ave., Suite 800, New York, N.Y. 10110; (212)
575-7723, fax (212) 730-4568.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarly Japan
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I want to take an escorted tour of Japan next
spring for about two weeks. We would love one like those run by
Elderhostel, but space is hard to find. Can you suggest similar
alternatives? Elena Stolzer, Kendall Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. Elderhostel provides educational trips worldwide for
travelers 55 or older, but if you cannot find space on any of its
trips, some of these tours suggested by the Japan National Tourist
Organization _ all of which include study programs with on-site
study leaders _ might work for you.
</P>
<P>
   The McGill University Alumni Association has a 12-day program in
central Japan March 25 to April 5, accompanied by a study leader
from the University of Toronto. It is intended as an introduction
to Japanese culture. Stops include Tokyo, Mount Fuji, Hiroshima and
the waterside shrine in Miyajima. The price is $3,233 a person,
double occupancy, with air fare from Toronto, calculated at $1.53
Canadian to the U.S. dollar. Contact McGill University, 3605 Rue de
la Montagne, Montreal, Quebec H3G 2M1 Canada; (800) 567-5175.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Barbara Museum of Art's trip April 13 to 25 to central
Japan will be accompanied by Bruce Coats, an expert on Japanese
temple architecture. It is meant to coincide with cherry blossom
season, and much of the trip will be spent in and around Kyoto,
with time in Tokyo, too. The price of $4,990 a person, double
occupancy, includes accommodations and a few meals, but not air
fare. Though the tour is now full, openings may develop. Contact
the museum at 1130 State St., Santa Barbara, Calif. 93101; (805)
963-4364, extension 336.
</P>
<P>
   From March 16 to 25, the Smithsonian Institution will conduct
its Kyoto Interlude. Speakers will include a member of the local
historical preservation society. To better understand traditional
Japanese culture, tour participants will visit a textile factory, a
castle, a tea ceremony and gardens. Rates: $5,575 a person, double,
including air fare from Los Angeles, accommodations and some meals.
Call the Smithsonian at (202) 357-4700.
</P>
<P>
   All the above include upscale accommodations. For tours using
moderate-class accommodations (similar to Elderhostel's), try
Esprit Travel, which has three education-accented itineraries with
a total of six departure dates. They vary in length from 12 to 14
days and in price from $3,000 to $3,250 a person, double. That
includes accommodations, air fare from Los Angeles and most meals.
Expect to do some walking. Contact Esprit Travel, 2101 Wilshire
Blvd., Suite 101, Santa Monica, Calif. 90403; (800) 377-7481, fax
(310) 828-3564.

 &HT;    Impressive first-year class awaits call from Hall
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dale Murphy had a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when is the announcement?'' the bashful voice inquired by
telephone from Boston. ``Tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   The Baseball Hall of Fame's newest class will be announced at 2
p.m. today, and how perfectly for Murphy that the occasion sneaked
up on him. Murphy, a former Braves center fielder, is part of a
superior first-year group of candidates, including Nolan Ryan,
George Brett, Robin Yount and Carlton Fisk. And if that bunch seems
to have a higher pedigree, the first to agree is, of course,
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three obvious ones (Ryan, Brett and Yount) are going to be
there,'' Murphy said. ``And anyone else who gets in is going to be
a real bonus and such a departure from the norm over so many years.
I really haven't felt much on it this year, except that I'm
eligible and it's hard to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baseball Writers Association of America, which has voted in
five players in the last six years, is expected to crack open the
door to Cooperstown a little wider. Only 26 players have been
inducted on the first ballot, and strikeout king Ryan, with seven
no-hitters, 5,714 strikeouts and hitters Brett and Yount, each with
more than 3,000 hits) would be the largest incoming group since
1991 (Rod Carew, Ferguson Jenkins and Gaylord Perry). It has been
44 years since four players were voted in at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Other first-year candidates include George Bell, Mike Boddicker,
John Candelaria, Frank Tanana, Mike Witt and Charlie Liebrandt,
another former Atlanta player. Among 17 holdovers from last year's
ballot are Tony Perez, Steve Garvey, Keith Hernandez and Bruce
Sutter. The company makes Murphy uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked about it since I retired, and I'm just honored
to be considered,'' said Murphy, who is 1 1/2 years into a
three-year Morman mission, serving as a missionary supervisor for
the church's Massachusetts region. ``I was just talking with
someone about an article that said I might have a shot. To be
honest, I've always felt there was maybe a shot, but that if it
happened, it'd be somewhere down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   While Murphy's career .265 average will not help him, he is one
of 19 players to win multiple most valuable player awards. Of the
other 18, only two are not already in Cooperstown Yount and Roger
Maris. While Murphy failed to reach the 400-homer mark, his 398
home runs rank 23rd among all players currently eligible for Hall
of Fame consideration. Of those 23, only Dave Kingman (442) and
Darrell Evans (414) have not been inducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does happen,'' Murphy said, ``whenever, if it ever does,
I would be more than ecstatic.''

 &HT;    The game hasn't changed, but the Falcons have
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charlie Taylor, Falcon spokesman, described it as ``an
ordinary Monday.'' And it was, except that this is January, and the
Falcons don't ordinarily play in January. Except that they're
favored _ favored _ to win only the third playoff game in their
33-year existence. Except that by winning once more they'll advance
to the NFC championship game, where this franchise has never been.

   An ordinary Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After a season of extraordinary Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Except that, viewed individually, none of those Sundays were so
extraordinary, either.
</P>
<P>
   Win 14 games and there figures to be a fluke mixed in. The
Falcons had none. Oh, they trailed Indy and Philly early and
Chicago and Detroit fairly late, but not once did this team win a
game where it seemed justice had been flouted. Not once did a
Falcon run a Big Ben and pluck a Hail Mary from the Jaws of Defeat.
There were no finishes on the order Young-to-Owens at 0:03. There
was simply numbing consistency, play upon play, quarter after
quarter, month after month.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent excellence is a blessed thing, but it's hard to
market and harder still to chronicle. Was there one Sunday this
season when everything turned for this franchise? The easy answer
is the second San Fran game _ the Ray Buchanan interception, the
Jessie Tuggle recovery, the Terance Mathis touchdown. But that
ignores the flattening of New England the week before, which was in
its way more impressive. And calling the win in Foxboro the
season's biggest road achievement ignores what happened in
Charlotte before Labor Day, when the tabbed-for-mediocre Falcons
whipped the poised-for-a-rebound Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   So much in life is context. That Carolina game seems
insignificant now, but at the time the Falcons regarded it as a
watershed. That the Falcons would be working in January has been a
given for nearly a month, but it wasn't a given in August. Back
then, the goal was to win nine or 10 times and earn a wild card.
Back then, even that standard-issue assignment seemed ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   It's an amazing story, except that the closer you look the more
mundane it gets. What's exotic about blocking hard and tackling
harder, about running the ball and stopping the run? Where's the
breakthrough in a coach stressing fundamentals? How is this
different from what Lombardi did in Green Bay, what Noll did in
Pittsburgh, what Parcells does wherever he goes? And the answer is,
it's not. At bottom, winning football is always the same.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed is that the Falcons, for so long forlorn, have
come to embody the characteristics of a winner. They don't subsist
on emotion. They didn't beat the Patriots and Niners and then lose
two of the next three. They didn't waver after Dan Reeves was
hospitalized. They kept going, play upon play, quarter after
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Now here they are, spending an ordinary Monday readying to play
the Niners again, unsurprised by being the NFL's surprise team.
Chances are, next Monday will find these Falcons working still,
business as usual, one step from a most extraordinary place, one
step from the Super Bowl.

WHITE HOUSE IS RELUCTANT TO DELAY STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House expressed reluctance Monday to
delay President Clinton's scheduled Jan. 19 State of the Union
address to Congress, despite the urgings of some senators that
Clinton postpone it because of his looming Senate impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was looking
forward to outlining his proposals to a joint meeting of the House
and Senate as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of any discussions or requests from the
(congressional) leadership to adjust that date,'' Lockhart said.
``The president is working hard on his speech and plans to deliver
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican and Democratic senators urged Clinton on
Sunday to postpone his nationally-televised address until the
Senate completes action on his impeachment _ either with a Senate
trial or a resolution of censure _ for his cover-up of his sexual
dalliance with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said Sunday that it would be
``unseemly and distracting'' for Clinton to deliver the address
while an impeachment trial was underway. Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., said that it would be ``inappropriate'' for Clinton to
report to Congress while he was ``under impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, suggested that Clinton merely submit
his State of the Union address to Congress in writing.
</P>
<P>
   A speech delay would be a major blow to Clinton's effort to
portray himself as an undistracted chief executive carrying on
normal business in the face of efforts by the Republican-led
Congress to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, saying that he was choosing his words ``very
carefully,'' told reporters: ``As of now, we're planning to give
that speech on Jan. 19.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and the congressional leadership agreed
last month that Clinton would deliver the address on Jan. 19.
Clinton aides said they wanted a date in the third week of January
in order to accommodate the president's plans to visit St. Louis,
Mo., the following week for the visit of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton wanted to deliver his address as scheduled
to highlight his legislative agenda for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has important work that he's doing and looks
forward to presenting it to the country,'' Lockhart said. ``The
public has come to expect the president to continue doing his job.
He'll continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers brief Clinton daily on developments with the
threatened Senate trial but Lockhart said the president was not
being diverted from official business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deals on a day-to-day basis with the business at hand here
in Washington, and (the impeachment trial) is clearly on everyone's
plate,'' Lockhart said. ``It's a subject that comes up, but it
certainly doesn't dominate the president's work day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said White House lawyers would be prepared to present
the president's defense against impeachment at a Senate trial if
the proceedings begin Monday. ``We'll be ready to go next week,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued to unveil features of his proposed federal
budget for the fiscal year 2000 that begins next Oct. 1. His State
of the Union address is expected to address those proposals, which
he will submit to Congress by Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We traditionally use this time to try to generate public
support for some of the ideas that the president will have in his
State of the Union and the budget,'' Lockhart said in response to
questions about the administration's timing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
proposed a five-year, $6.2 billion package of assistance for the
long-term care of the disabled, including a $1,000 tax credit for
an estimated 2 million Americans trying to care for disabled
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that there is not a substitute for families
being able to care for their loved ones,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``But
we sometimes forget that caregivers also need care. They, too,
carry enormous burdens.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the $5.5 billion cost of the tax
credit over five years would be offset by closing unspecified tax
loopholes that benefit corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said the
proposal was merely the beginning of an effort with Congress to
address the problem. The message to Congress, Shalala said, is
``Let's sit down and talk together,'' adding: ``I would describe it
as evolving.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton unveiled a proposed $110 billion increase in projected
Pentagon spending over six years in his nationally broadcast radio
address on Saturday. Earlier, he proposed a boost in federal
assistance to the homeless.

<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., meets Wednesday with
the Senate's 55 Republicans to search for consensus on how to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal being considered _ put forth by Gorton and Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. _ calls for a two-stage Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under their proposal, House ``managers,'' or prosecutors, would
present the case for impeachment next Monday; Clinton's defense
team would rebut the allegations on Tuesday; senators would
question the two sides on Wednesday; and the Senate would vote
Thursday on whether the House's allegations of presidential perjury
and obstruction of justice, if proven true, would warrant removal
from office.
</P>
<P>
   If proponents of Clinton's removal failed to muster the required
two-thirds majority at that point, the Senate would adjourn the
trial and move to a compromise censure resolution.

IT'S BETTER TO BE PEERLESS THAN PIERLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the San Francisco-area's most popular
fishing piers may be shut down forever, and another _ the No. 1
fishing pier in California _ is also in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo Pier, which extends 2-and-1/2 miles from Foster
City out to the main channel of South San Francisco Bay and
provides a rare opportunity to catch sturgeon, was closed last year
by a California Department of Transportation earthquake retrofit
project on the adjacent San Mateo Bridge, and will likely never
reopen due to structural deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacifica Pier, the only pier in the Bay Area that provides
direct access to the ocean and the chance to catch salmon, striped
bass and Dungeness crabs, will run out of funding for maintenance
by the City of Pacifica this summer, leaving it at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been used for free by thousands of people every year,
and Pacifica Pier is the most popular pier in California, with 500
to 1,000 people at a time fishing when schools of salmon arrive
within range every summer.
</P>
<P>
   Each has its own story.
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo Pier was shut down nearly a year ago to the public so
CalTrans crews could use it as a staging area for equipment and
barges for work on the adjacent San Mateo Bridge. It now resembles
something of a war zone, and while the crews have been retrofitting
the bridge for earthquake safety, engineers say the pier is now in
a severe state of decay.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete from support columns has eroded in many places,
even exposing re-bar in some sections, with pieces and chunks of
concrete occasionally crumbling into the water below. Meanwhile,
the work crews have transformed the top of the pier to fit their
own needs, and to reopen it would require renovation.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the pier will never be reopened, according to
rangers for the San Mateo County Parks and Recreation, who did not
want to be quoted. According to a CalTrans spokesman, it will be
closed for ``a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo Pier has been one of the few free, accessible places
where anyone can try to catch sharks, rays, perch, kingfish,
striped bass, and sturgeon; the only other piers with a chance of
catching sturgeon in the Bay are Dumbarton Pier at Newark, McNear's
Pier in San Rafael and Point Pinole Pier near San Pablo. Since it
extends past tidal flats, San Mateo Pier has also been a great walk
or easy bike trip, and you could view egrets, stilts and other
seabirds when minus low tides unveil the surrounding mud flats.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pacifica Pier is in imminent trouble. According to an
engineering report, the pier needs $1.5 million worth of immediate
repair work.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the City of Pacifica has maintained the pier
because it runs a pipe for its water treatment facility there. But
with a new water treatment facility going on line in the coming
year, scheduled for April, but more likely by September, the money
is not available to finance the maintenance of two systems.
</P>
<P>
   While no closure of Pacifica Pier is planned, that could change
quickly with a series of howling Pacific storms that could
undermine the pier's support pilings. Behind the scenes, city
administrators are scrambling for alternative financing, most
likely from the state, perhaps even to deed the property to the
California State Parks Department.

<P>
   &UR; A CUBAN SOUND DANCING NORTH &QL; 
 &LR;  There has been a flood of traditional records from Cuba recently,
and the reasons for it are simple. The first is the descent into
irrelevance, perhaps temporary, of the Havana-based Timba dance
music world, which started receiving plenty of attention five years
ago and is now self-destructing. The second is the international
success of the Ry Cooder-produced album, ``Buena Vista Social
Club,'' released last year. Given the easy availability of hundreds
of fine little local Cuban son bands and older singers playing the
same music made by Buena Vista Social Club, it's not surprising
that the market is overflowing. Here are a handful of the best; all
are available from Descarga, (800) 377-2647 or at
www.descarga.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IBRAHIM FERRER: `TIERRA CALIENTE' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer was the star vocalist with the Afro-Cuban All-Stars
(another Ry Cooder production), who released an album in 1997 and
toured the United States last year. His own record, with Los
Bocucos, is a marvel of syncopation and oddness. ``Tierra
Caliente'' (Egrem) is sort of son and sort of salsa, and it shows a
side of Cuban music that Americans used to the authenticity of
``Buena Vista Social Club'' haven't seen.
</P>
<P>
   There are electric keyboards and electric guitars, and the
rhythms draw from all over the world. Sometimes the music sounds
Haitian, sometimes Cuban, and it is always joyous, with a sense of
humor that's palpable whether one understands the words or not. And
it has an intensity that only the best dance music achieves.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOS NARANJOS: `MI SON TIENE PIEL MORENA' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a rocking little record. With a tres guitar motoring away
at rhythmic figures, the music, hardcore son, never stops. Most of
the songs are older without being overfamiliar, and the chorus
sings away, surrounding the rough tones of the lead singer.
</P>
<P>
   There's a force under the prettiness of the music; suddenly the
music is charging down the highway, swinging with power. ``Mi Son
Tiene Piel Morena'' (Eurotropical) is perfectly made; the band is
obviously a working group, and its precision helps drive the
dance-floor sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   El Son Entero: `Cuba'
</P>
<P>
   Yet another little rock-house of a record. This time it features
the tres playing of Luis Acosta Pino, a virtuoso, and when the
singers call on him to solo, they call him the killer of the tres.
His solos charge the record, zipping around the fretboard, using
more of a jazz sensibility _ he even bends some notes _ than the
traditional Cuban point of view. The music is built around his
solos, and when he starts the band seems to stand back, wondering
what's about to pop out of Acosta's imagination. The group is from
the province of Camageuey, and it uses a few unusual rhythms. If
anybody needed an argument to prove that the son doesn't stand
completely still, this is it. There are occasional imperfections in
the singing in ``Cuba,'' (Playasound) but the feeling and the solos
make up for the problems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAITO SUREDA: `AHORA COMIENZO A VIVIR' &QL; 
 &LR;  Sureda is 84 and the title of the record, ``Now I Start to
Live,'' has some truth to it and some wishful thinking, given
Cuba's economy. Sureda sang with Celia Cruz in the Sonora Matancera
and spent much of his life traveling. ``Ahora Comienzo a Vivir''
(Eurotropical) catches him in bolero, son and guaguanco territory,
backed by Su Sonora, a swinging small band with a few trumpets. It
is sophisticated dance music in an older style influenced by jazz,
and Sureda's large, intense voice floats over the classic sound of
the band. The music is nicely balanced and gentle, but with a
rhythmic tug.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LA BANDA MUNICIPALE DE SANTIAGO DE CUBA, `FANFARE CUBAINE' &QL; 
 &LR;  This is an oddity, a record of the community brass band from
Santiago, home of the son, produced by the French ethnomusicologist
Emmanuelle Honorin. The band, started in 1900, is big and full, and
it takes on famous sones, danzones and congas and turns them into
lilting, beautiful orchestral pieces. ``Fanfare Cubaine'' (Buda)
includes the Buena Vista Social Club's ``Chan Chan,'' with tubas
announcing the bass line. The recording is a footnote, but a
gorgeous one that suggests the breadth of imagination and the
conservative essence of Cuban music. &QL;

<P>
   CINCINNATI _ When a recruiter offered her a job as a research
specialist at a rapidly growing medical company, Kimberly Belknap
grabbed it and moved here from Grand Rapids, Mich., to get herself,
as she put it, on a more lucrative career path.
</P>
<P>
   The new job, auditing doctors who test new drugs for
pharmaceutical companies, pays nearly $60,000 a year. Ms. Belknap
earned that much in Grand Rapids, but only by holding two jobs, and
the long hours were getting to her. So was the lack of opportunity.
As a 36-year-old physiologist, she had already risen, in her main
job, to research coordinator at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the feel of this city,'' Ms. Belknap said. ``It is
much larger but very conservative, like Grand Rapids, and the cost
is about the same.'' For $660 a month, she has a two-bedroom
apartment with a fireplace. And there is opportunity in a city with
a big university, teaching hospitals, a young biotechnology
industry and other growing companies like Kendle, the one that
employs Ms. Belknap. ``I have already been approached,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati is prospering, drawing professionals like Ms. Belknap
to companies that are expanding or putting new operations here.
Jobs in this Ohio River metropolis are multiplying at a nearly 3
percent annual rate, on the strong side for cities its size _
higher, for example, than the 2.4 percent rate in Salt Lake City,
but lower than the 4 percent for Austin, Texas. The national
average is 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Midsized American cities _ not only Cincinnati, Austin and Salt
Lake, but Denver; Indianapolis; Kansas City, Mo.; Sacramento,
Calif.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Charlotte, N.C., and more than a dozen
others _ reflect the strengths that have sustained the American
economy in the 1990s and, more recently, kept it growing in the
face of economic turmoil abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America has found in these cities a fertile ground for
the service-sector job creation that has played so big a role in
the current expansion. AT&AMP;T, for example, has a huge
telephone-operator center in Jacksonville; Microsoft and Vanguard
chose Charlotte for some of their new service operations; and
Integral Technologies, a new software company with 100 employees,
came to life in Indianapolis, financed by a local venture capital
company, one of many that have sprung up in midsized cities.
</P>
<P>
   Public spending, particularly for downtown redevelopment, like
the two sports stadiums and the riverfront highway under
construction here, also plays a role in these cities' prosperity.
So do tax breaks and other subsidies that the cities use
aggressively to coax companies to locate or expand there. But the
main engine is a plentiful pool of workers who are not too
expensive, even those who are college-educated and highly skilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, everyone was predicting that companies would
move to Montana or some other rural state,'' said Edward Glaeser, a
Harvard economist and urban expert. ``The key now is the
middle-sized city, 750,000 to 2 million people, that can provide
enough amenities, enough of the right sort of labor pool, to
attract companies, encourage expansion and create jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater Cincinnati, with 1.9 million people spread over 13
counties in southern Ohio and northern Kentucky, offers such a
pool. Most of the nation's job creation in the 1990s has been
generated by companies in the service and financial sectors, Labor
Department data show. And they have hired mainly among two groups
of workers. One group, near the high end, college-educated like Ms.
Belknap and very skilled, accepts $40,000 to $80,000 as a
satisfactory wage. The other, at the low end, often fairly skilled
but either just starting out or not as well educated, settles for
less than $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller cities, even if they have this mix of workers, lack the
nexus of business services _ accountants, lawyers, advertising
agencies and transportation _ that corporations need, said Mark
Zandi, chief economist of RFA, an economic consulting firm in West
Chester, Pa. And larger cities are saddled with the urban social
problems and the unionized workers that corporate America tries to
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity in Cincinnati could dissipate. Even as new
companies arrive, long-established ones could falter. Auto sales,
now strong, could fall, hurting the numerous parts suppliers here.
China, a big customer of General Electric Aircraft Engines, could
cease to be an enthusiastic buyer of the narrow-bodied airliners
equipped with the jet engines that GE assembles here at a sticker
price of $5 million an engine. Or stock prices, whose rise has
encouraged a flourish of borrowing and spending, could falter,
extinguishing wealth among thousands of shareholders here in such
hometown companies as Procter &AMP; Gamble and Fifth Third Bancorp.
</P>
<P>
   But if the booming stock market helps explain the spending and
home construction so evident in this city, Megan McCoy helps
explain why expanding companies like Fidelity Investments choose
cities like Cincinnati to locate new operations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCoy, 24, is one of the more skilled people at the low end.
After graduating in May 1997 from Miami University in nearby
Oxford, with a degree in finance, she joined Fidelity, the
Boston-based mutual fund and financial services company that is a
unit of FMR. Years ago, Fidelity had all its workers in Boston, and
the most sophisticated operations are still there. But as Fidelity
grew, it spread across the country, and now 60 percent of its
27,000 workers are in regional centers like the one here, which is
Fidelity's largest, with 3,500 employees _ up from 300 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCoy is a phone operator, taking calls to an 800 number
from Fidelity clients who want to cash in their 401(k) plans. ``I
wanted to get into the securities industry, but I did not want to
be thrown right away into cold calling,'' she said of her decision
to join Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   She commutes from the Hyde Park neighborhood, where many young
singles live, to a quiet, wooded campus of modernistic office
buildings near the city's huge airport, on the Kentucky side of the
Ohio, in one of the two Kentucky counties that are part of Greater
Cincinnati. There, using answers that come up on her computer, she
counsels Fidelity clients who are retiring or leaving a company.
</P>
<P>
   For this, Ms. McCoy earns just under $12 an hour, or nearly
$24,000 a year, although with regular overtime, her total pay in
1998 was roughly $28,000. With many other workers like Ms. McCoy
eager to get started, other companies have also set up telephone
operations here. Citibank, a unit of Citigroup, and GE Information
Technology Solutions are the latest.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Distribution is another growing Cincinnati activity, because of
the giant airport, which is Delta Air Lines' second-largest hub.
From its campus, Fidelity mails the monthly statements to all of
its 12 million clients, as well as the checks they receive and a
variety of other materials. Seven hundred people, earning $18,000
to $23,000 a year, work in mail. An administrative staff for the
entire Fidelity operation, as well as a variety of technical
workers _ more than 500 people in all _ earn between $40,000 and
$75,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work ethic here is extremely strong,'' said Paul Smith,
manager of the Fidelity campus.
</P>
<P>
   The public subsidies are also robust. As a lure, Fidelity got
tax relief equal to about 5 percent of the $100 million
construction cost for its five-year-old campus, a free highway to
its hilly campus, and, starting in January, a telephone center at
Northern Kentucky University, a state school 10 minutes away by
car, where 200 students will do the same work that Ms. McCoy does _
for $2 or $3 an hour less in pay.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no major corporate undertaking seems to happen in the
Cincinnati area anymore without a public subsidy. That is true of
other American cities, although Cincinnati, with strong support
from the Kentucky and Ohio governments, is more aggressive than
most. And the subsidies flow, whether the company is being lured
here, like Fidelity, or is long-established, like Procter &AMP; Gamble,
which gets property tax abatements for new investments.
</P>
<P>
   Anything splashy gets some public money. Duke Realty
Investments, an established developer here, built and recently
opened a gray concrete and tinted glass shopping center on Fountain
Square, the busiest downtown area. Palomino, a trendy, lamp-lit
restaurant, is a tenant. Tiffany's is another, and so are a Brooks
Brothers clothing store and a Lazarus department store. But the
city government, not Duke, purchased the choice site for $80
million and leased it to Duke for monthly payments that cover, in
effect, only $10 million of the city's outlay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not have gotten into this,'' said James Gray, a Duke
vice president, ``if the city had not presented us with that modest
lease.''
</P>
<P>
   A different view of Cincinnati's appeal emerges from the city's
leaders. True, they say, wages are lower than in the Northeast, or
on the West Coast or in Chicago and Detroit. But the cost of living
is also much less. The hub airport, greatly expanded in recent
years, plays a decisive role as a corporate lure, they argue. And
the riverfront construction project, featuring new football and
baseball stadiums for the Bengals and the Reds, each demanded by
the teams, gives the city an indispensable lure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are talking to businesses about locating here,'' said
Robert Wehling, a senior vice president at Procter &AMP; Gamble, the
city's largest employer, ``if you don't have professional sports
teams, you are not going to make their cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The saucer-shaped foundation of the new football stadium is
already in place and bulldozers have cut the wide swath of an
eight-lane highway to replace a road now running through the
riverfront site. Two thousand feet upriver, the Reds' new stadium
will rise almost on top of the team's present stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between these two bookends,'' said Andis Udris, director of
economic development, ``we will have retailers, restaurants,
offices, a museum _ basically items that complement tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   In full swing, the five-year, $800 million construction project,
financed through a half-cent increase in the sales tax, will
generate 2,000 jobs, many at local supplier companies, city
officials estimate. That is roughly 7 percent of the 25,000 jobs
added in Greater Cincinnati in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The riverfront stadiums are marketing,'' said Bob Bedinghaus,
a commissioner of Hamilton County, which includes downtown
Cincinnati. ``They show that this is an exciting place to live and
work.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are not what encouraged Candace Kendle Bryan and her
husband, Christopher Bergen, to form Kendle, the medical company,
after they moved here from Philadelphia to be near her mother, and
then expand it from 63 employees in 1991 to 350 today in
Cincinnati. Many are nurses, pharmacists and physiologists like Ms.
Belknap. They audit doctors who test drugs on patients before the
Food and Drug Administration rules on licensing the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a big enough health care industry, a critical
mass, so that we have people to draw from,'' Bergen said, ``and
there has to be alternative jobs for our employees who don't work
out or who want other opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the growth, there are caveats. The city's black
population does not share equally in the prosperity. The black
unemployment rate for the area is at least 8 percent, more than
double the 3.4 percent rate for the work force as a whole. And some
of Cincinnati's job gains, like those of other midsized cities, are
someone else's losses. Ashland Oil, for example, is shifting its
headquarters to Cincinnati from smaller Ashland, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zandi, the economist, said, ``There are no hard numbers,
but most of the new jobs in midsized cities seem to represent
expansion rather than transfer.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1953, Athol Fugard quit the University of Cape
Town and hitchhiked up through Africa to Port Sudan. Stranded,
without money, he booked passage on a tramp steamer, working as
``the captain's tiger,'' or all-purpose assistant. On board, he
found time to write his first novel, a book about his mother. But
in Fiji, in a fit of desperation, he threw the manuscript into the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Fugard's new play, ``The Captain's Tiger,'' is in previews at
the Manhattan Theater Club, where it is scheduled to open Jan. 12.
Subtitled ``A Memoir for the Stage,'' it deals with what happened
when Fugard shipped out on the steamer, an experience that
represented his coming of age. In a sense, the play is a
substitution for that early discarded novel, as an older artist
looks back at a turning point in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I never realized,'' he said in a recent interview, ``is
that writing `The Captain's Tiger' fulfills the promise I made to
my mother to deliver a body of work of which she would be proud and
that would celebrate her by way of that silent dedication behind
all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The promise came in a letter he wrote to his mother, Elizabeth
Fugard, when his ship docked in Honolulu. In it he said, ``If I've
the strength to fulfill my destiny it will live when I am no more _
and through it, you.'' He said he might fail as a man but his art
would be strong because it was inspired by her virtues: ``courage,
an indomitable will and faith.''
</P>
<P>
   That letter was published some years ago in a critical biography
of the playwright. When it was read back to him, his eyes clouded
over with emotion. He had forgotten what he had written, and he was
moved by what he now remembered and by what had followed in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   After he told his mother about his decision to leave the
university before graduating, she encouraged him in what other
parents might have considered to be a foolhardy venture. When her
husband, a pianist in a jazz band, retired and fell into years of
defeat and alcoholism, she supported the family by running a cafe
in Port Elizabeth. Scraping by on her income, she sent her son
money to come home. Returning to South Africa, he began his writing
career.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years of apartheid, as South Africa's foremost
playwright, his voice rang out clearly against racism, oppression
and censorship. Plays like ``The Blood Knot,'' ``Boesman and Lena''
and ``A Lesson From Aloes'' were conscience-struck about events in
his country. All his work seemed to lead to ```Master Harold' ...
and the Boys'' (in 1982), an autobiographical play in which he
looked back at his friendship with two black men who were waiters
in his mother's cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Chronologically, ``The Captain's Tiger'' follows ``Master
Harold,'' and it is something of a sequel. In both plays, he said,
``I am at a desk writing, trying to unravel the story of a mother
and father,'' and in each case, a black man is watching him.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Captain's Tiger,'' he has imaginary conversations with
his mother as a young woman as he tries to rewrite her life so that
it can lead to a happier ending. ``As I saw her life,'' he said,
``it was unformed and blinded by love, devotion and loyalty.'' She
was a woman who had sacrificed herself for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The new play is the latest work in Fugard's post-apartheid
period. With the election of Nelson Mandela as President of South
Africa in 1994 and with the end of apartheid, the playwright
wondered if he would be at a loss for material. ``South Africa,''
he said, ``had to do a complete 180-degree turn in terms of the
political miracle of the 20th century for me to realize that
somebody had pulled the plug, in a sense, on what was one source of
energy in my work _ my feeling of outrage and anger. Then it dawned
on me. You're not empty. You're loaded. Empty would be a blessing.
There's a wonderful phrase in Kazantzakis where he talks about the
need to reach your grave unburdened. That will never happen to me,
but it's a great sense: unburdened.''
</P>
<P>
   To his surprise, after apartheid, Fugard felt a kind of creative
liberation. He was ``free to tell personal stories that I would
have thought of as an indulgence during those years of apartheid,''
and he still had ``an incurable itch to write.''
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent plays like ``Valley Song'' and ``Cousins,'' his
1997 book about two disparate members of his family, he began
focusing more on private matters (as he had in ``Master Harold'').
With ``The Captain's Tiger,'' as is often the case, the author is
also the director and plays the central role.
</P>
<P>
   The third character in the play is an illiterate Swahili stoker
called Donkeyman who becomes a friend of the author and is
transfixed by the idea that he is writing a book _ and then is
horrified when he abandons it. With his quiet intensity, Donkeyman
is like Queequeg studying Ishmael, marveling at the idea of
literary creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of the manuscript was, for Fugard, an act of
betrayal, akin to the scene in ``Master Harold'' when his
surrogate, Hally, spits at Sam, one of his mother's waiters and the
boy's devoted father figure. ``My life is littered with
betrayals,'' he admitted, and added, ``I think that generates the
plays.'' In the case of the discarded novel, it was a betrayal both
of his mother and of Donkeyman.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he could have thrown away the manuscript, he said: ``I
think it might have had something to do with the fact that Fiji was
the moment of real despair on the entire trip. I felt there were no
roads from Fiji to South Africa. That led to drinking, and when I
really hit bottom, I got very self-destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   But some people who felt so depressed might have jumped
overboard. ``Survivor,'' he described himself. ``Which saved me so
many times on the edge of that cliff.'' That in effect was the
beginning of the new play, although it was more than 40 years
before he could write it.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening time, he endured the hardships of a
tumultuous political period _ including having his passport taken
away by the South African government in 1967 _ and he confronted
his own alcoholism. During the run of ``Master Harold'' on
Broadway, he went to Chicago for a weekend and, as was then his
habit, packed two bottles of Jack Daniel's in his overnight bag.
``I was drunk when I arrived in Chicago, and I stayed drunk for the
weekend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, he was dining with Susan Hilferty, his set and
costume designer and later the co-director of ``The Captain's
Tiger,'' and she gave him the telephone number of Alcoholics
Anonymous, putting it next to a glass of wine on the table.
</P>
<P>
   He was faced with a choice: AA or the glass of wine, the lady or
the tiger. He chose AA and went to his first meeting that evening,
and though he did not follow through with the AA program, he
stopped drinking. He realized that his drinking had been in
unconscious emulation of his father. ``Without my knowing it,'' he
said, ``I was following in my father's footsteps, getting drunk
periodically, using alcohol to cope with a sense of huge personal
inadequacy.''

 TAKE-NYT 
NEW YORK: personal inadequacy.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His father's story is one of Fugard's many unkept appointments,
a play he has yet to write, along with one about South Africans in
exile. All of them are lined up waiting for the right moment, which
he once described as when the external specifics of a story run
parallel to a private need to make a personal statement.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years there have been major changes in his life. He
bought a home in Carmel, N.Y., and divides his time between the
United States and South Africa. His daughter, Lisa, once an
actress, is now a writer, in common with her parents. Fugard's
wife, Sheila, is a novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about other changes, Fugard said: ``I gave up drinking.
I gave up smoking. Two weeks ago I gave up coffee.'' Then came his
announcement: ``I'm giving up acting.'' The last performance of
``The Captain's Tiger'' in February, he said, will be his final
appearance onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought acting was bad for his health, he laughed
and said: ``No, but it might be bad for my writing. I'm 66 and
there are any number of celebrations I've got to get down on paper,
and acting doesn't allow me to do that. It was a hell of a drug,
performance. It's a great thrill, especially for a storyteller. But
it can go. Directing can go. Writing can't go. And in terms of what
writing lies ahead, I want to have a burning focus _ almost like
smoke coming up from the paper as I write.''
</P>
<P>
   When he begins a play, he follows a ritual. He uses a new
fountain pen and a new bottle of ink. Because he has written more
than two dozen plays, he said, ``the pen collection has gotten
totally out of hand.'' He continued: ``The pens complicate my life
now instead of being a source of joy. In the early days I had one
humble little Parker. Then I discovered Duponts, Mont Blancs, pens
from Japan.'' He has so many of them he is thinking about giving
some away, but will never part with his trusty Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his work to date, he said, ``I'm acutely conscious
of this moral responsibility to get as close to the truth as I
can.'' During the apartheid years, he said, he was ``bearing
witness'' to the stories of Boesman, Lena and others.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about his characters, he said, ``I have a perfect
solution for insomnia.'' He imagines that it is his 70th or 80th
birthday and the guests at a party are all characters from his
plays. He has to decide who sits next to whom at a long table and
what they will have to say to one another. ``Who can you put next
to Boesman? Or Gladys in `A Lesson from Aloes' ?'' Next to the
author is ``the youngest of my family, the ones I've written about
last, like the Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   He closed the conversation with a bit of advice: ``You must
never make rules about writing. That's the first thing I say when I
talk to students. After I said that in one lecture, a student
asked, so how  &UR; do &LR;  you start? And I said, `Wait for the moment when
the paper isn't looking at you.'''

CORPORATE PATRONS LOST TO MERGERS, ARTS GROUPS FEAR 
</HEADLINE>

 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The record number of mergers of large companies
into even larger ones last year has raised concerns at many arts
organizations and other nonprofit groups that a decline in
corporate donations may be an unfortunate byproduct.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the merging companies say they will maintain their
contributions. But ``what usually happens is that the combined
companies do not give as much as each company was giving
individually,'' said Ann Kaplan, research director of Giving USA,
which tracks contributions. ``Companies by their nature are not
philanthropic. They are giving to advance their business
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Recipients of corporate gifts fear that those interests might
change because of shifts in corporate philosophy, overlapping
contributions among newly merged companies or the closing of
headquarters in cities where a merged partner has long had a
presence. Some local arts groups say that even the loss of a modest
grant could be detrimental, because contributions from blue-chip
companies serve as marks of an organization's value to other
potential donors.
</P>
<P>
   The United States experienced more than 12,000 mergers last
year, with a total value of more than $1.5 trillion, although many
of them are awaiting federal approval. Among the companies involved
are major arts patrons like AT&AMP;T, Bell Atlantic, BankAmerica,
Chrysler and Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the anxiety among nonprofit groups is the inability of
some of the merging companies to respond to queries about their
future giving because of a federally mandated ``quiet period''
during which they are not permitted to talk about their plans while
regulators review the deals.
</P>
<P>
   The role of corporate donations in the arts and other
philanthropic activity is huge. According to Giving USA,
corporations gave $8.2 billion to nonprofit institutions in 1997,
which accounted for 5.7 percent of all charitable contributions.
The share rose to 12 percent when contributions to churches and
other religious institutions, which are made largely by
individuals, were removed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this giving is centered on the communities where
companies are based; and after mergers they are based in fewer
places. Lee Cassidy, executive director of the National Federation
of Nonprofits, said that while mergers tended to hurt nonprofit
institutions in general, he feared they would hit particularly hard
in cases like Chrysler Corp.'s merger with Daimler-Benz AG. Arts
groups and other nonprofits in the Detroit area could feel the
pinch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations that establish themselves through headquarters or
plants or even sales offices in a community tend to support that
community because the people who work for them live in that
community,'' he said. ``I think Chrysler will be less involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Harris, senior vice president for communications for the
newly unified ChryslerDaimler, said that the fears were
understandable but unfounded. The merged company will have dual
headquarters, he said, in Auburn Hills, Mich., a Detroit suburb,
and Stuttgart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chrysler has been active in the city of Detroit, and we have
no intention of breaking away from that at all,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar concerns have focused on the largest proposed merger of
last year, the $86 billion marriage of Mobil and Exxon, which is
awaiting federal approval.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil, more than most companies, has been identified with arts
giving for years, most prominently as one of the first and largest
contributors to public television, including 28 years as sponsor of
``Masterpiece Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The series is probably safe for now. While a Mobil spokeswoman
declined to comment, because of the ``quiet period'' rules, the
spokeswoman for WGBH in Boston, the producing station, said that in
July Mobil renewed its commitment to the show through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But arts organizations in the Washington area, where Mobil
maintains its headquarters in Fairfax, Va., are concerned. Although
Mobil's marketing and refining headquarters will remain, its top
corporate officers will be leaving, along with other highly paid
executives and, not incidentally, the people who make decisions on
charitable donations. Would the merged Exxon-Mobil in Texas have an
interest is supporting, for example, the Arts Council of Fairfax
County, which received $20,000 from Mobil last year?
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations in the Washington area that have been
supported by Mobil include the principal public television station,
WETA, and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which
each received $100,000 in 1997 from Mobil, out of annual budgets of
$55 million and $90 million respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Tukey, executive director of the Fairfax Symphony Orchestra,
said Mobil's donation of $10,000 toward its $1 million annual
budget was vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scheme of things, Mobil has been our largest single
corporate underwriter,'' she said. ``They establish a record that
tells other companies that this is a worthwhile venture. When Mobil
leaves, we will have to show the new folks at the merged company
that the partnership that has been in existence is vital to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Arts groups' fears of lost donations are based on experience.
While not caused by a merger, Exxon's move of its headquarters from
New York to Irving, Texas, eight years ago resulted in a big
geographic shift of its support for the arts, which, like Mobil's,
is considerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were big supporters of the arts in New York City until we
moved here in 1990,'' said Edward Ahnert, president of the Exxon
Education Foundation, from his office in Irving. ``In 1990 we began
a measured program to reduce our support of the community
organizations there.''
</P>
<P>
   The donations instead were largely transferred to the
Dallas-Fort Worth area. ``It is normal for companies to give more
in communities where they have a work force,'' Ahnert said.
</P>
<P>
   According to its report for 1997, Exxon gave more than $2.6
million to arts organizations. Of that, more than $1.3 million went
to groups in Texas in donations of $5,000 or more. In addition,
Exxon gave $832,858 to match employees' cultural donations and
$156,945 in gifts of less than $5,000 each, mostly in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years we have drawn back almost all of our giving in
New York,'' Ahnert said. In 1997 Exxon gave $100,720 to the Houston
Grand Opera and $65,000 to the Dallas Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior is not exceptional, said Ms. Kaplan of Giving USA.
When a company's headquarters leave a city, she said, the company
loses its incentive to support organizations in the abandoned city,
and thousands of jobs leave, and with them the donations of the
departed employees.
</P>
<P>
   When Chevron absorbed Gulf in 1984, for example, Gulf's once
ample donations dried up at cultural institutions in its home base,
Pittsburgh. Until the merger, Gulf had sponsored the National
Geographic public television specials, which had been produced by
WQED in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chevron kept up with Gulf's commitments, and that soothed
community feelings,'' said George Hazimanolis, a spokesman for the
station. ``Chevron supported the arts for a few years and then
moved on to something else.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Cleveland faces a similar prospect. A big local employer,
British Petroleum, is acquiring Amoco, but it is moving its
headquarters to Chicago, Amoco's home. The Cleveland Orchestra is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``BP has been very generous in guaranteeing that it will honor
the commitments in Cleveland through the year 2000,'' said Annie
Madonia, the spokeswoman for the orchestra. ``It's hard to tell how
successful we'll be. It's a difficult position to be in.`
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum now gives the Cleveland Orchestra $100,000 a
year. ``We hope the company will continue to be a good corporate
citizen,'' Ms. Madonia said.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations sometimes continue to support programs in the
former home bases of companies they have absorbed. In a $72 billion
merger of telephone companies, SBC Communications, which is based
in San Antonio, is taking over Ameritech, whose headquarters are in
Chicago. SBC has pledged to maintain Ameritech's presence in
Chicago, including its philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Selim Bingol, SBC's spokesman, said that was what happened when
SBC took over Pacific Bell. In 1996, before the merger, Pacific
Bell donated $7.6 million to nonprofit organizations, he said.
During 1997, when the merger took place, the total rose to $9
million. By the end of last year, under full SBC control, Bingol
said, Pacific Bell donated $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   One big merger in New York that probably will not reduce
corporate donations is the $73 billion deal between Citicorp and
Travelers to form Citigroup. The headquarters of both merged
companies are in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Morris, the Citigroup spokesman, said, ``The level of
giving is not going to be affected by the merger per se, but by
business conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new foundation formed by the merged company would
honor multiyear commitments made by the predecessors, although he
warned that new projects might meet some resistance because
financial-services companies have seen their profits squeezed
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for continued charitable commitments is that the
co-chairmen of the merged company, John Reed, who had been chairman
of Citicorp, and Sanford Weill, who had headed Travelers, bring
separate interests to the newly formed corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's main interest is in the social and behavioral sciences.
Weill is a generous supporter of the medical school of Cornell
University and is probably best known in New York for his support
of the arts, especially Carnegie Hall, where he has been board
chairman since 1991. The two men serve on only one board together,
that of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 another New York merger brought together Chemical Bank
and Chase Manhattan, both of which had been big supporters of the
Museum of Modern Art. ``There has been no impact of the merging
relative to contributions,'' said Liz Addison, the museum's
spokeswoman. In fact, she added, the amount the museum has received
from the merged bank exceeds the amount that the two had given
separately.
</P>
<P>
   Another bank merger raised fears in Philadelphia, where a
carefully worked-out agreement on giving followed the absorption in
1997 of hometown Corestates Financial Corp. by First Union Corp.,
which has its headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. Arts, civil rights
and economic development groups, as well as the city itself,
opposed the merger before government regulators, partly on the
ground that a large corporate donor would be disappearing from the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition was dropped, said Dale Mitchell, executive
director of Delaware Valley Grant Makers, when First Union agreed
to maintain Corestates' previous contributions of $17 million a
year to local groups for five years and to set up a $100 million
foundation whose income provides for future grants.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Mondesire, president of the Philadelphia chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which
had received support from Corestates, said that the merged bank had
kept up the level of donations but that Philadelphia organizations
would have to be diligent because ``the president here answers to
someone in Charlotte.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked, however, whether he thought that Philadelphia
institutions would benefit as much from the bank in the future as
they did in the past, he answered warily. ``I think if we're not
careful, they won't,'' he said. ``You lose contact with the local
people who make decisions.''

   &UR; A COLOR-FILLED CRYSTAL BALL &QL; 
 &LR;  If President Clinton has to appear before the Senate this month,
Leatrice Eiseman says he should wear navy blue. ``Blue is the color
of credibility, constancy and truth, the color most Americans
associate with dependability and loyalty,'' said Ms. Eiseman, a
color psychology expert.
</P>
<P>
   The president should avoid a red or a red-purple tie, she
warned, as ``these colors speak of sensuality.''
</P>
<P>
   As executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, in
Moonachie, N.J., Ms. Eiseman researches the associations consumers
make with colors and predicts their seasonal selling power. She was
one of the first to say that gray would be the best-selling color
last fall (it was), pegging it as ``the logical, nonthreatening
shift away from black.''
</P>
<P>
   She predicts that pink will be the big hit for spring because it
taps into a national feeling of optimism. ``Pink not only makes you
feel good, it makes you feel better,'' she said. ``Pink soothes.
It's nurturing. It has a softening touch. Our studies show that men
have far less objection to wearing pink and being surrounded by
pink than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first year of the next century, Ms. Eiseman picks blue _
specifically, a sky-blue color she calls (what else?) millennium
blue _ as the winner. ``Blue brings up feelings of the universe,
and it makes the unknown a little less frightening,'' she said.
``The sky, which is a presence in our daily lives, is always there.
That's the dependability factor of blue. The earth can shake under
our feet, but so far the sky has not fallen.''

   &UR; SURFING FOR NORMA KAMALI &QL; 
 &LR;  If you were surfing the Internet Monday, you might have read this
exchange on the Norma Kamali Web site.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Yumarv: &LR;  ``How long will the fall sale be on? Is it 40 percent
off on  &UR; all &LR;  merchandise?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Norma Kamali: &LR;  ``Thank you for your inquiry regarding our fall
sale. Yes, it is 40 percent off on all fall merchandise. As you
know, sale merchandise is final sale. Please e-mail us your
telephone number so a personal shopper can assist you in making the
best selection for size and fit.'' (By the way, the sale is still
on.)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that was Ms. Kamali herself typing in the response. Her
site (www.omo-norma-kamali.com) has been up for more than four
years, but the designer began responding directly to consumers
yesterday. She went on to mention her first sample sale in five
years (Jan. 9 to 16).
</P>
<P>
   Like other retailers going after the estimated $5 billion online
market, Ms. Kamali says holiday sales from her Web site far
exceeded expectations: her 1998 online sales were 50 percent over
1997's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really, really was the first Christmas with so much
activity, so much curiosity,'' she said. Ms. Kamali likens e-mail
and online chat to virtual R&AMP;D. ``It's like an elaborate market
study direct to the designer without all the research,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DESIGNS TO HELP BATTLE BREAST CANCER &QL; 
 &LR;  NEW YORK _ Isaac Mizrahi's latest design since closing his
business last October is also his smallest. It's a twin sweater set
with matching scarf, a tweed skirt and jeweled ballet slippers he
created for a 21-inch-high Mme. Alexander Cissy doll.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be among 20 designer-outfitted dolls to be auctioned
in September at a fund-raiser for the Council of Fashion Designers
of America Foundation's Fashion Targets Breast Cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The designers, who dressed the dolls in a joint project with the
Alexander Doll Company, will have their first looks at one
another's creations on Jan. 27, when they meet for a cocktail
reception at the company's factory, in Harlem. Fern Mallis, the
council's executive director, who has already had a look, said she
was also impressed with the designers' deftness with the dolls'
hair and makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The Cissy dolls have clothes that range from Diane Von
Furstenberg's signature wrap dress under a long pink mink coat to
James Purcell's ball gown printed with targets that match the
Fashion Targets Breast Cancerlogo pin, which the doll is holding.
All will be offered to buyers at the annual Toy Fair in February,
and the 10 most popular will be manufactured to sell to collectors
for about $450 each. Gale Jarvis, president of the company, said
that all proceeds from the auction of the originals would go to the
breast cancer campaign. She added that at least 10 percent of the
wholesale price would go to the fund when the dolls reach stores in
August.

 &HT;    Falcons' Whitfield is all business
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bob Whitfield kicked back the other day and put his
feet up while sitting in his Atlanta recording studio. As he waxed
philosophical on his dual careers as the Falcons' left tackle and
as an executive in the music business, it is clear that the two
jobs don't match.
</P>
<P>
   But little about the 6-foot-5, 318-pounder seems to make sense.
</P>
<P>
   The former All-American from Stanford has marched to a different
tune since before Atlanta made him the No. 8 choice of the first
round of the 1992 draft.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Whitfield was voted as a first alternate to the Pro
Bowl and has played a big role in helping running back Jamal
Anderson rush for a franchise-record 1,846 yards on an NFL-record
410 carries.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitfield, 27, never has been voted to the Pro Bowl, despite
talent widely considered sufficient enough to make it on a
consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Whitfield, an intelligent man with a quick if peculiar
wit, has an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be totally in tune, or I can be lackadaisical and out of
it,'' he said. ``I can shut down the best, or get beat by the
worst. Some (game) days, you just wake up sharper. You hear things,
and see things _ driving to the stadium, everything is just
sharper.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can wake up some days, and it's just like, 'I do not
want to do this. I'm ready to retire.' I'll be at the stadium, and
I feel like, 'I do not want to play this game; I hope that dude
across from me does not play hard.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Lester Archambeau was a senior at Stanford when
Whitfield arrived as a big and raw prospect out of Carson, Calif.
He doesn't understand his teammate any better now.
</P>
<P>
   ``What parts of Bob are normal?'' Archambeau wondered. ``He's a
big and talented guy . . . with a different sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield's role at his Patchwerk Recordings studio near the
Georgia Tech campus is more consistent and well defined.
</P>
<P>
   After starting the business five years ago, in part to help a
childhood friend who wanted to start making albums, he poured his
heart into the business, as much or more than he did football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to drive downtown after practice every day . . . stay
there 'til midnight and drive home and go to practice the next
day,'' he said. ``That was too much stress, too much anxiety. It's
like (defensive end) Chuck Smith said _ it wasn't paying my bills
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   So Whitfield stopped going in '96, except for Tuesdays, the
Falcons' off day.
</P>
<P>
   Business has improved, not so much because he's not around but
because the 3,500-square-foot studio with 48-track recording
capabilities has become a little better known. Some steady clients
over the last few years have been ``Usher,'' ``TLC,'' ``OutKast''
and ``ATLiens,'' all of whom have made recordings that have sold at
least 500,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Plaques on the purple walls stand as proof.
</P>
<P>
   His childhood friend, Curtis Daniel, runs the studio, and Norman
Kerr, a friend from Stanford, runs the music end of the business.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that 1998 will end up being the first year the
studio makes a profit, but even if it doesn't, Whitfield loves his
hobby.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, he got involved in some production work, but that
required patience. Bob Whitfield doesn't always have a lot of
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to be the producer. Hey, I played piano, drums and
trumpet,'' he said. ``It was more fatigue, more stress. I used to
sleep on the couch some nights. It was losing money, but I didn't
count it as a loss. I counted it as an experience. If it's
something you want to do . . . you can take setbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting the studio so his friend, rap artist Ras Kazz,
could get a jump start on his profession, Whitfield took it
seriously for a while. Upon realizing his skills were better suited
for football, he stepped back.
</P>
<P>
   The place still has his unique flair, however.
</P>
<P>
   The decor is generally purple and black. There is a red
billiards table. A soda machine offers the usual, plus Bud Light. A
candy and chips machine offers the usual, plus Phillie Blunt
cigars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a little something for everybody,'' he said, a big
grin creasing his face. ``It's fun to be here, but it's not my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Football is much of Whitfield's life, although the single father
spends a lot of time with daughter LaNiece, 8, and sons Kodi, 4,
and Kairo, 2.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield, who has played the game with more purpose than usual
this year, said part of the reason is because the team's success is
a motivating factor.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start playing football until ninth grade. I was too
big to play Pop Warner,'' he said. ``Sports were never big for me.
I was always a straight-A student.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started playing, I was weak as hell. I was a . . .
nerd. I'd just go to school, do my homework, run the streets a
little bit. I wasn't the athletic type. I was never honed to be a
football player. I would be bored if I was.''
</P>
<P>
   After a bad game, don't even think of asking Whitfield what went
wrong. He's likely to start rambling, saying that he forgets
things. Even teammates have a hard time talking seriously about
Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bob has always had the talent, but he's just getting
more recognition this year because of the offensive numbers we're
putting up,'' said Anderson, referring to an offense that scored a
franchise-record 442 points and finished No. 7 overall in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``His timing is incredible. He knows when to break the tension
with a joke or something. He's not a real talkative guy in the
huddle, but then again, when you just look at his face, you laugh.
He's the ugliest guy on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield is by no means alone in helping pave the way for
Anderson's big season, as a young offensive line that drew a lot of
criticism early in the year has matured faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
   But he's the anchor of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Now the questions are whether he can keep it going and for how
long.
</P>
<P>
   He has two years left on a four-year, $18.5 million contract
that included a $6.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play 10 more years if I can get it worked out where I
don't have to do no doubles (two-a-day practices) in training
camp,'' he said. ``They (stink), man. I don't need that (stuff).''
</P>
<P>
   There he goes again, marching to a different tune.

FIGHTING FLARES IN SEPARATIST INDONESIAN PROVINCE

 BY MARK DODD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ At least nine people were killed, more than
20 injured and scores arrested over the weekend in Indonesia after
a crackdown by government forces in a province that has been a
center of separatist violence.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters and battalion-strength reinforcements have been sent
to Aceh province in northern Sumatra, the scene of the clashes, a
senior military commander said.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said the violence in the area was the most
serious since August, when the military promised local residents
that it would withdraw its forces. That agreement seems
increasingly unlikely to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   A senior army commander based at Lhokseumawe, the industrial
town that is the site of the most recent violence, said by
telephone that police and army reinforcements had secured the town
and restored order, although the situation remained tense.
</P>
<P>
   Lhokseumawe is almost 1,000 miles northwest of this capital, on
the northern tip of Sumatra, Indonesia's largest island.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are nine dead, all civilians,'' the East Aceh military
commander, Col. Johnny Wahab, said.
</P>
<P>
   Wahab said security forces opened fire on Sunday after 3,000
separatist supporters had rioted and looted government buildings.
During the riot, mobs set fire to four police stations, a district
chief's office, an immigration office and a logistics warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   That violence was set off by a military raid on Saturday to try
to capture the leader of the Free Aceh movement, Ahmad Kandang.
Kandang eluded capture. But 132 people were arrested in the
security sweep. Military officials said they had been responding to
two separatist attacks against the military.
</P>
<P>
   Aceh, a staunchly Muslim province, has been a center of
separatist activity since Dutch colonial times. Brutal
counterinsurgency operations mounted by the military in a nine-year
crackdown have inflamed feelings against the army.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has flared in several regions since the resignation in
May of President Suharto, ending 32 years of dictatorial rule.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and residents of Aceh have accused the
military of rape, torture and summary executions. In August, with
the nation under new leadership, the army apologized for abuses and
said that it would withdraw its forces from the province.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most recent crackdown in Aceh began after a separatist
attack on Tuesday in which eight off-duty soldiers were killed
after having been dragged from a bus that the rebels ambushed.
</P>
<P>
   An army spokesman said three recovered bodies bore torture
marks. A search is under way for two marines who are believed to be
alive after having been abducted on Wednesday in an ambush in
northern Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   Wahab said security forces would reassert their authority.
``From where my office is, about one kilometer from the shopping
center, traffic looks normal,'' he said. ``I can't confirm all
shops are open. But it seems life is beginning to get back to
normal. People are still cautious.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TO INTUIT: WHERE'S THE BEEF?
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of personal finance software maker Intuit
was depicted by Microsoft's lead attorney Monday as running a
highly successful company without any valid complaints against the
maker of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   As the government's landmark antitrust case against Microsoft
resumed after a two-week holiday recess, Intuit president and chief
executive officer William Harris conceded that his Quicken product
is used in more than 10.5 million U.S. households, with an 80
percent share of retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft's own financial product, called Money, in second
place, Harris voiced fears on the witness stand that the software
giant would use its Windows monopoly to apply undue leverage
against its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But under John Warden's searing cross-examination, Harris proved
unable to show how Microsoft had failed to play by the rules, even
the loosely defined ones in the fast-paced software industry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Quicken's success, Intuit's small
business-oriented product, known as Quickbooks, has 84 percent of
its market, and its tax preparation software has 80 percent of that
market, Warden noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they monopoly products?'' he boomed at the witness.
``Should Quicken be treated as some common carrier?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that Quicken is not an essential service for
which there is no effective substitute,'' Harris replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you suggesting that the Interstate Commerce Commission be
reconfigured into the National Operating System Commission?''
Warden asked. ``Are you suggesting a National Operating System
Commission should be created?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not proposing any such thing,'' Harris responded.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris scored a point when Warden sought to show that
Microsoft, despite the power of Windows, failed to dominate as a
``portal'' on the Internet _ the site users see first when they
enter the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that he was told by Microsoft's vice president of
personal finance, Lewis Levin, that the company had quickly become
one of the most commonly accessed sites on the Internet ``without
even having tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Levin said that was only the beginning. Harris said
Levin had told him: ``We have a bunch of leveraged assets to get
eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris also said that Compaq, a leading computer maker, came
under pressure from Microsoft to break a deal to display a link to
Quicken on the desktop screen that appears when Compaq machines are
first turned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq was going to abrogate the contract with us,'' Harris
said. ``We complained to them, and they told us that was simply the
way things were.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, after a top-level talk, Compaq agreed to allow both
Intuit's Quicken and Microsoft's Money program to be provided,
Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit did not sue Compaq, Harris added, ``because we felt that
was about all we could get.''

 &HT;    Destiny can defy defeat
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just like that, the Golden Gate Bridge is
sparkling more. The cable cars are climbing higher to the sky.
Really, all you need to know about life here these days is that the
next frown you see when you mention anything involving the 49ers
will be the first.
</P>
<P>
   Still, here is the most striking thing around San Francisco Bay
since the Green Bay Packers were ambushed Sunday at 3Com Park by a
miracle dressed in cardinal and gold: The 49ers don't look so
creaky, so vulnerable, so likely to become an easy stepping stone
for the Falcons to the NFC Championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The Redemption Catch lives, just as it will forever through the
magic of NFL Films and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that play is officially a part of us,''
said 49ers strong safety Tim McDonald, referring to Terrell Owens
surviving his horrors at wide receiver for 121 minutes and 57
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as a packed stadium held its breath with three seconds
left, Owens grabbed Steve Young's 25-yard pass for a 30-27 victory
that hid this organization's many woes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, for the moment. McDonald said, ``There's been so much
negative talk around here about this and that, but we have to stay
positive. It's behind us, but it's just below the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance: There are so many vacancies in high places
throughout the 49ers' complex that you'd think somebody had
unleashed a neutron bomb. The ownership situation is absolutely a
mess. So is the head coaching situation, where Steve Mariucci's job
is shaky despite a 29-9 record overall, including 18-1 at home.
Then again, the 49ers haven't won a road game against a team with a
winning record for nearly 25 months.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the 49ers' secondary is a sieve. Green Bay
receivers spent most of Sunday prospering in wide open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   You can expect more of the same Saturday at the Georgia Dome,
where Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler is likely to spend the
afternoon playing catch with his receivers early and often. That
is, when Jamal Anderson isn't chewing through a 49ers' front seven
that has yet to stop the Packers' Dorsey Levens, either on the
ground or through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the 49ers' pass rush is in such disarray that they've
signed ancient and troubled Charles Haley for the playoffs. This is
presumably because Fred Dean or Hacksaw Reynolds wasn't available.
Wide receiver Jerry Rice is aging by the moment. He didn't make a
catch against the Packers until the final seconds. He fumbled it
away, but the officials showed mercy or incompetence by not making
the call.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with everything just said is that logic has nothing
to do with the 49ers these days. Logic always disappears when the
subject is a team hinting of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very important for us if we were going to go
anywhere,'' said 49ers linebacker Ken Norton, still glowing with
others in their suddenly brighter world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were going to continue the dominance of the league the
way the 49ers have, we had to get over Green Bay,'' Norton said.
``It's kinda similar to how we couldn't beat Dallas for the longest
time. Now that we got that off us, the world is out there for us to
take.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but the 49ers' world begins in Atlanta, where another team
hinting of destiny is expecting its own pixie dust.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TO INTUIT: WHERE'S THE BEEF?
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of personal finance software maker Intuit
was depicted by Microsoft's lead attorney Monday as running a
highly successful company without any valid complaints against the
maker of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   As the government's landmark antitrust case against Microsoft
resumed after a two-week holiday recess, Intuit president and chief
executive officer William Harris conceded that his Quicken product
is used in more than 10.5 million U.S. households, with an 80
percent share of retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft's own financial product, called Money, in second
place, Harris voiced fears on the witness stand that the software
giant would use its Windows monopoly to apply undue leverage
against its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But under John Warden's searing cross-examination, Harris proved
unable to show how Microsoft had failed to play by the rules, even
the loosely defined ones in the fast-paced software industry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Quicken's success, Intuit's small
business-oriented product, known as Quickbooks, has 84 percent of
its market, and its tax preparation software has 80 percent of that
market, Warden noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they monopoly products?'' he boomed at the witness.
``Should Quicken be treated as some common carrier?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that Quicken is not an essential service for
which there is no effective substitute,'' Harris replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you suggesting that the Interstate Commerce Commission be
reconfigured into the National Operating System Commission?''
Warden asked. ``Are you suggesting a National Operating System
Commission should be created?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not proposing any such thing,'' Harris responded.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris scored a point when Warden sought to show that
Microsoft, despite the power of Windows, failed to dominate as a
``portal'' on the Internet _ the site users see first when they
enter the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that he was told by Microsoft's vice president of
personal finance, Lewis Levin, that the company had quickly become
one of the most commonly accessed sites on the Internet ``without
even having tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Levin said that was only the beginning. Harris said
Levin had told him: ``We have a bunch of leveraged assets to get
eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris also said that Compaq, a leading computer maker, came
under pressure from Microsoft to break a deal to display a link to
Quicken on the desktop screen that appears when Compaq machines are
first turned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq was going to abrogate the contract with us,'' Harris
said. ``We complained to them, and they told us that was simply the
way things were.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, after a top-level talk, Compaq agreed to allow both
Intuit's Quicken and Microsoft's Money program to be provided,
Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit did not sue Compaq, Harris added, ``because we felt that
was about all we could get.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these stabs, the Microsoft team contended at the end of
the day that Intuit's boss had failed to make a compelling
antitrust case for the Justice Department and the 19 states joining
it as plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to understand why (Intuit) would have come
forward,'' Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said outside the federal
courthouse. ``Our job is the catch the mud that the government is
throwing at Microsoft,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After Harris completes his testimony, the government will call
its last witness, Franklin Fisher. The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology economist has spent the last several months poring over
data taken from Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., databases that detail
the company's contracts with computer makers and retailers.

ELIZABETH DOLE LEAVES RED CROSS; POSSIBLE WHITE HOUSE BID SEEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``w'' and ``p'' categories.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole stepped down as president of the
American Red Cross Monday, clearing the way for a possible bid for
the Republican presidential nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional ceremony at the ornate 82-year-old Red Cross
headquarters here, Dole only hinted at what her future plans might
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not made definite plans about what I will do next,'' she
told more than 100 Red Cross employees and well-wishers. But she
did say, ``At this important time in our national life, I believe
there may be another way for me to serve our country.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Soon, I will begin considering new paths, and there
are exciting possibilities. I will choose one and pursue it with
all my might.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, 62, the wife of 1996 GOP contender and former Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole, declined to answer questions from the
stage where she made her announcement. But on her way out, she told
reporters that she would give a presidential bid ``serious
consideration, along with other options.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dole adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the
Associated Press that there are plans to form a presidential
exploratory committee within a month. Some associates said Mrs.
Dole did not want to explore any presidential aspirations while
still affiliated with the nonpartisan Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   After her announcement, she won high praise from Republican
political activists. ``If she ran, she would be instantly viable,''
said GOP pollster Frank Luntz. ``Her style and demeanor are exactly
what Americans want at this point in the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   She also drew praise from a senior Clinton administration
official. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said
Mrs. Dole had ``provided outstanding leadership to the American Red
Cross'' in her eight years there. ``She brought intelligence, skill
and integrity to the post and she leaves with my highest respect
and affection.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Hanford Dole grew up in comfortable surroundings in
Salisbury, N.C. As an undergraduate at Duke University, she was May
queen, and her strong academic record won her admission to Harvard
University law school, from which she graduated in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   After serving on the Federal Trade Commission from 1973 to 1979,
she held two Cabinet posts. She was transportation secretary under
President Reagan from 1983 to 1987 and labor secretary under
President Bush in 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the still male-dominated world of politics, she has earned a
reputation for keen analytical and policymaking skills tempered by
a sunny disposition and southern drawl.
</P>
<P>
   She has never held elective office. Her marriage to Bob Dole in
1975 brought her new status as half of one of Washington's most
prominent power couples.
</P>
<P>
   She took a leave from the American Red Cross in 1996 to campaign
for her husband, and at the Republican convention that year in San
Diego, she electrified delegates by walking among them,
TV-talk-show style, and offering a lyrical recitation about ``the
man I love.''
</P>
<P>
   With her final departure from the Red Cross Monday, some
political analysts predicted that she may really be a contender for
the vice presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster, dismissed such talk as idle
speculation. ``This isn't about being vice president,'' DiVall
said. ``This is about making a serious bid for the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   DiVall and Luntz said Mrs. Dole would be able to raise up to $25
million, the amount needed to launch a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz placed her in a league with contenders such as Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., who announced formation of a presidential
exploratory committee last week, and publishing magnate Steve
Forbes, whose vast personal fortune automatically makes him a
credible competitor if he decides to run.
</P>
<P>
   Among potential GOP candidates, Texas Gov. George W. Bush is
widely considered the frontrunner. The field is expected to narrow
somewhat Tuesday as another Republican hopeful, conservative Sen.
John Ashcroft, R-Mo., announces his plans. According to the AP, he
has told at least one backer he is not likely to run.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, whether as a presidential or vice presidential
candidate, would be seen as an asset to Republicans among many
women voters, a majority of whom have preferred Democrats in recent
national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, 51 percent of women interviewed in exit polls
reported voting for a Democrat for the House of Representatives
while 46 preferred a Republican. Among men, 52 percent said they
voted for a Republican and 45 percent, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole has supported the pro-life position on abortion,
something that Democrats could seek to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Cohen, spokeswoman for Emily's List, a political
action committee that raises money for pro-choice women Democrats,
said she sees a possible Dole candidacy as an attempt by
Republicans to emulate the success of women Democrats such as Sens.
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California and Patty Murray
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democratic women have been successful in these high-visibility
races; so it makes sense that a prominent Republican woman would
step forward,'' Cohen said. ``Republican women have not made
significant gains in recent elections. So this may be something
helpful to them.''

   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole stepped down as president of the
American Red Cross Monday, clearing the way for a possible bid for
the Republican presidential nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional ceremony at the ornate 82-year-old Red Cross
headquarters here, Dole only hinted at what her future plans might
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not made definite plans about what I will do next,'' she
told more than 100 Red Cross employees and well-wishers. But she
did say, ``At this important time in our national life, I believe
there may be another way for me to serve our country.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Soon, I will begin considering new paths, and there
are exciting possibilities. I will choose one and pursue it with
all my might.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, 62, the wife of 1996 GOP contender and former Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole, declined to answer questions from the
stage where she made her announcement. But on her way out, she told
reporters that she would give a presidential bid ``serious
consideration, along with other options.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dole adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the
Associated Press that there are plans to form a presidential
exploratory committee within a month. Some associates said Mrs.
Dole did not want to explore any presidential aspirations while
still affiliated with the nonpartisan Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   After her announcement, she won high praise from Republican
political activists. ``If she ran, she would be instantly viable,''
said GOP pollster Frank Luntz. ``Her style and demeanor are exactly
what Americans want at this point in the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   She also drew praise from a senior Clinton administration
official. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said
Mrs. Dole had ``provided outstanding leadership to the American Red
Cross'' in her eight years there. ``She brought intelligence, skill
and integrity to the post and she leaves with my highest respect
and affection.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Hanford Dole grew up in comfortable surroundings in
Salisbury, N.C. As an undergraduate at Duke University, she was May
queen, and her strong academic record won her admission to Harvard
University law school, from which she graduated in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   After serving on the Federal Trade Commission from 1973 to 1979,
she held two Cabinet posts. She was transportation secretary under
President Reagan from 1983 to 1987 and labor secretary under
President Bush in 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the still male-dominated world of politics, she has earned a
reputation for keen analytical and policymaking skills tempered by
a sunny disposition and southern drawl.
</P>
<P>
   She has never held elective office. Her marriage to Bob Dole in
1975 brought her new status as half of one of Washington's most
prominent power couples.
</P>
<P>
   She took a leave from the American Red Cross in 1996 to campaign
for her husband, and at the Republican convention that year in San
Diego, she electrified delegates by walking among them,
TV-talk-show style, and offering a lyrical recitation about ``the
man I love.''
</P>
<P>
   With her final departure from the Red Cross Monday, some
political analysts predicted that she may really be a contender for
the vice presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster, dismissed such talk as idle
speculation. ``This isn't about being vice president,'' DiVall
said. ``This is about making a serious bid for the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   DiVall and Luntz said Mrs. Dole would be able to raise up to $25
million, the amount needed to launch a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz placed her in a league with contenders such as Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., who announced formation of a presidential
exploratory committee last week, and publishing magnate Steve
Forbes, whose vast personal fortune automatically makes him a
credible competitor if he decides to run.
</P>
<P>
   Among potential GOP candidates, Texas Gov. George W. Bush is
widely considered the frontrunner. The field is expected to narrow
somewhat Tuesday as another Republican hopeful, conservative Sen.
John Ashcroft, R-Mo., announces his plans. According to the AP, he
has told at least one backer he is not likely to run.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, whether as a presidential or vice presidential
candidate, would be seen as an asset to Republicans among many
women voters, a majority of whom have preferred Democrats in recent
national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, 51 percent of women interviewed in exit polls
reported voting for a Democrat for the House of Representatives
while 46 preferred a Republican. Among men, 52 percent said they
voted for a Republican and 45 percent, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole has supported the pro-life position on abortion,
something that Democrats could seek to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Cohen, spokeswoman for Emily's List, a political
action committee that raises money for pro-choice women Democrats,
said she sees a possible Dole candidacy as an attempt by
Republicans to emulate the success of women Democrats such as Sens.
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California and Patty Murray
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democratic women have been successful in these high-visibility
races; so it makes sense that a prominent Republican woman would
step forward,'' Cohen said. ``Republican women have not made
significant gains in recent elections. So this may be something
helpful to them.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a neat trick, and between Rose Marie Bravo and
Roberto Menichetti, they seem to have pulled it off. They took a
moldering old British clothing company called Burberrys, known
mainly for its plaid umbrellas and raincoat linings, altered the
name to Burberry and gave it a spiffy new look without destroying
its essential character.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bravo, the chief executive, and Menichetti, the design
director, accomplished the feat by looking at the 150-year history
of Burberry and updating the best of its attributes into a
thoroughly modern line of women's clothing and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The trench coats, the plaid, the innovative fabrics _ they're
all there, but reinvented for a new age. The trench coat has been
streamlined, stripped of extraneous epaulets and tabs. The plaid
(which the British call a check, reserving ``plaid'' for tartans)
has come out from under wraps to appear on skirts and dresses. New
ways with materials include coating canvas with voile and
distressing leather with perfume. But there has also been a return
to gabardine, the fabric that Thomas Burberry, who founded the
company in 1847, had specially woven for the durable coats worn by
sportsmen and the military.
</P>
<P>
   The first collection of the new Burberry, for spring of this
year, was quietly introduced last September in the company's London
showroom. Although it wasn't shown on the runway with all the
hoopla that entails, the line took the fashion world by storm. Many
fashion magazines borrowed pieces to photograph, and retailers all
over the world bought the collection.
</P>
<P>
   In stores where once just a smattering of raincoats could be
found, there are now motorcycle jackets and trench coats in buttery
soft leather, jersey T-shirts and hip-slung skirts that bare the
midriff, motocross pants of stretch canvas with insets of leather,
ankle-length kilts without pleats, and plaid dresses of Irish linen
loomed on antique machines. Colors are mainly cool neutrals, with
touches of sky blue, mauve and a yellow inspired by a pair of the
Duke of Windsor's trousers.
</P>
<P>
   The first styles are now arriving in Burberry's stores, in
Bergdorf Goodman in New York, Jeffrey in Atlanta, Louis of Boston,
Joseph and Harrods in London, Colette in Paris, Joyce in Hong Kong
and Taiwan, Trois Pommes in Geneva and Zurich, and Club 21 in
Singapore. Barneys New York started selling the clothes last week
in its Madison Avenue and Beverly Hills stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a big commitment,'' said Judy Collinson, an executive
vice president of Barneys. ``Only 15 percent of the delivery is in
now, and the leather coats are already selling. The line has two
things we always love: beautiful, modern, amazing fabrics and the
old English sports tradition. The marriage of the two things has
been done beautifully. There's a lightheartedness to it, but the
quality is definitely there. We were so excited when we saw it in
London. It was something new and exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Boitano, the executive vice president of Bergdorf
Goodman, called the line ``very sophisticated, in its color palette
and styling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clean sportswear, with a bit of a twist, but still
keeping the Burberry concept,'' he said. ``It's very item-driven,
and that's very much how our customer shops these days.''
</P>
<P>
   The words of praise are music to Ms. Bravo's ears. Since she
left the presidency of Saks Fifth Avenue in October 1997 to
reinvent Burberry, she has hired designers, found new factories in
Italy, eliminated inappropriate licenses and set up a new band of
distributors, dropping those that were channeling goods into
discount stores in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning, just the DNA of the new
Burberry,'' she said last week in the women's department of the
Burberry store at 9 East 57th St. The first shipment of spring
clothes was hanging on racks, and nearby the new handbags and shoes
were on display.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Menichetti, the new Burberry team includes Eugenia
Ulasewicz, as president of retail and wholesale operations in the
United States; Michele Smith, as senior vice president for women's
wear; Robin Marino, as senior vice president for accessories, and
J. Stanley Tucker, as senior vice president for men's wear.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker is working on the men's-wear licenses, changing factories
to upgrade the line of suits and coats and adding more luxurious
fabrics. Meanwhile, Menichetti is designing the signature men's
collection, which will be made in Italy; it will be introduced next
July for the spring 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bravo decided to concentrate on the women's wear first, she
said, because it had no fashion image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burberry had a masculine image,'' she said. ``The women's was
anonymous. We felt we could make a big statement in the women's
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very fortunate in that Burberry has such a reputation
globally,'' she added. ``When you think of all the designers and
brands working so hard to build world recognition, and the Burberry
check is as recognizable as the Coca-Cola bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped the design staff from tinkering with the
classic plaid, making it bigger on certain fabrics and changing the
background color slightly. There are even two tone-on-tone plaids,
in beige and in dark blue, used so far only for handbags. There are
also sleek new leather shoulder bags that are molded to follow the
curve of the hips.
</P>
<P>
   The trench coat has been reinterpreted as a double-layered
dress, and the pleatless kilt is fashioned from two pieces that
wrap around the hips. There are knee-length and ankle-length
skirts, and blazers with a feminine cut.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Menichetti, who worked on Jil Sander's men's wear line for four
years, comes from a family of Italian fabric and clothing
manufacturers. When he went to Burberry last year, he immediately
began to build on its tradition of marrying fashion and function.
He worked closely with Italian mills to develop special fabrics,
because like Thomas Burberry, he believes that everything begins
with the fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that he is Italian and Ms. Bravo is American,
they are committed to the Britishness of Burberry. ``When Roberto
and I first talked,'' Ms. Bravo said, ``he instantly understood
that the man of a certain taste, whether in Italy or Japan or
wherever, always had something by Burberry. We felt we could latch
on to that and go into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   The path to the new Burberry hasn't been totally smooth. The
company's profits nose-dived 90 percent for the six months ending
last Sept. 30, mostly because of the economic problems in Asia,
which had been Burberry's biggest market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debacle in Asia is complicated, of course,'' Ms. Bravo
said. ``We totally stopped parallel trading, where distributors
sent our products to discount stores. That was a big business, but
over a period of time it was deleterious to the brand. You'd have
products selling at regular price in a store on one side and at a
discounted price on the other side of the street. That detracts
from what we're trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much business was tied up in Asia. That will come back in
time. A lot of London business was from Asian travelers, and the
idea now is not to be so driven by the tourist trade. We want to
gear ourselves to the local audience, wherever our stores are.
Burberry has over 50 stores worldwide. We want to build Burberry
into an international luxury company with a British style and
sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Burberry's parent, Great Universal Stores, is a multifaceted
British company that is also in the mail-order business. Lord
Wolfson of Sunningdale is the chairman of Great Universal, and
Victor Barnett is the chairman of Burberry Ltd. They have both
given their blessings to the changes Ms. Bravo has made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victor and Roberto and I are working together to clean up and
develop the business,'' she said. ``One of our strategies is to
re-establish ourselves in the United States and London and have a
more balanced portfolio around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Bravo is doing is similar to what other old-line
fashion houses have been doing, starting with Karl Lagerfeld at
Chanel and continuing through Tom Ford at Gucci and, more recently,
John Galliano at Dior, Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton and Michael
Kors at Celine.
</P>
<P>
   The next step for Burberry is to put the women's collection on
the London catwalks during the fall shows next month. Ms. Bravo
said she wasn't sure Burberry was ready to face the critics last
season. Now she is.

EUROPEANS GET INTO THE EURO-SWING OF THINGS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Euro-phoria'' struck European financial markets Monday as
investors gave a vote of confidence to a single currency during the
euro's trading debut on stock and currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the arrival of the economic and monetary union of
11 countries, stock markets on the continent rallied as investors
leaped to benefit from gains expected to flow from a stronger, more
competitive Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Italy and Spain each rose more than 6 percent. Germany's
blue-chip Xetra DAX rose 5.7 percent, hitting a four-month high.
</P>
<P>
   In currency markets, the euro had a slow but solid first day of
trading, strengthening slightly against the world's dominant
currency, the US dollar, and holding its own against the Japanese
yen.
</P>
<P>
   European Commission President Jacques Santer expressed
confidence that the euro, representing an economic bloc nearly as
big as the United States, would act as a counterweight on world
currency markets between the dollar and the yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of our main goals,'' Santer said. ``The single
currency will be a credible currency accepted by international
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, evidence of the euro's power was suggested by lackluster
action on London's stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The FTSE-100 index was virtually flat Monday, and investors read
it as a message that countries, including the United Kingdom, that
declined to participate in the euro would be left behind. Britain,
one of Europe's biggest economies, has adamantly resisted political
pressures both inside and out to join the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's caution has merit. There is no assurance that early
euphoria surrounding the euro can continue to sustain markets.
Economists predict Europe's growth prospects are expected to slow
in 1999 because of turmoil in Asia and Russia. Certainly, the
long-term impact on 11 different countries of such an unprecedented
conversion of monetary systems is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   But markets bustled Monday with the prospects of integration of
a continent that had been ravaged by two world wars. ``I know the
importance of this currency. I know that it will make Europe move
forward,'' German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   All financial trades and noncash transactions are now being
conducted in euros. The currencies of the 11 unified countries _
Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal _ are fixed
against the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors pushed up demand for stocks as they set
about buying shares of companies for index funds that track new
indexes based on companies in the 11 member countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retail investors in Europe aren't as accustomed to equity
investments as we are in the US. They tend to prefer index'' funds
over stock-picking funds, said Jonathan Francis, head of global
strategy for Putnam Investments in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The single currency makes it much easier for investors to buy
and sell securities all over Europe without worry about the complex
conversions among the lira, the deutsche mark, the franc, and other
currencies _ and without the currency risks.
</P>
<P>
   The new Dow Jones Euro Stoxx index based on 50 companies in the
participating countries rose 6 percent, nearly double the 3.13
percent return to the Bloomberg Europe 500 index that tracks all of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest showings were in Italy and Spain: Stocks rose 6.44
percent and 6.21 percent, respectively. Germany and France, which
most forcefully pushed for a euro, had increases of 5.7 percent and
5.2 percent, respectively. Austria gained less than 1 percent and
Ireland gained 1.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ``A very, very good day,'' said David Potts, a European
fund manager for London money manager Guinness Flight.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the significance of 11 industrial nations abolishing
their individual currencies, Potts concluded at the end of a day of
watching euro-market trades that it is ``beneficial for investors
and companies _ I'm convinced.''
</P>
<P>
   While the euro's value is set against European currencies, its
floats against other world currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The euro opened in Asia at a value of 1.17 dollars, peaked
during trading hours in Europe at just over 1.19, and ended Monday
firmly at 1.18 dollars in late-day trading in New York, according
to New York-based Independent Economic Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In trading against the yen, the euro opened at 133.15 yen in
Asia, peaked in Europe at 135.5, and settled back to 132.37 yen in
New York Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although trading was light, the euro had ``an auspicious
beginning,'' said Pierre Ellis, senior international economist for
the New York office of Primark Decision Economics in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good, because it was a business-as-usual day despite
the momentous event. The markets had prepared themselves. They saw
it coming and a lot of work that was done paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro may one day rival the US dollar. But US Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin said what was good for Europe was good for
the United States, though he acknowledged the euro would keep
Washington on its toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro just reemphasizes how important it is that we focus
on our own policies and continue to make the United States a place
where people want to invest their capital by having sound policies
here,'' Rubin told reporters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Experts concede, however, that strong European stock markets
_and economies _ depend most on continued US economic expansion.
``If the US slows down too much, the whole world will slump,'' said
David Lui, manager of the Strong International stock fund in
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions in London and around the world worked
long hours over the weekend to prepare for the euro. Many have set
up dual accounting systems to track transactions in two currencies
until investors get a feel for the value of the new currency and
become familiar with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's trading has largely been dominated by the checking of
systems in an actual trading environment,'' said Timothy Jarrett,
European currency analyst in the London office of Independent
Economic Analysis.

KOBRICK BIDS ADEIU TO CENDANT NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Money manager Frederick R. Kobrick thought he had a
match made in heaven when he joined with Cendant Corp. a year ago
to start a mutual fund firm. Months later, the unusual marriage
threatened to become a horror show, as Cendant, a marketing and
franchising giant, became a synonym for accounting fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Determined, Kobrick stuck it out, figuring that his partner's
marketing muscle and extensive lists of potential fund customers
far outweighed the image problem of cooked books.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick said Monday that he had axed the Cendant name from his
three mutual funds, formerly known as the Kobrick Cendant Funds.
While he won't say if he plans to dump Cendant as a
behind-the-scenes partner, the name change would appear to presage
a move in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting e-mails from the public about Cendant's role
in the funds,'' said Kobrick, who is chief executive and president
of Kobrick Funds. ``I didn't even see that people were thinking
that Cendant was involved in actually running the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsippany, N.J.-based Cendant owns about 70 percent of
Kobrick's fund firm, although most of the stake is in unexercised
options. Kobrick, a top money manager at State Street Research &AMP;
Management Co. in Boston before striking out on his own, built his
partnership with Cendant out of his close friendship with the
company's chief executive, Henry R. Silverman. The relationship
still stands, mostly because Kobrick thinks other Cendant
executives are to blame for the company's woes. Cendant shocked
Wall Street last April with revelations of accounting problems in
its membership division.
</P>
<P>
   With brands including Avis car rentals, hotel chains Howard
Johnson and Ramada, and real estate franchisee Century 21, Cendant
has reams of customer data and considerable marketing reach that
could prove a gold mine in the cutthroat investment business.
Kobrick's idea in teaming with Cendant was that a Ramada client
might eventually buy a Kobrick-run mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant never played a role in running Kobrick's three small
equity funds, which posted outstanding returns in 1998, their first
year of life, including a 50 percent gain by the $34.3 million
Kobrick Capital fund. The funds never owned any Cendant stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Kobrick-Cendant marriage was highly unusual for the fund
industry, where independent money managers typically form alliances
with traditional financial services companies, such as banks or
insurers. Still, some observers aren't sure that dumping the
Cendant name will translate into a sales fillip at Kobrick. Russell
J. Kinnel, equity funds editor at Morningstar Inc., said most
mutual funds were a tough sell in their first year, since they
lacked a performance record to tout.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick may have dumped his partner's name, but he hasn't
forsaken its stock. His $100 million hedge fund, separate from the
mutual funds, doubled its stake in Cendant to 2 percent of assets
last year when the company nose dived on Wall Street. The
reasoning? ``I expect them to have a big year,'' Kobrick said.
``They've got the wind in their back now.''

   HARIS, Iran _ Aziz the Magician pulled into town in his
rattletrap Russian truck and waited for the crowd to gather.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long. There are no theaters in this depressed
town of 14,000 in northwest Iran, no satellite dishes, not even a
full-size soccer field. And so even before Aziz hauled out his
primitive loudspeaker and makeshift bag of tricks, men and boys had
hurried by the dozens to the muddy lot to see what Aziz would do.
</P>
<P>
   The worn sweaters and lined faces composed a scene that could
have come from any moment in the last 50 years. But it is
present-day Iran, where, far from the big cities, people are
grateful for any entertainment they can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not tricks,'' Hafez Ali, a 45-year-old farmer,
confided to a visitor as Aziz produced a thimble to begin a
sleight-of-hand act. ``They're all done scientifically.''
</P>
<P>
   Magicians, strongmen and showmen of their ilk have roamed the
Iranian countryside for centuries, as much a part of rural life as
the weaving of the handmade carpets for which Iran is famous. In
larger towns, much of their appeal has been crowded out by more
modern diversions, or snuffed out by Islamic authorities who frown
on gatherings whose appeal has nothing to do with religion.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, the capital, movies, soccer matches and musical
concerts at government cultural centers have become popular public
spectacles, while affluent residents use illegal satellite dishes
to watch programming more racy than that available on Iranian
television.
</P>
<P>
   For the poor, mass prayer gatherings and government-sponsored
political demonstrations serve as a kind of free entertainment. The
few showmen who do still turn up on city streets tend to be shooed
away by the police or ignored by pedestrians who regard them as
backward.
</P>
<P>
   But in places like Haris, 60 miles from the nearest city,
Tabriz, and surrounded by hardscrabble farmland and barren peaks,
the touring showmen are still a fixture, known by name to just
about everyone and awaited with anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing else to do,'' Jalil Hadarani, a 27-year-old
grocer, said. ``We don't have any fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Many men in Haris are unemployed, and others work only as day
laborers, victims of a collapse in the carpet industry and the
broader troubles of an economy unable to create enough jobs for a
fast-growing population.
</P>
<P>
   As if to reassure his audience, Aziz assured the crowd that he
had performed in the past before thousands of people in one of
Teheran's main public squares. But his gaunt appearance and the
condition of his truck suggested that he spent most of his life on
the road, so much so that local people said he came to Haris no
more than twice a year, even though he hailed from Gharadog, a
village less than 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   By no means was Aziz the only such visitor to Haris, the local
people said. There was Rashid, another magician, whose mention
prompted a brief and inconclusive argument about which of the two
was more talented. Another favorite was Ali Pahlavan, or Ali the
Muscleman, who could tear thick chains, catch heavy weights on his
chest and bear without complaint the burden of a truck driven
slowly over him.
</P>
<P>
   But the young boys in particular expressed a preference for
Aziz, who drew laughs by making a thimble materialize from
someone's crotch, and who had a knack for choosing the most
gullible among them to be his assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aji maji!'' Aziz was proclaiming on this bitterly cold
morning, just as nonsensically as if he were saying
``Abracadabra!''
</P>
<P>
   The thimble vanished into a handkerchief, reappeared as if from
a young boy's ear, and Aziz began another incantation: ``Spit of
the mouth, oil of the cotton and the salt of the just people ...''
</P>
<P>
   The men and boys stamped their feet, blew on their hands and
looked on intently, as if to detect a bit of Aziz's trickery.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crowd of about 200, some had closed their shops for
the occasion; the boys, schoolbooks in hand, had clearly escaped
the classroom. Women and girls were nowhere to be seen, not even in
shapeless chadors, which before and since the Islamic revolution
have in rural Iran been their only acceptable attire. In Haris,
most women still spend their days indoors, bent over their
traditional looms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was evident that no one really had anything better to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Carpet prices have plunged in recent years, so much so that many
families have given up on the traditional Haris carpets and have
begun instead to imitate the more intricate designs from the
regional capital, Tabriz, that fetch a higher return.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even a rug that takes six months to weave typically earns
less than $300. There is no industry in the area, and little
commerce to speak of, so most men in Haris work as farmers, if they
are employed at all, and earn little more than their rugs would
bring.
</P>
<P>
   That has made for many empty pockets, bad news for the local
people and, on this day, bad news for Aziz the Magician.
</P>
<P>
   Once his act was over, everyone knew, he would pass a hat for
cash donations; that was how it had always worked. But he could not
collect if he did not finish, and so eventually, inevitably,
someone began to pick a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show us what's under the tangerine!'' a man in the crowd
taunted as the magician tried to find another way to make the
thimble disappear. His clumsiness detected, Aziz tried to turn a
deaf ear, but as others took up the chant, the audience began to
drift away. Finally, Aziz gave up, packed his bags and fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be back,'' Hadarani, the grocer, predicted after Aziz
and his truck disappeared down the rutted road. ``And when he
comes, everyone will come running again. This isn't the city; we
don't have any other choice.''

CARROLL, SAYING TEAM HAS COME TOGETHER, LOOKS TO THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ With plans to attend the Senior Bowl and the
Scouting Combine, Pete Carroll sounded like a man who assumes he is
going to be coach of the New England Patriots next season.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll addressed the team in a fairly long meeting at Foxboro
Stadium Monday, telling his players he wants them to be in top
shape by making a commitment to the offseason conditioning program.
He also spoke in a press conference on a number of issues,
including the progress of younger players, the solid work he
thought his assistants did, and the personnal evaluations that he,
Bobby Grier, and Andy Wasynczuk will make.
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk, the vice president of business operations, said the
process will take about three weeks. Whether a decision on
Carroll's fate takes that long remains to be seen, but for now he
is trying to leave no doubt that he is the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be of great interest to all of you about my job
status,'' said Carroll. ``All I will say is we're going onward.
We're together. The statements Robert (Kraft) made Monday about
those rumors being `hogwash' I think cleared that up. There's been
a lot of talk, rumor about this and that. It was a problem and a
distraction early last week, though we've learned to overcome
those, so we move on. There's no questions to be answered about
that. We're moving into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``To finish after the first round is not what we had in mind.
What came out of the season was a strong sense of what this team is
all about. When you find the connection of being really tight and
being together, not allowing yourself to be split regardless of
where the influences come from, you accomplish some special things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accomplished some things this year, against some odds, that
we can build from, something to move into the future. The ability
to win big games under adversity, duress, and sometimes against
odds, are things we can take with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special plays by players in backup roles were the kinds of
things we take out of this season. Most of the good stories had to
do with courage and overcoming pain because of their commitment to
their teammates. I'm proud that comes from this team. We added to
the foundation of our teams of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew (Bledsoe) emerged this season. It's quite obvious that
the players are committed to him. If you look at the teams who are
in the playoffs, you see those kinds of players leading their
clubs, and our guy has arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said the Patriots will head into next season with a
strong nucleus, but added, ``We have to have everybody playing
every week.'' He said there's a ``separation between the quality
players and those who fill in. We have to shrink that gap. We have
to plug in a great player here and there, but we need to stay
together and be healthy. When the chambers are filled, we're as
tough as any team you can go against.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are likely to look at free agents this winter,
perhaps at the receiver spot.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll also said the team must deal better with the pressures
of media scrutiny in Boston, calling it a ``force that goes on
outside of your club. You have to stay on track and continue to
stay focused. That comes from maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerning his assistants, one or two of whom will likely be
replaced, he said, ``These guys worked their tails off. They were
faced with difficult situations week in and week out with personnel
and also preparing for the tremendous competition we played
against. I thought they did a tremendous job. I'm very proud of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said the Patriots must work on mistakes like too many
men on the field, procedure penalties, and clock management. On the
first play of Sunday's season-ending playoff loss in Jacksonville,
tight end Rod Rutledge was called for an illegal procedure penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play was on the charts for several days and one guy got
whacked out and he shouldn't have been on the field,'' said
Carroll. ``The wrong guy left the field because the wrong guy was
out there. If it's recurring, you have to get rid of him. If it's
the same guy, you can fix it; if it's a different guy, you have to
look into why it's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll made it a personal goal to develop younger players, an
area in which he thinks he made progess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a philosophy that we need to develop our younger
talent,'' said Carroll. ``I'd match the playing time of our younger
guys against anyone in the league. We were forced to play them and
we brought them along.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the age of free agency, you have to get something out of
your young players because four or five years down the road, you
might not be able to re-sign them. There are teams in the league
who are trying to win with older players. We need a mixture, a
combination of maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the comment today. I thought the group did a very good
job _ Robert (Edwards), Tebucky (Jones), Chris Floyd, Greg Spires,
Rod Rutledge, Tony Simmons started a bunch of games. We got
accustomed to having a rookie starting at wide receiver. Because of
the playing they got this year, it's going to pay off in Year 2 and
3. They're going to make first-time mistakes. They're going to be
on the field at the wrong times, but eventually we'll eliminate
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In evaluating himself, Carroll said, ``I plan to grow and get
better. You get more clearly atuned to what's necessary. It's a
very big job and there are a lot of areas to grow. I'd like to see
my perspective adjusted from one year to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to suggestions that his team is not disciplined,
Carroll said, ``How do you judge discipline? It seems you people
judge by slapping hands with the rulers. Look at George Seifert. I
don't care what label you put on it, he's the winningest coach in
NFL history. But you would never consider him the guy you're
thinking of. He's just the winningest coach who ever lived.''

CARROLL URGES TEAM TO MAINTAIN OFF-SEASON CONDITIONING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Patriots-Carroll)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Bob Kraft said Sunday that he wants Pete
Carroll to be more assertive in the manner in which he handles his
team and his players. Kraft didn't come out and say Carroll
definitely will get that chance with the Patriots, but the coach
seemed to begin the process Monday when he addressed the players,
warning them to be in the ``best shape of their lives'' when they
return next season or risk losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the one player who should have been listening
wasn't there. Terry Glenn was back home in Columbus, Ohio, healing
from a broken ankle, when Carroll spoke of each and every player
making a commitment to the offseason conditioning program under
Johnny Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a big statement about the commitment to the
offseason,'' said Carroll. ``It has to be one that brings us back
in the best shape of these players' lives. If they don't do that,
they've sold out themselves and they've sold out on us. So there'll
be a directed commitment to the offseason than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll obviously felt that the conditioning of the team wasn't
top-shelf, particularly with 16 starters succumbing to injuries
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's done either by incentives or threats,'' said Carroll.
``You can make sense to them or you can threaten them. We tried to
make sense to these guys. Guys have lives that take them away from
this. In that case, we do the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Carroll did get Ben Coates to take part in the
program for the first time, something Bill Parcells never was able
to accomplish. Veterans Bruce Armstrong, Henry Thomas, and Todd
Collins also do not take part, and there was no indication that
will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make them come,'' said Carroll. ``You can't have
mandatory camp at this time in the offseason. We have incentive
programs, we have incentives of maintaining their job position. We
can threaten their jobs and put pressure on them and make them
understand that if they take part in the program under Johnny
Parker, they'll be in great shape and ready for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want more participation than last year, and if we do that,
we'll have as much participation as any team in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's previous team, the San Francisco 49ers, had just
average participation in its offseason program yet has been very
successful year in and year out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were very few veterans, a lot of rookies, and some free
agents who'd show for it,'' recalled Carroll. ``We have veteran
players who took it upon themselves to get ready for the start of
the season. There was a great deal of pride in their individual
conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   No amount of offseason conditioning program can prevent all
injuries, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn reportedly worked out on his own but keeps getting hurt.
Armstrong didn't take part in the Parker program yet made it
through the year healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Wasynczuk, the team's vice president of business
operations, said he has stepped up the workout bonuses in contracts
over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some take advantage of it and some don't,'' said Wasynczuk.
``By doing it, we stress to the player the importance of being in
shape and what our program can mean for them. We understand that
not everyone will take advantage of it, but by inserting a bonus
clause we certainly give them an indication of how serious we are
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk was asked who is responsible for making sure the
players take the workouts seriously. Is it Parker, who has come out
and taken responsibility for the disappointing turnout? Is is
Carroll? Is is Bobby Grier, as the personnel man? Or is it
Wasynczuk, who puts the incentives in the contracts?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's everyone doing their part to stress it,'' said
Wasynczuk.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was more participation under Parcells than
Carroll, Wasynczuk said, ``I can't recall the actual numbers. I
don't think it's far off.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, Coates, and William Roberts were among those who
didn't show up under the Parcells regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get everybody on the same page with this,'' said
Chad Eaton. ``I'm coming back in February and I'll be here the rest
of the time working out. I need that. I need it to get better and
to get to the next level of my game. Guys like Bruce, Ben, and
Henry are proven guys. They come to play every year. But there are
guys, like Terry, who need to be here.''

BROWN RE-ELECTION MAY HINGE ON MUNI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown, just days into a re-election
year, has already drawn a challenge, if not a challenger:
convincing tens of thousands of regular Municipal Railway
passengers that he's not all talk and no action.
</P>
<P>
   Brown won his office in December 1995 by hammering the incumbent
over San Francisco's dysfunctional transit agency and promising the
city a quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, however, Muni's core riders _ about 84,000,
if measured by monthly Fast Pass sales _ still register broad
dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent voters are expressing discontent (with the mayor
in polls), Muni is one of the things they seize on,'' said
Supervisor Michael Yaki, a close Brown ally. ``His election, in
part, is going to be a referendum on how people feel about Muni in
November, rather than how they feel about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   That view _ that Brown is in trouble with a sizable pool of
voters but still has time to improve his standing _ is driving the
mayor's moves at the Municipal Railway.
</P>
<P>
   It explains why Brown is asked the Board of Supervisors on
Tuesday to give final approval to a new round of spending to put an
international management consultant, Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton, in
charge of the Muni Metro system through the fall mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
   It also raises the stakes on his choice of a successor to
departing Muni General Manager Emilio Cruz, who leaves this month
for a private sector job after 2-and-1/2 years at the agency's
helm.
</P>
<P>
   Muni, under Brown's tenure, has been marked by fatter budgets
and increased equipment purchases as well as staggering service
disruptions, safety shortcomings and disciplinary lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, many political observers say Brown's
handling of the agency is unlikely to cost him re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Brown is not the kind of guy who, because of a job
ratings sag, you start to count him out,'' said Examiner pollster
Brad Coker, citing the mayor's 14-year run as speaker of the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there is a consistent frustration among voters with
Muni service. But incumbency is a powerful force in the hands of
someone who knows how to use it to set the agenda,'' said Coker,
president of Maryland-based Mason-Dixon Political Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's political savvy aside, the pollster's survey results are
cause for concern for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In an Examiner poll published a year ago, Brown's rating among
city voters dipped below 50 percent for the first time, with 67
percent expressing dissatisfaction with Muni.
</P>
<P>
   By September, the figure for Muni worsened; 71 percent gave it
an unfavorable rating. And the mayor's grade sank too, with 41
percent saying he is doing a good or excellent job, down from 46
percent nine months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A Chamber of Commerce poll of city voters in May showed how
familiarity with Muni breeds contempt. According to the survey, 63
percent of riders who take Muni once a month or so are satisfied
with it, compared with 52 percent of those who ride weekly and only
35 percent of daily riders.
</P>
<P>
   The low-water mark coincided generally with the so-called Muni
meltdown _ the tumultuous service disruptions the week of Aug. 22
that accompanied the launch of a new metro train-control system.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's response to that cataclysm _ an initiative dubbed the
Muni Recovery Project _ is designed as much to reverse the
political damage as it is to put transit service permanently on
track.
</P>
<P>
   Focused exclusively on the metro _ five subway and streetcar
lines carrying 125,000 weekday passengers, or 18 percent of Muni
riders _ the plan's linchpin is outside management expertise from
Virginia-based consultant Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Under its contract, Booz Allen is supposed to retrain metro
employees to better use the new computer-based Advanced Train
Control System and more quickly address streetcar breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The contract also calls for Booz Allen to increase the number of
streetcars available to Muni each morning by developing better
maintenance at yards housing Muni's new line of Italian-designed
vehicles by Breda Construzione Ferroviarie. A retrofit campaign
aimed at the system's old Boeing-built cars also is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   If Booz Allen meets performance targets by August and keeps to
them through December _ after the city elects a mayor _ the company
qualifies for a 20 percent bonus. It would take the contract's
value from $4.4 million to $5.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yaki, chairman of the supervisors' Transportation Committee,
said the recovery project carries its own political risks for
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one variable in this entire equation is whether Muni can
execute the decisions Booz Allen makes,'' Yaki said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The mayor is rolling the dice on this one. A number
of us are going to put our money down on the mayor and the fact
that the way the project is conceived has the best potential for
offering fast improvements.''

TEXAS NEONATAL ICU WORKING WITH RECORD NUMBERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In a low-lit room he shares with his bigger brother,
baby Ikem, the smallest of the seven surviving octuplets, lies
nearly motionless, wrapped in bunting on a warming bed.
</P>
<P>
   The beeping of a monitor is his lullaby. A Beanie Baby dog and
bear, only slightly smaller than he, sit near his head. Tubes and
lines run from his hands, feet and face.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Ikem moves a tiny right hand near his ear, fingers
clutched in a fist. He opens his eyes for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   For an outsider getting a first glimpse of the baby who weighed
only 16 ounces at birth, the focus inevitably shifts from Ikem's
innate charm and baby-appeal, to the ventilator and IV keeping him
alive. It's a jarring contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this sight is commonplace at the Texas Children's Hospital
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, which every year cares for 900 of the
sickest babies in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Children's Neonatal ICU (or ``nee-cue,'' as staffers refer
to it) served as a backdrop while attention was focused on the
world's first surviving set of octuplets born to Nkem Chukwu and
her husband, Iyke Louis Udobi, on Dec. 8 and Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital is a record-breaker in its own right, and is
playing an increasingly important role as the number of infants
born prematurely with low birth weights continues to climb.
</P>
<P>
   With 120 beds, and plans to add 40 more in the next two years,
it is the largest unit of its kind in the United States. The NICU
can handle 60 babies who are ``level three'' patients, requiring
some sort of breathing assistance, either through mechanical
ventilation or other positive-pressure devices.
</P>
<P>
   The Chukwu babies, one of them born at 25 weeks and the rest
born at 27 weeks (full term is 37 or more weeks), are all level
three patients. They remained in critical but stable condition
Monday. Six of the seven surviving babies _ girls Chidi, Chima,
Ebuka and Echerem, and boys Jioke and Ikem _ are breathing on their
own; the other, baby girl Gorom, is receiving assistance from a
ventilator. Baby Odera died Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Because of intense media interest, and the parents' request for
privacy, the hospital has taken additional security measures,
putting the newborns in isolation rooms along the rear wall of the
unit. A uniformed Houston police officer sits in front of the
rooms. Two hospital security officers patrol the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   A staff of more than 350 doctors, nurses, respiratory
therapists, nutritionists and other experts provide
around-the-clock care. An on-site breast-milk bank serves 100,000
meals a year.
</P>
<P>
   The babies rest in ``pods,'' or groupings of four to six, with
nurses perusing thick binders of medical charts at an island in the
middle. Preemies frequently have heart, lung and intestinal
problems, and several hundred surgeries a year are performed right
there, with doctors bringing a mini-operating room to the pod.
</P>
<P>
   Legions of volunteers sew quilted covers for the incubators and
hold the older babies, providing skin-to-skin contact. A six- or
nine-month stay is not uncommon (one child recently went home after
a yearlong stay), and the volunteers fill in as comfort-givers
while parents are at work or tending to needs at home. Doctors say
the Chukwu babies are likely to remain in the unit until March. The
five surviving sextuplets born to Chris and Christopher Collins of
nearby Kingwood in November will be there at least until February.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard Weisman, chief of neonatology at Texas Children's,
said the last two months of 1998 have been the unit's busiest since
it was established in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   In the period between the births of the Collins sextuplets and
the Chukwu octuplets, the hospital, which rarely turns patients
away, reached its level three capacity and sent three babies to
neonatal units at Hermann Hospital and Ben Taub.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, the unit had 119 babies, 56 of them in level
three. Thirty-five of the babies were the result of multiple
births, according to a hospital spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Fertility drugs, which help countless couples have children,
also contribute to the growing number of multiple births. These
often produce underweight and premature babies.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman said the annual number of twins born has increased by 50
percent over the last 18 years. In 1996, there were more than 6,000
births of triplets or more, nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be a significant part of this increase in very
low birthweights,'' Weisman said.
</P>
<P>
   The murmurs of nurses and doctors and the low-key setting belie
the stress of the place. To keep the unit staffed with six Baylor
College of Medicine faculty members, three ``fellows'' (doctors
learning the neonatology specialty) and eight Baylor medical
residents, Weisman has to hire more than three times that many.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the doctors provide hands-on patient care for an
average of only four months at a stretch. The rest of the year they
spend on research, teaching or administration; Weisman explains
they need time away from the NICU because the job carries a high
burnout rate. Every detail matters, and there are hundreds of
details to be kept track of daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty high pressure cooker. These patients don't have
little problems, they have big problems,'' said Weisman, who spends
only three months out of the year seeing NICU patients. ``The
margin for error is very, very small. You don't have leeway for
making mistakes.''

CLINTON ANNOUNCES $6.5 BILLION HEALTH CARE PROPOSAL 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the holidays over and an impeachment trial
pending, President Clinton returned to work Monday by announcing a
new legislative proposal to help people in need of long-term health
care.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of many likely announcements this month as the
White House prepares its 1999 agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is keeping with his tradition of using January to offer
glimpses of his legislative priorities contained in his State of
the Union address and in his budget proposal for the 2000 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, meanwhile, remained in a quandary over how to
proceed on a trial for Clinton who was impeached by the House in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this new year gives us all a sense of making a fresh
start, a sense of being able to think anew. It should also give us
a sense of rededication,'' Clinton told invited guests who heard
him unveil a five-year, $6.5 billion plan for $1,000 tax credits to
either patients or caregivers providing long-term health care.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day leading up to the Jan. 19 State of the Union
speech, Clinton will make some announcement. He will release his
budget Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposals likely will contrast sharply with the
effort by some Republicans to remove Clinton from office with a
trial in the Senate on charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   The plan announced by Clinton calls for either the patient or a
family caregiver to receive a $1,000 tax credit based on long-term
health care. It would create a national network for family
caregiver support where the helper can access community resources
and include a national education campaign for Medicare
beneficiaries on their long-term care options. It would make the
federal government the largest employer to offer long-term health
care insurance to its employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no single solution to the challenges of care giving,
but together these initiatives represent a powerful first step to
force the kind of challenges we need in our society,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined in the White House's Grand Foyer by first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and several members of Congress. Vice
President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, appeared by satellite to
also trumpet the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why the president is at 70 percent (approval
rating) and the Congress is at 30 percent is that he is the only
one who is not talking about impeachment,'' said Rep. James Moran,
D-Va., who attended the White House announcement on aide for
long-term medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what people care about. This proposal is going to
address that. I think it does have a chance in Congress and I do
think it represents the reason why the president is faring a heck
of a lot better than the Congress is,'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania complemented
Clinton for keeping his eye on legislative priorities. ``I think
that it's very important that we conduct business as usual. I was
with him, as you know, when he went to Israel, and I think he did a
good job there. And he's moving ahead with the business of the
country,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, who attended the White House announcement, also said he
differed from some of his Republican colleagues who have suggested
Clinton postpone his State of the Union address to a joint session
of Congress. ``I think we ought to keep the business of the country
going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton has every
intention of keeping the date for his speech despite calls from
critics that he wait until after the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has important work that he's doing and he looks
forward to presenting it to the country,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also said the daily announcements were not intended to
detract attention from the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all you have to do is go back to the stories you did
this time last year and the year before, and you'll find that we
traditionally use this time to try to generate public support for
some of the ideas that the president will have in his State of the
Union and the budget,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that we could have been smart enough a year ago
December to have worked out a strategy to help deal with the Monica
Lewinsky issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the White House continued to talk privately to
members of the Senate to see how a trial will proceed. A trial,
only the second for a president in the nation's history, could
begin as early as next week. There is a dispute among Republicans
over whether it should be a short hearing or whether it should be
longer and if the Senate should hear from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton's attorneys would be ready to proceed with
a trial as early as Jan. 11.

DIANE SAWYER TO BE CO-ANCHOR OF MORNING SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also moving in `e' category)

   NEW YORK _ In a move that underscored how far the fortunes of
``Good Morning America'' have fallen, and how much that hurts the
fortunes of the ABC television network and its stations, ABC News
on Monday plucked one of its biggest stars, Diane Sawyer, from the
firmament of prime-time news and named her co-anchor of the morning
show, where she will be paired with Charles Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was co-anchor of ``Good Morning America'' for 11 years
until last May, when he left the show to Kevin Newman and Lisa
McRee, who had replaced Joan Lunden a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The new anchor pairing will be interim, but indefinite, said
David Westin, the president of ABC News, and will begin Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sawyer, who will retain her twice-weekly role as co-anchor
for the news magazine ``20/20,'' said she envisioned her morning
role as lasting ``a few months, but we're not trying to put a
number on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The move came after a long slide in the program's ratings. Once
the premier show in morning television, it lost its lead to NBC's
``Today Show'' in 1995. Since then it has declined precipitously in
the Nielsen ratings, losing more than a quarter of its audience in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   The morning shows are the most profitable news programs for ABC
and NBC. Year-end figures are not yet available, but estimates
compiled by Nielsen from network and advertising agency figures
show that for the first half of 1998, ``Today'' earned about $117
million for NBC, a unit of General Electric, while ``Good Morning
America'' earned about $77 million for ABC, a unit of Walt Disney
Co.
</P>
<P>
   But these programs are also vital to each network's owned and
affiliated stations. They split advertising time 50-50 with the
network (while the show costs them almost nothing), and the show
helps lead viewers to the rest of a station's morning programming.
</P>
<P>
   Westin acknowledged that ABC's stations had been pressuring the
network to fix whatever was wrong with ``GMA,'' as it is nicknamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to make a very dramatic move,'' Westin said.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, the ``Today'' show averaged a 5.3 rating, while ``Good
Morning America'' averaged a 3.0 rating, with each rating point
representing 994,000 homes. ``CBS This Morning,'' the other morning
show, averaged a 2.3 rating.
</P>
<P>
   The move was so dramatic that it stunned the pair's ABC News
colleagues, who regard Ms. Sawyer as one of the stars of prime-time
news, and Gibson as having finally escaped from an early-morning
duty at which he had served long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one really needs this in their career right now,''
said Westin. ``But Charlie is deeply committed to the `Good Morning
America' franchise, and Diane is being a very loyal colleague and
stepping up to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sawyer co-hosted the morning show for CBS News in the early
1980s, before joining ``60 Minutes'' and then moving to ABC. She
said she would now cut back on assignments requiring travel, but
otherwise planned ``to be fully part of the `20-20' team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll just have to give me a lot of extra makeup for under
my eyes,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until this fall Ms. Sawyer and Sam Donaldson had co-anchored
their own news magazine, ``Prime Time Live,'' on Wednesday nights.
It was renamed ``20/20'' and joined that franchise, with Friday
nights anchored by Barbara Walters and Hugh Downs and Sunday nights
anchored by Ms. Walters and Ms. Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues who insisted on anonymity pointed out that in the
ego-driven world of prime-time news, Ms. Sawyer had been unhappy
about ``Prime Time Live'' being subsumed into ``20/20,'' which was
long identified with Ms. Walters, and that the ``GMA'' role gives
her a fresh and prominent identity, apart from Ms. Walters. It is
also flattering, they said, to be regarded by top management as the
potential savior of a show that is financially vital to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sawyer excused herself early from Monday's telephone news
conference to catch a plane, and had no further comment. Gibson had
just been named co-anchor, with Connie Chung, of the latest edition
of ``20/20,'' on Monday nights, starting Feb. 1. He said Monday he
would do that but would reduce the number of pieces he reported.
</P>
<P>
   Westin and both anchors said that no extra compensation or
contract revisions had been made to induce the pair to take the new
roles.
</P>
<P>
   But two of Ms. Sawyer's favorite producers were chosen to run
``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Ross, who recently produced Ms. Sawyer's exclusive
interview with Ken Starr, the independent counsel prosecuting
President Clinton, was named executive producer of the show,
replacing Shelley Lewis. And Phyllis McGrady, who had been
executive producer of ``Prime Time Live'' for four years until it
was folded into ``20/20,'' will be the ABC News management
executive supervising the show.
</P>
<P>
   Westin said that ABC News management, which has included him for
20 months, was to blame for the swift decline at ``Good Morning
America,'' and that he did not expect recovery ``overnight.'' He
said his two goals were to restore the program's ``core identity,''
which he said means a warmer, more familylike show, and will groom
contributors for the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Today'' show has been successful at gradually acclimating
its viewers to new talent, both anchors and news readers. Matt
Lauer, who replaced Bryant Gumbel as co-anchor with Katie Couric in
1997, filled in as an anchor for almost one-third of the previous
year's shows before taking over.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Newman came from almost total obscurity as an ABC
News correspondent, and Ms. McRee was a Los Angeles local news
anchor when she replaced Ms. Lunden. Westin said Ms. McRee would
become a correspondent based in Los Angeles, in part because she is
expecting her first child next summer and her husband lives there.
</P>
<P>
   Newman will become a correspondent for ABC News' ``Nightline''
program.

MRS. JESSE VENTURA BECOMES A RELUCTANT FIRST LADY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ There is, of course, the matter of the
silverware.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, frets the wife of the new governor of
Minnesota, ``if there is some queen and king of Sweden who come
here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you address these people? What fork or knife do I pick
up first?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a potential society page scandal, a first lady faux pas of
the first degree, and Terry Ventura knows it.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been part of the baggage as her husband, Jesse ``the
Body'' Ventura, the former professional wrestler, has become the
country's most unlikely political star. Ventura was sworn in as
Minnesota's 37th governor on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Ventura's inauguration, his wife was
busy trying to calm her butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I have just been treading water to make sure I
don't drown for the last two months,'' she said a few days before
the inauguration. To one television interviewer, she said: ``I'll
be the one tripping down the stairs in her formal gown.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that she does not appreciate the fact that her
husband, a man whose early career involved wearing a pink feather
boa and butting heads with Hulk Hogan, managed to upend the
stalwart Republican and Democratic candidates with his raucous
third-party insurgency. It is just that this extraordinary chapter
in her husband's celebrity forces her to become a celebrity, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, our victory turned into this giant Frankenstein
monster rampaging through the village,'' Ms. Ventura said from her
husband's transition office in the basement of the state Capitol.
``My phone is ringing off the hook. They have all these
expectations. They want me to give speeches. Well, the last time I
gave a speech I was at my sister's wedding. I was the maid of honor
and I said: `Congratulations. Have a great life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the down-to-earth Ms. Ventura, 43, who raises horses and
teaches riding on the couple's 32-acre ranch northwest of
Minneapolis, did not want her husband to run for governor at all.
She supported his decision, but largely stayed in the background
during his campaign. Her first reaction on election night was to
crawl into her mother's lap and cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid, a lot, of this loss of personal anonymity _ did
I say that word correctly?'' she said. ``I was afraid of the rabid
press thing, of where if you do make a mistake, my gosh, it's not
your mistake, it's the whole state's mistake. I was so enjoying our
little private life. Now the guys at the feed store want
inauguration party tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but those catty celebrity-watchers have started
to weigh in, even in mild-mannered Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone wrote into a gossip column and said why doesn't she
change her hair and she has too much hair,'' said Ms. Ventura, who
has decided to keep her dark tresses long and natural. ``My mom
said, `Well, do you like your hair?' and I said, `Yes, it keeps me
warm in the wintertime.'''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a farm family from Vernon Center, in the
southern part of the state, Terry Ventura has acknowledged that she
is not without social refinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not stupid,'' she told a Minnesota newspaper. ``I went to
Wendy Ward Charm School at Ward's when I was 13, excuse me. I know
how to walk, how to get in and out of a car without showing the
world everything.''
</P>
<P>
   With a good-natured laugh, she said in the interview from the
transition office that she briefly considered hiring first lady
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I thought to myself, that's not really why people
elected Jesse,'' she said. ``The first thing they always say is
that `You're always so real.' I'm afraid that if I did that my
husband and I might lose that appeal.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Terry Larson was a 19-year-old receptionist when she went to
ladies' night at a bar called the Rusty Nail and fell for the
bouncer, 23-year-old James George Janos. (He hadn't yet changed his
name by picking Ventura off a California map.)
</P>
<P>
   They married a year later and she went on the road with him
during his stint as wrestling's bad boy, a role that sometimes
riled up fans to the point where they would taunt Ms. Ventura and
pelt her with sno-cones. But most of the time, she said, ``I could
fade back into the shadows. That is no longer an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Ms. Ventura has had to put aside many of her
responsibilities on her Jester's Falling Tree Ranch as she prepares
for a role of throwing parties and charity fund-raisers. She will
also supervise a staff of eight at the governor's residence, even
though the first family plans to live there only part time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is being run on my dining room table,'' she said.
``I had to put an extra leaf in the table so that I could have a
typewriter and a phone and files. Every time I walk through that
room, the stress level goes right through my hairline.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ventura also plans to get involved in two policy issues:
farming, because of her background raising horses, and special
education, in part because the Venturas' 15-year-old daughter,
Jade, has a learning disability. The couple's 19-year-old son,
Tyrel, works at a hat store and has hopes of a career directing
films.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura suggested in a recent television interview that the
first lady earn a salary for her work, say $25,000. But Ms. Ventura
said that was his idea, not hers. She doesn't want to overplay the
importance of her role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not here to whisper in my husband's ear every night,''
she said. ``I'm certainly not going to be stomping up and down the
aisles of the Legislature saying you have to change this or that.''

VENTURA TAKES OATH; FACES HUGE CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL _ In his Harley Davidson jacket and matching
sweatpants, John Einfeldt figured he'd fit right in Monday at the
improbable inauguration of former pro wrestler Jesse Ventura as
Minnesota's 38th governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Einfeldt had to sneak in a back door of the museum-like
state Capitol building, past the uniformed guards, past the Navy
honor guard, past the men in suits, past the well-coiffed ladies in
demure dresses and polished pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got all the biker votes, but man, I don't see too many of
us here,'' said Einfeldt, peeking out from behind a massive stone
pillar.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Ventura tries to make the leap from a dimple-chinned
curiousity of national proportions to an effective political
leader, Einfeldt's uncomfortable realization underscored the twin
challenges facing a new governor who has traded biker leathers for
sober business attire.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, political analysts and historians say, Ventura must
appeal to the elites who packed the State House Monday, as well as
the majority of Minnesotans who voted for the two major-party
politicians Ventura defeated as a Reform Party candidate. And yet,
if he goes too far to appease them, he risks alienating people like
Einfeldt, hundreds of whom lined up outside the State House to
shake Ventura's beefy hand after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ventura seemed to recognize the challenge ahead.
After taking the oath of office under a soaring marble dome, the
47-year-old governor pledged to his supporters in his
gravel-and-whiskey voice: ``I'm not changing.'' Then he tried to
wrap his huge arms around the rest of the state, including a Senate
controlled by the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, and a House run by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must put down the partisan party politics and look at the
bigger picture. We must look at the picture of these young people
who have now come on board,'' he said. ``We cannot fail. We must
not fail. Because if we do, we could lose this generation, and we
dare not let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his most specific message in a brief, rambling,
plain-spoken, extemporaneous address that echoed the stump speech
of his man-of-the-people campaign. Beyond his call for unity,
Ventura made no promise more ambitious than to be honest, work hard
and ``do what's right for the people of Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment at least, that was enough to win him a rousing
ovation from his family, friends, former Navy buddies and pal
Arnold Schwarzenegger, with whom he starred in the films
``Predator'' and ``The Running Man.'' How long the honeymoon will
last, however, was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ventura finds himself in a paradox. He ran against the
establishment, and now he is the establishment,'' said Hy Berman,
history professor at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to stick to one's guns and be an effective
governor,'' Berman added.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Boyte, director of the Center for Democracy and
Citizenship at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey Institute of
Public Affairs, said Ventura will be judged in large part on how
well he translates his populist appeal into genuine ``citizen
engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a really funny view of politics. They want to be
involved, but they don't have high hopes,'' Boyte said. He compared
voters' feelings toward Ventura to locals' relationship with the
Minnesota Vikings, a team with the best record in football but
uncertain playoff prospects. ``People love how well they're doing,
but they're not quite true believers yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs the Ventura style is winning converts. A
December poll found 69 percent of Minnesotans thought he was doing
a good or excellent job preparing for the office, and 46 percent
said they would support him if another election were held that day.
That was a notable improvement from the 37 percent Ventura received
in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really want him to do well,'' said US Sen. Paul
Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who attended the inauguration.
``There's an enormous reservoir of good will and good feeling,
which is a Minnesota political ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Ventura has raised eyebrows in recent  &UR; week &LR; s by
signing a six-figure book deal, accepting corporate sponsorships
for his inaugural and considering plans to license an action figure
based on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Even more importantly, he has recently taken a go-slow approach
on a key to his campaign victory: a promise to return to taxpayers
an estimated $3.3 billion state surplus. Such caution drew a muted
protest from the Taxpayers League of Minnesota. Beyond them,
however, it was hard to find anyone Monday who didn't claim to be
among the earliest supporters from mid-1997, when Ventura held
strategy sessions in the barn where his wife Teresa runs a horse
business.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before the swearing-in, Ventura admitted to
``some butterflies'' then stressed he would not bend too far to
please anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too bullheaded to even try. It's going to be the same
Jesse,  &UR; today &LR;  and always,'' he said. When asked to view the day in
wrestling terms, he said, ``I can't. . .I'm looking to the future,
not the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the five other state officials sworn in Monday, Ventura
did not utter his name as part of the oath. It had been a matter of
some local speculation whether he would use Ventura, his stage
name, or his legal name, James Janos.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura once said he would arrive at his inauguration as
governor by helicopter, then rappel down the capitol's ornate dome.
That plan was nixed when his aides feared Ventura would be swept
like a kite by the winter winds and end up impaled on the arm of a
golden maiden perched just below the dome.
</P>
<P>
   And so, he came by Lincoln Town Car.
</P>
<P>
   The change of heart and transport epitomized his evolution and
political education _ from campaigner to governor, from Jesse ``The
Body'' Ventura of his old wrestling life to Jesse ``The Mind''
Ventura in his new role.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the inauguration was nothing like the predictions of
Garry Trudeau, whose ``Doonesbury'' comic strip spent more than a
 &UR; week &LR;  spoofing Ventura with suggestions that it would be ``total
insanity.'' In one strip, a drug-befuddled character whom Trudeau
imagined organizing the festivities pledged: ``Our citizens will be
running buck wild through the streets!''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen Monday, though there was still time for such
revelry: Inaugural events will continue through Jan. 15, when a
come-as-you-are ``People's Celebration'' will take the place of a
traditional inaugural ball.

LEW WASSERMAN: HOLLYWOOD'S ULTIMATE DEALMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVIN BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis McDougal wasn't particularly surprised by the recent
bloodletting at Universal Studios. What goes around comes around,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal is the author of ``The Last Mogul,'' a long, withering
look at the life and times of Lew Wasserman, former head of the
Music Corporation of America and Universal Studios. At the
beginning of December McDougal read about Edgar Bronfman Jr. firing
Universal Studios chairman Frank Biondi Jr. and head of movie
production Casey Silver _ after having given four other top execs
the boot earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal pointed out that 60 years ago Bronfman's grandfather,
Sam _ future head of the Seagram's empire _ was providing liquor to
the Mayfair Casino in Cleveland, which employed a young publicist
named Lew R. Wasserman.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bronfman did in three years time, in spite of the
promises he made when he walked in the door, was clean house,''
said McDougal. ``One of the great ironies of the whole Wasserman
story is that a guy who got his start in a Cleveland night club
ultimately loses the studio he worked so hard to get 60 years later
... to the grandson of the Canadian rum-rummer who supplied that
night club with booze.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman, 85, is left with the title of board chairman emeritus
and an estate _ built across a lifetime of cut-throat dealing _
that's valued at more than $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   He would've traded a lot of that money, said McDougal, for more
of a say in what happened to Universal. But the stock deal
Wasserman cut with Mitsushita of Japan in 1992 left him helpless
when Mitsushita turned around and sold Universal to the liquor
giant, Seagram's, in 1995. And there's some irony in that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz, once seen by Wasserman as successor to the
throne, engineered the Seagram's deal without Wasserman's OK. ``The
quiet necromancer in the Seagram-Matsushita deal turned out to be
Lew's own best student,'' McDougal writes in ``The Last Mogul.''
``Just as Lew might have done in an earlier era, Ovitz put a ready
seller and willing buyer together.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other ironies in the Wasserman story, said McDougal,
including the fact that Wasserman's deal-making skills deteriorated
into a series of movie miscalculations.
</P>
<P>
   He thought ``American Graffiti'' and ``Deer Hunter'' would both
be busts, approved box-office clunkers like ``Skullduggery'' while
the studio was $40 million in the red, and on three separate
occasions turned down a $25,000 request to front the making of
``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman is credited with bailing Robert Mitchum out of jail
after his marijuana arrest, getting Lana Turner back on the screen
after the murder of Johnny Stampanato, and for movies like
``Operation Petticoat,'' Doris Day's series of bedroom farces,
including ``Pillow Talk'' and ``That Touch of Mink,'' and the
steady growth of game-show, simpleton TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio's saving grace throughout the Wasserman years was
television,'' said McDougal. ``They sucked off millions in
television production funds over the three decades Wasserman ran
Universal.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Most motion pictures Universal produced under the
Wasserman-Sid Sheinberg reign were crap.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another irony, said McDougal _ how the Japanese buyout
of Universal coincided with the end of the both the Wasserman era
and the mob's dwindling infuence in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The former Los Angeles Times reporter and author of ``Fatal
Subtraction: How Hollywood Really Does Business,'' makes no bones
about the ties between organized crime and the movie industry in
the years when Wasserman was rising to power at MCA and Universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the high-water point for mob influence was probably
the mid-'40s, although it persisted well into the 1960s,'' said
McDougal. ``Ironically, it didn't die, I don't believe, until the
Japanese invasion of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they were interested in was the bottom line, so payoffs,
bribes, the under-the-table deals and all the other gimmicks that
kept relations cozy between the mob, the Teamsters and the
Hollywood studios were simply unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman had moved from Chicago to Hollywood in 1938 when the
head of MCA, Jules Stein, decided the movie industry was going to
be a fountain of money. Both men, cashing in on the American dream
during prohibition, were weaned on a world spilling over with
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Stein's monopoly control of orchestras during the Big Band era
smacked of mob funding, while Wasserman _ who came to MCA straight
from the Mayfair Casino _ never shook the image that he owed his
Hollywood power to the men with big cigars.
</P>
<P>
   But Wasserman really owed his steady rise to his ability to
wheel and deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lew Wasserman was the genius of the deal,'' he said. ``He
could bring two or more disparate parties together at a conference
table and walk away with a deal everybody was happy with, at least
at the moment. And Lew still got to keep his 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wasserman could in McDougal's words be an ``autocratic
ass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where he screwed up was when he decided to be a filmmaker,
when he started believing his own PR ... that he was, in fact, the
King of Hollywood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman's mantra as an agent was simple, McDougal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep in mind at all times that people are less
important than the deal. Your loyalties first and foremost must
always be to yourself, then to the agency, and only after both
those loyalties have been met, to the client,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wasserman's leadership, the MCA empire grew to be worth
$1.3 billion by 1980.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of money didn't go unnoticed by politicians. Bill
Clinton has visited Wasserman's home more than once and Senator
Dianne Feinstein read a proclamation into the Congressional Record
praising him on his 80th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Dennis McDougal covered Hollywood for more than a decade for
the Los Angeles Times. He has written ``Angel of Darkness,''
``Mother's Day,'' ``In the Best of Families,'' and ``Fatal
Subtraction: How Hollywood Really Does Business.'')

MODERN BRIDES PLACE LEGAL RIGHTS ABOVE TRIBAL TRADITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KWAMBONAMBI, South Africa _ The Zulu bride had intended to
approach the groom's family homestead in her shimmering white
wedding gown, with her pearl-studded headdress and 20-foot-long
train. But her husband's relatives would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding festivities came to a standstill. The singing
stopped. Negotiations began as family members from both sides
milled around on the dusty road outside the groom's family's
property, each side clucking over the other's stubbornness.
Eventually it was decided that Nompumelelo Mkhwanazi, surrounded by
her family, could come as far as the gate in her white dress.
</P>
<P>
   But then she would have to go away again to change into a
traditional beaded skirt and leopard-skin collar before actually
being welcomed by the Mthembus _ who had slaughtered a pale brown
cow for the occasion and carefully divided the meat between the two
families, in Zulu tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that she is theirs,'' joked the bride's uncle, Joe
Mkhwanazi, who had led the bride's negotiating team and agreed to
the compromise. ``They can do what they want with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Across South Africa, in black townships and in rural villages,
tribal marriage ceremonies are under assault, and it is not merely
because young women want the white dresses. They are also seeking
the stronger legal rights that state-sanctioned weddings hold out
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the apartheid government, marriages following local
tradition were widely practiced but not recognized by the state.
They were governed by tribal law, which made wives wards of their
husbands. Once married, a woman could not own property, and if
divorced, she had no claim to any of the couple's assets. Her
husband could take another wife without her consent.
</P>
<P>
   The apartheid government, geared to the needs of whites,
recognized only weddings where couples were required to obtain a
license and to be married by someone the state had authorized.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, however, Parliament passed a law recognizing tribal
marriages and seeking to bring them in line with country's new
Constitution, which guarantees equal rights to women.
</P>
<P>
   The new law allows a wife in a tribal marriage to own property
and gives her half the marital assets in case of divorce, as do
other state-sanctioned marriages. It continues, however, to allow a
husband who has been married only under tribal law to take more
than one wife _ as long as the first wife agrees and there is a
formal inventory of property to protect the first wife's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Many women's rights advocates acknowledge that the law governing
tribal weddings was a compromise. But they contend it was one that
could not be avoided. The rural areas are filled with women in
polygamous marriages _ and outlawing their marriages would have
been more hurtful than helpful, rights experts say. In addition,
they assert that if polygamy was outlawed, many men would refuse to
marry at all.
</P>
<P>
   As Liesl Gerntholtz, legal director of the South African
government's Commission on Gender Equality, put it: ``For many
women in the rural areas, these marriages are their only hope of
access to resources _ housing and water. Yes, it's problematic. But
in some of these areas women are not in the position to negotiate
the kind of relationship they want to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Gerntholtz says that the new laws represent a major
gain and that the property clauses will eventually make an impact.
``Our hope is that now it will be so expensive that polygamy will
eventually die out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, she points out, traditional marriages are on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Since South Africa never recognized them, there are no
statistics on them. But Likhapha Mbatha, a researcher at the
University of Witwatersrand's Center for Applied Legal Studies,
says that even before the new law, black South Africans had
increasingly been mixing their cultural traditions with others and
insisting on a conventional, state-sanctioned ceremony as well.
Part of the impetus was the influence of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Those most likely to mix both were the most urbanized and
educated. In many cases, weddings have become an expensive mix of
both cultures, with aggravation and amusement for everyone
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The nuptials of Ms. Mkhwanazi and Mthokozisi Mthembu began on a
recent Saturday with a ``white wedding'': a Christian ceremony,
which took place in her family's Baptist church near their home in
a township outside Richards Bay on South Africa's east coast.
</P>
<P>
   The service had elements of African tradition, though. For
instance, family elders from both sides of the aisle gave speeches
describing the many virtues of their own families, in a kind of
jovial contest. At one point, the bride's uncle made her stand to
show how sturdily built she was _ ``like an ox,'' he said. The
groom, he pointed out, was just a short man.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, known to their friends and family as Mpume and
Guava, did not argue about having both kinds of wedding ceremonies.
They agreed immediately that both were necessary to satisfy their
respective families. The bride, who lets her outgoing husband do
most of the talking, said demurely that she would not have been
happy with only a traditional wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to feel good,'' she said. ``there are people in
my family who would want to see me in a white dress and even
myself, I liked to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no argument. The groom, a teacher like his wife
and the chairman of the English and history department of a rural
high school, said that he too wanted a legally binding agreement
that protected his wife from tribal customs and superstitions that
could leave her penniless if he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our culture, there is nothing to say that if I die that my
brother can't come and say, `You killed him _ you get nothing,' ''
he said. ``Educated people cannot allow that type of wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   But during his wedding some of his relatives said privately that
they felt the bride had taken advantage of her husband because, by
having a conventional state ceremony as well, he could no longer
legally take any more wives.
</P>
<P>
   The new law has caused plenty of muttering. As a taxi driver
quoted in a Johannesburg paper put it, ``If the men in Parliament
cannot handle their wives, let them not take out their frustrations
and hide their humiliations through these stupid laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that despite the new laws, it may take years before
the status of married women in the rural areas changes much. In
such areas, where chiefs still rule and there is little education,
Parliament's decision will remain largely unenforced. Life for
brides will go on much as it did before _ they will still not have
the right to so much as sell a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen overnight,'' said Mathilda Smith, the
director of LEAP, a nonprofit legal education project. ``Some will
reap the benefits right away. But for some, it will take a whole
generation.''

 KWAMBONAMBI, South Africa: whole generation.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Ms. Mkhwanazi's and Mthembu's first ceremony was pretty
much a standard church wedding with more than 100 guests, the
following day was altogether different. Early in the morning, the
cow was slaughtered in the Mthembu family's cattle pen, where the
men gathered to do the skinning and butchering while the women were
up the hill, cooking over an open fire. Representatives of the
bride's family watched, making sure that they got the right pieces
of meat and singing as the gifts were handed over.
</P>
<P>
   The bride arrived in the afternoon, and after the skirmish over
her attire retired her to change three times behind a blanket her
bridesmaids held up for her. After that her family toured the
Mthembu property with her hope chest, symbolically introducing her
to the ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Then the two families gathered in a wide circle and the men
danced, in Zulu warrior dress. Afterwards, an exchange of presents
began. Many of the groom's family were called forward to accept
presents from the bride _ often blankets and mats that were tried
out on the spot. Those who got gifts sang or danced their thanks.
</P>
<P>
   The last to get gifts was the groom. In a playful skit, designed
to tell him that he could be in trouble if he did not treat the
bride well, he too was given a mat and a blanket. But his blanket
is thrown over his head and the bride's friends quickly descended
on him, beating him with sticks until he could get away.
</P>
<P>
   The bride, 32 and the groom, 33, met when they were still in
high school in 1985 and he decided she would be his wife when they
were both in college, he said. A brother and a close friend began
negotiating a bride price for him in 1994, but the wedding was
delayed because of deaths in the family.
</P>
<P>
   The groom was taken aback at the western custom of proposing to
a woman on bended knee. He said he simply told his future wife he
was going to negotiate for her, and ``she was happy because I had
four or five girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes weddings so expensive is the traditional
bride payments, called lobola. This, too, is under attack these
days as some South African women say it encourages the men to feel
they have bought their wives and therefore can abuse them.
</P>
<P>
   But many surveys have found that there is still wide support for
lobola. Ms. Mkhwanazi and Mthembu both said they believe in it. The
groom said he had gained respect for his wife in having to pay to
marry her. The price is always denoted in cows, though these days
it is often paid in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you talk in terms of cows,'' he said. ``Then you say,
`You know we don't have any cows, so let's talk about money now.'
And then you are talking about how many cheap cows and so on.'' A
typical price for a bride is about 11 cows or nearly $3,000, a sum
that could take the average working South African years to save.
Women are worth more if they are the daughters of chiefs or have
education.
</P>
<P>
   Lobola was once an insurance policy in case the marriage broke
up. The cows were held by the bride's family and multiplied as the
years went by. They would help support her and her children if a
divorce occurred. But these days, when it is often cash that is
paid to the bride's parents, it is usually spent long before any
breakup. Ms. Mkhwanazi's family gave her some of the money to buy
her wedding dress and some gifts for the Mthembu family, but often
this does not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The groom is not finished paying when he has paid the lobola.
There are several more ceremonies, including one at which members
of the bride's family get to ask for gifts such as a new suit, a
leather jacket or a washing machine. During this exchange _ which
fills one of the newly married couple's photo albums _ the groom is
given a sheep or a goat to symbolize his acceptance into the
bride's family.
</P>
<P>
   One picture shows a woolly sheep standing in the middle of the
couple's tidy, modern living room.

PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS BEGIN JOCKEYING FOR POSITION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the dawning of a new millennium is prompting
some frightened souls to seek cover, it has not scared off the
politicians already lining up to be the first president elected in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   With the presidential primaries more than a year away, a gaggle
of Republicans and a handful of Democrats have already indicated or
are strongly hinting they will seek their party's nomination for
the nation's top political job.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering accelerated Monday with announcements or
near-announcements by several serious candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, a former Cabinet member in two Republican
administrations, announced she was stepping down as head of the
American Red Cross to pursue other options, including a possible
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this important time in our national life, I believe there
may be another way for me to serve our country,'' Dole told
colleagues in a packed hall at Red Cross headquarters, just down
the street from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Although she did not make direct mention of any political
aspirations in her 15-minute speech, the wife of 1996 Republican
presidential nominee Bob Dole later told reporters that she would
give ``serious consideration'' to a White House race.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Arizona Sen. John McCain, a former prisoner of war in
Vietnam and maverick lawmaker who championed campaign finance
reform and anti-tobacco legislation, announced he was forming a
committee to explore a presidential bid. McCain is expected to make
his decision in a few weeks, said Howard Opinsky, a San
Antonio-based GOP consultant working for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, a little-known
Republican lawmaker best known for his opposition to abortion, said
he was filing as candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the bell has rung,'' said Republican consultant
Charles Black, who worked on Texas Sen. Phil Gramm's failed
presidential effort in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With no incumbent seeking re-election and no heir apparent on
the Republican side, the 2000 race for the White House is expected
to be highly competitive.
</P>
<P>
   And political experts such as Black say that potential
candidates need to be campaigning early to raise the estimated $20
million necessary to run a credible primary race.
</P>
<P>
   If Dole decides to run, she will likely face an expensive and
tough primary fight with a number of other high-profile
Republicans, including Texas Gov. George W. Bush and the man who
served as vice president to Bush's father, Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Former presidential candidate and wealthy magazine publisher
Steve Forbes, who attracted voters with his flat-tax mantra in
1996, is now actively wooing social conservatives by opposing
abortion and promoting morality.
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran from the 1996 campaign, Lamar Alexander, the
former Tennessee governor and U.S. education secretary, has also
been working Republican primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   And a host of other figures, including conservative activists
Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, commentator Pat Buchanan, and House
Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich of Ohio, have made noises
about jumping into the race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has remained coy about his presidential intentions and has
said he will announce his decision in the spring, toward the end of
the legislative session that begins this month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has been anointed the front-runner by many in the
media, a Dole entry could draw supporters and money from the Texas
governor, particularly among the establishment Republicans to whom
they both appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Bush lavished praise on his potential opponent,
calling Dole a ``really good soul.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she'd be a great candidate, and I think she's a fine
person,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also declined to give more clues as to his thinking about a
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it just about every day, particularly when I get
asked questions about it. But I've got to give an inauguration
speech. I've spent more time on my inaugural address, which I'm
anxious for you to hear,'' Bush told reporters before traveling to
Florida to watch his younger brother, Jeb, inaugurated as governor
there.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer Democrats have juggled the presidential question as
surveys continue to show Vice President Al Gore with formidable
leads in primary match-ups. Gore has avoided being tarnished by the
White House sex scandal that led to Clinton's impeachment and
dodged a potential land mine when Attorney General Janet Reno opted
not to appoint a special prosecutor to look into alleged
fund-raising abuses during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a number of possible challengers have surfaced,
including former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, House Democratic
leader Richard Gephardt, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and
Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the race has barely begun, a number of possible
candidates are already dropping by the wayside. Last month, Sen.
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska said he would not seek the Democratic
nomination and instead would concentrate on his Senate re-election
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a tough Senate re-election race may have scared
off Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., who for months has been wooing
social conservatives with his emphasis on family values and his
condemnation of President Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft has scheduled an announcement Tuesday in his hometown
of Springfield, Mo., but a number of his backers said they believe
he will not run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, a Republican consultant and adviser to Ashcroft,
said the lawmaker's key financial supporters in Missouri were not
keen on him running for president because they feared it might make
it harder for him to retain his Senate seat. The state's popular
Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan has indicated he will challenge
Ashcroft in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition, said
Ashcroft's absence from the race could leave social conservatives
with few palatable choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a healthy chunk of the religious conservative
community that is all dressed up for the prom and doesn't have a
date,'' said Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bauer, the head of the Family Research Council, which has
crusaded against abortion and gay rights, may step in to fill the
void.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a real vacuum in the Republican Party. The
mantle of Ronald Reagan has not been picked up,'' said Bauer, who
added that he will make his decision on a presidential bid by the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The early jockeying is taking place in the unusual context this
year of the Senate trial of Clinton, an historic event that is
expected to draw media attention from almost every other political
activity.
</P>
<P>
   If the trial is prolonged some political observers say it could
further hurt the lesser known candidates who need this time to
establish an identity with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a distraction from the presidential contest is
certainly to the benefit of Governor Bush or other front-runners,''
said Steve Grubbs, the outgoing chairman of the Iowa Republican
Party. ``Candidates with lesser name ID will have to rise above the
din of Washington media chatter. That is hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubbs noted that Bush recently called him to congratulate him
on the birth of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that prolonged Senate trial will make it harder for
Bush and others to avoid weighing in on Clinton's troubles. Bush
has so far not said whether he believes Clinton should be convicted
and ousted from office.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Appell, a Republican consultant, said that if Bush does
not speak out more forcefully on Clinton he ``runs a real risk with
conservative and primary voters.''

SIZE OFTEN AN IMMEASURABLE PROBLEM  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a problem that has countless women grumbling in store
dressing rooms across America and catalog retailers like Eddie
Bauer, L.L. Bean, and Lands' End complaining bitterly about
millions of dollars in merchandise returns.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaotic world of women's clothing sizes, the numbers that
shoppers see on garment tags, from tiny 2 all the way to 20, have
become all but meaningless. Women waste hours trying on clothes
that droop or squeeze, and catalog vendors end up with costly
returns from similarly frustrated mail-order customers.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog companies say the answer to decades of frustration
over finding the right fit is simple: Create new sizing standards
across the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But that is anathema to upscale clothiers such as Donna Karan
and Ellen Tracy, which use ``vanity sizing'' to make shoppers think
they are spending their big bucks on fashionably small-sized
outfits.
</P>
<P>
   High-end designers have learned that it is profitable to flatter
women by offering tiny sizes on big garments. The result is that a
woman might fit into a size 8 from one manufacturer but have to
jump all the way to a 12 from another.
</P>
<P>
   The push to eliminate the decades-old guessing game in women's
apparel is being spurred largely by the fast-growing mail-order and
Internet apparel businesses. Catalog retailers know that accurate
sizing is critical, since women can't try on their merchandise.
More and more catalog pages are devoted to explaining sizes and
measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Some department stores, such as Target, also are pushing for
consistency in sizing among vendors to help their customers.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since 1942, a major study is underway to
measure the size and shape of today's American woman.
</P>
<P>
   This initiative pleases many in the industry who say too many
women are suffering from fitting-room fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the market transitions to a more relevant set of standards,
it will make more obvious those who are not in synch,'' says
Michael Alexin, vice president of design and product development
for Seattle-based Eddie Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-end designers are not eager for any of this. They
have made money on vanity sizing, and that has led to today's
haphazard size labeling.
</P>
<P>
   (The exception to the high-end rule that smaller is better is,
no surprise, in bra sizing. For more expensive bras, size labels
tend to run big.) Ellen Goldsberry, associate professor of
retailing at the University of Arizona in Phoenix, says pricey
designers have learned all too well that many women love to
exclaim, ``I have a wonderful dress! And it's a size 2!'' Burt
Hunton, vice president of Wolf Form Co. in Englewood, N.J., which
makes garment-fitting forms for clothiers, says high-end designers
will never go along willingly with a uniform sizing system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still want to do their own thing. . . . It makes the
woman customer feel better,'' Hunton says.
</P>
<P>
   He says Ellen Tracy sells size 8 clothes with measurements that
other apparel makers sell as a size 12.
</P>
<P>
   While some shoppers may feel flattered and pay for the
privilege, the sizing game infuriates others, who would like to see
women's clothes come with meaningful, consistent measurements -- in
inches -- as men's clothing does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to see measurements on clothes,'' says Meredith
Pooler, 18, after using holiday gift money to buy herself
custom-fit jeans at Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``You never know
with different makers what your size is or what a size small,
medium, or large means.''
</P>
<P>
   But most people in the industry don't think manufacturers will
start displaying actual measurements on garment tags, as is done
for women's clothing in many parts of Europe, any time soon. They
say American women don't want to see their hip measurement on a
tag. And some clothes makers say the standard trio of measurements
(bust, waist, and hips), plus height, are often overly simplistic
predictors of fit.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they are eager for standards, almost everyone in
the industry agrees that there's a need for updated information on
the size of the American woman as we approach the next millennium.
This information will help all clothing manufacturers develop
better-proportioned and better-fitting clothes, regardless of how
sizes are labeled.
</P>
<P>
   The only sizing chart based on actual measurements of American
women dates to 1942, when more than 10,000 military women were
measured at different body points. The US Department of Commerce
used this data to assign size numbers from 2 to 20 to correspond to
different sets of measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, this data is hopelessly outdated. The average
woman then was 5 feet 2 inches and weighed 129 pounds. Today, the
average woman is about 5 feet 4 inches and weighs about 142 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   While makers of mass-produced clothes may have followed these
guidelines in the 1940s, companies later began to realize the shape
and size of the typical American woman were growing. Each company
tinkered with its numbers in its own way.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five decades, women's sizing became increasingly
haphazard.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1994, the American Society for Testing and
Materials, which sets sizing standards in the industry, came out
with new guidelines. They were based on industry practices at the
time, but not on a new set of measurements.
</P>
<P>
   According to the society's chart, which is followed today, more
or less, by catalog vendors and some product lines, a size 10 woman
would measure 36 inches at the bust, 28 at the waist, and 38 1/2 at
the hips. In 1942, a 10 measured 33 1/2, 24 1/2, and 35 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   But many apparel makers are unhappy with the chart, and even the
testing and materials society says it should have updated the
measurements of women.
</P>
<P>
   But an attempt shortly afterward to fund a new measurement study
failed, largely because many manufacturers did not want to help.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged instead is a three-year study, sponsored and funded
by the Society of Automotive Engineers, the Air Force, and some
apparel manufacturers, all of which want updated size figures for
the typical male and female age 18 to 65. The Air Force wants to
make better flight suits, the auto makers better-fitting seats, and
clothes makers better-fitting garments. The study began a year ago
and will measure more than 10,000 people in the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have a database, businesses can begin to cater to a
particular clientele,'' says Jo Ann Pullen, who heads the textiles
committee for the testing and materials society and is a high
school instructor of consumer and health issues in Northfield.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an alternative to standardization: mass
customization. Some companies envision retailers outfitting
dressing rooms with high-tech body scanners that record multiple
body measurements. Garments would then be custom-designed for a
particular body type.
</P>
<P>
   David Bruner, manager of research and development for TC
Squared, a company in Cary, N.C., says the beauty of body scanning
is that women won't have to deal with size numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner acknowledges that a big obstacle to this effort is the
cost. A body scanner sold by his company costs about $100,000, and
so far, he says, he has sold only two.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss is experimenting with a program called ``Original
Spin'' that allows customers such as Meredith Pooler to buy jeans
for $55 that are custom-fitted to their measurements, though for
now that information is obtained with old-fashioned measuring
tapes. The system also allows customers to choose options for
color, fly, and leg opening.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the wave of the future turns out to be standardization
or mass customization, ``the status quo is very difficult for
women,'' says Susan Ashdown, associate professor in the textile
department at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is finally waking up. The whole level of
frustration with clothes shopping has increased.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOW WOMEN GROW BUT STAY THE SAME SIZE  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, clothing manufacturers relied on a US Department of
Commerce chart to put sizes on their clothes. Since then, companies
have departed from that specification and each has gone its own
way. The only updated sizing chart came out in 1994 from the
American Society for Testing and Materials. It attempted to
summarize the typical sizing practices in the industry today,
though many companies deviate wildly from it.

 &HT;    Delta to announce expansion to overseas destinations
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines is expected to announce today what it
calls ``a major expansion'' of international service from
Hartsfield International Airport and New York's Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based carrier handles 80 percent of the traffic at
Hartsifield but faces fierce competition on international routes.
Fred Reid, the company's vice president for marketing who was hired
last summer, is expected to lay out Delta's strategy in the battle
to get a larger share of the overseas travel market.
</P>
<P>
   While the company wouldn't comment on specifics Monday, Samuel
C. Buttrick, an airlines analyst with PaineWebber, said now was an
``inopportune'' time to consider an aggressive international
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``More international capacity is not what the industry needs
right now,'' Buttrick said. ``Margins in all the international
sectors have been under pressure in the past year not only across
the Pacific, where economic pressures have been more publicized,
but in recent quarters revenue trends in Latin America and across
the Atlantic have also deteriorated.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Buttrick said, Delta could plug holes in markets that
have bilateral limitations on new service, including the United
Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's major strategic challenge at Delta has been beefing up
its international alliance network, considered weak compared with
competing pacts such as United's five-way Star Alliance or
American's planned Oneworld team, which will include British
Airways and others.
</P>
<P>
   While Delta has a solid partnership with Swissair and separate
deals with assorted other carriers, it's been jilted by a few
partners in recent years. An immediate goal is broader ties with
Air France.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Delta unveiled its new premium-service section,

over the next eight months. BusinessElite will replace separate
first- and business-class sections on 57 MD-11 and Boeing 767 jets
that fly overseas. It also will be installed in 14 new Boeing 777
widebodies on order.

IRAQ MOVES TOWARD EVICTION OF U.S., BRITISH RELIEF WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq took its first step Monday toward evicting
American and British relief workers, saying their visas would not
be renewed because their safety could not be guaranteed in the face
of public anger over air strikes last month.
</P>
<P>
   In an unsigned diplomatic note delivered to the U.N. office that
coordinates the Iraq ``oil for food'' program here, the Iraqis
repeated their charges, so far not proved and denied in Washington
and London, that the American and British attacks had targeted
``schools, universities, hospitals, grain depots, means of
communication and factories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of anger that besets 22 million Iraqis may find
expression in unfriendliness,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. officials, who say they are studying the note,
delivered by Iraq's representative-designate, Saeed Hassan, also
said the Iraqis have inexplicably not included all Americans in
their ban. Three will apparently be allowed to remain in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Four British experts working on contract to European countries
doing repair and development work for the United Nations may also
remain.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Iraqis seem to have used the decision to expel
British and American citizens in order to move 10 relief officials,
including de-mining experts, out of Kurdish areas in the north,
where standards of living have been improving rapidly. Among the
most successful U.N.-run programs in the Kurdish regions was a
poultry industry, which supplied Baghdad with meat and eggs. It was
run by an American agriculture expert.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ``oil for food'' program, Iraq is permitted to sell up
to $5.2 billion in oil every six months to pay for basic goods like
food and medicine. The program provides Iraqi families with monthly
rations of items like milk, cooking oil and beans. Recently it has
also paid for the purchase of computers and repairs to
energy-producing dams and generators.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, the spokesman, James Rubin, said: ``Any
Iraqi effort to selectively exclude some nationalities from the
staff of the U.N. humanitarian program would contravene the U.N.'s
worldwide policy of nondiscrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin noted that U.N. legal officials were working on a
response. He added that Iraqis had told U.N. officials that the
denial of visas might be ``temporary'' and that the numbers
involved were very small.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad Monday, the government continued its verbal assaults
on Arab leaders who have accused President Saddam Hussein of
provoking the air attacks by refusing to cooperate with weapons
inspectors, who are now all out of the country. Sharp criticisms,
particularly from President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and also from
the Saudi leadership, may have unnerved Hussein, some diplomats
say.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister, said there
was ``a regrettable campaign in the Iraqi press'' against Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi leadership has appeared slightly off balance in trying
to build public opinion in its favor since the air strikes last
month. Because the missile and bomb attacks were so precisely
targeted, however, there seem to have been few civilian casualties,
relief workers and other foreigners in Baghdad say. This has robbed
the government of the opportunity to play on international opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has focused instead on condemning continued American and
British patrolling of ``no flight'' zones in the Kurdish north and
in the southern part of the country populated by Shiite Muslims,
who have rebelled against Baghdad in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In its diplomatic note to the United Nations Monday, the Iraqi
government said the war ``was still under way by virtue of the
maintenance of the no-flight zones imposed by force of arms and
without the authorization of the Security Council.''

740 FIRST TO LOSE WELFARE PAYMENTS IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For the first time in 60 years, the state is no longer
giving cash aid to families with no apparent income but with
children to support, halting payments this week to 740 welfare
recipients _ the first of thousands of families rubbing up against
the new 24-month deadline for families with children older than
two.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the recipients failed to find work or sign up for a job
search, despite having received warnings from the state that their
benefits were about to run out.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, 5,100 families _ each typically consisting of a
single mother with two young children _ became the first to hit the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,800 of those families applied for possible last-minute
extensions, claiming they can't find childcare or have made
good-faith efforts to find jobs. They will continue receiving
benefits until welfare officials decide whether or not to grant
their requests.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 2,300 families have been sent notices they are
about to be taken off the rolls, and as of Monday, 740 of them had
been cut.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the checks have stopped, welfare officials believe,
many parents who dragged their feet will now make serious efforts
to find jobs. Even by taking a minimum-wage job, the officials
said, a parent can easily improve her family's financial situation,
since the monthly welfare grant for a family of three works out to
about $3.26 an hour over a 40-hour week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is able-bodied people should be working,
especially in this economy,'' said Department of Transitional
Assistance spokesman Dick Powers. ``If there were extenuating
circumstances that prevented them from doing so, the extension
process would and will flush them out.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts represent the triumph of a decades-long battle by
conservative legislators to reverse a ``culture of dependency''
that allowed some families to languish on state aid indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the conviction the welfare system had become so
perverted over the years it was trapping generation after
generation of children in poverty, state policymakers embraced a
welfare overhaul plan in 1995 that prods parents to work by placing
an unprecedented time limit on Aid to Families with Dependent
Children.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely, Powers said, some parents of the families dropped
from the rolls already held under-the-table jobs that they did not
report to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraud exists in the world, and fraud exists in welfare,'' he
said. ``There are people who have been working under the table for
part or all of the 24 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who cannot find jobs right away will inevitably turn to
family networks for help, Powers said, but he eschewed speculation
by homeless advocates that many would eventually end up in shelters
and the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare officials plan to gauge the wellbeing of families who
have been cut under the time limit during monthly meetings the
families still must attend with their caseworkers in order to
remain eligible for food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   If the caseworkers sense a family is in distress, or if a family
fails to show up for the monthly meeting, the state Department of
Public Health, under a $2 million agreement with DTA, will send a
nurse or social worker to the family's home to check on the
children and parents, encourage the parents to apply for an
extension if appropriate, and to make them aware of programs, such
as Medicaid and food stamps, they may still qualify for.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Doolin, director of Catholic Charities of Greater Boston,
believes most parents who have been able to get jobs, have already
done so and have already left the rolls before they hit the time
limit. Therefore, he said, those being cut this week are likely to
fall through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that people who have stayed on up to the 12th
hour of the 24th month are the core that have lifestyle,
psychological or family problems that keep them from working, or
that don't have the skills for the job market,'' Doolin said. ``A
great number also don't have of English language.''
</P>
<P>
   Doolin contends these families, after exhausting any available
family networks, will likely end up in a few months in food
pantries and shelters, which he said have already seen demand jump
since the welfare overhaul plan started three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some families, Doolin acknowledged, have resorted to illegal
activities such as prostitution or drug sales to supplement their
welfare grants. But he shuddered at the possibility that
black-market dealings might become the only means of sustenance for
some whose welfare grants have ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that would not be dramatically accelerated,'' he
said. ``But I don't know.''

 &HT;    Barnes puts emphasis on health issues
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Choosing a doctor like choosing a car mechanic.
Funneling tobacco money into health care. Merging separate
departments into a new health superagency.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by these proposals, Roy Barnes already is emerging as an
activist governor on health care issues.
</P>
<P>
   That's a clear departure from his predecessor, Zell Miller. So
after years of government cost-cutting, anticipation is running
high among Georgia's health industry officials, as they await the
1999 session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a governor who is very interested in health issues,
and I think it's exciting,'' says Paul Shanor, executive director
of the Medical Association of Georgia, a powerful physicians'
lobby. ``Frankly, it's an issue that Zell Miller didn't want to
deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   As in previous years, Georgia legislators are likely to tackle
hundreds of bills with health-care implications. They will consider
large and small changes to a system that can be as confusing as it
is costly. And tinkering with one of health care's many gears can
throw another one out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   Health care problems aren't unique to Georgia. Still, the state
is near the bottom of some glaring health statistics, such as
infant mortality and low birth weight babies. Rural hospitals are
spewing red ink. And 1.3 million Georgians have no health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the cost factor. Businesses are paying higher
prices to cover their employees, who in turn face rising insurance
premiums. The problems persist despite a roaring economy. If the
boom starts to fizzle, fixing the health care system becomes even
more troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco settlement
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's health care system, though, may soon get a new
injection of funds _ thanks to the state's recent $4.8 billion
settlement with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The money would come to Georgia over 25 years, with no strings
attached, after a sufficient number of states give final approval
to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Divvying up the money has already provoked debate. Republicans
have their own ideas: the settlement money belongs to taxpayers and
should lead to tax credits, GOP leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes wants the money to go to health. Among his priorities:
Medicaid reimbursement, aid to rural hospitals, medical education,
anti-smoking campaigns and reducing the waiting list for disabled
Medicaid recipients to get services in the home. He's also pushing
early-childhood development programs.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of this debate, of course, depends on when the money
arrives. The first installment could come sometime later this year,
but Barnes thinks substantive tobacco settlement-related
legislation is more likely next session.
</P>
<P>
   Umbrella health agency
</P>
<P>
   Another health-care proposal under consideration is to create a
single department of health. It would merge the following agencies:
the Department of Medical Assistance, which runs Medicaid for 1.2
million low-income residents; the State Health Planning Agency,
which regulates expansions of health-care facilities; the Division
of Public Health; and the State Merit System, which covers state
employees and dependents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we've got health scattered among several
departments,'' Barnes says. A unified agency, he says, can provide
a coordinated health plan for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Mentioned as the leading candidate to head a new department is
Russ Toal, a former Medicaid commissioner who's widely respected in
the health-care industry.
</P>
<P>
   The superagency idea also could combine the buying power of
Medicaid and hundreds of thousands of state employees, to lower the
state's total medical bill.
</P>
<P>
   That cost of health care is an annual topic in the General
Assembly. It's the counterpoint to the slew of proposals seeking to
protect patients within managed-care plans, such as HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups and insurers insist that such measures balloon
their health costs. Already, the Georgia Association of HMOs says
that 1999 premium increases are running up to 10 percent. ``The
more you raise costs, the more uninsured Georgians you'll
produce,'' says Earl Rogers of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The medical association argues that managed-care companies have
raised premiums to their proper level, after keeping prices
artificially low in previous years to gain market share. And
alarming cost projections don't account for the ultimate result of
denying needed care _ higher medical bills later, says the medical
association's Shanor.
</P>
<P>
   The managed-care revolution, in any event, has been jarring for
many consumers. About half of Georgians now are enrolled in
managed-care plans such as HMOs, up from 33 percent in 1991. Barnes
tapped into consumer angst on HMOs last year when he delivered this
line in his campaign: ``If you can choose who changes the oil in
your car, you ought to be able to choose who delivers your baby.''
</P>
<P>
   How the patient choice issue will play out in legislation,
though, will be tricky. Barnes wants HMO patients to be able to go
to non-network doctors, if the physician agrees to the managed-care
plan's rates. If there's agreement on rates, he argues, how can
costs rise?
</P>
<P>
   Likely opponents _ business groups and insurers _ counter that
the choice argument itself can be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a wide range of choice available to Georgians
already,'' says Jack Towsley of Cigna HealthCare, who's president
of the Georgia Association of HMOs. An employee often has a choice
of what type of insurance plan to join, Towsley says. Even in a
strict HMO, consumers have a wide choice of doctors within that
network, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise on choice could arise from expanding the law on
Point of Service plans, where patients can go to non-network
doctors, but must pay more for that right.
</P>
<P>
   Suing your HMO
</P>
<P>
   Another Barnes priority is extending patients' rights to sue an
insurance plan for malpractice. A similar law was passed in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see some responsibility for the health plan
that makes a medical decision that causes an injury,'' says Barnes,
adding that the Texas law hasn't increased health costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Chamber of Commerce would oppose a sweeping
liability measure, says Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO industry, instead, pushes a proposal for an external
review panel for medical decisions, where independent doctors would
rule on the denial of benefits by a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   Any legislative remedy, though, generally would not apply to
those Georgians who work for larger, self-insured companies, which
are exempt from state insurance regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has pledged his support to the medical association's push
to make the state Board of Medical Examiners an independent entity.
The board, which regulates and disciplines doctors, is now under
the secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Miller vetoed a similar bill, saying it was
''anti-consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanor, though, argues that the board now doesn't have enough
investigators or lawyers to police the profession. ``To protect
patients, you've got to have an independent body,'' Shanor says.
``There are bad doctors out there. We would like to protect the
reputation of the profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors group is also expected to play defense against
separate bills that would extend prescription-writing power to
psychologists, advanced-practice nurses and optometrists.
</P>
<P>
   Saving rural hospitals
</P>
<P>
   The financial plight of Georgia's rural hospitals again will
draw legislative proposals. Twenty such facilities have lost money
three consecutive years, according to state figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to recognize that all rural hospitals will not
survive,'' Barnes says.
</P>
<P>
   But he also envisions increasing Medicaid reimbursements, along
with some direct aid for these hospitals. Legislators may push for
loosening state certificate-of-need laws, so rural hospitals can
branch into new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Other battles may loom over expanding options to nursing homes,
including assisted-living, that Medicaid would reimburse; and over
proposed Medicaid cuts to hospital-based nursing homes. Also on the
table for discussion are two huge health-care contracts: A new $40
million-plus information system for Medicaid, and the selection of
a managed-care network for state employees. Both contracts were set
to be awarded in December, but were delayed by Barnes and Miller
amid questions about the fairness of the bidding process.

COMMENTARY: A TERRIBLE PRECEDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Suppose that in last fall's election Democrats had
gained enough seats to control the House. Suppose that Henry Hyde
and the Republicans had still gone ahead and steamrollered
impeachment through the expiring House.
</P>
<P>
   The illegitimacy of that course would have been obvious. What
actually happened _ pushing a partisan impeachment through before
the new House was sworn in _ has been treated as less dubious. But
the constitutional illegitimacy is the same, and the precedent is
extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   That is the thrust of an analysis by Bruce Ackerman of the Yale
Law School. Professor Ackerman made the point briefly last month in
an Op-Ed piece for The New York Times and in testimony before the
House Judiciary Committee. At the time I thought it was a
distraction from the impeachment debate. Now Ackerman has produced
a full-scale paper. I find it formidably convincing.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the analysis is the original intention of the
20th Amendment, added to the Constitution in 1933. It directed that
Congress meet in January following its election. Before then
Congresses had waited 13 months before convening. The old members,
in lame-duck sessions, often did things that the new members might
not. Outrage grew.
</P>
<P>
   The framers of the 20th Amendment were determined above all not
to let lame-duck members choose the president if no candidate had
an Electoral College majority and the choice was thrown to the
House. The Senate report on the amendment said it would assure that
``the new House of Representatives fresh from the people would ...
select the president.''
</P>
<P>
   It is just as offensive to the intent of the amendment, Ackerman
argues, for the Senate to try a sitting president on impeachment
charges brought by a lame-duck House. The framers would be outraged
at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, anticipating the argument, have said that
several times in our history judges have been impeached by the
House in one Congress and convicted by the Senate in the next. But
all of those cases except one occurred before the 20th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception proves nothing. It was the case of Judge Alcee
Hastings, impeached before the 1988 election and convicted in 1989.
Judge Hastings made no constitutional objections; indeed, he waived
the point by asking for the delay. So it was not a binding
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   All ordinary legislation dies at the end of a Congress if not
finally enacted. So this impeachment resolution, to be considered
by the new Senate, would effectively have to be given an especially
privileged status. But the framers of the 20th Amendment, Ackerman
argues, would if anything have said that ``a lame-duck impeachment
is entitled to even less respect than an ordinary bill passed by a
lame-duck House.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers are wary of raising the lame duck argument
for fear that pro-impeachment forces will denounce it as a
``legalism.'' How, then, may it be raised?
</P>
<P>
   First, Rep. Hyde may ask the new House to reconfirm the
appointment of managers for the Senate trial, as has been done in
the past. Democrats could then move an amendment to force
reconsideration of the impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   If the House reappoints the managers without amendment _ or if
Hyde and the Republicans try to proceed without reappointment _
senators could raise the issue at the start of their proceeding.
They could ask Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who will be
presiding, to rule that the lame-duck impeachment resolution is not
properly before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, this is no ``legalism.'' It is a profound historical
and constitutional point, with dangerous implications for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much more is at stake than the fate of William Jefferson
Clinton,'' Ackerman writes. ``If this lame-duck impeachment is
allowed to go forward, a terrible precedent will be created. ... A
time will come when another lame-duck House ... will strike out at
the president of the opposing party. ... Once such an abusive cycle
of impeachments has begun, it will be very difficult to keep under
control the bitter disagreements generated by our often-divided
government.''

 &HT;    Commentary: Labeling our lives
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ What would a new year be without catchy new
phrases to describe those of us entering it?
</P>
<P>
   We're all familiar with ``Baby Boomers'' and ``Generation X.'' A
lesser-known appellation for those of us who can't stay awake past
9 p.m. is ``Generation Zzzz.''
</P>
<P>
   The new year also will bring with it some trends in the way we
live. In fact, some of them have been conveniently labeled for us
by Lys Marigold and Faith Popcorn in their book Clicking.
</P>
<P>
   One is ``SOS (Save Our Society): A continuing interest in social
conscience and protecting the planet.'' This has been a trend for
years, it seems, and never quite makes it to the front burner. It
might be better labeled ``RIP,'' especially given the state of our
social conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes ``Being Alive: A growing awareness of health and
quality of life.'' Well, as trends go, it beats ``Being Dead.''
Once again, this one seems a bit like a retread. Sure, sure, we all
want to be more aware of our health and have a good quality of
life. So what's new about that? Somebody pass me the Pringles.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's what the authors call ``Cashing Out: The search for
personal fulfillment outside of high-powered careers.'' Let me go
on the record by stating that many of us never ``cashed in.'' Had
we, though, we might well be ready to go beyond crass materialism
and find meaning in other things like faith, family, friendships or
service to others. Before I completely cash out, though, I'd like
to have a little more cash in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anchoring'' is another trend, described as ``reaching back to
spiritual roots.'' This trend already has a strong foothold, given
the number of current books with the words spiritual, angel and New
Age in their titles. Maybe the problem is too many of us feel
``anchored'' in our spiritual life but would rather be sailing _ as
long as we remember where the port is.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the list is ``Down Aging: A growing indulgence in
childhood nostalgia.'' This used to be known as ``There's no fool
like an old fool.'' Down Aging, I guess, is more politically
correct. Regressing also would work. We know we're experiencing
this when we get weepy over Barbie lunch boxes, hula hoops and
Slinkies. I don't want to down age. It's a little too close to
dotage.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think your personal trends should be for the new
year? Resolutions aside, January is a good time to slow down and
ponder the future. Here are some personal trends I predict for my
life in the coming years:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Downsizing.'' With one son in college and a second closing
in, our household is diminishing _ in bodies if not laundry. We'll
be a smaller group, and that will be a big adjustment. Maybe we'll
have a few years to enjoy it before we ``upsize'' with new
daughters-in-law and grandchildren _ but I look forward to that,
too, as long as they don't all live with us.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Feathering the Nest.'' We have lived in our current house
long enough that major repairs are needed. We either have to make
them or move. New roof, new air conditioning, new refrigerator, new
water heater. I'm lobbying for a nice condo.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Second Aging.'' This period starts around age 45 when we try
to do all the things we didn't do in our 20s and 30s. Like get a
master's degree, take that trip to New England to see the fall
foliage, write a book of poems or refinish antique furniture. The
children had us for years; now we have ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite simple, actually. If I have to live up to a set of
labels, I'm going to choose my own.

CLINTON OFFERS TAX CREDIT FOR LONG-TERM-CARE FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although a Senate impeachment trial threatens to
delay his State of the Union message, President Clinton plunged
ahead Monday with a preview, announcing a $1,000 tax credit to help
disabled Americans needing long-term care and their relatives who
provide the care.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant health care proposal in his proposed budget
for fiscal 2000 was unveiled at a White House ceremony as the
administration's efforts to publicize the president's policy
priorities in advance of the State of the Union shifts into
high-gear.
</P>
<P>
   As in years past the White House has begun rolling out
proposals, one by one, leading to up the annual address. And this
year, administration officials are proceeding even though the
Senate, as its first order of business, will determine the
procedures for Clinton's impeachment trial, which could wind up
causing a postponement of the Jan. 19 speech.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart said the president
was planning to go ahead with the State of the Union as scheduled,
but he left open the possibility that Clinton could postpone it, as
some Democrats have suggested, if a Senate trial is in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what decisions the Senate will come to as far as
their schedule and their process,'' said Lockhart. ``But as far as
the president goes, he's hard at work on the State of the Union
address. ... He plans to give that speech January 19th.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of this year's new policy ideas are being packaged around
the theme of work and family, as the White House seeks to maintain
Clinton's high approval ratings despite his impeachment by the
House and his impending Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Clinton unveiled the $1,000 tax credit targeted to
2 million elderly and disabled Americans and their families with
long-term-care needs. It is the centerpiece of a five-year, $6.2
billion health care initiative that, if approved by Congress, would
represent the biggest tax credit for families in the
administration's proposed budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providing long-term care at home is more and more a common
choice, but . . . it is rarely an easy one,'' Clinton said. ``Since
this kind of care is almost never covered by private insurance or
Medicare, out-of-pocket expenses can be staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who joined the president for the
announcement, said: ``Every family member has its own story about
how difficult it is to see those we love grow infirm or become
disabled and the challenges we face in giving them the care, the
love, the attention and the medical services they need and
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the tax credit, Clinton proposed that the federal
government, as the nation's largest employer, begin offering
private, long-term-care insurance to federal workers, retirees and
their families at group rates in the hope that private-sector firms
would follow suit. The government estimates that about 300,000
federal employees would take part in such a program and that it
would cost $15 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton proposed spending $625 million over five
years to create a national family caregiver support program that
would provide counseling, information and other support to about
250,000 families caring for elderly relatives with chronic
illnesses and disabilities. He also proposed spending $10 million
on a national campaign to provide the nation's 39 million Medicare
beneficiaries critical information about long-term care options,
including what Medicare does and does not cover. As part of the
initiative, Vice President Al Gore will conduct a series of forums
nationwide on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term-care initiative was the latest in a series of
proposals Clinton or his aides have announced in advance of the
president's State of the Union message and budget presentation to
Congress Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposals have included increasing funding for food safety
by $105 million, or 12 percent, over this year to prevent
potentially deadly food-borne illnesses, and increasing defense
spending by $100 billion over six years to help the armed forces
deal with various world crises and for military pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Clinton said Monday he will resume his push with
Congress to give patients covered by health maintenance
organizations more flexbility to choose their doctors and will
again call for a boost in the minimum wage, now set at $5.15 an
hour, in his State of the Union speech.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, Clinton is scheduled to make announcements on
education, drugs and prisons, as well as deliver a speech Friday in
Detroit on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime the media and everybody else is ready to write off
the president as a lame duck, he shows we are still full of ideas,
and we have a very active agenda,'' said Maria Echaveste, White
House deputy chief of staff.

ISRAELI WOMEN INJURED AS GUNMEN ATTACK VAN IN HEBRON

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Gunmen opened fire Monday morning on a van
transporting Jewish settlers in the divided city of Hebron,
injuring two Israeli women as they riddled the vehicle with two
dozen bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli army officials suspect that the gunmen were Palestinian
militants, committing the first successful terrorist attack on
Israelis since early November. They said they believed that the men
fled from the Israeli-controlled part of Hebron, where the attack
occurred, into the Palestinian part of the city, where Israeli
officers are not allowed to pursue them.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai ordered the borders of Hebron
closed to Palestinians, preventing them from entering or leaving
the city. He also imposed a curfew on the Palestinians living on
the Israeli side; they were restricted to their homes, although
some slipped out to throw stones at Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting rubber-encased metal bullets, the soldiers injured two
Palestinian youths, striking one 13-year-old boy in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office quickly denounced the
assault on the van as an attack on the peace agreement signed in
Washington in October. David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to the
prime minister, said the incident made ``a mockery'' of the
Palestinians' commitment to peace under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Citing previous Palestinian violations, the Israelis have
stopped complying with the agreement. They refuse to turn over any
more land in the West Bank, a refusal likely to remain steadfast
until Israelis elect a new government in May.
</P>
<P>
   In Hebron, the gunmen reportedly hid in an alleyway on a winding
road and ambushed the white van as it was leaving the Cave of the
Patriarchs, a holy site to both Jews and Muslims. The women,
kindergarten caretakers, were on their way to work in downtown
Hebron from their homes in the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat
Arba.
</P>
<P>
   Flori Hoffi, one of the women shot, was slightly injured; the
other, Fani Elezra, was more seriously injured. Both remained
hospitalized on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said the settlers had been offered an armored
vehicle for such trips, and refused it.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the settlers, Orit Struck, responded: ``They
don't want to give real security to the area. They prefer to put
Jews in bunkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from her hospital bed on Israeli television, Mrs. Hoffi
said, ``I was hit from the first round and ducked, and then I heard
the second round, and I knew my girlfriend was injured from it, and
then she lost consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   After the attacks, the settlers' leaders gathered at the scene,
and young girls swayed in prayer, reading psalms. The leaders said
Netanyahu should go beyond freezing the peace agreement to
invalidating it.
</P>
<P>
   Hebron, where 450 Jewish settlers live amid 150,000
Palestinians, has long been a flashpoint for violent confrontation,
but until this attack, it was experiencing a relatively calm
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli army officials asked the Palestinians to hunt for the
suspects. ``We approached the Palestinians and asked them to take
action in their territory in order to investigate the matter and
capture the attackers,'' Yitzhak Eitan, the commander for the West
Bank, told the Israeli radio.

DUTCH RELENT AND GRANT PERMIT TO PILGRIMS SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After widespread publicity, the Dutch government
withdrew its order Monday that a leading American scholar on the
Pilgrims leave the Netherlands by Jan. 15 and instead granted him a
residency permit, the scholar, Dr. Jeremey Bangs, said.
</P>
<P>
   Bangs said a Dutch official called him Monday to apologize for a
``misunderstanding'' about the order expelling him from the country
which almost four centuries ago granted refuge to the Pilgrims when
they fled religious persecution in England. Bangs, 52, founded a
Pilgrim museum in Leiden in 1997 and was doing research on the
Pilgrims' sojourn in the Netherlands from 1608 to 1620, when they
left for the United States. His research is financially supported
by the New England Historic Genealogical Society in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier rejecting his request for a residency permit, the
Dutch Ministry of Justice said Bangs did not qualify for a work
permit and it did not believe he had adequate means of support.
Bangs and some of his Dutch and American supporters believed he had
been caught in a crackdown by the Dutch government on 50,000
illegal immigrants last year to the Netherlands from Afghanistan,
Iraq, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Bangs received Monday, A.A.M. Wezenberg, a regional
official of the immigrant and naturalization department of the
Ministry of Justice, said: ``After extensive study of your dossier,
I have come to the conclusion that it was incorrect that no
residence permit was granted to you. For this I offer my sincere
apologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the residency permit was a temporary one, Bangs said he
believed he will be able to have it extended.
</P>
<P>
   Bangs said he was ``very relieved'' by the news. The Dutch
government acted after newspaper articles about Bangs' plight
prompted complaints to the Dutch government.

ELIZABETH DOLE WEIGHS RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The fast-churning Republican presidential field
took on new shape Monday, as Elizabeth Dole said she is giving
``serious consideration'' to running for the White House and
Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire formally filed papers to become
a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Another much-discussed GOP prospect, Senator John Ashcroft of
Missouri, is slated to announce Tuesday whether he will seek the
presidency amid last-minute signs that he is leaning against such a
bid.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the wife of 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole,
resigned Monday from her job as president of the American Red Cross
and immediately became a political factor who cannot be ignored in
the 2000 race. With or without her husband's connections, the
former two-time Cabinet secretary is one of the most prominent
women in America and a longtime star in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Cross is now solid as a rock, and at this important
time in our national life, I believe there may be another way for
me to serve our country,'' said Dole, who has run the nonprofit
institution for almost eight years. ``The Red Cross has been a
glorious mission field, but I believe there may be other duties yet
to fulfill.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 90 minutes after Dole's news conference, Smith met with a
small group of reporters at a Capitol Hill townhouse to announce he
had filed papers with the Federal Election Commission to become a
presidential candidate. Smith, who narrowly won reelection in 1996
and is little-known nationally, said he hopes to make headway in
what he described as a slimmed-down ``Chevy campaign'' that will
rely largely on his contacts in Iowa and his home state of New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have the experience, the desire, the `fire,' if you
will,'' Smith said. He called upon Americans to send him at least
$20, and up to $1,000, to create what he called a ``grass-roots''
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, 62, has been promoted by both her husband and a North
Carolina-based ``Draft Elizabeth Dole 2000'' committee as a GOP
presidential candidate. In November Dole told her hometown
newspaper, the Salisbury (N.C.) Post, ``I've learned never to say
never, and then sort of leave it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole did not refer specifically to a candidacy during her
farewell remarks at the Red Cross headquarters Monday, but
questioned by reporters afterward, she said: ``I'll give it serious
consideration. We're going to have to talk about it down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dole sounded much like a candidate as she ticked off a
list of accomplishments in her current post and emphasized her
vision, compassion, and optimism for the country to a throng of
applauding Red Cross employees who packed the historic Board of
Governors hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've cradled a gaunt, Rwandan baby in my arms, and I've sat
with our men and women in uniform, far from home and loved ones, as
they kept the peace in Bosnia,'' Dole said of her own Red Cross
experiences. ``I've stood in the Somalian darkness while Red
Crossers operated by flashlight on a victim of that nation's
bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Kluttz, a North Carolina leader of the campaign to
draft Dole that sprang up in October, said the response for
volunteers and money has been ``awesome.'' The draft campaign set
up a Web site over the weekend, www.electelizabeth.org, and about
$50,000 has been raised for the effort, said Kluttz.
</P>
<P>
   GOP pollster Linda DiVall said about Dole, ``If she gets in, she
immediately becomes a top-tier candidate. She changes the dynamic
of the race, making the front-runner candidates George Bush and
Elizabeth Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Duke University and Harvard Law School, Dole has
never held elective office but has an impressive resume of
government service. She served in President Nixon's office of
consumer affairs, was a member of the Federal Trade Commission for
six years, was Transportation secretary in the Reagan
administration and Labor Secretary to President Bush. She married
Bob Dole in 1975. The couple has no children.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a self-described conservative with a 100 percent rating
in 1996 from the American Conservative Union. He is best known for
his strong stand against abortion, his efforts to uncover whether
Americans missing in action during the Vietnam War are still alive,
and his work as chairman of the ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's presidential aspirations have drawn both fascination and
fury in the first-primary state of New Hampshire. While Smith has a
solid base of support as a senator, some New Hampshirites have
expressed concern that his entry into the presidential race could
effectively shut down the primary by causing other candidates to
stay away. But a statewide poll conducted last month by the
Manchester-based American Research Group found that Smith was
favored by only 3 percent in a GOP primary, leading observers to
say the primary would still be heavily contested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking New Hampshire people for granted,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 57, a former high school history teacher and varsity
basketball coach, was elected to the House in 1984 and to the
Senate in 1990. He was reelected in 1996 with 49 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   So far, much of the speculation about the GOP race has centered
around Texas Governor George W. Bush, who is ahead in the polls but
hasn't announced whether he will run for the presidency. Last week
Arizona Senator John McCain formed an exploratory committee, an
initial step toward running.
</P>
<P>
   Other prospects include former Education Secretary Lamar
Alexander, commentator Patrick Buchanan, publisher Steve Forbes,
former Vice President Dan Quayle, conservative activist and former
Reagan aide Gary Bauer, and Representative John Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But as Monday's movements demonstrated, the GOP field is in
flux. Ashcroft, for example, has signaled for months that he
intended to run for president. But his presidential dreams may have
collided with the calendar: He is up for reelection in 2000 and
faces a potentially tough race against Democratic Governor Mel
Carnahan, who plans to challenge Ashcroft for the Senate seat.
There have been suggestions that Ashcroft could run Senate and
presidential races on parallel tracks, but that is potentially
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore filed papers late
last month to become a candidate. Senator Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota and former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey have formed
exploratory committees. Others considering running are Senators
John F. Kerry and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt is believed to be leaning against a race in favor
of trying to capture the speakership in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who spent the Christmas vacation at the Sun Valley,
Idaho, home of his wife, Teresa Heinz, said the family discussions
went well enough for him to proceed to the next phase of his
decision-making process, which involves gauging his prospects with
politically connected allies and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a terrific discussion,'' Kerry said Monday of his
family talks. ``I wouldn't be having a lot of these other
discussions if they weren't pretty positive. But I think I need to
have the other evaluations.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he planned to make an announcement in late January or
early February.

SIHANOUK OFFERS TO BE PUT ON TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ As passions rise over whether to put
former leaders of the Khmer Rouge on trial, King Norodom Sihanouk
volunteered Monday to join them in the dock to answer for his past
associations with the brutal communist movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ready to appear in front of a tribunal in charge of
judging the Khmer Rouge and their real or supposed accomplices,''
the king said in a statement from Beijing, where he spends much of
his time. ``Even if the tribunal judges do not summon me, I will
turn up anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has suggested that the king stand trial. But he appears
to have been stung by reminders in the press that he lent his name
to the movement, as its nominal head of state, at the start of the
period from 1975 to 1979 when it ruled Cambodia and caused the
deaths of more than a million of his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in public life today _ including Prime Minister Hun
Sen _ have had links with the Khmer Rouge, either while they ruled
the country or in the next decade when a coalition of royalists,
democrats and Khmer Rouge forces battled a Vietnamese-backed
government in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the political cross-currents that complicate a
resolution to the country's past conflicts, there is a network of
often-hidden personal relationships that keeps past debts and
rivalries alive.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the United Nations, which have worked on
preparations for a possible tribunal, have made it clear to
Cambodian leaders that they have no intention of casting a wide
net, a person involved in those preparations said.
</P>
<P>
   The preparations appear to be focusing on a dozen top figures
from the Khmer Rouge Central Committee and the torture house at
Tuol Sleng prison, where at least 14,000 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Among these are Khieu Samphan, the movement's nominal head of
state, and Nuon Chea, a top ideologist, who both surrendered to the
government on Dec. 25. Hun Sen, who welcomed them, at first seemed
to say he opposed a trial, then seemed to say he favored one. The
two men were allowed to tour the capital, Phnom Penh, then visit
the seaside resort of Sihanoukville and the temples of Angkor
before returning last Monday to Pailin, an enclave of former Khmer
Rouge in a remote area of western Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   In an anguished statement last week, the king said he would have
no part of Hun Sen's seeming leniency and asserted that he would
not issue a royal amnesty to the two men. He left it up to Hun Sen
to decide their fate.
</P>
<P>
   The king, who is 76, lent his name to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas
after he was ousted in a U.S.-backed coup led by his army chief,
Lon Nol, in 1970. Sihanouk's popularity was a major asset to
recruitment by the small communist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   He then allowed himself to be named head of state when the Khmer
Rouge seized power in 1975 under the leadership of Pol Pot, who
died last year. But Sihanouk was placed under house arrest for the
final three years of Khmer Rouge rule. He was one of the millions
of people who suffered severely at the hands of the Khmer Rouge,
losing 14 family members.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen was a middle-ranking Khmer Rouge field commander until
he broke with the movement in 1977, but most historians say he does
not appear to have been involved in Khmer Rouge atrocities, and he
appears to face little threat from a tribunal focusing on those
years.
</P>
<P>
   The head of his political party, Chea Sim, as well as his
co-defense minister, Tea Banh, were members of the Khmer Rouge in
the 1970s.

SPORTS COLUMN: BOWL SYSTEM LUCKED OUT ONCE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ ``Once two strangers climbed up Rocky Top,
looking for a moonshine still,'' as the Tennessee fight song puts
it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was more than two strangers, and they were looking for
a photo opportunity, and instead of Rocky Top it was Mount Kush.
But you get the point.
</P>
<P>
   There would be room for only one team on the symbolic pinnacle
after Florida State and Tennessee finished pummeling each other in
the Fiesta Bowl Monday night. The game would determine the national
college football championship under the new format, pitting the No.
1 team against No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   All the strangers in Volunteer orange and all the strangers in
Seminole garnet were cordial to each other on the pile of rocks
overlooking Sun Devil Stadium. Bowl games, after all, are a rather
bourgeois affair, drawing a bunch of lawyers and accountants who
can afford to travel with their favorite team.
</P>
<P>
   They could probably afford outrageous ticket prices, but were
not forced to pay them. This game was so far from either school
that the demand was down, and scalpers were muttering ``face value,
face value'' as their gloomy mantra as they trudged up and down
Mills Street with the posh tourists practically naming their price.
</P>
<P>
   As a former Appalachian hand, I can testify there were precious
few real hillbillies making their way up the trails of Mount Kush.
The orthodontic smiles and re-sculptured faces told me these were
suburban folks on holiday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the hill up which Frank Kush used to send his football
players, in full battle regalia, in the blazing August heat when he
was the resident sadist at Arizona State. Now tourists do it on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Kush is around here somewhere, and could probably make
a great piece of change hiring himself as a universal football
coach, goading grandfathers and little children up the mountain, to
prove their courage and uphold the American way of life.
</P>
<P>
   There was precious little woofing between the garnet people and
the rather more plentiful orange people, who peered down from Mount
Kush into the empty stadium. Later, of course, the joint would
reverberate with the Tennessee anthem, written in the 60's by
Felice and Boudleaux Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The song _ my favorite rendition is by Buck Owens _ begins,
``Wish that I was on old Rocky Top, up in the Tennessee hills,''
and has absolutely nothing to do with football but rather with the
flinty independence of all mountaineers. Nevertheless, the song has
become a staple at all Tennessee games.
</P>
<P>
   Both schools aspired to lofty heights in Monday night's game.
Each had won a national title _ Tennessee back in 1951 and Florida
State in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was sure to be crowned champion last night because
there was no wiggle room for impassioned whining from a third
school. Tennessee was the only top-level undefeated team (sorry,
Tulane), and once-beaten Florida State had been anointed to
challenge Tennessee in this ultimate game of king-of-the-hill.
</P>
<P>
   The football coaches who vote in the ESPN poll were committed to
crowning the winner while the writers who vote in the Associated
Press poll reserved their right to cast ballots three hours after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   John Cooper tried to make a case after his Ohio State team
escaped Texas A&AMP;M during the long New Year Day glut of bowl games.
Cooper said the writers might consider his team if Florida State
did not rack up many style points in a theoretical victory over
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame John one bit for feeling the way he does,'' said
Bobby Bowden of Florida State on Sunday. ``John might have the best
football team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Bowden quickly added, ``if Tennessee wins this ball
game, they're going to be national champions. And if we win this
ball game, we're going to be national champions.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right about that. Florida State had the good sense of
losing to North Carolina State early, upon which kindly old Grandpa
Bowden informed his older players that they could keep their
scholarships while sitting way down on his bench.
</P>
<P>
   The new system lucked out because there were not three
undefeated contenders trying to squeeze into one Fiesta Bowl. (Come
to think of it, a triangular football game does have its anarchic
appeal.) Ohio State also lost, while UCLA and Kansas State made the
gross mistake of losing in their last regular game, which is bad
timing, since bowl officials penalize teams for recent losses.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA had not lost to Miami, there would have been a
UCLA-Tennessee game here Monday night, a battle of undefeated
teams. There would have been fewer people on Mount Kush because the
fans would have been down on Mills Street begging for tickets at
$500 or $750 or maybe even $1,000. But we still would have had
countless verses of Rocky Top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top, reckon they never
will,'' is the punch line of the Bryants' classic song. There's not
much pity on Rocky Top _ and no second chances after the Fiesta
Bowl, either.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years after her husband's unsuccessful effort
to oust President Clinton, Elizabeth Hanford Dole announced Monday
that she was resigning as president of the Red Cross, a move that
several advisers said was intended to clear the path for her own
campaign for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole had insisted for more than a year that she had no
intention of seeking the Republican nomination, and her
announcement Monday stunned many politicians and strategists in her
party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet given her national prominence and popularity among
Republicans, her appeal to women, her experience as secretary of
labor and secretary of transportation, and her work for the Red
Cross, many strategists say Mrs. Dole could catapult herself to the
top tier of Republican contenders. Polls of Republican primary
voters have shown, consistently, that Mrs. Dole is second only to
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas as the most popular prospective
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, who is 62, did not speak directly of her intentions
in the farewell address she made Monday to Red Cross employees.
``Soon, I will be considering new paths, and there are exciting
possibilities,'' she said. ``I will choose one and pursue it with
all my might.'' Asked by reporters afterward whether she planned to
run, Mrs. Dole said, ``We're going to give it serious
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   But several people close to Mrs. Dole said her advisers had
already assembled a plan for her to raise as much as $22 million
this year, and that they intended to establish an exploratory
committee to begin soliciting donations shortly after she
officially leaves the Red Cross in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In another surprise turn that has roiled the Republican field
even before any candidates have officially announced, several
advisers to Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said he was expected to
announce on Tuesday that he has decided not to seek the nomination.
He had been aggressively laying the groundwork for a candidacy for
a year and had positioned himself, with some success, as a champion
of religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft had gone as far as to rent space for a campaign office,
and he had planned to be the first candidate to formally announce
at an event on Tuesday in Springfield, Mo. But with his Senate seat
up in 2000, his advisers said, he worried that it was too risky to
try to run for president and win re-election in what could be a
tight Senate contest. Gov. Mel Carnahan announced earlier this
month that he would take on Ashcroft in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, he decided that a Senate seat was too valuable to
the values that he stands for to put in jeopardy,'' said Ralph
Reed, a strategist and former head of the Christian Coalition who
had counseled Ashcroft. ``We've got too many vulnerable seats to
just punt one to the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle and Steve Forbes, the
publisher, are the two possible candidates who are likely to appeal
to Ashcroft's supporters because they have offered themselves as
religious conservatives with pragmatic campaign experience.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said Ashcroft's decision leaves ``a large chunk of the
religious conservatives' leadership all dressed up for the prom but
without a date.'' The senator had been the choice of Pat Robertson,
founder of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another move Monday that is part of a sudden burst of
activity that underscores how the presidential field for 2000 is
beginning to settle out unusually early, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H.,
announced the establishment of a presidential campaign committee.
While Smith, a hard-edged conservative, is considered a long shot,
he could muddle the nominating process because he is the favorite
son in New Hampshire, traditionally the first primary state.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vice President Al Gore, the favorite for the
Democratic nomination, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., announced
that they had formed committees that allow them to begin raising
money.

ANALYSIS: CHANGING OF THE GUARD WITH 49ERS RECEIVERS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ No wonder Jerry Rice blew up during the regular
season over his desire to catch more footballs and in bigger
moments. Rice must have seen this coming. He must have realized
long before us that receiver Terrell Owens was the new apple of the
49ers' eyes. Especially of quarterback Steve Young's eyes. That in
the post-season Owens might get more calls. More passes. More
chances to win games. More glory. The Guy. The Star.
</P>
<P>
   It takes one to know one.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a bright, visionary star to peek around the stage just
before the curtain rises and to realize that the props, the music,
the timing, the production is striking a new chord. That an
understudy is being provided with your script. Your show.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has done it all _ won big games in the closing seconds, won
Super Bowls _ and for nearly all of his 14 seasons with the 49ers,
he has been The Guy. The Star. He can discern in practices and in
the game plan and in communication with Young and with his coaches
where the emphasis on placing the football will be. He must have
felt things turning, shifting, as this season unfolded. And in the
49ers' dramatic 30-27 wild-card playoff victory over Green Bay here
on Sunday, it was crystallized. Entrenched. Rice caught one ball
for 6 yards. And even on that one grab, during the game-winning
drive, he apparently fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was Owens who kept getting his number called, who despite
dropping four passes and fumbling once still kept getting his
number called. It was Owens in the end who stole it, won it,
reached for glory, swiped it, and solidified his status as The Guy.
The Star. It was the 25-year-old Owens who was double-covered for
most of the day by the Packers, who chose to single-cover the
36-year-old Rice. Owens made the 25-yard touchdown catch with three
seconds left that created history. New history. A permanent new
49ers order.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Rice said about it:
</P>
<P>
   ``That play was more of a desperation throw, with everybody
trying to go deep and create single coverage. Steve made the right
read and threw a good ball in there. T.O. was able to hang on to
it. We knew we somehow had to get it into the end zone. The guys
kept working and we got it done. This game is going to go down in
history, and I'm glad to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A part of it instead of being squarely in the middle of it? No.
80 in the back seat to No. 81? Instead of J.R., T.O.? Time out!
</P>
<P>
   No. Some things must change. Very little stays the same.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Terrell Owens, T.O., is The Guy, The Star, whom the
Atlanta Falcons must account for most in the 49ers' passing game
when San Francisco (13-4) clashes with Atlanta (14-2) on Saturday
in a second-round playoff game at the Georgia Dome. It would, of
course, be a mistake to ignore Rice. Who says he is completely
done? Certainly he doesn't. Rice can still be a game-breaker and
the Falcons know this only too well. But here is the catch _ now
defenses have Owens first in mind. He commands the attention. The
double-teams. It is his size _ 6 foot 3 inches, 217 pounds _ his
strength, his speed and his huge hands. He is a powerful receiver
who is also graceful. Full of desire. Wonderful combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, a third-round pick in 1996 out of Tennessee-Chattanooga,
grew up immensely in this Packers game.
</P>
<P>
   You think he was not aware of what has happened? What is
happening? During the regular season Rice caught 82 balls and Owens
caught 67. But Owens nearly matched Rice's 1,157 reception yards,
missing by only 60 yards. Owens averaged 2.3 yards a catch more
than Rice. Owens caught 14 touchdown passes; Rice caught 9. Rice's
longest touchdown grab was for 75 yards. Owens earned one of 79
yards.
</P>
<P>
   So, Owens entered the playoff game against the Packers knowing
that the trend in the regular season was going to follow in the
playoffs. Owens would be counted on most in the passing game. The
Guy. The Star.
</P>
<P>
   And he nearly choked.
</P>
<P>
   Think there isn't pressure supplanting Jerry Rice? In the
playoffs, no less?
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers cornerback Marquez Pope put it this way: ``When you
are a receiver and you know the ball is coming to you all day, you
can get a little antsy. And then you get the drops T.O. had and you
start to doubt. We kept telling him on the sideline not to doubt
himself. We've seen him all year make plays. We knew he could be
there when it counted.''
</P>
<P>
   And Owens realized he was pressing. ``I woke up a couple of
times last night and I couldn't sleep, so I just laid in bed
staring at the ceiling and I was thinking,'' Owens said on Sunday
after the game. ``I had a vision about making a play and winning
this game. And then once the game rolled around I was pressing.
Near the end of the game, I was already thinking about how I was
going to live with myself knowing I let the team down. I was
thinking, `They have been looking at me all year long. And now
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   This became that. Owens won it. Credit Young for believing in
Owens. You are the quarterback and Owens has dropped the ball all
day and in the final ticks of the clock with everything on the line
you are going to go back to Owens and not to Rice? That takes guts,
and a season's worth of confidence in your receiver. Young clearly
felt that way about Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Some Packers said afterward they had a hard time swallowing the
fact that a player who made as many mistakes as Owens did could
make one play and be a hero. It was Packers cornerback Tyrone
Williams who kept trash-talking Owens in the third quarter over
Owens' drops.
</P>
<P>
   Football players are taught that mistakes kill. That mistakes
cost. That in playoff games mistakes are seldom overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Terrell Owens, T.O, made gaffe after gaffe in his bid to
cement his status as The Guy. The Star. And in one sweeping moment,
he wiped the slate clean and created new playoff history and a new
49ers order.
</P>
<P>
   It looks permanent.

DOCTORS TO EXAMINE BLEDSOE'S FINGER TUESDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If he had his druthers, Patriots quarterback
Drew Bledsoe would have spent a chunk of time early this week
huddling with the team's medical staff, trying to end his shelf
life and get back on the field against the Denver Broncos this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars left any
mention of his mending digit moot, and Bledsoe plans to take off
Wednesday and ``go hide out for a while and get away from
everything and enjoy being around my family.''
</P>
<P>
   First, though, he will have his right index finger checked out
Tuesday. He expects the pin will be left in it for now and there
will be no problenms with it down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he and his teammates checked out of their Foxboro
Stadium locker room and Bledsoe, standing beside his white sports
utility vehicle in the parking lot, took a couple of minutes to
check in on things Patriot.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe started by throwing his support solidly in the corner of
coach Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, he's taken us to the playoffs two years in a row
and that's nothing to be taken lightly and he's been faced with
some extremely adverse situations,'' Bledsoe said. ``He walked into
a very adverse situation here following Bill and he's done a good
job handling all that pressure. We've had a lot of injuries and
setbacks the last two years, and he's been able to maintain his
poise and maintain his ability to coach the team through all of
that and I think he deserves a lot of credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he appreciates the way Carroll has hung in there in
the coaching pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody could have anticipated how difficult
this situation was going to be to step into,'' Bledsoe said. ``And
I haven't seen him change one bit in the last two years and that's
really to his credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides having Carroll stay around, Bledsoe said it would be
nice to have some continuity in a coaching staff that was
overhauled two years ago when Bill Parcells left, and then added
offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese for this past season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the injuries and all the adversity they've had to deal
with this year, I think they've done a good job,'' said Bledsoe of
Zampese and defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell. ``And plus, we've
been through enough changes here in the past few years. I think it
would be a real bonus if we could keep things in place here. But
we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe liked the way Scott Zolak and the Patriots came back in
the third quarter against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the effort of the team was excellent,'' Bledsoe said.
``I said after the game to the team that it killed me to stand and
watch but I was proud to be a part of this team because the guys on
this team played with a lot of heart and played with a lot of
effort and gave it everything they had.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he had no idea whether he would have been able to
play in the second round of the playoffs, but it would have been
nice to have his status be an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a touch-and-go situation and we would have
had to make the call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He echoed Carroll and others on one of the keys to next year:
having good attendance at Johnny Parker's offseason strength and
conditioning programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get guys stronger and faster and in better condition going
into the year, and in a lot of cases that can help you stay away
from some injuries,'' he said. ``It's not going to solve all of
them. Look at a guy like Ted Johnson, I'm not sure you'd find a
better-conditioned athlete in the National Football League.
Sometimes things happen, but you can avoid some things.''
</P>
<P>
   In a year in which some thought he came of age with comeback
wins late in the season before breaking his finger, Bledsoe said
he'll also take the responsibility for some early-season losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't accomplish what we wanted to accomplish this year,
and that's disappointing,'' he said. ``But there are a lot of
reasons for that, and I take a lot of the blame for that. Some of
the games earlier in the year we should have been able to win. It's
something everyone on the team has to address individually about
what we're going to accomplish in the offseason and how we're going
to approach things next year.''

AS THE EURO DEBUTS, SOME SAY IT MAY RIVAL THE DOLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EURO-CHANGEOVER) 
(lb) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The euro _ the new European currency _ had a positive debut
Monday in foreign-exchange dealings. But it is still unclear how
the euro will fare against the dollar this year and what kind of
challenge it will present over time to the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollar will stay the world's predominant currency but the
euro will be second,'' said Robert Standing, managing director in
London of the global trading division in Europe for Chase Manhattan
Bank. But, he added, ``the euro will be the first credible
challenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Others think the euro may be more than a challenger. Fred
Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in
Washington, said the question is not whether the euro will rival
the dollar but how fast that will happen. ``Some people say three
years, some say 10 years; but there is no doubt that it will
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the talk is of the euro challenging the dollar, what
the new currency really represents is another big step toward a
global economy, in which the United States will face more
competition for its share of growth.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the euro is one of the mechanisms that are making
a united Europe far more competitive with the United States. ``Its
a culmination of the globalization trend,'' said Bergsten, adding
that ``what the Europeans have done is show how you can take
maximum advantage of globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   In late trading Monday, the euro cost $1.18060, up from the
$1.17400 value of the old European currency unit on Dec. 31. The
ecu, a basket of European currencies that was the precursor to the
euro, converted into the euro on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The euro rallied from its New York lows as the stock market
reversed course, with the Dow Jones industrial average giving up
most of its gains for the day. The dollar fell much more sharply
against the yen, ending at 112.07 yen from 113.57 Thursday, in
light trading that may have exaggerated the decline, some traders
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new currency, some traders said, was buoyed by European
banks' buying and strong rallies in European stock markets from
Germany to Spain and France to Italy. Traders also said that
trading was orderly, although volume was only moderate. Traders
``were working their way in slowly,'' Standing of Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans used to following the German mark, the Italian
lira and the other currencies from the 11 nations now represented
by the euro, the new currency may be a little confusing. Until now,
the quotes of the value of the dollar against marks or lire have
been in how many of them one dollar can buy. For example, on Monday
the dollar was worth 1,639.34 lire.
</P>
<P>
   But with the euro, its value will be quoted in how many dollars
it can buy. This means that when the euro moves, for example, from
$1.17 to $1.18 dollars, the euro is getting stronger and the dollar
is getting weaker. The British pound is quoted in the same fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Americans will still have to look at the values of
marks and other European currencies, because the euro will only
gradually become available in coins and bills over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   So when travelers go to continental Europe this year, they will
still be spending marks, lire and francs when using cash. But goods
can be bought with euros on credit cards, and visitors can get euro
travelers checks. (Britain and several other European countries are
not adopting the euro.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As for the strength of the euro this year, that is open to
debate. There are plenty of currency forecasters who think the euro
will be strong and others who think it will be weak. The
expectation, said Standing of Chase, ``depends on the views of
where the two economies go.''
</P>
<P>
   Many forecasters are expecting growth to be stronger in Europe
than in the United States, which would help the euro. But Paul
Podolsky, a currency strategist at BankBoston, thinks growth in
Europe will be slower. He also feels that the new European Central
Bank will have a more difficult time navigating in its new
environment than others expect.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on Monday, Podolsky said European authorities got
what they wanted: an ``uneventful'' day. He said they did not want
the euro to fall in value nor did they want it to have a volatile
day.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, within the foreign-exchange business the biggest
significance of the euro's trading launch has been its likely
effect on jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign-exchange industry has been scaling bank and
adjusting to the arrival of the euro for about a year and
intensively since last May when the launch of the new currency was
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been streamlining and adjusting for all of 1998,''
said Standing. He said that another factor that made life difficult
for many foreign-exchange traders last year was the crash of many
emerging-market currencies. This forced a lot of firms to cut back
or get out of trading those currencies altogether.

 WASHINGTON: raising money.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is also preparing to
announce an exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Mrs. Dole's move was the biggest surprise as the 2000
presidential race gets under way. ``This is a 95 percent
certainty,'' said John Heubusch, who was a top aide to Mrs. Dole in
the Labor Department and at the Red Cross and has been one of her
closest advisers in discussing a presidential bid. ``The Red Cross
was in pretty bad shape when she got there; it was a really
significant management task to turn that place around. Her ability
to do that has truly gained her some real confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising the money, Heubusch said, ``wouldn't be easy but would
be doable _ when given a task she can complete it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fabrizio, the pollster for Bob Dole's presidential campaign
in 1996 who has worked closely with the Doles, said, ``Leaving the
Red Cross is a serious indication that she is serious.'' (She took
a leave when she helped Dole's presidential campaign.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole is a very disciplined politician who is known for
carefully stage-managing her every public appearance. But she has
never held elective office and many strategists questioned whether
she could endure the demands of a presidential campaign. While Mrs.
Dole could compete for Christian voters, she was described by
several people as a ``Billy Graham Christian'' because she is not
known as a a conservative ideologue.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's departure at the Red Cross headquarters two blocks
from the White House was also a masterful political event. It was
packed with more than 500 cheering employees, and she was praised
repeatedly for her leadership over the last eight years. As she
entered the room an announcer boomed over the loudspeaker, ``Our
beloved president of the American Red Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a touch that surely did not please the White House, Mrs.
Dole's aides distributed a statement from Donna Shalala, the
secretary of heath and human services who is president Clinton's
designee on the board of the Red Cross. ``She brought intelligence,
skill and integrity to the post,'' Ms. Shalala said, ``and she
leaves with my highest respect and affection.''

 &HT;    Former track star faces jury in rape charge
 &HT;    By Rob Modic
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A 12-year-old girl will testify today about how
former Olympic track hopeful Christopher Raulins Nelloms raped her
eight times when she was between 8 and 11 years old, an assistant
Montgomery County prosecutor told a jury Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nelloms, 26, of Trotwood, Ohio, faces a mandatory life sentence
if a Montgomery County Common Pleas jury of nine women and three
men convicts him on even one of the rape charges.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Kevin Lennen contended that the girl is a
``pathological liar'' who was sent to Nelloms for better discipline
after having trouble at her single mother's home.
</P>
<P>
   Nelloms was living with his fiance, Tina Smith, at the time the
girl first disclosed the allegations, last April 9. Lennen proposed
that the girl concocted the accounts of the rapes, an attempted
rape and a felonious penetration with a finger to avert being
returned to her natural mother.
</P>
<P>
   Lennen said the girl's testimony is also suspect because, during
the investigation, she changed some of her accounts of the rapes
and other sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant county prosecutor Angela Frydman said the girl first
disclosed the rapes to Tina Smith after watching a television
program about child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Frydman said Nelloms first assaulted the girl when she was 8,
shortly after he broke up with his wife, Mary, in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After several rapes while in Nelloms' care, the girl was
returned to her mother but did not reveal the assaults, Frydman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl visited Nelloms again when she was 10 and was subjected
to several more assaults, Frydman said. The girl will also testify
that Nelloms claimed after one assault that he would be
electrocuted if she told anyone about the sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Frydman said the head of the child abuse unit at Children's
Medical Center will testify that an examination of the girl found
evidence consistent with the girl's accounts. Lennen, however,
claimed there would be no physical evidence or any other witness to
support the girl's testimony.

 &HT;    Ohio Valley trying to dig out despite hard freeze
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The main roads are clear but local side streets
will likely remain rutted ice rinks for several days after this
weekend's snow, rain and hard freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Deep freeze temperatures Monday kept road salt from doing much
good against the packed snow and ice that coated many local roads,
local streets maintenance directors said.
</P>
<P>
   Those temperatures dipped to 3 degrees by 6 p.m. and the wind
chill was as low as -17 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Today the high is expected to reach 15 with a low near 10. By
Wednesday, temperatures are expected to be relatively warmer with
the high near 30, a low near 20 and a chance of snow. Thursday and
Friday's forecasts call for highs in the upper 30s and lower 40s
and lows in the mid 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The cold and icy weather may have contributed to a second death
in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Icy road conditions contributed to a fatal crash near the
Auglaize-Shelby County line late Sunday. Pramilaben Patel, 48, was
killed when the 1991 Ford Aerostar van in which she rode spun out
of control, landing on its right side in the median between the
north and southbound lanes of Interstate 75 six miles south of
Wapakoneta.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Ramarnlal Patel, 57, and another passenger, Adam
Patel, 18, received minor injuries in the accident, which happened
at 10:18 p.m. The survivors were treated and released at Wilson
Memorial Hospital. All were from Detroit, Michigan. Meanwhile,
Dayton police continued to investigate Monday's death of a man
found face down in the snow Sunday at 334 Norwood Ave. Herbert L.
Simon, 46, of 1231 S. Broadway St., was discovered about 8 a.m. and
was dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Police don't suspect foul play, said Sgt. Gary White. The cause
of death has been deferred pending the return of toxicology and
other tests, according to the Montgomery County Coroner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Ice became the biggest problem Monday as hospital emergency
rooms reported a rash of fall-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Roads stayed coated with ice after Saturday morning's fluffy
snowfall was packed down by cars, then matted with freezing rain.
By the time plows reached many side roads Sunday, they could only
scrape off the snow blown on top, leaving an inch or more of ice
below.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency rooms across the area have seen 250 to 300 people
treated for injuries related to the ice. Falls have outranked
injuries from traffic accidents 10 to 1, according to Dr. James
Augustine, an emergency physician at Miami Valley Hospital and
medical director for the Washington Twp. Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   At Miami Valley Hospital, which sees a third of the emergency
department volume in Montgomery County, 44 people were treated for
ice-related injuries on Sunday, Augustine said. Of those, 30 were
for falls, 10 for sledding injuries, three for traffic accidents
and one for a snow shoveling injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really very hazardous,'' Augustine said. ``The EMS people
are just going nuts with falls.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect icy sidewalks and driveways for the next few days, he
said. Some of the ice will melt gradually, only to rapidly
re-freeze as the sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Augustine advised people to wear shoes with tread, to walk in
the snow instead of on ice, and to avoid carrying things when
walking outdoors. One person was treated for an impaled hand after
falling while carrying a sharp instrument, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kettering, ice patches formed on roads that were plowed
first, according to Wayne Springer, assistant streets maintenance
director.
</P>
<P>
   Plowed snow blocked drainage and Saturday night's rains backed
up and froze into sheets, Springer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streets we worked very, very hard to get to bare pavement
then became thick ice,'' Springer said.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Dayton streets were cleared to the pavement after crews
from three departments hauled the snow away in trucks and dumped it
in parking lots at city parks.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton crews had trouble on side streets because of the rain and
ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The residential streets, some are in decent shape, some are
much less so, a lot of them much less than we would like,'' said
Dennis Goodrich, manager of street maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Some Dayton-area residents seemed pleased Monday with how
quickly street crews had responded to the snow and ice, if not with
the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you can see where all the snow gets blown,'' said Danny
Glascoe, 30, pointing in frustration to the ridge of plowed ice
blocking his and other parked cars along Dayton's Illinois Avenue.
``But I guess they're doing the best they can in this weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Winglewich, a 64-year-old resident of Marilyn Street in
Kettering, said he was impressed that city crews had already
cleared smaller side streets like his.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I can remember them coming out here this
quickly,'' he said. ``My only problem is, my car has to negotiate
that little bump'' at the end of the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Road crews have no choice, though, street maintenance officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bombarded with calls from people whose driveways were
(blocked by mounds of plowed snow),'' Robert Hoag, operations
engineer for the Montgomery County engineer's office. ``I feel for
them because my driveway was plowed in. We know of no other way to
get the roads open other than the way we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Xenia, plows and ice trucks may head back out tomorrow if
temperatures rise into the high 20s as expected. The city expected
the delivery of an additional 500 tons of road salt today.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The storm) shouldn't hurt us too bad but if we get another
storm, it could put a dent in the salt supply,'' said Charles
Leonard, Xenia's assistant public service director.
</P>
<P>
   The ice and nasty weather did not cancel classes at the
University of Dayton or Wright State University on Monday, though
UD officials said a handful of classes were cancelled because
professors were stranded at airports around the country, unable to
make connecting flights to Dayton in time for the start of classes.
</P>
<P>
   UD will not penalize students for missing class Monday if they
could not return to campus because of weather, said UD spokeswoman
Pam Huber.
</P>
<P>
   WSU's Lake Campus canceled classes Monday, but the main campus
did not. It is up to the professors' discretion whether to penalize
Monday absences, a WSU spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service was trying to make deliveries in the
Dayton area Monday, but spokesman Lee Withers said carriers were
being slowed down by unshoveled sidewalks and driveways, and ``we
may run out of daylight'' before all deliveries were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 concern is for the safety of our carriers and our
drivers,'' Withers said. ``I can say in the 454 (ZIP Code) area,
we're making an attempt to deliver. We ask that our customers be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm had little impact on the area's air freight companies.
</P>
<P>
   Emery Worldwide wasn't operating Friday through Sunday because
of the New Year's holiday, said Jim LaScala, human resources
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working feverishly today to clear the ramp,'' he said.
``It's almost clear as we speak. We expect to be pretty close to on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Airborne Express in Wilmington had crews salting the runway
before the storm began Friday night, ``and they've just been
working ever since,'' said spokeswoman Rita Carey. She said
Airborne had some delays Saturday because snow and ice on the ramp
slowed down loading and unloading of planes, but that problem has
been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky it happened on a holiday weekend, because we
didn't have a whole lot (of deliveries),'' Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   Piqua Police Lt. Tom Higgins said anyone venturing out in this
weather should have winter protection kits in their vehicles,
including blankets, extra clothes, a cell phone or CB radio, shovel
and road salt or sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the best thing is to stay home,'' Higgins said. ``If you
don't have to be out there, don't go.''

POLITICAL FORCES BUILD OVER EURO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Even by Monday morning standards, when grumpiness on
the Underground is de rigueur, Paul Johnson looked especially
sullen Monday as he stood in a crowded aisle of a Northern Line
train bound for his job in the City, London's financial center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm exhausted,'' the 40-year-old financial analyst confessed.
``I worked right through the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the sleepless sacrifice of Johnson and an estimated
30,000 City bankers, stockbrokers and computer technicians that
propelled the euro off to a smooth start Monday, even though
Britain is one of four of the European Union's 15 members that are
not participating in the new single currency effort.
</P>
<P>
   If Monday marked the practical start of the euro, which was
launched New Year's Day but not traded until Monday, it also
signaled the opening salvo of what promises to be a spirited,
divisive political battle here in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   And while most of the modern political battles here have cleaved
along opposing positions staked out by the Conservative Party and
the more liberal Labor Party, it became clear Monday that the
debate over whether Britain should join Euroland will be less
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Labor leader, said he
wants to join the single currency, but will leave it to the British
people in a referendum that won't be held for at least three or
four more years. But David Owen, who was a foreign minister for a
Labor government in the late 1970s and since 1992 has served in the
House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament, emerged Monday as a
key convert to the ``No'' campaign. Owen, long considered a
``europhile'' in favor of closer cooperation in Europe, said he
drew the line at a single currency, saying it was too much a
surrender of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The former Conservative leader and prime minister, Edward Heath,
simultaneously emerged as an unlikely champion of the euro. Heath
said Britain had wasted 22 years dithering on whether to join the
European Union, and now he worries that the country will do the
same on the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The British were not the only ones bickering about the euro.
French and Germans stepped up their war of words over how long Wim
Duisenberg, the Dutch banker who last year was elected to an 8-year
term as president of the new European Central Bank, should serve.
While the French claim there was a deal that Duisenberg would step
down after four years, the Germans want Duisenberg to serve out his
full term to provide stability for the new currency.
</P>
<P>
   While the political battles raged, the markets purred. Traders
like Jeramy Batstone of NatWest Stockbrokers, a British brokerage
house, said that while the volume of euro trading was low and it
had not yet been ``stress-tested,'' the first day of trading went
smoothly nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The new currency had what analysts consider a glitch-free launch
across the continent, gaining slightly on the US dollar and British
pound. Computer systems throughout Europe were ready to begin
trading in the euro Monday morning after an army of workers, like
Johnson in London, recalibrated them to recognize the new currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro has been greeted well,'' concluded Jean-Claude
Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, breathing a sigh of relief
that echoed across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   The debut was marred only in Amsterdam, where anarchists smashed
a custard pie into the face of Dutch finance minister Gerrit Zalm
when he arrived at the Dutch stock exchange for the start of
trading. The anarchists claimed the euro is ``authoritarian.''
</P>
<P>
   London traders were considerably more hospitable to the new
currency, despite the fact that Britain is avoiding the euro, at
least for now. Few of them believe the doomsayers who predict the
end of the City as Europe's financial capital. As one trader at
Merrill Lynch observed, the multinational makeup of the City
ensures that many deals involving euros will still be made in
London.
</P>
<P>
   About six times as many foreign exchange deals currently are
made in London as Frankfurt, Europe's other major financial capital
and now home to the new European Central Bank that sets monetary
policy for the 11 nations that have joined ``Euroland,'' the new
name for the bloc using the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Because it handles about a third of the world's foreign exchange
deals and is home to some 500 international banks _ the most in the
world _ the euro will be traded in the City despite Britain's
reticence to join the currency.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, it will not be circulated as hard cash
but rather as another currency that can be used in electronic
transactions, credit card purchases and travelers checks. In
January 2002, euro coins and bills will begin to circulate, and six
months later the national currencies of the 11 countries will be
withdrawn from circulation.
</P>
<P>
   While traders and bankers shrugged at the smooth start, the
amount of retooling necessary beforehand was staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a news agency, Reuters also supplies financial
information to more than half the stockbrokers in the City. About
300 of the 700 workers used by the company worldwide during the
weekend conversion were here in London. Geoffrey Sanderson, who
leads Reuters' euro program, said 1 billion pieces of data had to
be converted, including prices for 47,000 futures, 20,000 European
share issues, and 6,000 government and corporate bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions enticed workers to take part in the
round-the-clock operation by promising bonuses and perks, and by
providing free food, rooms and, in some instances, vintage
champagne when it was all over.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Capital, a money management firm, booked 80 rooms at
the Britannia Hotel in the Docklands section so its conversion
specialists could sleep without going home.
</P>
<P>
   Marks &AMP; Spencer, Britain's biggest department store chain, said
it would accept payments in euros. But by mid-afternoon, cashiers
at the Oxford Street store, in London's busiest shopping district,
said they were still awaiting their first euro transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't hold my breath,'' a cashier sighed.

WHITE HOUSE IS RELUCTANT TO DELAY STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: INSERTS 9th graf on the Constitution's requirement for a
State of the Union address.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House expressed reluctance Monday to
delay President Clinton's scheduled Jan. 19 State of the Union
address to Congress, despite the urgings of some senators that
Clinton postpone it because of his looming Senate impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was looking
forward to outlining his proposals to a joint meeting of the House
and Senate as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of any discussions or requests from the
(congressional) leadership to adjust that date,'' Lockhart said.
``The president is working hard on his speech and plans to deliver
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican and Democratic senators urged Clinton on
Sunday to postpone his nationally-televised address until the
Senate completes action on his impeachment _ either with a Senate
trial or a resolution of censure _ for his cover-up of his sexual
dalliance with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said Sunday that it would be
``unseemly and distracting'' for Clinton to deliver the address
while an impeachment trial was underway. Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., said that it would be ``inappropriate'' for Clinton to
report to Congress while he was ``under impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, suggested that Clinton merely submit
his State of the Union address to Congress in writing.
</P>
<P>
   A speech delay would be a major blow to Clinton's effort to
portray himself as an undistracted chief executive carrying on
normal business in the face of efforts by the Republican-led
Congress to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, saying that he was choosing his words ``very
carefully,'' told reporters: ``As of now, we're planning to give
that speech on Jan. 19.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Constitution requires the president ``from to time
time'' to give Congress ``information on the State of the Union,''
it does not say when an address with such information should be
made.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and the congressional leadership agreed
last month that Clinton would deliver the address on Jan. 19.
Clinton aides said they wanted a date in the third week of January
in order to accommodate the president's plans to visit St. Louis,
Mo., the following week for the visit of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton wanted to deliver his address as scheduled
to highlight his legislative agenda for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has important work that he's doing and looks
forward to presenting it to the country,'' Lockhart said. ``The
public has come to expect the president to continue doing his job.
He'll continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers brief Clinton daily on developments with the
threatened Senate trial but Lockhart said the president was not
being diverted from official business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deals on a day-to-day basis with the business at hand here
in Washington, and (the impeachment trial) is clearly on everyone's
plate,'' Lockhart said. ``It's a subject that comes up, but it
certainly doesn't dominate the president's work day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said White House lawyers would be prepared to present
the president's defense against impeachment at a Senate trial if
the proceedings begin Monday. ``We'll be ready to go next week,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued to unveil features of his proposed federal
budget for the fiscal year 2000 that begins next Oct. 1. His State
of the Union address is expected to address those proposals, which
he will submit to Congress by Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We traditionally use this time to try to generate public
support for some of the ideas that the president will have in his
State of the Union and the budget,'' Lockhart said in response to
questions about the administration's timing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
proposed a five-year, $6.2 billion package of assistance for the
long-term care of the disabled, including a $1,000 tax credit for
an estimated 2 million Americans trying to care for disabled
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that there is not a substitute for families
being able to care for their loved ones,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``But
we sometimes forget that caregivers also need care. They, too,
carry enormous burdens.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the $5.5 billion cost of the tax
credit over five years would be offset by closing unspecified tax
loopholes that benefit corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said the
proposal was merely the beginning of an effort with Congress to
address the problem. The message to Congress, Shalala said, is
``Let's sit down and talk together,'' adding: ``I would describe it
as evolving.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton unveiled a proposed $110 billion increase in projected
Pentagon spending over six years in his nationally broadcast radio
address on Saturday. Earlier, he proposed a boost in federal
assistance to the homeless.

<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., meets Wednesday with
the Senate's 55 Republicans to search for consensus on how to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal being considered _ put forth by Gorton and Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. _ calls for a two-stage Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under their proposal, House ``managers,'' or prosecutors, would
present the case for impeachment next Monday; Clinton's defense
team would rebut the allegations on Tuesday; senators would
question the two sides on Wednesday; and the Senate would vote
Thursday on whether the House's allegations of presidential perjury
and obstruction of justice, if proven true, would warrant removal
from office.
</P>
<P>
   If proponents of Clinton's removal failed to muster the required
two-thirds majority at that point, the Senate would adjourn the
trial and move to a compromise censure resolution.

 &HT;    Old movies bring fame to a former journalist
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nick Clooney has spent a lifetime in what he calls ``this
general communications racket,'' the interlocking industry of show
biz and news and talking about both. These days, the former
anchorman _ father of George, brother of Rosemary _ is better known
than he's ever been, talking about old movies on the cable network
American Movie Classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``All films are history,'' he says. ``They tell us what we
laughed at, what we drank, what we smoked, how we felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when those old movies seem, from today's vantage, racist or
sexist. AMC shows old Charlie Chan movies, Tarzan movies with
horrific stereotypes of Africans, and Westerns that were
``demeaning, degrading or patronizing,'' in Clooney's words, in
their presentation of Native Americans. Watch a great old musical
like ``Holiday Inn'' on AMC, and there, smack in the middle, is a
minstrel number, with white actors in blackface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some black family is watching that, that's gonna jolt the hell
out of 'em,'' Clooney acknowledges. ``That's why I try to describe
it in advance. I understand the criticisms (of showing such old
movies). But we're not gonna cut that out, not gonna P.C. it. This
is how we were; that's the truth of how we felt at that instant.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his son George of ``ER'' and movie fame, Nick Clooney is a
talker, holding forth over lunch at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in
Buckhead about meeting Orson Welles, gossip about Richard Widmark,
how Henry Fonda was discovered, the state of journalism today. He's
in Atlanta this week as guest co-host of WXIA's ``Peachtree
Morning,'' the 9 a.m. talk show, along with his wife, Nina, and
their foundling dog, Spags.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, 62, almost got into movies himself, following his
sister Rosemary (``White Christmas'') to Hollywood, where he read
for Cecil B. DeMille. The producer liked his looks and his voice,
but told him, ``You look 18 and sound 40. Come back when the
qualities merge.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clooney went into the Army, got into the communications
racket, substituted for Dick Clark on ``American Bandstand,''
hosted a talk show in Cincinnati (near his home in Maysville, Ky.)
and was a TV news anchor and news director as high up as KNBC in
Los Angeles. For the past four years, he's been AMC's main
ambassador and started his own research library (600 books and
growing) to help him write his movie introductions.
</P>
<P>
   The movie that's on his mind at the moment is ``Out of Sight,''
which just beat ``Saving Private Ryan'' for best film in a surprise
vote by the National Society of Film Critics. Although the movie
was not a hit, some critics considered it George Clooney's best
work yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that great?'' he beams, then recounts the critical
reception of ``Out of Sight'' and the European box office tallies
(No. 1 in Britain for two weeks, ``No. 2 or 3 in Italy'').
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't yet talked about the win to George, who's filming his
final ``ER'' episode this week in Los Angeles (airing in late
February). But he has thought about how his life turned out,
keeping him connected to the movies, but never in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things work out the way they're supposed to work,'' he
says.

 &HT;    With today's merger of the morning Times and the afternoon Free
Press, a city mourns the passing of a journalism legacy
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA _ This time the Yankees are going, not coming. And a
lot of Chattanoogans are sad to see them leave.
</P>
<P>
   The 130-year-old Chattanooga Times _ an institution built by
Adolph Ochs, an Ohio-born rabbi's son famous for his role in making
The New York Times great _ has surrendered to its archrival, the
home-grown Chattanooga Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, the morning Times (circulation 42,000) and the
afternoon Free Press (circulation 40,000) are one morning paper.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' capitulation comes after decades of strident
squabbling between the two papers, both of which were family-owned.
Ochs' descendents _ liberal, Jewish, old-money _ ran the Times. The
McDonald family _ conservative, Christian, newer money _ owned the
Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a strange mix of philosophies,'' says Peter
Pringle, a journalism professor at the University of
Tennessee-Chattanooga. ``There's so much bad blood between them.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while _ nobody will say how long _ the new paper will
carry both names. Still, partisan readers of both papers are leery
about the merger and new, out-of-town ownership of the combined
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're damn tootin', it's very upsetting,'' says Frances
Alexander, an executive of Chattanooga's Tennessee American Water
Co. ``The Times is as much a part of our history as the Battle of
Lookout Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Bonds, a bartender at the Big River Grill, is just as
worried about what might happen to the old afternoon paper, once it
absorbs the Times. ``I've always read the Free Press,'' she says.
``It's got more of that hometown feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Ochs bought the struggling Times in 1878, the paper has
seen itself as a bastion of big-city-style journalism, trumpeting
civic progress and championing such causes as civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Press, on the other hand, was started in 1933 by a
grocer, the late Roy McDonald, who gave it away to advertise
products sold in his stores. It has always reflected a conservative
Christian viewpoint in its news columns, as well as on its
editorial page. Into the 1990s, it still referred to the Chinese as
``Reds.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Times has been known for pushing education and
national and world news on its front page, the Free Press' claim to
fame has been local coverage, fires, crime and ribbon-cuttings,
wrapped around ``grip and grin'' photographs sent in by readers.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, for example, while the Times ran photos of the
Clinton impeachment hearings on its front, the Free Press displayed
a huge picture of a local restaurant that had burned, along with a
murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two couldn't be more different,'' says Kittrell Rushing, a
journalism professor at UT-Chattanooga. ``This merger is a real
blow to the city. The professional community and the educated folks
are very much concerned they won't even recognize the new paper.
And that's a real shame, because thanks to Adolph Ochs, this is
where modern, objective journalism was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what's led to the takeover of the Times:
</P>
<P>
   After the Civil War, the Times replaced the old Chattanooga
Rebel, which had fled the city just ahead of Union Gen. William T.
Sherman's invading army. (Its staff was captured and its presses
destroyed near Valdosta, Ga.) The 19-year-old Ochs, whose family
had moved from Cincinnati to Knoxville just after the war, borrowed
$2,000 to buy the Times in 1878, vowing to ``give the news without
fear or favor.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper prospered. When The New York Times, then considered an
industry rag, went on the block in 1896, Ochs bought it and moved
to the Big Apple. But he retained his Chattanooga ties and became
the leading force for preserving historic battlefields at
Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge. He kept control
over the Times until his death in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   His only child, a daughter, inherited the paper, and she left it
to her four children. They in turn passed it to their 13 children,
who owned it in absentia until the recent sale. The family, which
continues to pump philanthropic dollars into the community, ran the
Times as an independent company, separate from The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Times owners' tried to buy the Free Press. But
its publisher, Lee Anderson, a former reporter who married into the
McDonald family, vowed never to sell to the ``Philistines.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their rivalry, the families tried to work together at
times. The Times and Free Press agreed as early as 1942 to save
costs by sharing the same building, presses and advertising and
clerical staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The families split the papers' operations in 1966, even though
that meant extra expenses. The Free Press moved to an 1880s hosiery
mill, lugged in old presses from storage and started publishing a
Sunday paper in competition with the Times. The Times fired back by
starting its own short-lived afternoon paper, the Post.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the papers entered another agreement. It required the
Times to kill its Sunday paper, leaving that lucrative market to
the Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   The competition might have continued, with the Times owning an
edge in daily circulation and the Free Press publishing the big
Sunday edition. But the Free Press' Anderson is 73, and Frank
McDonald, son of the Free Press' founder, is 69 and seriously ill.
Neither had children who wanted to take an active ownership role.
</P>
<P>
   So in March, the family sold the Free Press to Walter E. Hussman
Jr., 51, a mild-mannered but tough-minded businessman who heads
WEHCO Media of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Hussman, at 27, had taken over the Arkansas Democrat and led it
in a 17-year war with the older and larger Arkansas Gazette. He
won, defeating the powerful Gannett chain, and since 1991, Little
Rock has been a one-newspaper town.
</P>
<P>
   When Hussman bought the Free Press, the Times chose not to
compete with his empire and put itself on the block as well.
Hussman's Free Press bought it and announced the two papers would
be combined.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Holmberg, 76, Ochs' granddaughter and Times publisher for
28 years until 1992, admits that the merger is a ``very sad
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Times readers will see things and say, 'Ah, I don't
want to read this.''' Holmberg says. ``A lot of people are very
emotional about the Times. I run into people on the street who say,
'Oh, I just can't talk about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   She shares the readers' dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather was an icon in this city. I feel like I've lost
the first of my children.''
</P>
<P>
   It was her children, however, who sealed the paper's fate.
Holmberg says the next generation of her family, who all live
elsewhere, didn't think it would be worth sinking $50 million into
the Times to save it.
</P>
<P>
   But she bravely maintains that the merger won't kill her
grandfather's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Times has not died,'' declares Holmberg. ``It's going to
be reborn.'' She's optimistic that with a bigger editorial staff,
the merged paper will be better than either the old Times or Free
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Times managing editor Ron Smith, whose job ended Monday, talks
hopefully about his old paper's future as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the afternoon paper that's disappearing,'' he insists.
``The afternoon newspaper did not win the war here.''
</P>
<P>
   But everyone knows it did.
</P>
<P>
   The Times published for the last time Monday, and surviving
staff members trooped from 11th Street to 10th, from their offices
in a clean, modern structure to the Free Press' dusty old structure
with exposed water pipes and heat ducts and boxes of supplies
stacked everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Times staff took the biggest hit, with 19 of 56 staffers
given pink slips. At the Free Press, 19 of 89 lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who keeps a big, black Bible on his huge desk and who
has written Free Press editorials for decades, doesn't quite
foresee a born-again Times. Anderson, who will serve as an
associate publisher of the new paper, vows it will be based ``on
the Constitution and the Bible, like we've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson stresses that ``it'll be run from here'' because
``Walter wants a Chattanooga newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Local service is our strong point,'' he says. ``We ran 11,000
pictures last year.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, at least, the new paper will have facing editorial
pages, one on the left reflecting the Ochs tradition of liberal
views and on the right, conservative opinions of the McDonalds.
It's not clear whether this will last; Hussman's Arkansas paper has
only one editorial voice _ conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be six weeks, six months, six years or forever,''
says Paul Neely, former publisher of the Times and now an associate
publisher of the hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hussman says the combined paper should satisfy
customers of both papers. He foresees a slight drop in weekday
circulation, but growth on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that's being lost is afternoon delivery,'' he grins.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chattanoogans, though, don't see it that way. They openly
mourn the loss of their tie to Ochs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to point out, when people visit, not only Missionary
Ridge and Lookout Mountain, but to tell them that in a sense, The
New York Times started here. It's a very nice thing to be able to
say,'' says Jeff Messinger, owner of the upscale Mount Vernon
Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga native Franklin Seymour calls the merger ``a sad
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've driven up the Ochs Highway to my job for 23 years,'' he
says. ``We're losing a legacy, and we're going to feel it.''

SECRET-LOAN SCANDAL CLAIMS THIRD BLAIR OFFICIAL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A scandal that has already cost Prime Minister Tony
Blair his closest political confidant and a principal connection to
big business claimed a third government official on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Charlie Whelan, said he was leaving as press
secretary to Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, the second
most powerful man in the government. He said the ``absurd'' level
of public attention to his possible role in the departure of two
officials 12 days ago made it too difficult for him to carry on
with his job.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, Peter Mandelson, 45, the trade and industry minister
who was Blair's chief aide and architect of the Labor Party's 1997
election victory, and Geoffrey Robinson, 60, a millionaire
industrialist who served as paymaster general, quit their posts.
</P>
<P>
   Behind all three departures was a secret $625,000 home loan from
Robinson to Mandelson in 1996, which Mandelson failed to reveal
even when Robinson's outside financial affairs became the subject
of an investigation by the department Mandelson came to head.
</P>
<P>
   The episode has become the first major disruption in the smooth
operation of the 20-month-old Blair government. Blair has obtained
the highest approval ratings of any prime minister in modern
British history, but when he returns from a visit to South Africa
this week he will face challenges to his government's reputation
for discipline and control.
</P>
<P>
   Blair vigorously campaigned for office on claims that his
government would put an end to the kinds of scandals that forced
out 12 of Prime Minister John Major's ministers. And the current
incident exposes tensions between his office and Brown's that date
to the keen competition between the two men for the leadership of
the party after the death in 1994 of its former head, John Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Whelan, 44, a Brown loyalist long seen as a stoker of a
simmering feud between his boss and Mandelson, was suspected of
being the person who disclosed the secret loan arrangement between
Mandelson and Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Monday saying he would be quitting ``as soon
as an appropriate opportunity becomes available,'' Whelan denied
that he was the one who turned Mandelson in, but said he was
leaving government anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it absolutely clear that I was not responsible
for disclosing any information about Peter Mandelson's mortgage and
I refute any suggestion that I was,'' he said. ``I do, however,
take the view that the job of press secretary becomes extremely
difficult if the press secretary, and not the department he serves,
becomes the story and the subject of excessive attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Press secretaries and information management have become stories
more often in this government than in past British ones because of
the importance the Blair people attach to presentation, or
``spin.'' Alastair Campbell, a former correspondent for The Daily
Mirror who is Blair's spokesman, has insisted on a level of
coordination in the issuance of government information that has
been unseen until now in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has often been reported to be put out with Whelan's
independence and resistance to direction from 10 Downing Street. On
Monday, he bade him a blunt farewell, saying, ``I have got no doubt
whatever that he will find work that he will probably enjoy more
and which will use his talents well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whelan and Mandelson shared the same press honorific, ``spin
doctor,'' but little else. Whelan, a Communist in his youth and a
former union press officer, is affable, gruff, profane, someone who
The Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said ``never
called a spade a spade when he could call it a bloody shovel.''
Mandelson is silky and urbane, an Oxford graduate with cosmopolitan
tastes in friends and clothes who embraced the world of business
and taught the once-socialist Labor Party to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson accepted the loan from his millionaire colleague on
the Labor back benches when he decided to move from a modest
apartment to a house costing $790,000 in the fashionable Notting
Hill area of West London. He said he expected that a family
inheritance would enable him to pay it back promptly.
</P>
<P>
   Whelan fell under suspicion in the last 10 days of intense media
speculation because he is a friend of Paul Routledge, a journalist
who last year composed an admiring biography of Brown and has now
written a damning one of Mandelson, which began serialization in
The Mirror on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The information about the secret mortgage was in the first
chapter of Routledge's book, but The Guardian published it first on
Dec. 22, leading Mandelson and Robinson to resign the next day.

 &HT;    Late talks fail to rescue Hayes
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell and Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hayes Corp. on Monday laid off all but a handful of
employees, after running out of cash when bankers slammed the door
on financing for anything but a liquidation of the once-proud
company.
</P>
<P>
   Once the leading maker of analog modems, Hayes sent about 250
employees home without severance packages, apparently giving up the
ghost after months of struggle through sagging sales, feuding
executives and a stock price crashing toward zero.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the end loomed, officials were still negotiating
with potential ``white knights'' who might have purchased Hayes,
said Ron Howard, Hayes' chief executive officer. ``As late as this
weekend, we had significant interest in the sale of the company as
a going concern, but the bank wouldn't fund that.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks ended Monday, and the company moved to close down.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, which filed for bankruptcy protection Oct. 9, once
dominated the modem market. Although the company slipped into
bankruptcy in 1994, Hayes fought off takeover attempts and emerged
in 1996, an independent company with projections of $300 million in
revenue. The company reported several strong quarters and then
began to battle falling sales and disappearing profit margins. The
company had hoped to hang on while it nurtured new technologies for
high-speed connections to the Internet. But the bridge to that
future depended on either a rebound in sales or in reshaping itself
to slash costs.
</P>
<P>
   Howard on Monday declined to name potential suitors. But Hayes
had been in talks with Kaifa Technology of Taiwan and another
unnamed company that would have put the Hayes name on modems it
manufactured. Even as its debts grew steeper, Hayes officials had
hoped such a deal to outsource production would offer a way to keep
the company alive.
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations produced no deal.
</P>
<P>
   NationsCredit, which had funded the limping company after its
fall into bankruptcy protection Oct. 9, put officials on notice two
weeks ago that it would not fund efforts to find a suitor or to
keep the company in business. When Hayes failed to find alternate
sources of revenue _ a buyer or a big contract _ it had no choice
but to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done what the bank demanded, and this is an incredibly
sad day,'' said Howard, who came to the company with high hopes a
year ago in a merger with Access Beyond. ``I am sort of at the
emotional end. This has been a tear-filled day, crying with a great
group of employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Through years of turmoil, the Hayes work force had been shaved
from more than 1,200 to fewer than 500 in November, when the
company shut down its manufacturing unit. Those who stayed until
the end now must get into queue with other creditors, hoping a
liquidation will leave them a few scraps of severance.
</P>
<P>
   Workers were told Monday to attend a 3 p.m. meeting at the
company's one-story headquarters in Norcross, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   P.K. Chan, company president and manufacturing chief, passed out
a one-page letter from Howard to employees written on stationery
that proclaimed the company's 20th anniversary last year. The
letter offered little hope to employees but, then, after all the
bumps in the road, few were shocked at the turn that took them to a
dead end.
</P>
<P>
   Workers interviewed after the meeting declined to give their
names. An engineer who spent 15 years with the company said he went
to the meeting expecting bad news, but hoping the business would
continue, at least limited operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably made some bad decisions toward the end,'' he
said. But even as late as last summer, the company seemed to be
showing promise, he said. ``We had a lot of orders coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Another worker, a nine-year employee, blamed the decision made
late last year to go public, arguing that it was premature. Going
public, ``you had a higher authority to answer to.''
</P>
<P>
   Many employees who left months ago were given generous severance
checks. Not so Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody expected it (the closing), but at least we thought
we would get some severance,'' said a worker. Yet despite the lack
of an extra paycheck, ``everybody seemed to take it pretty good,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loading her minivan, one office worker said she joined the
company two and half years ago shortly after it had emerged from
its first sojourn in bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I originally came here thinking I could be on the dream team
with Mr. (founder Dennis) Hayes bringing the company back, and I
honestly thought we were going to be able to turn it around. I hate
it for Mr. Hayes,'' she said. ``He built something really good
here, and to see it go down and him get kicked out ...''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hayes has been alternately cursed and hailed for his role
in founding the company and steering it from upstart to dominance _
and then into trouble. Yet in bankruptcy court, Hayes had made an
impassioned plea that he be permitted to reject takeover bids that
ranged up to $140 million. As the prime shareholder, he would have
been the prime recipient of those offers, but he wanted the company
to remain independent and in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   To convince the judge, Hayes accepted investment that diluted
his control, hired a chief executive officer and gave up day-to-day
control of operations. But the CEO stayed less than two years.
After the merger with Access Beyond, Howard became CEO _ and the
two men did not get along.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Hayes agreed to resign as chairman of the board.
Monday, he declined to comment on the company's fate or on his own
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes Corp. owes creditors about $42 million. The company has
several hundred creditors, although the bulk of the debt is owed to
NationsCredit and a few large suppliers like Lucent Technologies,
which says it is owed $4.8 million, and another chip maker,
Rockwell Semiconductor Systems, which alleges a debt of $2.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Campbell, attorney for the committee representing
creditors, said the company is not formally being liquidated. ``In
order to have a liquidation you'd have to sell all the assets,
employ an auctioneer and so on, and that would require a court
order.''
</P>
<P>
   The next court session is set for Jan. 19, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said that while formal sale of assets has not begun, the
company is no longer in business. ``The company is being
liquidated. The company is no longer being operated as a going
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said he will remain chairman of the board but is no
longer an employee.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Hayes would mark the fall of one of Atlanta's
brightest and earliest technology stars. But while Hayes dimmed and
declined, the company was also eclipsed by newer technologies aimed
at the Internet, electronic commerce or biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes was surely no meteor, its fall taking years. And as the
light from Hayes fades, remaining employees can at least emerge
into a vibrant economy, a bustling market for high-tech talent.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Reiser, a software engineer, joined the company three
years ago. Like many colleagues, he started sending out resumes in
recent months after growing difficulties grew ever more grim. He
does not expect to be without comparable work for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some good prospects,'' Reiser said.
</P>

Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

APPLE DEVOTEES GATHER WITH NEW CONFIDENCE ABOUT COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly two years after Apple Computer Inc.
advertisements began imploring computer users to ``think
different,'' the company has given the entire industry plenty to
think about.
</P>
<P>
   After a long period of massive losses and plummeting sales for
its Macintosh computers, Apple has mounted a comeback that has
astonished the industry. Its new iMac personal computer has become
the best-selling desktop machine in America, boosting Apple's share
of the market for the first time in years. Better yet, the company
is making money again _ $309 million in fiscal year 1998, which
ended in September.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that this week's MacWorld, a gathering in San
Francisco of Apple computer users, is the most upbeat in a long
time. A crowd of about 600 responded Monday with lusty cheers to
the greeting from computer-industry journalist David Pogue:
``Welcome to the first MacWorld conference that nobody thinks will
be the last MacWorld conference.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the dramatic revival of Apple's fortunes, severe
challenges lie ahead. Apple is stable and profitable once again,
but it's an open question whether the company can do what it must
to secure its long-term survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did the phase where they cut and tightened up and got
into shape,'' said Bruce Stephen, industry analyst with
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. Although Apple has
gained some market share, he added, ``we think they're going to be
a niche player.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, a close look at Apple's 1998 results shows that most
of the company's profit came from cost cutting, including the
elimination of 4,200 jobs and a reduction in spending on research
and development. Lower spending on research is a risky move for a
high-tech company whose future depends on a steady stream of new
products.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, unit sales of Macintosh computers actually declined
last fiscal year, to 2.763 million, from 2.874 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, Apple introduced iMac, and the elegant desktop
machine has led to a burst of new Macintosh sales. The market
research firm PC Data Inc. reported last week that Apple's iMac was
the best-selling personal computer in America in November. The iMac
represented 9.1 percent of all PCs sold, by dollar volume, in
November, up from 6 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac, priced at $1,300, was the company's attempt to regain
a foothold in the home computer market. But anecdotal evidence
suggests that the iMac is also finding a place in many businesses,
as an inexpensive computer that connects easily to corporate data
networks. Keith Geck, Apple's vice president for business sales,
cited a recent sale of 300 iMacs to Genentech Inc. of San
Francisco, a major biopharmaceutical firm. ``We're beginning to see
good acceptance of iMac inside organizations,'' Geck said.
</P>
<P>
   But barriers to greater acceptance of Macintosh computers remain
formidable. Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a
computer-industry research firm, sobered the crowd by declaring
that Macs will never make up more than 10 percent of all desktop
machines. ``Whether we like it or not,'' he warned, ``the desktop
war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner, of course, was rival Microsoft Corp., whose Windows
software is on well over 90 percent of the world's desktop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Apple can't hope to prevail over the long run by simply selling
to its base of loyal customers, Bajarin said. ``They need new users
if Apple is to be around five years from now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bajarin hopes the company can find these new users in millions
of households which still lack cheap, easy-to-use computing
devices. Apple, he argued, is well-placed to serve that market.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry-watchers had expected Apple to address the home
computing market this week by showing off a new portable _ a sort
of entry-level laptop . Apple is known to be working on such
devices, but last week company officials flatly denied that these
machines would be on display at MacWorld.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rumors abound that during his keynote speech on Tuesday,
Apple's interim chief executive officer Steve Jobs will make some
dramatic announcements. He's expected to provide details about a
new series of high-end Macs codenamed Yosemite, and intended for
heavy-duty users in publishing, graphic arts and the sciences. He
may also announce dramatic price cuts
</P>
<P>
   on the iMac that could bring the price of a basic unit below
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Because Apple makes hardware as well as software, the company
has no choice but to lower prices, in Bajarin's view. ``The whole
concept of premium pricing is dead,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unclear whether Apple can maintain its recent level of
profits while selling cheaper machines. The company's gross margin
on sales was a healthy 25 percent in the last quarter of fiscal
1998, but even Apple officials predict that this will come down
because of the need to slash prices.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important topic on the MacWorld agenda will be
the latest news about Mac OS X, the company's long-delayed new
operating system which is supposed to debut this year. OS X, built
around a core based on the advanced Unix operating system, could
finally make the Mac competitive with Microsoft Windows NT among
high-end operating systems for running corporate computer networks.
And the new version of Windows NT, renamed Windows 2000, has
suffered delays, giving Mac OS X an opportunity to win new
corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Macintosh loyalists gathered here are expecting mainly good
news from Jobs. But nobody is ready to declare victory yet. ``These
guys are realistic,'' said Bajarin. ``They can get into a rah-rah,
but at the end of the day, these people know as well as anyone that
this company is still fighting for its life.''

JERRY QUARRY, 53, BOXER BATTERED BY YEARS IN THE RING
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Quarry, a heavyweight contender of the late 1960s and
early '70s who faced the sport's greatest names of his era and then
spent his final years debilitated by boxing-induced brain damage,
died Sunday at Twin Cities Community Hospital in Templeton, Calif.
He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   Quarry, who lived with relatives in Paso Robles, Calif.,
suffered complications of pneumonia that had been brought on by
dementia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   He fought Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, had two
shots at the heavyweight championship, earned $2 million in purses
and posted a record of 53-9-4 with 33 knockouts. But by age 50,
Quarry experienced severe memory loss and crippled motor skills
from dementia pugilistica _ brain damage caused by repeated blows
to the head. His only income was said to have been Social Security
disability checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hallucinates, he hears voices,'' his brother James, who
cared for Quarry at his home in Hemet, Calif., told an interviewer
in 1995. ``When he walks off, we have to go find him. Sometimes we
can't find him, and we have to call the police and they bring him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Bakersfield, Calif., Quarry was raised to fight by
his father, Jack, an amateur boxer in his youth and a man with the
words ``Hard Luck'' tattooed on his knuckles and the motto ``A
Quarry Never Quits.'' The father went west from the Texas cotton
patches in the Depression years, and with his wife, Arwanda, raised
his children in migrant labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heritage was `The Grapes of Wrath,''' Quarry once said.
</P>
<P>
   He first put on boxing gloves at age 3, won a junior Golden
Gloves title at age 8 and fought more than 200 amateur bouts before
turning pro in 1965, with his father a co-manager.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot 195-pounder, Quarry was an adept counterpuncher with a
fine left hook, but a fighter who was easily cut. In a division
dominated by black fighters, he was sometimes at the center of
racial hype. Quarry was referred to in one magazine article as
``The Great White Hope'' and in another as ``Hungry, White and
22.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarry had two bouts in Los Angeles in 1967 against Patterson,
the former heavyweight champion, who was 10 years older than
Quarry. The first fight was a draw and the second one a majority
victory for Quarry in an elimination fight for the World Boxing
Association title that had been stripped from Ali for refusing to
submit to the military draft. In April 1968, Quarry lost a majority
decision to Jimmy Ellis in his bid to win the WBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Quarry fought a furious bout with Frazier at Madison Square
Garden in June 1969, seeking Frazier's share of the heavyweight
title that was recognized by New York and five other states. The
fighters exchanged head-rattling blows through the first round in a
bout stopped after seven rounds with Quarry bleeding severely from
a cut and his eyes closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quarry had an appeal that made the public snap up tickets,''
Frazier would recall. ``Why not? He was a good-looking Irish kid
with a nice smile and an engaging boy-next-door manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali's first bout on returning to the ring was with Quarry on
Oct. 26, 1970, in Atlanta. Ali dominated Quarry, stopping him in
the third round after cutting him severely. But it was Quarry's
biggest payday, a purse of $338,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ali stopped him again, in seven rounds, two years later, and
after Quarry defeated Ron Lyle and Earnie Shavers, he was knocked
out by Frazier in five rounds in June 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Quarry retired in 1975, made brief comebacks in 1977 and 1983
and then, in a final return in 1992 at age 47, took a beating from
an unknown fighter in a six-round bout in Aurora, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his parents and his brother James, Quarry is
survived by three children; two brothers who also boxed, Mike and
Bobby, and four sisters.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990's, James Quarry started a Jerry Quarry
Foundation to raise money for him and other boxers with dementia.
When Quarry was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in
October 1995, he was so disabled that he could not sign his name
for autograph-seekers.

BELL ATLANTIC WOULD GAIN NATIONAL REACH WITH AIRTOUCH DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp.'s proposed acquisition of AirTouch
Communications Inc. would become a second linchpin of the New
York-based telephone carrier's plans to become a nationwide player
in telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which has lost some wireless telephone customers
since AT&AMP;T Corp. launched its national single-rate calling program
last year, would be better able to compete against AT&AMP;T with a
one-rate service coast-to-coast.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of having a national wireless footprint akin to
AT&AMP;T's _ is the most immediate reason why Bell Atlantic wants to
spend around $45 billion to acquire AirTouch Communications of San
Francisco in a stock swap. AirTouch would provide Bell Atlantic
with a dominant West Coast presence in wireless.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier strategic move to expand coast to coast, Bell
Atlantic agreed to buy GTE Corp. for $52.9 billion, a deal expected
to close later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic Mobile stressed that
the complex negotiations are continuing and that no definitive
agreement has been completed. Over the weekend, both companies
confirmed they are in merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are already partners in a company, called PrimeCo
Personal Communications, which offers wireless digital services in
communities between the two coasts that are not served by either
AirTouch or Bell Atlantic .
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch is the leading mobile telephone carrier in California
and other West Coast markets and, like Bell Atlantic, lacks a
national calling program like AT&AMP;T's Digital One-Rate, which
provides customers with a single rate for a fixed number of
minutes, eliminating ``roaming,'' long distance and other fees.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T owns most of its nationwide wireless network, enabling it
to hold down costs. By contrast, Bell Atlantic, whose mobile
telephone service is largely limited to 13 East Coast states, must
rely on other regional carriers to complete calls. Because Bell
Atlantic must access fees to the other carriers, its single-rate
plan is more costly.
</P>
<P>
   With the expected acquisition of GTE Corp., which serves parts
of California, Texas, Tennessee and several other states states
plus scattered markets nationwide, Bell Atlantic would still lack a
cohesive wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   The AirTouch combination, along with PrimeCo, would catapult
Bell Atlantic into the top four national wireless telephone
carriers along with AT&AMP;T, Sprint PCS and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T changed the wireless market with its One-Rate program and
Bell Atlantic knows that to compete nationwide it must go
nationwide and spread out its reach plus lower its overall costs,''
said Judy Reed Smith, president of Atlantic ACM, a Boston
telecommunicaitons consulting and research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's wireless expansion quest is also a hedge against
expected declines in local and long distance calls over today's
telephone wires.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile telephone traffic is growing by leaps and may soon
eclipse local phone service as more and more people turn to cel
phones instead of traditional phones for everyday calling,
according to several market analysts. To make sure Bell Atlantic
does not lose its current customers to AT&AMP;T, Sprint or other
nationwide cellular telephone carriers, Bell Atlantic wants to
become a national wireless carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will start to see this year a lot of price reductions to
where wireless service is going to be the dominant voice
communications technology in about five years,'' predicted Andrew
Cole, senior manager of the wireless practice at Renaissance
Worldwide, Inc., a Stamford, Conn. consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``All wireless carriers need to reduce their costs and rates,
which are now 9 cents to 17 cents (a minute), to around 3 cents in
the near future. And if Bell Atlantic wants to be a major
telecommunications player it must expand its wireless operations to
be cost competitive with AT&AMP;T, Sprint and other carriers.'' said
Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it remains uncertain whether Bell Atlantic and AirTouch
could strike a deal soon as Bell Atlantic reportedly wants to avoid
paying a big premium in its bid for the largest wireless phone
company.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, AirTouch shares closed at 68 1/4, down 4 3/16 while Bell
Atlantic dipped 2 1/16 to 51 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   If Bell Atlantic and AirTouch reach stalemate in their
negotiations, several other potential buyers could emerge,
including MCI Worldcom Inc., which unlike AT&AMP;T and Sprint, doesn't
own a wireless service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie Ebbers (MCI Worldcom chairman) has said in the past
year that he understands the strategic importance of owning a
wireless asset, '' said Scott Wright, telecommunications analyst
for Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``And while there does not appear to be anyone
else in the wings, the rumored terms from Bell Atlantic may be
disappointing.'' ''

IMF CONSIDERING A MAJOR OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund, sharply criticized
for how it handled crises from Southeast Asia to Russia, is
discussing an overhaul of the fund's operations that could let it
intervene directly in national economies long before they get into
deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas being discussed within the fund _ and by outsiders
like the billionaire investor George Soros _ build upon and go
substantially beyond proposals made by President Clinton and
leaders of other industrial powers in October.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, trying to calm the panic among investors who were
pulling out of developing nations, the administration backed some
cautious proposals that would allow the fund to act earlier, before
currencies collapsed and economic ``contagion'' spread around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   The first real experiment with a new approach began in November,
when the IMF put together a $41 billion ``precautionary'' loan
package for Brazil, hoping that early intervention would prevent
the kind of crisis that struck Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The central idea now being discussed within the IMF _ and
outlined in a speech Sunday by Stanley Fischer, the fund's No. 2
official _ is to turn the fund into a ``lender of last resort''
that could make available pools of money for countries that, like
Brazil, appear threatened by global economic forces beyond their
control. Fischer noted that the fund is increasingly being pushed
into that role anyway, but stressed that ``the job can surely be
done better.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing it better, though, is no easy task, and the Clinton
administration made it clear on Monday that it has reservations
about a grand expansion of the fund's role in setting up
multi-billion dollar ``precautionary'' credit lines for countries
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of interesting proposals out there in this
area, but there are a number of concerns associated with all of
them,'' said one senior Treasury official, who spoke only on the
condition that his name not be used.``We're still working through
how to address those concerns, and whether we can adequately
address them at all.''
</P>
<P>
   A system for providing credit lines, while designed to head off
trouble, could create some new risks. The IMF has shown little
ability to predict which nations are most at risk of being struck
by economic crises. Few anticipated, for example, that the economic
collapse in Thailand would turn into a global panic.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there remains the problem of what to do about nations
like Russia, which have resisted the kind of real economic reforms
that would qualify them for more IMF aid. But as last summer's
economic debacle showed, when countries as large and strategically
vital as Russia get into trouble, the West feels compelled to
provide aid anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Fischer, the one-time chairman of the
economics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
stressed that he was not seeking to ``turn the IMF into some kind
of superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything we are trying to do works, there shouldn't be
five crises in a year, as we've just had, and the IMF should be
able to do less lending rather than more,'' he said. ``The whole
idea is prevention. If there is a crisis every two months, we won't
be able to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said that he was speaking for himself, but acknowledged
that many of the ideas had been widely discussed within the fund in
recent months. So has the question of how the widely criticized
institution can better its image.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the IMF hired Edelman Public Relations Worldwide
and Wirthlin Worldwide, a polling firm, to recommend how the fund
could better explain itself around the world. That may be an
especially difficult task in Asia and Russia, where the fund's
prescriptions _ including the raising of interest rates _ are now
blamed by many for deepening the recessions that the countries are
now struggling to end.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Fischer's proposal would reward countries for good
behavior _ as defined by the IMF and its board, which is dominated
by the United States, Japan, and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Countries that strictly supervise their banking systems, that
disclose far more information about their financial state, and that
balance their budgets would ``pre-qualify'' for help from the IMF.
Presumably investors would be reassured, and currency speculators
would not take the risk of betting against that nation's currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``For such a scheme to work, lender-of-last-resort loans would
have to be denied to countries that do not qualify,'' Fischer said
in his speech to the American Economic Association. To deal with
that problem, Fischer said, the IMF may charge higher interest
rates to countries that do not meet the fund's criteria or make
those countries agree to tougher conditions once they come to the
IMF for help.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were echoes of Fischer's proposal in an article by Soros
on Monday in The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   Soros argued that the IMF should act more like an international
central bank, that in a crisis would ``impose conditions not only
on the country concerned but also on the creditors'' who lent the
country money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Booms and busts would not be banished altogether, but the IMF,
in its new incarnation, could also act as a kind of international
central bank, regulating the environment for international capital
flows.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, that idea would encounter considerable resistance
both within Congress and among developing nations. In both places,
suspicions of the IMF run high, and many countries have recoiled at
the idea that the fund, in return for offering its aid, could
dictate economic and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moment at least,'' Lawrence H. Summers, the deputy
Treasury secretary, said in a speech on Monday, ``it is difficult
to imagine nations ceding control over their money or their banks
to an international institution.''

 &HT;    Sunday's loss may send Holmgren packing
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after the season ended for Green Bay coach
Mike Holmgren, his stint with the Packers likely ended as well. The
team's gut-wrenching Sunday defeat at San Francisco meant other NFL
clubs could seek permission to discuss job vacancies with Holmgren.
Three teams _ Baltimore, Philadelphia and Seattle _ all phoned
Green Bay president Bob Harlan and general manager Ron Wolf on
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   According to his contract, which runs through the 1999 campaign,
Holmgren can leave the Packers for a job that provides him the dual
roles of coach and general manager. A team would have to send Green
Bay its second-round draft choice as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of speculation that he would replace Steve Mariucci
in San Francisco, it now appears Holmgren's likely landing spot is
Seattle. Owner Paul Allen, who tried to hire both Holmgren and Wolf
at various times last season, certainly has the financial
wherewithal to propose a blockbuster deal.
</P>
<P>
   League insiders and Green Bay officials told the
Journal-Constitution on Monday that a contract with Seattle could
be worked out within 48 hours. Through club president Bob Whitsitt,
the Seahawks are offering a five-year deal worth $4.2 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows what all the stipulations are in (Holmgren's)
contract with us,'' Wolf said. ''I'm under the assumption I still
have a coach for now. Mike has a window where he can look at other
things, but our goal remains keeping him here.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems unlikely. In August, the Pack offered Holmgren a
contract extension worth close to $3 million annually and he
rejected it. Wolf has told confidants in the last 24 hours that he
feels Holmgren is off to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren could not be reached for comment but his agent, Bob
Lamonte, acknowledged he had a ''hectic day'' on Monday dealing
with his coveted client's options. In his seven seasons in Green
Bay, Holmgren has a record of 84-42.
</P>
<P>
   So who might coach the Packers next season? Wolf almost
certainly will not promote
</P>
<P>
   offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis or quarterbacks coach Andy
Reid, but those close to him feel he has had someone in mind for a
few weeks. It's believed Wolf talked to New York Jets assistant
head coach Bill Belichick. But the more likely successor to
Holmgren is former Philadelphia head coach Ray Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys codgers
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys looked old and used-up in Saturday's loss to Arizona
and no one more so than 13-year veteran guard Nate Newton. The
Cardinals' brilliant defensive game plan exploited the ''A'' gap
between center Mike Kiselak and Newton for several big plays by
linebackers Mark Maddox and Jamir Miller. But Newton, 37, wasn't
the only player who showed his age. Michael Irvin couldn't shake
the coverage of corner Aeneas Williams. Quarterback Troy Aikman
never demonstrated a sense of urgency. Tackle Erik Williams looked
confounded at times. ''This is not a young team and it's not
getting any younger,'' Deion Sanders warned afterwards. Despite the
denials of owner Jerry Jones, a major overhaul is in order.
</P>
<P>
   Chomping for Champ
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Bengals own the third overall selection in the
'99 draft and, while it's early, seem to be leaning toward choosing
a cornerback. Toward that end, the Bengals very quietly dispatched
defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau to the Georgia Dome last week to
watch Champ Bailey in the Peach Bowl. Because his paperwork for
entering the draft had not been finalized, scouts cannot yet
comment on Bailey. The Bengals feel they will lose corner Ashley
Ambrose in free agency and their other starter in '98 was rookie
Artrell Hawkins, a second-round choice.
</P>
<P>
   Art-ful dodger
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable element about Art Shell's denial he would be
interviewed by Cleveland Browns president Carmen Policy is that
league officials desperately wanted to get the word out on the
Falcons offensive line coach. In fact, NFL operatives were leaking
news of the interview to selected media on Saturday. Yet when Shell
was contacted by the Journal-Constitution, he claimed the reports
were wrong. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue knows he has a public
relations nightmare. Counting George Seifert in Carolina, there
have been 17 head coaching changes since Tony Dungy was hired in
Tampa Bay and none of the jobs went to minority candidates. League
officials have been phoning owners and requesting they be sensitive
to the race issue, and some have been. Former Philadelphia
defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas interviewed Monday for the head
coaching job in Baltimore. Current Kansas City offensive
coordinator Jimmy Raye will interview for the vacancy in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news Bears
</P>
<P>
   In addition to getting permission to talk with Raye, the Bears
also plan to meet with Chiefs defensive coordinator Gunther
Cuningham, Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Jim Haslett and former
UCLA coach Terry Donahue. There is a possibility Chicago will talk
with Lewis and Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching carousel
</P>
<P>
   Haslett, who will interview today in Seattle, may have
overplayed his hand in Philly, where he is viewed as the
front-runner. He reportedly told operations director Tom Modrak he
wants a seven-year contract and a $2.9 million budget for
assistants. After his interview in Seattle, Haslett will head to
Baltimore. . . . The Bears will have not made contact with Hall of
Fame linebacker Mike Singletary, who is lobbying for a shot at the
job. . . . San Diego GM Bobby Beathard is very interested in Oregon
State coach Mike Riley. . . . Although Falcons defensive
coordinator Rich Brooks said he has not been contacted about the
opening at the University of Washington, some people on the West
Coast are pushing hard for him there. . . . Rams owner Georgia
Frontiere will meet with her football braintrust in (of all places)
the new-age Mecca of Sedona, Ariz., today. It is believed she'll
agree with team president John Shaw that Dick Vermeil be retained
for another year. . . . Mike White could replace Jerry Rhome as
Rams offensive boss. . . . New England personnel director Bobby
Grier interviewed each player individually on Monday and asked each
about coach Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   The zebras
</P>
<P>
   In the press box at San Francisco on Sunday, director of
officiating Jerry Seeman told anyone who would listen that game
officials ruled correctly the day before on the play when it
appeared Buffalo wide receiver Andre Reed had scored against Miami.
Seeman was conspicuously quiet, though, when officials blew a call
on a Jerry Rice fumble that would have ended the 49ers comeback.
Second-year field judge Kevin Mack, who was closest to the fumble,
seemed to freeze on the play. Veteran line judge Jeff Bergman
instead came across to incorrectly rule that Rice's knee was down
before the fumble.

NEW GOVERNOR PROCLAIMS ERA OF `HIGHER EXPECTATIONS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Declaring ``a time to do great things again,'' Gray
Davis took office Monday as the 37th governor of California,
pledging to overhaul the troubled public schools of the nation's
most populous state as the centerpiece of his efforts to shepherd
its growth and preserve its prosperity in a new century.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural address, Davis, the first Democrat to hold the
state's top job in 16 years, sounded forceful notes of contrast
with his Republican predecessor, Pete Wilson, and to a lesser
degree with his onetime boss, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.,
whose '70s-era skepticism led him to proclaim a time of lower
expectations for the Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we begin a new chapter in the history of California: The
era of higher expectations,'' said Davis, who began his political
career as Brown's chief of staff, but Monday sounded like a more
optimistic Democratic forbear, Brown's father, Pat, who presided
over the state's explosive growth in the 1950s and '60s. ``We will
embark in a new direction guided by our lasting values.''
</P>
<P>
   After thanking Wilson for cooperating in the transition to a new
administration, Davis several times implicitly rebuked his
predecessor's highly publicized campaigns against affirmative
action and illegal immigration, telling a cheering audience at the
Memorial Auditorium here that ``you can finally ring down the
curtain on the politics of division.'' Those words left Wilson and
his wife, Gayle, the only people seated on the stage amid a
thunderous standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis, 56, a cautious, career politician who has spent most
of his adult life aiming for the job he assumed Monday, made it
clear that he plans no radical change, though Democrats control all
three branches of state government for the first time since Jerry
Brown's day. Instead, Davis repeated the moderate mantra that
helped him win a 20-point victory over his conservative Republican
opponent, former State Attorney General Dan Lungren, last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will govern neither from the right nor the left, but from
the center, propelled not by ideology, but by common sense that
seeks better results,'' Davis told a crowd that included Vice
President Al Gore and former Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is to begin work in earnest this week, when he presents
his first budget on Friday and, keeping a campaign promise, calls a
special session of the State Legislature to focus on improving
school accountability, increasing teacher preparation and assuring
that every child learns to read by the end of the third grade. None
of those tasks will be easy for Davis, who won office with strong
support from the state teachers union, which feuded bitterly with
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis fired a not-so-subtle warning shot across the
teachers' bow Monday, acknowledging: ``Yes, there are some
deficient teachers and principals out there,'' and adding: ``Under
my administration, they will either get better _ or they will be
encouraged to find another line of work.'' And he vowed: ``The time
has come to restore California's public schools to greatness. The
voters demand it, our future depends on it, and I am determined to
make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican minority leader of the State Assembly, Rod
Pacheco of Riverside, said he agreed with ``a lot of what I
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican themes,'' Pacheco said. ``That's good. We'll do
what we can to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much Davis can do about education in the short term
remains to be seen. In the last two years of Wilson's
administration, the legislature and voters approved several
changes, from smaller class sizes for early elementary grades to
mandatory testing of students to an end to most bilingual
education, that are still being phased in. And despite a booming
economy, state and local government budgets remain relatively
tight, in part because of restrictions on taxation like Proposition
13, the 1978 ballot measure that capped local property tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   But while Davis has made it clear that he will not try to reopen
past policy debates, like the ballot measure that overturned
affirmative action programs, he has already sent some signals of
change, like appointing the state's first black and Asian cabinet
members. And with a 23-year career in politics, Davis, who
campaigned against a field of richer, flashier Democratic rivals
with the slogan, ``Experience Money Can't Buy,'' has a good idea of
what he may be in for.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his career, as a state assemblyman, controller and,
for the last four years, lieutenant governor, Davis was mocked as a
tireless fund-raiser, who rode his staff hard and was as bland as
his first name. But he is having the last laugh now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, sometimes a person meets his moment,'' Davis said in
an interview published Monday in The Sacramento Bee. ``I have
always been a pragmatist and moderate by nature. I have always been
more interested in solving people's problems than in espousing a
rigid ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read all these commentaries about me, and they're always
saying how dull and stodgy and predictable, but that's just the way
I am,'' he added. ``Happily, the people were in the mood for the
kind of person that I am.''

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The euro had a nearly flawless debut in
world markets on Monday as European financial institutions opened
for business without a hitch and Europe's new single currency
climbed in value against other major currencies.
</P>
<P>
   From London to Paris to Frankfurt and beyond, stock exchanges
and banks opened serenely, despite a grueling weekend in which
millions of computers had to be reprogrammed to handle euros.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are observing today is the natural and happy birth of
the euro,'' said Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the Bank of
France.
</P>
<P>
   In its first full day of trading, the euro opened at $1.17 and
climbed to more than $1.19 before settling at $1.18. Far from being
unsettled by the uncertainty or technical glitches, the stock
markets in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Madrid all jumped by 5
percent or more on the euro's first day in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which has thus far refused to adopt the euro, had a
less euphoric day. The FTSE stock index ended roughly even while
the pound slipped against the euro.
</P>
<P>
   On European streets, there was little sign that anything had
changed. Even in downtown Frankfurt, home to the European Central
Bank, few stores were posting prices in euros.
</P>
<P>
   At Kaufhof, an upscale department store in the city's financial
center, signs boasted, ``We will make you ready for the euro,'' but
none of the prices were listed in euros.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of people were befuddled. Because euros will be
usable only for electronic payments until Jan. 1, 2002, some German
bank customers did not understand why their banks would not give
them euros in cash. Others were annoyed that banks were suddenly
ordering them to identify the currency they were using when writing
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Even bank employees were perplexed about how exactly to open a
bank account denominated in euros.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a sort of experiment,'' said Monique Pouzet, a
teller at Credit Commercial de France in Paris as she opened a
binder marked ``Memento euro.'' After a moment's study and a few
keystrokes, Ms. Pouzet reported with a smile that the experiment
was a success. ``You can pick up your euro checkbook in about one
week, apparently,'' she told a customer.
</P>
<P>
   Traders, bankers and government officials warned that it would
take several more days to know for sure whether the technical
conversion was successful. But the evidence on Monday pointed to a
remarkably smooth start for the euro and to its acceptance as a
serious competitor of the dollar as an international currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, there is absolutely no problem at all,'' said
Michael Bartmann, a securities dealer on the floor of the Frankfurt
stock exchange. ``The only problem is that people have to get used
to the new numbers. Trading volumes are very low right now,
probably because people need time to get adjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Though individual institutions all seemed to function well on
Monday, the real test will come when banks and brokerage firms
process their transactions after the markets close. Bank executives
said it would take several days of trading before the full range of
financial institutions _ banks, brokerage firms and settlement
systems _ have had a chance to thoroughly interact with one another
in settling accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we declare this a complete triumph, let's just wait
until the settlement is done of the first few trades,'' said Graham
Bishop, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``Once we have pushed
through to the end-of-the-week settlements, then people will feel a
lot happier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still two important milestones in front of us,''
said Peter Wolf-Koeppen, head of euro projects at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt. ``One of them comes today when we have to post all the
day's transactions to all the accounts. The other will be in
settling transactions with other institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   One trader in Frankfurt said: ``There is definitely potential
for problems. What could happen is that you get orders in euros and
in marks, and in that case you would see complete chaos. We will
have to wait and see whether the banks have fully implemented the
conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, industry executives and European central bankers
said the conversion seemed a success. Most central banks, including
the German Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy, said they had received
no distress reports during the weekend conversion or on Monday. And
both big and small financial institutions said the conversion had
been easier and faster than they had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, which had more than 3,000 workers on duty over
the weekend, said Monday that it had reprogrammed all its computers
by 10 a.m. Sunday. In London, Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and
Salomon Smith Barney had wrapped up their work by Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went absolutely perfectly, much faster than in our dress
rehearsals,'' said Detlev Rahmsdorf, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Shivers, head of Merrill Lynch's euro conversion
project, was equally optimistic. ``It went tremendously and far
exceeded our expectations,'' he said Monday afternoon in London.
``It's been unprecedented _ very unusual to see an industry pull
together and accomplish something like this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though many industry experts worry that smaller banks may turn
out to be weak links in the chain of processing payments,
executives at several smaller institutions said their conversion to
the euro seemed to go smoothly, too.
</P>
<P>
   Vincenzo De Bustis, chief executive of Banca del Salento in
southern Italy, said all the bank's operations seemed to function
properly when business started Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked on the conversion all weekend,'' De Bustis said. As
of early Monday morning, ``exchange operations and transfers both
within Italy and abroad went without any problems,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Even before European markets opened Monday morning, currency
traders in Australia and Asia had bid up the price of euros, and
there was considerable evidence that Asian fund managers were
buying euros as a hedge against global economic turmoil. The
buoyancy continued after European markets opened, though traders
noted that the volume of activity in both stock and currency
markets was very low.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said it would be a mistake to read much significance
into the euro's rising price, but they said the activity on Monday
was consistent with the general strength that individual European
currencies have enjoyed for much of the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We predicted that the euro will be a stable currency, and that
is what we are seeing today,'' said Petra Koehler, a senior
economist at Dresdner Bank. ``I think there was also some relief
that the conversion went well.''
</P>
<P>
   All the effort for conversion was of little interest to ordinary
bank customers and shoppers, who have heard so much for so long
about the euro but cannot feel the soft comfort of a thick wad of
bills or drop a shiny new euro coin into a vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that most German stores continued to post prices only
in marks on Monday reflected, in part, a residual hostility toward
the new currency among many Germans, who still treasure the mark as
an anchor of stability.
</P>
<P>
   But it also reflects the fact that most people don't really need
to do anything in euros for the time being. Executives of Deutsche
Bank and Commerzbank said that far less than 1 percent of their
customers had asked for euro-denominated bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro is a great thing for Europe, but it makes no
difference to me in my daily life,'' said Egon Weber, a customer at
Frankfurter Volksbank. ``If I had a lot of customers in other
countries, a euro account might be useful. But for the moment,
there isn't any point.''
</P>
<P>
   Many German bank customers may soon be furious about the euro.
Some banks say they will not process bank transfers if customers
forget to specify on the form whether the payment is in euros or
marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a customer forgets to indicate the currency, we will have
to clarify each case individually,'' said Herbert Staub, a board
member at Frankfurter Sparkasse, a savings bank.
</P>
<P>
   In France, where the dream of a single European currency first
took hold, stores and banks were far more hospitable to the euro.
</P>
<P>
   At the Virgin Megastore on the Champs-Elysees and at Galeries
Lafayette, one of the flashiest department stores in downtown
Paris, clerks said they had been taking euro-denominated checks
since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Michel-Edouard Leclerc, head of the Leclerc chain of
hypermarkets, went so far last weekend as to take a group of
journalists along on a shopping trip in which he paid for his
purchases with euro-checks. And Le Printemps, another big
department store, is offering until Jan. 15 to deliver anything
ordered from its Internet site anywhere in Europe for 3 euros.

BOSTON SWEETENS BID FOR DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Shoring up potential holes in Boston's bid for the 2000
Democratic National Convention, the city added another $1 million
in cash and services to its $32.4 million proposal in the home
stretch of the siting contest.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they were hopeful that throwing in a
cutting-edge web site, another $750,000 for the media pavillion,
and free airport shuttle service might clinch a Hub victory over
the other finalists, Denver and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's smoke coming out of the smokestack and it's white
smoke,'' quipped Mayor Thomas M. Menino, in reference to the signal
used by the College of Cardinals after they successfully choose a
new pope.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is believed to be the first of the final three to fatten
its offer, but details of each bid are being jealousy guarded, said
Howard Leibowitz, Menino's point person on the convention proposal.
</P>
<P>
   US Senator Edward M. Kennedy lauded the sweetening of Boston's
bid as further proof the city ``has the resources and facilities to
be the best site for the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials are especially proud of the high-tech plan,
dubbed ``America's web of democracy,'' which proposes the first
Internet-friendly political convention.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the software and technical know-how contributed by local
computer gurus, 3Comm has offered to donate palm-size computers for
floor delegates, according to bid documents.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, spearheaded by local software pioneer John J.
Cullinane, focuses heavily on direct contact between voters and
party officials, as well as a separate educational site for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering two-way communication between delegates,
constituents, and the DNC, the system would also hawk Boston
examples of pet programs of the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates could also send a ``letter from Boston'' to their
hometown paper each day and the media could hold ``virtual press
conferences'' via the website, according to bid plans.
</P>
<P>
   While Denver has also hawked its high-tech capabilities in its
bid, Leibowitz said the DNC site committee specifically invited
Boston to flesh out a technology proposal because of the city's
Internet industry reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newsweek had us as one of the top Internet cities _ they
didn't have either of the other two,'' said Leibowitz.
</P>
<P>
   At this nail-biting stage, all the conventional wisdom is mere
speculation, however.
</P>
<P>
   The spirits of Denver and Boston officials were buoyed after Los
Angeles, the frontrunner, scored low marks in the DNC's follow-up
site visit last month. LA reportedly did not have detailed plans on
convention logistics and, with a Republican mayor, had no elected
official to sign off on commitments for police and other government
services.
</P>
<P>
   After reported success of the DNC visit to Denver, Boston
officials decided to firm up areas that had left questions
unanswered when DNC site panel members were here last month.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the DNC visit, city Transportation Director
Andrea D'Amato had simply reassured the committee that Boston could
devise a shuttle service for delegates, given its success at
transporting runners and officials for the 100th Boston Marathon
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But when Denver's shuttle service won kudos from the DNC, Boston
officials dropped their nonchalance, and created plans and obtained
Massport sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Boston has enhanced its $1.5 million plans to upgrade
the FleetCenter parking structure for media work space by $750,000.
DNC panelists asked a lot of questions about the media
accommodations when they were here.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't use the money for the media, Leibowitz said,
``They can spend it on whatever they want.''

 NASDAQ AT NEW PEAK; INVESTORS WAITING FOR DELUGE OF IPOs  
(rl) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks spurted, then retreated and finally closed
mixed Monday, as traders and investors began to focus on upcoming
quarterly earnings reports and a fairly hefty calendar of expected
initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Following the market's steep selloff last summer, the flow of
new stock offerings slowed significantly, effectively capping the
pool of securities investors could choose from. A rise in new
supply would alter the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market enjoyed four months of no new supply, a strong
merger and acquisitions market and strong inflows of funds,'' said
Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new issue calendar is as big as I have seen, which means
things will not be so favorable as they have been. That will leave
the spotlight squarely on earnings, and I don't think they will be
so great.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, for instance, Goldman, Sachs sold 50 million shares
in the MBNA Corp. Goldman had purchased the block of new shares
from the company. The transaction raised $1.2 billion for the
credit-card company. Shares of MBNA closed at 24, down 13/16 on the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations of good fourth-quarter earnings reports from
technology companies helped to push the Nasdaq composite index to a
new record. The Nasdaq index rose 15.36, or seven-tenths of a
percent, to 2,208.05. Early in the session the index traded as high
as 2,233.57. The Nasdaq rose 39.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 16.1 percent last
year, began 1999 with a gain of 2.84, to 9,184.27. Before a number
of computer-generated sell programs hit the blue-chip index, the
Dow was up as much as 168 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index posted a loss of 1.13, to
1,228.10. During morning trading, the index traded as high as
1,248.81. It rose 26.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   More than eight stocks rose for every seven that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Big Board was active, at more
than 892.5 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions were very orderly,'' said one block trader, who
asked not to be identified. ``We were so busy that we weren't
paying attention to what the market was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts attributed the market's strong early advance to a
surge in European stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices on the Continent rose on optimism that the arrival
of the euro will help to increase economic efficiency and growth,
which would be beneficial for the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices on the French, German and Italian exchanges were up
more than 5 percent Monday. Of major European markets, only
Britain, which is not adopting the new currency, registered a
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks retained their popularity Monday, particularly
the biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 2 5/16, to 141. Intel gained 2\, to 120 13/16.
Cisco Systems gained 2 1/2, to 95 5/16. And Internet companies like
Amazon.com and Yahoo also posted big gains. Amazon shot up 33
11/16, to 354 15/16. And Yahoo rose 11 1/16, to 248. But America
Online, trading for the first time as a component of the S&AMP;P 500,
fell 6 5/16, to 148 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Spyglass declined 7, to 15, after the maker of software that
hooks devices up to the Internet said it expects to report a loss
of 14 cents to 16 cents a share. Analysts had been expecting the
company to eke out a profit of about a penny a share.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Dow stocks, AT&AMP;T gained 2 1/8, to 77 7/8, after the
company said it had dropped a plan to separate its consumer and
corporate businesses. DuPont rose 2 3/16, to 55 1/4, on the
expectation it would seek a more attractive acquisition candidate
after the company ended its $750 million purchase of the white
pigment business from Imperial Chemicals Industries PLC.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper fell 2 11/16, to 42[. And IBM, whose stock
was one of the most impressive performers last quarter, fell 1 3/8,
to 183. General Electric also slumped, losing 1 7/16, to 100 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   The day's big gainers also included E-Trade, the online
securities broker. The company's shares jumped 8 21/32, to 55 7/16,
after it said it will split its common stock 2 for 1.

NEW MAYOR PREPARES TO SHAKE THINGS UP IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first hint that things might be different was
Mayor Anthony Williams' arrival time Monday, 1:59 p.m., one minute
early for his first news conference as the District of Columbia's
mayor. His predecessor for 16 of the last 20 years, Marion Barry
Jr., usually appeared about 20 minutes late.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was sworn in on Saturday, also wore a bow tie, an
unlikely accessory for Barry.
</P>
<P>
   But they were not the only changes apparent on Williams' first
full day of business. Making good on a campaign promise to improve
the delivery of city services, he said he challenged his cabinet
heads, most of them Barry holdovers, to develop action plans within
a week, or face the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of asking a series of hard-hitting
questions,'' he said to a room packed with reporters and members of
his administration. ``They have a lot of work to do in the next
days. How they respond will tell us a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 48, the district's former chief financial officer, was
elected in November largely on promises of fixing a city that was
broken for years and holding city employees accountable for their
job performance. He vowed to have garbage collected on time, fix
the potholes and have city workers respond to callers by saying,
``I'll find out,'' rather than ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the parade of new staff members he introduced, heads
could roll. Few served under Barry, who chose not to seek a fifth
term, and most had unusually impressive academic or employment
credentials. But Williams stressed that he wanted to give the
holdovers a chance to prove themselves before seeking replacements.
</P>
<P>
   For all the need for improvement, the city Williams inherited
from Barry is vastly different from the one Barry took over when he
returned in 1994 after his disappearance from politics while he was
in prison for drug possession. Then, the district had a deficit in
excess of $700 million, and few departments operated as they were
intended to.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Congress, controlled by Republicans, shifted the
power of running the city from Barry to a financial control board
that was created in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three years, the board and Williams, who was hired
by Barry, were so successful in cutting spending and reorganizing
agencies that Williams could have as much as a $400 million surplus
for the current fiscal year. In addition, crime rates have fallen,
as they have in most big cities, and city services are improving.
The control board has returned the operational powers to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams insisted that he would not be ``a totally happy
camper'' until he felt that the changes residents clamored for were
under way. And responsibility for that, he said, starts with
department heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't hold line workers accountable if you don't hold
managers accountable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' challenge to the cabinet heads, which he made in a
morning meeting, was included in a 46-page booklet he distributed
to them in which he also outlined his expectations for six months
and beyond. It was the kind of written guideline Barry used to
circulate to managers. But with the new mayor's tenuous allegiance
to officials from a previous administration, the latest
recommendations seemed to carry more weight.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Williams' newly won power was evident in his
demeanor as he spoke and answered questions for nearly an hour. He
seemed to have shed the self-deprecating image of the nerd, which
he embraced as chief financial officer and as a campaigner. He
spoke in a strong voice that reflected confidence in his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of his highest political priorities would be to
press Congress for the restoration of full home rule, which the
city lost to the control board. By law, the district must balance
its books four consecutive years before the board can be shut down.
It has two to go, but as the ultimate authority over the nation's
capital, Congress can do anything it wants.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said his harmonious working relationship with the
board's new leader, Alice Rivlin, the vice chairman of the Federal
Reserve, as well as with the District Council, could help win an
assurance that federal lawmakers would not renege on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a bad hand, and now we have to make it into something
good,'' Williams said. ``Over the next couple of years, we'll spell
out the criteria that ought to be applied for the full resumption
of home rule and the elimination of the control board.''

GOP LEADERS INSIST ON STRICT SATELLITE EXPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss.)  (js) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders have warned President Clinton
not to weaken a new law that makes foreign policy and national
security the only basis for approving exports of U.S. satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has delayed telling Congress how it
will put the new law into effect. It tightens control over
satellite exports by shifting regulation back to the State
Department from the Commerce Department, which places trade as a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the military budget bill signed last October, the
Clinton administration was required to tell Congress by Jan. 1 how
the State Department will replace the Commerce Department as the
licensing authority for most commercial satellite exports. Even
though Clinton originally opposed the measure, administration
officials said he will comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, nine Republican senators, including the majority
leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, warned Clinton in a letter not
to ``undermine the clear intent'' of the law by finding a way to
give the Commerce Department a role.
</P>
<P>
   That warning came as a select House panel issued a bipartisan
report saying that the national security of the United States had
been harmed by satellite technology transfers to China. The
700-page secret congressional report will be delivered to the
administration this week.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will work with Congress to declassify some of
the report and respond to its 38 recommendations, some of which
involve strengthening the export licensing process.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the report covers a 1995 decision by the Commerce
Department approving aid provided by Hughes Electronics, a
satellite manufacturer, to Chinese rocket scientists. The Commerce
Department failed to insure that Pentagon monitors were present
when Hughes gave the Chinese lessons in commercial rocket launches
that also had broad applications to ballistic missiles. The House
select committee has suggested ways to broaden the role of the
Defense Department in the licensing process, officials also said.
</P>
<P>
   A required report on complying with the new satellite export law
will be sent to Congress shortly and it will not give the Commerce
Department any formal role in the licensing process, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes that the national security of the
United States was adequately addressed and protected under the
previous systems but we will of course implement the new
regulations consistent with the law,'' said David C. Leavy, a White
House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, when President Clinton signed the National Defense
Authorization Act for 1999, he said he ``strongly opposed'' the
provision shifting satellite licensing back to the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This change is not necessary to ensure effective control of
U.S. exports of satellites and could hamper the U.S. satellite
industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the State Department can take only foreign policy and
national security factors into account when deciding an export
license.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Clinton reversed a decision by his secretary of state
and transferred authority for most satellite exports to the more
business-friendly Commerce Department. China buys U.S. satellites
and it also sells services as a low cost launcher of satellites.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Commerce Department documents turned over to the select House
committee show that Commerce officials tried to address concerns by
Hughes officials about the role of Pentagon monitors at satellite
launches. And they show that the Commerce official who allowed
Hughes to help the Chinese solve the failure of one of its rockets
in 1995 knew his approval could be seen as a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The licensing official, Gene Christiansen, wrote in a 1996
e-mail message turned over to the select committee that ``some
would say to release that data to the Chinese would violate the''
licensing conditions, making it more likely ``that our decision
will be challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Pentagon and the State Department did just that,
finding that Hughes had significantly improved China's ability to
launch satellites and ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report showed ``the Commerce Department's record of
putting commercial interests ahead of American national security,''
the letter from Lott to Clinton said. Its signatories included the
chairmen of four key committees.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes officials have defended their 1995 help to the Chinese by
citing the Commerce Department's approval.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter last week to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, the company's chairman said Hughes ``will adopt new
policies and procedures for the export of technology and
equipment,'' including a ``new internal export compliance
program.''
</P>
<P>
   William A. Reinsch, the undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, told Congress last summer that Hughes' help to
China was ``appropriate and without risk to national security,''
but he said his department should have referred the matter to the
State Department for review.

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ People here expect Jerry Brown to be a
different sort of mayor. On his first day, he did not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   From his morning meditation at his downtown loft, to his earnest
pronouncements of what ``we can do together'' before throngs of
well-wishers outside City Hall on a windy, chilly afternoon, to his
tieless suit _ the shirt, as usual, had a banded, priestly collar _
the three-time candidate for president and two-time governor of
California became mayor of the state's seventh-largest city in his
classic, inimitable fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the 60-year-old native San Franciscan, who moved across
the Bay to Oakland five years ago to form a research organization,
We the People, and start a radio talk show, marched six blocks from
the swearing-in ceremonies at the Paramount Theater to the rally at
City Hall. He was escorted by a jazz band and what seemed like the
entire city.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a few pickets from a group that says the new mayor's
promise to reduce crime amounts to an order for police to round up
blacks, Edmund Brown Jr.'s inauguration was greeted with the wild
enthusiasm that politicians' dreams are made of. He gave just a
three-minute speech at his swearing-in _ after a tedious ceremony
in which Board of Education members and City Council members took
their oaths. But his words, judging from the audience's response,
were inspirational. When he said: ``Everything will be made
right,'' the cheers had an almost religious zeal.
</P>
<P>
   At his rally, Brown, his voice slightly hoarse, announced four
goals: to reduce crime, to attract 10,000 people to live downtown,
to help parents and teachers create public charter schools, and to
encourage celebrations, festivals and artistic performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much that we can do together,'' Brown said, as the
crowd shouted its approval.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland has high hopes and expectations for its new mayor. Brown
won the nonpartisan primary with more than 58 percent of the vote,
avoiding a runoff with 10 opponents. His ballot proposition to
change the balance of power, giving the mayor more power than the
city manager, was supported by 75 percent of voters. And his
inaugural festivities, ``Celebrating Oakland,'' which offered
citizens a jam-packed schedule with scores of local acts _
musicians, visual artists, dancers and poets _ were touted Monday
as a sure-fire sign that the new mayor is planning to showcase the
best Oakland has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a breath of fresh air in the American political
syndrome,'' said Tom Siporin, a poet and yogi who hobbled on a
crutch to attend the rally in the City Hall plaza. ``He's a great
attempt to show there's hope in the inner city. He's a visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, with close to 400,000 residents, suffers from a serious
inferiority complex. The city has been called homely and
crime-ridden, a poor cousin to San Francisco, for so long that
these have become its defining characteristics. Meanwhile, the
city's assets _ its thriving port, its handsome neighborhoods high
on the Oakland hills, its growing community of artists and
musicians, many of them refugees from San Francisco's sky-high
rents _ have been largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Residents clearly believe that the new mayor, with his high
political profile and pull as a media magnet, could give their city
the respect and attention it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakland is a beautiful city and with a strong mayor we will
have an even better Oakland,'' said Clement Sinclair, an automotive
shop teacher and Democratic party worker originally from Jamaica.
``People who have run away from Oakland in the past will now be
glad to come back.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Henrietta Hamilton, who has lived in Watts and Harlem and now
lives in Venice, Calif., flew up to Oakland to attend the
inauguration. ``I would like to change the world and I can't
imagine a better person than Jerry Brown to do it here for
Oakland,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's plans are already being criticized as too vague by some
local political pundits. Skeptics doubt whether a would-be
philosopher king, the former ``Gov. Moonbeam,'' with all his new
age-ish rhetoric, could also be a pragmatic nuts-and-bolts
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry just doesn't have the mind for these everyday matters of
city government,'' said Robert Warwick, a member of a local
Democratic club that backed one of Brown's primary opponents. ``I
know Jerry well,'' he said. ``He used to be involved with Zen
Buddhism and so was I. But he was a terrible governor. That stupid
tax reform proposition he pushed ruined the state for 25 years and
now he's here.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Brown accomplishes, Warwick said, given the
expectations it will not be enough. ``The idea that one charismatic
guy could come here and turn things around is ridiculous,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But his was a minority opinion, one that Brown surely did not
hear above the roars of approval Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know politics is not doing too well in this country
lately,'' he told the city. ``But in Oakland, we're putting it all
together. It's real in this town. We're going to break the mold.''

 &HT;    Texas clemency process debate continues
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Unlike the Democrat he's replacing, Republican
Attorney General John Cornyn isn't pushing for changes to the
state's clemency process for condemned killers, an aide said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Death-row inmates today are seeking temporary changes to the
process by which they can ask the state to commute their death
sentences to life in prison. Under the current system, the
18-member Board of Pardons and Paroles votes on their fate by phone
or fax. They do not meet publicly or speak to each other about each
petition.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates challenging the process say it violates the state's Open
Meetings Act.
</P>
<P>
   Two state judges already have ruled that the process is
unconstitutional, but appeals courts have later reversed their
rulings. District Judge Scott McCown today could set temporary
rules for the clemency process while a trial is held to determine
whether it is legal.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, former Attorney General Dan Morales said the process
should be changed to include an open meeting. U.S. District Judge
Sam Sparks, though highly critical of the process, said it
nonetheless meets the minimal standards for due process under
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Cornyn spokesman Ted Delisi said Cornyn supports the
current process.
</P>
<P>
   ``As confirmed by a recent federal court decision, the state's
clemency statute affords each death row inmate sufficient due
process,'' Delisi said. ``As the state's top lawyer, Judge Cornyn
will defend the clemency process to assure the swift administration
of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn is a former judge on the Texas Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Rodriguez, chairman of the Pardons and Paroles Board, has
said that he believes the process is fair and legal. He added,
though, that he is open to changes.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush said he, too, is willing to listen to
recommended changes but supports the current process.
</P>

A STRONG 49ER-PACKER RATINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Francisco 49ers' stunning 30-27 victory over the Green
Bay Packers on the Fox network Sunday produced a 24.2 overnight
Nielsen rating _ the highest for a National Football League
wild-card playoff game since 1991. The rating represented a 27
percent jump from the comparable game last year, the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers against the Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   The game demonstrated the potent drawing power of two of the
league's most successful and storied teams, even in a wild-card
matchup. The game was carried in the coveted 4 p.m., Eastern, time
slot, when more people are watching television, on a day when much
of the country was beset by torrents of rain or snowstorms.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the game sustained increasingly higher ratings.
The game opened with a 19.8 rating from 4:15 to 4:30, jumped to a
25.9 from 6:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. and finished with a 28.5 from 7 p.m.
to 7:30 p.m., Eastern, when Terrell Owens caught the winning pass
from Steve Young with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Each overnight rating point represents 624,000 TV households.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, the market closest to Green Bay, the game produced
a 53.7 rating and a 76 share, meaning 76 percent of the homes
watching TV in the market were tuned to the game. In San Francisco,
the rating was a 42.0/73. The New York market posted a 22.3/36. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Jacksonville's 25-10 victory over New England, the CBS
overnight rating was an 18.7, up 1 percent from last year's
comparable game, New England against Miami, which was carried by
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   All four wild-card games, including the two played last Saturday
on ABC, posted higher ratings. The 17.9 rating for the
Buffalo-Miami game was a 15 percent improvement on the comparable
game last year, and the 21.0 for the Arizona-Dallas game
represented a 24 percent increase.

SENATORS STILL SEARCHING FOR WAY TO HANDLE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators searched on Monday for the formula that
would produce bipartisan support for a curtailed impeachment trial
of President Clinton as a few more Republicans expressed opposition
to the compromise plan under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   With the 106th Congress set to convene on Wednesday, Sen. Trent
Lott, the majority leader, returned to the Capitol to prepare for
Republican and Democratic conferences on Wednesday that could
determine whether the Senate can find a way around a full trial
with extensive testimony from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   A day after some senators called on Clinton to postpone his
State of the Union Message if an impeachment trial was under way,
White House officials said Clinton still planned to deliver the
annual policy address on Jan. 19. However, they did not close the
door to a delay. Democrats close to the White House said the
president would put off his speech for a week or so if the Senate
seemed able to wrap up impeachment proceedings quickly this month.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate still appeared far from agreement on a proposal
by Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn.,
that would condense a trial into a matter of days and then require
test votes on whether each of the two articles of impeachment sent
by the House warranted Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, neither article drew the 67 senators that would
ultimately be needed to convict Clinton, then the Senate would vote
to adjourn the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say Lott will move ahead with the proposal only if a
majority of the Senate's 55 Republicans back it, but opposition to
the plan only seemed to be growing among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious mistake,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. ``It's
not constitutional. It creates a bad precedent and I don't think
this president would take it seriously.'' And Sen. Orrin G. Hatch,
R-Utah, expressed opposition in an op-ed article in The Washington
Post, saying he feared the procedure could create a long-term
precedent and be seen ``as a repudiation of the House's decision to
impeach President Clinton.''

TIME FOR NHL TO CONSIDER NO-TOUCH RULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the aftermath of the knee injury to Glen Murray
on Saturday night, much of the talk in the Kings' dressing room was
about the need for the National Hockey League to consider adopting
the international no-touch rule for icing.
</P>
<P>
   This was after Murray, in a breakneck race to beat Colorado
defenseman Aaron Miller to the puck to wash out an icing call,
landed awkwardly, tearing the medial collateral ligament in his
right knee, an injury that will deprive the Kings of their best
all-around forward for at least two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives a reason for no-touch icing,'' Kings defenseman Rob
Blake said later, referring to the rule under which the whistle
blows for icing the moment the puck crosses the goal line. ``If
there's no-touch icing, there's no injury on that play. I think it
definitely should be in the game. I've seen a lot of injuries like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   One that springs to mind is the broken leg suffered by
then-Dallas defenseman Mark Tinordi several years back along the
same Forum end boards where Murray was injured. On that play,
former King John Druce was chasing Tinordi for the puck, and at the
speed they were traveling, it didn't take much body contact by
Druce to send Tinordi crashing into the boards, another clean hit
resulting in a serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   And for what?
</P>
<P>
   Under the current icing rules, about 95 percent of the time fans
are treated to the thrilling sight of a defenseman leisurely
skating into his own end to tap the puck with his stick so the
referee will whistle icing.
</P>
<P>
   Less often you get a foot race, such as the one in which Murray
was hurt. Less often than that, the offensive player wins the race
and captures the puck to wash out the icing, and his effort results
in a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting no-touch icing is one rule change the NHL could make
that would arouse little controversy, wouldn't alter the fabric of
the game, and would reduce the risk of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Blown call: Clearly, NHL vice president Colin Campbell should
have given Phoenix's Dallas Drake more than a four-game suspension
for his boarding penalty on the Kings' Doug Bodger last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings placed Bodger on injured reserve Monday because of his
cervical and shoulder strains, meaning the Kings' defenseman
probably will miss at least as many games as Drake. Somehow, this
doesn't seem fair.
</P>
<P>
   Drake was apologetic about the hit.
</P>
<P>
   `After my hearing over the phone (with Campbell), I thought four
games was a little harsh,'' he said. `But I did hit him from
behind. He spun around and I should have stopped, but I didn't. The
league's trying to cut down on things like that, and I just put
myself and him in a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It could have been much worse. Bodger was lucky to avoid a
severe neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   Courtnall improving: St. Louis' Geoff Courtnall _ brother of the
Kings' Russ Courtnall and Kings fans' No.1 enemy during last
season's playoffs _ has been sidelined more than a month because of
a concussion resulting from a hit by Washington's Joe Reekie.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is Courtnall is feeling better and has started
light workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually the daily routine was to wake up with a headache, and
by mid-afternoon, I felt really sick to my stomach _ and tired,
like I needed to lay down,'' he said. ``I'd get back up and still
have a headache. It'd go like that every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting depressed last week, thinking that I might not
ever play again. It was scary for two or three weeks. When you have
headaches 12 hours out of the day and feel lousy every morning when
you wake up, it's pretty scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough talk: Chicago fans better hope the NBA lockout is settled
and Michael Jordan returns to the Bulls. The Blackhawks certainly
aren't filling the void.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bob Murray recently ripped several of his
younger players: Eric Daze, Chad Kilger and Ethan Moreau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear we're putting too much pressure on the kids and that
they don't have confidence. That's horse(bleep),'' Murray said.
``It's having a passion for the game. You've been playing hockey
since you were 4 or 5 years old, and either you want to win or you
don't. Just go out and do what you have to do to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like losing bothers some of these guys. The
sense of urgency and desperation, I'm just not seeing it. It has to
be an attitude within the team that says losing is not OK. You've
got to hate to lose. I just wonder sometimes how many of our guys
hate to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockeytown South? When Detroit lost at Nashville recently, the
arena was loaded with red-and-white clad Red Wings fans, many of
them Michigan transplants working at the Saturn automobile plant in
nearby Spring Hill, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot more Red Wings fans than I thought I would,''
Predators left wing Denny Lambert said. ``I came out in warmups and
I thought, `We're in Detroit.''' &QL;

DUNKIN' DONUTS SUES FRANCHISEE OVER A MOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass.)   (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was 15 minutes of fame Dunkin' Donuts did not
want.
</P>
<P>
   It began last week with a photograph in The New York Post of a
mouse munching on a doughnut in the window of a shop in midtown
Manhattan. Soon everyone was cracking jokes about what Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani called a ``disgusting, horrible story.'' David
Letterman placed the news on his ``Top Ten List'' of things
overheard in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number nine,'' he declared. ``It's so cold the rat on my
doughnut just froze.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Dunkin' Donuts struck back, filing a lawsuit in
Federal district court in Manhattan that accused the Riese
Organization, the company that runs the franchise outlet at 46th
Street and Fifth Avenue, of breaching its contract by not meeting
the donut chain's health and sanitation standards. The suit seeks a
court order forcing Riese to close the shop and remove the familiar
Dunkin' Donuts sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime someone laughs at your trademark and what's going on
in your shops, you've been damaged,'' said Jack Laudermilk, a
lawyer for the Dunkin' Donuts chain, which is based in Randolph,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been made the butt of a joke in New York _ on
television, in the newspapers,'' he said. ``We take it not as funny
but as something very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunkin' Donuts has about 3,700 stores nationwide, including
about 200 in New York City, of which about 30 are run by Riese,
said Jennifer Rosenberg, a spokeswoman for the chain.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Dunkin' Donuts has sent workers to inspect all of
the stores run by Riese, as well as others in New York, ``to make
sure that all of the locations are up to our standards for
sanitation and food and safety and quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The shop in question, she said, will remain open until the suit
is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkin' Donuts said it notified Riese last Thursday, the day
after the Post article appeared, that it was terminating its
franchise contract for that location. It is not clear from the
lawsuit whether Riese is contesting the action, or what explanation
Riese may have. Dunkin' Donuts said that it was not seeking to end
its contract with the other Riese locations.
</P>
<P>
   A Riese spokeswoman would not comment Monday night, saying that
the company had not yet reviewed the suit. Riese is a major
operator of fast food restaurants in Manhattan, including such
outlets as Nathan's, Roy Rogers and TGI Friday's.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkin' Donuts said in the suit that the shop shared common
storage, refrigeration, and seating areas with other Riese
franchises at the location, which had been ``cited numerous times''
by the New York City Department of Health for sanitation-related
violations, including the existence of vermin.
</P>
<P>
   Moving quickly and forthrightly can be an important means of
restoring a company's reputation when a crisis occurs, marketing
experts have said.
</P>
<P>
   One, Stephen Greyser, a professor of marketing at Harvard
Business School, said the lawsuit is a correct step but may not be
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the problem will be broad one, as customers who
consider eating at Dunkin' Donuts shops around the country ponder
what they may find there.
</P>
<P>
   The suit ``certainly sends a signal to other franchisees,''
Greyser said. ``That's very important. The point is, these kinds of
things, if you pardon the pun, have a long tail.''

CHATTANOOGA TIMES FOLDS AFTER LONG NEWSPAPER WAR
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chattanooga Times, the newspaper that Adolph S. Ochs took
over 120 years ago with borrowed money and the same stubborn
confidence that later led him to buy The New York Times, published
its final edition Monday as control passed from Ochs' 13
great-grandchildren to the owner of its evening rival, The
Chattanooga Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   The two newspapers fought pitched battles against each other in
the 1970s. Although the hostility was muted after a joint operating
agreement took effect in 1980, they retained distinct
personalities. The Times featured a liberal editorial page and
in-depth, analytical coverage; The Free Press fought back with
scrappy, locally oriented coverage and a deeply conservative
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the two newspapers become one, carrying the nameplates
of both. But while Chattanooga becomes a one-newspaper town, it
will keep two editorial voices. The 70,000 or more subscribers to
the merged newspaper will have the chance to read two editorial
pages, _ The Times' opinions on the left-hand side, The Free Press'
on the right.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to the sale _ an expensive battle between two
newspapers with daily circulations of just over 40,000 and profit
margins in the single-digit range _ was favored by neither the Ochs
descendants nor Walter E. Hussman Jr., who bought The Free Press 10
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the chief executive of Wehco Media Inc., the 52-year-old
Hussman controls lucrative cable and broadcast properties in
Arkansas and Louisiana and had emerged victorious from a fierce
newspaper war in Little Rock eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In national terms, the loss of The Times further cuts the ranks
of towns with more than one newspaper. Among large cities, New
York, Chicago, Denver, Boston and Seattle stand almost alone as
cities with more than one newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 great-grandchildren of Ochs, who owned The Chattanooga
Times, were among the unsuccessful bidders for The Free Press when
its owners, the McDonald family, put it up for sale about a year
ago, Hussman said. The Chattanooga Times and a small printing
operation are held separately from The New York Times Co., whose
controlling shares are also owned by Adolph Ochs' descendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make economic good sense to have two newspapers in
this city, especially two that were in full-fledged battle,'' said
Ruth S. Holmberg, the chairman of The Chattanooga Times, who is one
of Ochs' four grandchildren. ``We had made a bid for The Free
Press, and this is what we would have done. It just makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she said, ``yesterday was a very hard day.'' Monday
final edition of The Times included a cartoon of Adolph Ochs with a
tear sliding down his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Hussman of Wehco had for two decades been friendly with the
publishers of The Free Press, beginning in the late 1970's, when
Hussman, then the publisher of the financially shaky Arkansas
Democrat, turned to Roy McDonald for advice on how to make an
evening newspaper successful. McDonald obliged. With his counsel,
Hussman ended the Little Rock wars when Wehco bought its rival and
merged the two as The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Golden, a son of Mrs. Holmberg who was one of the 13
owners of The Chattanooga Times, said of the sale: ``It was a very
emotional decision. This is where our roots came from. This is
where Adolph Ochs developed his instincts and his feelings about
journalism that blossomed so well here and in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   But, added Golden, who is also vice chairman of The New York
Times Co., it became clear that a ``full-blown newspaper war''
would cost somewhere between $60 million and $80 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hussman and Golden said that averting a costly war would
free more resources for ambitious journalism.
</P>
<P>
   But John Siegenthaler, the former publisher of The Nashville
Tennessean, was not sanguine. ``I think that the absence of
meaningful competition in most communities in America right now
results in the cynicism many people feel for the press,'' he said.
``There's no second voice, no second check, no real monitor. While
it's true that in some cities a single newspaper has done
extraordinary things, it's by no means an automatic result.''

 &HT;    FALCONS REPORT: Reeves gets clearance for bigger workload
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves got a doctor's OK Monday to
increase his workload in preparation for Saturday's NFC playoff
game at the Georgia Dome against the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   But as he continues to recuperate from quadruple heart bypass
surgery Dec. 14, that doesn't guarantee he will be on the sideline
this weekend, or even at practice today. Barring complications,
Reeves will be at the game, but the risk injury on the sideline
could necessitate a move to the press box, high above the playing
field. That decision will come later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Falcons had mandatory weightlifting and running.
Reeves arrived mid-afternoon at team headquarters and sat in on
early offensive meetings, as the game plan was being constructed.
He said he would not stay late into the night, as he usually does,
and he was hopeful Dome officials can clean up after Monday night's
professional wrestling event so the Falcons can practice there this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   That would take the team out of the cold, and increase chances
of Reeves being involved. He stayed in his office during two
cold-weather practices last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need as much concentration as we can get,'' he said,
explaining that cold weather distracts players and coaches alike.
``My checkup went well, and I'm cleared to do as much as I can
until I get tired.Shell game
</P>
<P>
   Falcons offensive line coach Art Shell has had preliminary phone
conversations with Cleveland Browns president Carmen Policy about
the coaching job for the expansion franchise, but has not had an
official interview.
</P>
<P>
   Shell, 52, had a 54-38 record coaching the Oakland Raiders in
1989-94. He did not return phone calls Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who on New Year's Day gave Policy permission to talk
with Shell, said he believes Shell and Policy agreed on a formal
interview date dependent on when the Falcons' season ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Shell) has talked to Carmen . . . to set something up,''
Reeves said. ``Art has not been up there (to Cleveland).''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   The only two players held out of practice last week, cornerback
Ronnie Bradford and linebacker Craig Sauer, are likely to practice
today. Bradford (slight shoulder separation) said, ``You can't keep
me out of pads.'' Sauer's strained hamstring has improved. . . .
Fullback Bob Christian, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in
his left knee Dec. 13, will have surgery today.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen Falcons were at ``Monday Nitro,'' the WCW
event at the Dome. Some were teammates of pro wrestling star
Goldberg when he was a reserve defensive tackle for Atlanta in
1992-94 under the name Bill Goldberg. The former Georgia star had
16 tackles and four quarterback pressures for the Falcons. . . .
Defensive end Chuck Smith has 48 1/2 sacks in his seven-year
career, and his seven of the 49ers' Steve Young are more than any
other player.

   FRANKFURT, Germany _ So now that euros have finally arrived,
what are people supposed to do with them?
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, not much. The only euro coins circulating here
Monday were chocolate ones wrapped in bright yellow foil. And while
the stores here were full of after-Christmas sales and signs
proclaiming lower prices, it was almost impossible to find a price
tag with any currency except the German mark.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, that was not surprising. After all, the new euro
notes and coins will not enter circulation until 2002, and most
stores here have not begun to accept euros from people who pay with
credit cards or checks.
</P>
<P>
   But on another level, it was odd. Germany fought hard to have
Frankfurt, its banking center, be home for the new European Central
Bank. Municipal officials have been bending over backward to
promote Frankfurt as a real competitor to London. Yet one could
walk through the main shopping district Monday without ever
glimpsing a blue-and-yellow euro sign.
</P>
<P>
   Car companies showed a bit more enthusiasm. Volkswagen, Mercedes
and the Opel subsidiary of General Motors all began posting prices
in euros, offering euro-denominated loans and accepting euros in
payment immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Car companies have been in the public spotlight over the euro
because they are notorious for charging higher prices in wealthy
Germany than in poorer countries like Spain. Many euro promoters
have argued that a single currency would make it impossible to
maintain such unequal pricing.
</P>
<P>
   But car executives say few customers will want to pay in euros,
because only a minuscule number of people have opened
euro-denominated bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least for the time being, the only people who will want to
pay in euros will be journalists who want to write about it,'' one
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor of Germany, was
probably Europe's most powerful and determined champion of the
euro, German government agencies are decidedly less enthusiastic.
Complaining about the conversion costs, they are refusing to accept
euros for taxes, Social Security payments or most other purposes
for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   People in France, Italy and Spain have been somewhat more
enthusiastic about the euro. In Paris, Paribas Bank had an all-day
euro festival that included a small parade, dancers, acrobats,
jugglers and a steel band dancing through the streets near the
Bourse.
</P>
<P>
   But while many of the big French supermarkets and
``hypermarkets'' are now posting prices in both euros and francs,
most other stores have not yet begun to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, one politician wasted no time testing the new system.
Felice Besostri, a member of the Italian Senate from Milan, marched
into a local branch of Banca Popolare di Lodi and opened a
euro-denominated account with 20,000 euros, or about $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to confess I did it in part maliciously, to see whether
the banks' protestations that they were ready were true,'' Besostri
said.

GOP TO CAUCUS OVER IMPEACHMENT TRAIL PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With their party's public standing at stake, Senate
Republicans Monday hastily scheduled a closed-door caucus for
Tuesday to confront deep divisions within their ranks over how to
conduct an impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The private meeting, on the eve of the swearing-in of the 106th
Congress, could determine the course of the potentially explosive
proceedings, which one Republican senator Monday declared of more
consequence than ``the trial of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid polls that show the Republican Party suffering a serious
backlash from the presidential impeachment crisis, the 55 GOP
senators had planned to huddle Wednesday or Thursday to wrangle
over starkly divergent plans to conduct the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, pushed up the caucus
to Tuesday to try to unify his GOP colleagues and prevent
additional damage to the Republican cause in the prelude to the
high-stakes impeachment showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This speculation about the trial of the century _ I think it's
the trial of all time,'' said Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania
Republican. ``I don't think there has ever been a trial in the
history of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence which is as important as this
one.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate anxiously braces for the first presidential
impeachment trial in 130 years, the House will revisit the issue
Wednesday, just hours after the swearing-in of the new Congress and
less than three weeks after the lame-duck House impeached Clinton
on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from his
sexual affair with a former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional rules require the newly inducted House to
reauthorize the 13 managers _ all members of the House Judiciary
Committee, including the chairman, Henry J. Hyde _ who will present
the impeachment case against Clinton in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But House Democrats, who gained five seats in the last election,
plan to use the occasion to press anew for a vote to place the
House on record in favor of censuring Clinton rather than removing
him from office.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders blocked such a vote last month on the
final day of the 105th Congress and are expected to do so again
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly like to see Henry Hyde be able to present
the testimony and what he needs to do to put his case forward,''
said the House speaker-designate, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the Republican majority is split over a
bipartisan proposal to abbreviate the impeachment process with a
vote to determine if the charges meet the constitutional standard
of high crimes and misdemeanors required to remove a president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   At least two-thirds of the Senate's 100 members would need to
decide that the charges constitute impeachable offenses for a full
trial to proceed. If less than two-thirds votes to proceed, a
simple majority of 51 senators could vote to adjourn the trial and
set up a possible censure vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who is keenly aware that the impeachment saga indirectly
led to the fall of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his would-be
successor, Robert L. Livingston, has expressed partial support for
the plan, which all 45 Senate Democrats appear poised to back.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a dozen conservative Republicans, including
Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, have blasted the plan as a
dereliction of the Senate's constitutional duty to fully examine
the impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a number of moderate GOP lawmakers, such as Specter
and Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio, have attacked the plan, imperiling
efforts by Lott to rally a Republican consensus for the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the 13 managers from the House would present
the impeachment case to the full Senate next Monday. Clinton's
lawyers would present their rebuttal Tuesday, and senators would
use the following day to ask questions of both sides. A vote would
follow, on Thursday, Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the process would prevent senators from
cross-examining witnesses whose previous testimony has conflicted
with Clinton's, including his personal secretary, Betty Currie, and
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to have a trial without witnesses,'' Specter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the pre-trial plan said it was crucial to avoid
proceedings that could drag on for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to have a short trial,'' said Senator John
Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat. ``I just think it's impossible, if
you're going to have a trial with witnesses, to make it quick and
short.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Lott and the Senate minority leader, Thomas A. Daschle,
have said they want to avoid the possible spectacle of a full trial
on the sex-related charges. And both continued to reach out to
lawmakers Monday despite the GOP's intraparty differences. Yet the
outcome remained highly uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Lott will propose the plan, I believe, only if a
majority of Republicans favor it,'' said Senator Slade Gorton, a
Washington Republican, who developed the proposal with Senator
Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton said he could not estimate how many Republicans will
back the plan. And other Republicans said Lott would be reluctant
to pursue the strategy without a solid GOP majority behind it.

POLITICAL FORCES BUILD OVER EURO

<P>
   LONDON _ Even by Monday morning standards, when grumpiness on
the Underground is de rigueur, Paul Johnson looked especially
sullen Monday as he stood in a crowded aisle of a Northern Line
train bound for his job in the City, London's financial center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm exhausted,'' the 40-year-old financial analyst confessed.
``I worked right through the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the sleepless sacrifice of Johnson and an estimated
30,000 City bankers, stockbrokers and computer technicians that
propelled the euro off to a smooth start Monday, even though
Britain is one of four of the European Union's 15 members that are
not participating in the new single currency effort.
</P>
<P>
   If Monday marked the practical start of the euro, which was
launched New Year's Day but not traded until Monday, it also
signaled the opening salvo of what promises to be a spirited,
divisive political battle here in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   And while most of the modern political battles here have cleaved
along opposing positions staked out by the Conservative Party and
the more liberal Labor Party, it became clear Monday that the
debate over whether Britain should join Euroland will be less
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Labor leader, said he
wants to join the single currency, but will leave it to the British
people in a referendum that won't be held for at least three or
four more years. But David Owen, who was a foreign minister for a
Labor government in the late 1970s and since 1992 has served in the
House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament, emerged Monday as a
key convert to the ``No'' campaign. Owen, long considered a
``europhile'' in favor of closer cooperation in Europe, said he
drew the line at a single currency, saying it was too much a
surrender of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The former Conservative leader and prime minister, Edward Heath,
simultaneously emerged as an unlikely champion of the euro. Heath
said Britain had wasted 22 years dithering on whether to join the
European Union, and now he worries that the country will do the
same on the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The British were not the only ones bickering about the euro.
French and Germans stepped up their war of words over how long Wim
Duisenberg, the Dutch banker who last year was elected to an 8-year
term as president of the new European Central Bank, should serve.
While the French claim there was a deal that Duisenberg would step
down after four years, the Germans want Duisenberg to serve out his
full term to provide stability for the new currency.
</P>
<P>
   While the political battles raged, the markets purred. Traders
like Jeramy Batstone of NatWest Stockbrokers, a British brokerage
house, said that while the volume of euro trading was low and it
had not yet been ``stress-tested,'' the first day of trading went
smoothly nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The new currency had what analysts consider a glitch-free launch
across the continent, gaining slightly on the US dollar and British
pound. Computer systems throughout Europe were ready to begin
trading in the euro Monday morning after an army of workers, like
Johnson in London, recalibrated them to recognize the new currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro has been greeted well,'' concluded Jean-Claude
Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, breathing a sigh of relief
that echoed across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   The debut was marred only in Amsterdam, where anarchists smashed
a custard pie into the face of Dutch finance minister Gerrit Zalm
when he arrived at the Dutch stock exchange for the start of
trading. The anarchists claimed the euro is ``authoritarian.''
</P>
<P>
   London traders were considerably more hospitable to the new
currency, despite the fact that Britain is avoiding the euro, at
least for now. Few of them believe the doomsayers who predict the
end of the City as Europe's financial capital. As one trader at
Merrill Lynch observed, the multinational makeup of the City
ensures that many deals involving euros will still be made in
London.
</P>
<P>
   About six times as many foreign exchange deals currently are
made in London as Frankfurt, Europe's other major financial capital
and now home to the new European Central Bank that sets monetary
policy for the 11 nations that have joined ``Euroland,'' the new
name for the bloc using the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Because it handles about a third of the world's foreign exchange
deals and is home to some 500 international banks _ the most in the
world _ the euro will be traded in the City despite Britain's
reticence to join the currency.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, it will not be circulated as hard cash
but rather as another currency that can be used in electronic
transactions, credit card purchases and travelers checks. In
January 2002, euro coins and bills will begin to circulate, and six
months later the national currencies of the 11 countries will be
withdrawn from circulation.
</P>
<P>
   While traders and bankers shrugged at the smooth start, the
amount of retooling necessary beforehand was staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a news agency, Reuters also supplies financial
information to more than half the stockbrokers in the City. About
300 of the 700 workers used by the company worldwide during the
weekend conversion were here in London. Geoffrey Sanderson, who
leads Reuters' euro program, said 1 billion pieces of data had to
be converted, including prices for 47,000 futures, 20,000 European
share issues, and 6,000 government and corporate bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions enticed workers to take part in the
round-the-clock operation by promising bonuses and perks, and by
providing free food, rooms and, in some instances, vintage
champagne when it was all over.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Capital, a money management firm, booked 80 rooms at
the Britannia Hotel in the Docklands section so its conversion
specialists could sleep without going home.
</P>
<P>
   Marks &AMP; Spencer, Britain's biggest department store chain, said
it would accept payments in euros. But by mid-afternoon, cashiers
at the Oxford Street store, in London's busiest shopping district,
said they were still awaiting their first euro transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't hold my breath,'' a cashier sighed.

<P>
   KWAMBONAMBI, South Africa _ The Zulu bride had intended to
approach the groom's family homestead in her shimmering white
wedding gown, with her pearl-studded headdress and 20-foot-long
train. But her husband's relatives would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding festivities came to a standstill. The singing
stopped. Negotiations began as family members from both sides
milled around on the dusty road outside the groom's family's
property, each side clucking over the other's stubbornness.
Eventually it was decided that Nompumelelo Mkhwanazi, surrounded by
her family, could come as far as the gate in her white dress.
</P>
<P>
   But then she would have to go away again to change into a
traditional beaded skirt and leopard-skin collar before actually
being welcomed by the Mthembus _ who had slaughtered a pale brown
cow for the occasion and carefully divided the meat between the two
families, in Zulu tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that she is theirs,'' joked the bride's uncle, Joe
Mkhwanazi, who had led the bride's negotiating team and agreed to
the compromise. ``They can do what they want with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Across South Africa, in black townships and in rural villages,
tribal marriage ceremonies are under assault, and it is not merely
because young women want the white dresses. They are also seeking
the stronger legal rights that state-sanctioned weddings hold out
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the apartheid government, marriages following local
tradition were widely practiced but not recognized by the state.
They were governed by tribal law, which made wives wards of their
husbands. Once married, a woman could not own property, and if
divorced, she had no claim to any of the couple's assets. Her
husband could take another wife without her consent.
</P>
<P>
   The apartheid government, geared to the needs of whites,
recognized only weddings where couples were required to obtain a
license and to be married by someone the state had authorized.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, however, Parliament passed a law recognizing tribal
marriages and seeking to bring them in line with country's new
Constitution, which guarantees equal rights to women.
</P>
<P>
   The new law allows a wife in a tribal marriage to own property
and gives her half the marital assets in case of divorce, as do
other state-sanctioned marriages. It continues, however, to allow a
husband who has been married only under tribal law to take more
than one wife _ as long as the first wife agrees and there is a
formal inventory of property to protect the first wife's claims.
Many women's rights advocates acknowledge that the law governing
tribal weddings was a compromise. But they contend it was one that
could not be avoided. The rural areas are filled with women in
polygamous marriages _ and outlawing their marriages would have
been more hurtful than helpful, rights experts say. In addition,
they assert that if polygamy was outlawed, many men would refuse to
marry at all.
</P>
<P>
   As Liesl Gerntholtz, legal director of the South African
government's Commission on Gender Equality, put it: ``For many
women in the rural areas, these marriages are their only hope of
access to resources _ housing and water. Yes, it's problematic. But
in some of these areas women are not in the position to negotiate
the kind of relationship they want to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Gerntholtz says that the new laws represent a major
gain and that the property clauses will eventually make an impact.
``Our hope is that now it will be so expensive that polygamy will
eventually die out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, she points out, traditional marriages are on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Since South Africa never recognized them, there are no
statistics on them. But Likhapha Mbatha, a researcher at the
University of Witwatersrand's Center for Applied Legal Studies,
says that even before the new law, black South Africans had
increasingly been mixing their cultural traditions with others and
insisting on a conventional, state-sanctioned ceremony as well.
Part of the impetus was the influence of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Those most likely to mix both were the most urbanized and
educated. In many cases, weddings have become an expensive mix of
both cultures, with aggravation and amusement for everyone
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The nuptials of Ms. Mkhwanazi and Mthokozisi Mthembu began on a
recent Saturday with a ``white wedding'': a Christian ceremony,
which took place in her family's Baptist church near their home in
a township outside Richards Bay on South Africa's east coast.
</P>
<P>
   The service had elements of African tradition, though. For
instance, family elders from both sides of the aisle gave speeches
describing the many virtues of their own families, in a kind of
jovial contest. At one point, the bride's uncle made her stand to
show how sturdily built she was _ ``like an ox,'' he said. The
groom, he pointed out, was just a short man.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, known to their friends and family as Mpume and
Guava, did not argue about having both kinds of wedding ceremonies.
They agreed immediately that both were necessary to satisfy their
respective families. The bride, who lets her outgoing husband do
most of the talking, said demurely that she would not have been
happy with only a traditional wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to feel good,'' she said. ``there are people in
my family who would want to see me in a white dress and even
myself, I liked to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no argument. The groom, a teacher like his wife
and the chairman of the English and history department of a rural
high school, said that he too wanted a legally binding agreement
that protected his wife from tribal customs and superstitions that
could leave her penniless if he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our culture, there is nothing to say that if I die that my
brother can't come and say, `You killed him _ you get nothing,' ''
he said. ``Educated people cannot allow that type of wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   But during his wedding some of his relatives said privately that
they felt the bride had taken advantage of her husband because, by
having a conventional state ceremony as well, he could no longer
legally take any more wives.
</P>
<P>
   The new law has caused plenty of muttering. As a taxi driver
quoted in a Johannesburg paper put it, ``If the men in Parliament
cannot handle their wives, let them not take out their frustrations
and hide their humiliations through these stupid laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that despite the new laws, it may take years before
the status of married women in the rural areas changes much. In
such areas, where chiefs still rule and there is little education,
Parliament's decision will remain largely unenforced. Life for
brides will go on much as it did before _ they will still not have
the right to so much as sell a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen overnight,'' said Mathilda Smith, the
director of LEAP, a nonprofit legal education project. ``Some will
reap the benefits right away. But for some, it will take a whole
generation.''

 KWAMBONAMBI, South Africa: whole generation.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Ms. Mkhwanazi's and Mthembu's first ceremony was pretty
much a standard church wedding with more than 100 guests, the
following day was altogether different. Early in the morning, the
cow was slaughtered in the Mthembu family's cattle pen, where the
men gathered to do the skinning and butchering while the women were
up the hill, cooking over an open fire. Representatives of the
bride's family watched, making sure that they got the right pieces
of meat and singing as the gifts were handed over.
</P>
<P>
   The bride arrived in the afternoon, and after the skirmish over
her attire retired her to change three times behind a blanket her
bridesmaids held up for her. After that her family toured the
Mthembu property with her hope chest, symbolically introducing her
to the ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Then the two families gathered in a wide circle and the men
danced, in Zulu warrior dress. Afterwards, an exchange of presents
began. Many of the groom's family were called forward to accept
presents from the bride _ often blankets and mats that were tried
out on the spot. Those who got gifts sang or danced their thanks.
</P>
<P>
   The last to get gifts was the groom. In a playful skit, designed
to tell him that he could be in trouble if he did not treat the
bride well, he too was given a mat and a blanket. But his blanket
is thrown over his head and the bride's friends quickly descended
on him, beating him with sticks until he could get away.
</P>
<P>
   The bride, 32 and the groom, 33, met when they were still in
high school in 1985 and he decided she would be his wife when they
were both in college, he said. A brother and a close friend began
negotiating a bride price for him in 1994, but the wedding was
delayed because of deaths in the family.
</P>
<P>
   The groom was taken aback at the western custom of proposing to
a woman on bended knee. He said he simply told his future wife he
was going to negotiate for her, and ``she was happy because I had
four or five girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes weddings so expensive is the traditional
bride payments, called lobola. This, too, is under attack these
days as some South African women say it encourages the men to feel
they have bought their wives and therefore can abuse them.
</P>
<P>
   But many surveys have found that there is still wide support for
lobola. Ms. Mkhwanazi and Mthembu both said they believe in it. The
groom said he had gained respect for his wife in having to pay to
marry her. The price is always denoted in cows, though these days
it is often paid in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you talk in terms of cows,'' he said. ``Then you say,
`You know we don't have any cows, so let's talk about money now.'
And then you are talking about how many cheap cows and so on.'' A
typical price for a bride is about 11 cows or nearly $3,000, a sum
that could take the average working South African years to save.
Women are worth more if they are the daughters of chiefs or have
education.
</P>
<P>
   Lobola was once an insurance policy in case the marriage broke
up. The cows were held by the bride's family and multiplied as the
years went by. They would help support her and her children if a
divorce occurred. But these days, when it is often cash that is
paid to the bride's parents, it is usually spent long before any
breakup. Ms. Mkhwanazi's family gave her some of the money to buy
her wedding dress and some gifts for the Mthembu family, but often
this does not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The groom is not finished paying when he has paid the lobola.
There are several more ceremonies, including one at which members
of the bride's family get to ask for gifts such as a new suit, a
leather jacket or a washing machine. During this exchange _ which
fills one of the newly married couple's photo albums _ the groom is
given a sheep or a goat to symbolize his acceptance into the
bride's family.
</P>
<P>
   One picture shows a woolly sheep standing in the middle of the
couple's tidy, modern living room.

MARKET PLACE: BELL ATLANTIC, AIRTOUCH WRESTLE WITH MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the time the stock market had opened Monday, Bell
Atlantic Corp. and Airtouch Communications Inc. had publicly
confirmed their merger discussions. But investors remained
uncertain that a deal would materialize _ and on favorable terms _
and sent down the value of both companies' shares.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, the No. 1 local phone company, is negotiating to
acquire Airtouch, one of the world's biggest wireless telephone
carriers, for around $45 billion in stock, roughly 10 percent more
than Airtouch was worth before the talks became public last week.
But some Wall Street analysts think that some Airtouch investors
would have a hard time going along with what they might perceive as
an ungenerous offer. (Relative to Airtouch's share price a month
ago, however, the premium would be closer to 25 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the negotiations have said, however, that
Bell Atlantic could offer as much as $50 billion for Airtouch, not
including the value of Airtouch's debt, and it appeared that
wrangling over valuation could be delaying a deal's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as important, it was not certain Monday that Bell
Atlantic would be able to use a favorable method of accounting
called pooling of interests in the event of an acquisition. It is
unlikely that Bell Atlantic would proceed with a deal if it were
not sure that federal regulators would approve of pooling.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors are convinced that a takeover is imminent, shares
of the acquiring company usually decline, mostly because investors
believe that the company's earnings will suffer from the costs of
the merger. Shares of the presumed target usually rise, mostly
because investors believe they will get a premium over market value
once the deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than a sense of conviction, a sense of confusion
continued to hover over Bell Atlantic and Airtouch's shares Monday,
sending both down. Bell Atlantic's shares lost $2.0625, or 3.8
percent, closing at $51.9375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Airtouch's lost $4.1875 or 5.8 percent, closing at $68.25. While it
seemed unlikely that federal regulators would altogether prevent
Bell Atlantic from using pooling, the complicating factors in a bid
for Airtouch have seemed serious enough that the two companies
continued Monday to speak privately with regulators at the
Securities and Exchange Commission about the deal's accounting,
executives close to the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The big benefit of pooling is that it allows acquiring companies
to avoid taking charges against their future earnings to cover the
difference between what they pay for another company (in this case,
say, $45 billion) and the value of the target company's tangible
assets (in the case of Airtouch around $8 billion). When a company
uses purchase, rather than pooling, accounting, those charges must
be taken in order to balance its books.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the many catches, however, are that the target company
cannot have undergone any major changes in capital structure within
the two years before a pooling (at least not any major changes made
in contemplation of a future pooling), while the combined company
cannot divest any major assets for two years after a pooling.
</P>
<P>
   These catches create at least two potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are good reasons for Bell Atlantic to want to spin
off its wireless operations, after acquiring Airtouch, by issuing a
separate tracking stock, which is meant to represent one aspect of
a company's operations.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whether Bell Atlantic issued $45 billion or $55
billion worth of stock for Airtouch, such a deal would seriously
dilute Bell Atlantic's future earnings, perhaps by more than 20
percent. By issuing a tracking stock (much as the Sprint Corp. did
recently for its interest in the Sprint PCS wireless venture), Bell
Atlantic would allow more conservative investors to continue to buy
a stock tied to its core operations, while allowing others to
invest in the fast-growing, though less-profitable, wireless
operation. (And it would pick up separate sets of Wall Street
analysts to pitch those two stocks.)
</P>
<P>
   The SEC might prohibit such a move for two years after a
pooling, or conversely, prohibit pooling in the first place if Bell
Atlantic planned to subsequently issue a tracking stock. (AT&AMP;T
Corp. plans to issue at least one tracking stock after acquiring
Tele-Communications Inc., the cable television giant, but is not
using the pool method of accounting in that acquisition.)
Privately, executives close to the negotiations say Bell Atlantic
does not plan to offer a tracking stock after a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The second potential problem lies in a deal that Airtouch made
with Mediaone Group Inc. (formerly U S West Media Group) last
spring. In that, Airtouch received Mediaone's domestic wireless
businesses in exchange for $4.5 billion of Airtouch's stock. It is
possible that by issuing so much stock, Airtouch may have tainted
itself for the purposes of pooling.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell Atlantic and Airtouch could have some good arguments
for why the Mediaone deal should not matter for the purposes of
pooling. They could argue that Airtouch was not thinking about
merging with Bell Atlantic when it issued all of those shares for
Mediaone, thereby letting Airtouch off the hook (though most people
who follow the communications industry have been expecting an
Airtouch-Bell Atlantic merger for at least a year).
</P>
<P>
   They could also argue that the amount of stock issued for
Mediaone was minuscule relative to Airtouch's overall size.
Moreover, of the $4.5 billion in stock that Mediaone received, $1.6
billion was in preferred stock that Airtouch had the option of
converting into cash, rather than into common shares.

U.S. READY TO EASE SOME KEY ASPECTS OF POLICY ON CUBA

 BY TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States is ready to let more people and
more money flow to Cuba, aiming to open up the political life of
one of the world's few surviving Communist nations, senior U.S.
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The moves would let Cuban citizens receive millions more dollars
from American friends and family members, allow them to buy more
U.S. food and medicine, permit more direct flights between the two
countries, renew direct mail service from the United States and let
the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national baseball team play
ball in March, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright formally recommended
the steps to President Clinton Monday, and the White House is
expected to announce them on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official, speaking in Ms. Albright's
seventh-floor State Department offices, said that the measures
``are intended to strengthen support for the Cuban people,'' to
allow them ``some elbow room'' and ``some modicum of
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said the moves are intended to increase
educational, religious and humanitarian contacts with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, some of the changes would be incremental
expansions of existing policies on private humanitarian aid to
Cuban citizens. But taken together, they represent a consensus
among top officials that, since the 40-year-old reign of Fidel
Castro is likely to end someday soon, the United States must
``promote a peaceful democratic transition'' by injecting U.S.
money, culture and ideas into the isolated island.
</P>
<P>
   The kinds of proposals advanced Monday had been under review
three years ago, but were halted when Cuba shot down Cuban-American
pilots for an anti-Castro group. The proposals moved forward after
Pope John Paul II visited Cuba a year ago. ``The pope's visit
created a wedge'' through which political light and air can stream
into Cuba, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The nature and the timing of the announcement arose in part from
a just-completed Council on Foreign Relations report, published
under the signature of two former senior State Department
officials. The report proposed essentially similar steps, and some
bolder ones, like granting some U.S. businesses licenses to operate
in Cuba and promoting Cuban-U.S. military ties.
</P>
<P>
   The council's report said it was intended to ``break the current
logjam'' in American policy toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The measures endorsed by Ms. Albright can be undertaken by
presidential order, without congressional approval. But Sen. John
Warner, a R-Va., said he was ``concerned that these efforts fall
way short'' of what could have been accomplished by a national
commission that he had proposed to review and revise U.S. policy
toward Cuba. Ms. Albright recommended that no such commission be
formed, saying it could never resolve the question of the economic
embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lost opportunity for America to review a policy of
basic isolationism,'' Warner said Monday night. ``We allow food and
medicine to get into North Korea. We allow food and medicine to get
into Iraq. And we still deny this tiny country basic things.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the news in Miami, the Cuban American National
Foundation, a conservative exile group, on Monday released a
statement praising the administration for refusing to re-evaluate
U.S. policy toward Cuba. It said most of the measures to be
announced are consistent with current policy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most important proposal is to increase the flow of U.S.
dollars to Cuba, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Such remittances are currently limited to $1,200 a year from a
Cuban-American family to relatives in Cuba. The amount could
increase sharply under the plan proposed by Ms. Albright: any U.S.
citizen could send $1,200 a year to anyone in Cuba except to senior
Communist officials. Religious groups, human rights groups and
other organizations may be able to send larger sums to sister
organizations under proposals still in the works, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The most politically appealing of the proposals was for holding
two exhibition games between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban
national team. Baseball is immensely popular in Cuba, a wellspring
of baseball talent despite its poverty.
</P>
<P>
   However, a baseball official said Monday night that fears of
angering anti-Castro Cuban-Americans could delay or scuttle this
week's planned trip to Havana by members of the Orioles
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles organization has been privately discussing such an
exhibition with U.S. officials since 1995. Their owner, Peter
Angelos, is a major financial contributor to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But in February 1996, the Cuban Air Force shot down two unarmed
civilian aircraft flown by Cuban exiles testing Castro's will.
Clinton almost immediately signed legislation to tighten the U.S.
embargo and strengthen trade restrictions against Cuba. The moves,
which pleased anti-Castro Cuban voters in Florida and New Jersey,
froze attempts aimed at thawing American-Cuban relations, including
the idea of a baseball game being played by a U.S. team in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles organization received U.S. government permission to
travel to Havana later this week to discuss how to schedule a game.
If games could be set up so that the Cuban government receives
little financial benefit from them, and that profits go to
authorized charities benefitting Cuban citizens, government
officials would grant the team the license to play ball _ once in
Havana, once in Baltimore, during the exhibition season in March.
</P>
<P>
   At least one staunchly anti-Castro senator, Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., said on Monday that he found the new steps unobjectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing here morally offends me,'' he said. ``Our ultimate
weapon against Fidel Castro is the flood of ideas.'' But he said
that the administration's idea of sending U.S. food to independent
restaurants and independent farmers in Cuba was naive, since few
such institutions exist and those that survive are tiny.
</P>
<P>
   The statement from the Cuban American National Foundation, the
conservative exile group, objected to any sale of agricultural
supplies to non-governmental entities, saying ``no true private
business emblematic of a free-market democracy exists in Castro's
Cuba.'' And the group also objected to any sale of food, saying
that Castro has rejected the foundation's proposals to have
humanitarian food donations distributed in Cuba under the
supervision of international agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deplorable reaction deserves condemnation, not efforts to
find measures that are acceptable to the dictator,'' the group
said. ``To deal with Castro on his terms is to invite failure and
humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has opposed bills that would allow the sale of
food and medicine to Cuba by U.S. companies for fear such a move
would weaken the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, a Yankees fan, jokingly warned that ``having the
Orioles going to Havana may be good foreign policy, but it's bad
baseball strategy.'' The Baltimore team finished fourth in the
American League's east division with a 79-83 record last year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, one of the two principal authors of the Council
on Foreign Relations Report, Bernard W. Aronson, a former assistant
secretary of state, said: ``American policy has succeeded in
containing the spread of Cuban Communism. That battle is over. We
can move to a new stage in our policy. We should, because within
the shell of Communist society in Cuba there is a fragile civil
society clawing its way to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the forthcoming report helped to
shape their new proposals, in part because it has received quiet
support in conservative circles, leading them to believe that the
steps put forth by Ms. Albright to the president on Monday would be
seen as politically bipartisan.

U.S. AGREES TO SETTLE DISCRIMINATION CASE WITH BLACK FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture has agreed to pay hundreds of
millions of dollars to settle a lawsuit brought by thousands of
black farmers who say the department discriminated against them by
denying loans and other subsidies, representatives of the
department and the farmers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Gray, the department's civil rights director, said the
department will not admit to having discriminated against the
farmers, but will agree that its procedures in handling bias claims
have been flawed. Under the terms of the consent decree, which
could be formally announced as early as Tuesday, the department may
have to pay as much as $300 million and possibly more, depending on
how many farmers come forward with claims, Ms. Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Black farmers who have an active discrimination case or who file
an affidavit of discrimination that names specific individuals in
the department who denied them loans will be eligible for $50,000
tax-free, and will have all their debts to the Agriculture
Department forgiven, said John Boyd Jr., president of the National
Black Farmers Association, which filed the 1997 lawsuit that led to
the settlement. The average debt for most black farmers is between
$75,000 and $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers who have better documentation of bias can forgo the
$50,000 award and negotiate higher awards with an outside
arbitrator, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 farmers around the country are part of the
class-action lawsuit, Boyd said, and another 1,000 to 2,000 farmers
are likely to file claims once the settlement is announced. The
majority are likely to claim the $50,000 award, he said, as they
lack the explicit proof of discrimination necessary to get a larger
arbitrator's award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous victory for black farmers across the
nation,'' said Boyd, whose group represents about 60,000 farmers
and their family and other supporters. ``We met with the president.
We tied a mule to the White House gate. We lobbied Congress. And
finally farmers are getting some relief for the way they were
treated in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, when the Reagan administration abolished the
Agriculture Department's Office of Civil Rights, many of the
nation's 18,000 black farmers have complained that they have been
denied loans and subsidies simply because they are black. While
they have watched white farmers in their counties receive thousands
of dollars of loans, the farmers say, they were told by local
officials of the department that the programs have run out of
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried for nine years to get a farm operating loan,'' said
Boyd, himself a tobacco farmer from the remote fields of southern
Virginia, near Baskerville. ``Back in 1992, the county supervisor
for the department threw my application in the trash. He said they
didn't have any more money. When the investigator asked him why he
had made only two black farm loans, he said black farmers were
lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the farmers, who originally sought $3 billion, were
able to document that loans to black farmers took far longer to
process than loans to white farmers, and that far more of their
applications were denied. By 1996, when the civil rights office was
restored by the Clinton administration, the department had admitted
that some discrimination had taken place, and that the backlog of
discrimination cases was enormous and in disarray. The department
did not try to justify the higher rate of denials.
</P>
<P>
   Black farmers began to hold large and visible protests in
Washington, at one point tying a mule to the White House fence.
President Clinton met with Boyd and several other leaders in
December 1997 and promised to seek a resolution of the case, and
Congress eventually passed a bill that extended the statute of
limitations in the case beyond the usual two years.
</P>
<P>
   By last October, the path toward a settlement seemed clear,
although the details were still to be worked out. The department's
inspector general issued a report saying the civil rights office
was in disarray, and recommending that an outside body administer
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, when a federal judge ruled that the black
farmers constituted a legitimate class for purposes of the lawsuit
_ a major victory for the farmers _ a spokesman for Dan Glickman,
the agriculture secretary, said the department wanted to resolve
the issue quickly and compensate those who had claims. The case was
scheduled to go to trial next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this goes a long, long way, maybe all the way, toward
resolving the outstanding complaints against the department,'' Ms.
Gray said Monday, ``They were concerned about having their
complaints processed within the department, so the settlement will
allow them to have their concerns processed outside of the
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cash awards, Boyd said his group remains concerned
that many of the department officials who presided over the
original discrimination still have their jobs and will not be
punished under the settlement. Ms. Gray acknowledged that the
settlement does not have a procedure for disciplinary action
against department officials, but said the department would change
its internal procedures for investigating bias claims in a way that
could lead to greater discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already drafted and cleared through the department new
regulations which will allow us, we think, to process complaints in
a more timely fashion,'' she said. ``We certainly have changed some
of our procedures as it relates to our responsibility to follow up
with disciplinary action.''

   STORRS, Conn. _ Tip-off was three hours away and the temperature
was 14 degrees, but it was party time outside the University of
Connecticut basketball arena. Three early birds started the line at
daybreak by pitching a tent on the top steps, and other students
staked their claims with a barbecue, sleeping bags, a sofa, a Ford
Escort for blasting tunes and a pillow for playing soccer.
</P>
<P>
   And these were students who already had tickets. They just
wanted front-row seats, the better to howl for the Husky men and
heckle their victims, who on Saturday night happened to be the
Georgetown Hoyas, who were eventually packed away 87-64. Here among
the wind-swept farms of eastern Connecticut, the Huskies are
redefining the term ``basketball powerhouse'': Both the men's and
women's teams are ranked No. 1 in the nation, a feat that has been
accomplished only once before. By Connecticut, back in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just for a week. This time, the two teams have led
the nation six weeks running. They continued the rout on Saturday
when, in a rare eclipse, both played home games seven hours apart,
leaving both teams 11-0 and UConn's fans baying with an amazed
euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to say, `Yukon? Is that in Canada?''' said John
Dipollina, 19, a sophomore majoring in sports management.
</P>
<P>
   UConn basketball frenzy is by no means confined to this
supercharged season, or to this university's 14,000 undergraduates.
It has been a consuming pastime for years in this state, which has
no major league team in any sport (jai alai doesn't count) and a
heavy concentration of UConn alumni (two-thirds of the 140,000
living alumni are still in Connecticut).
</P>
<P>
   People here still talk about the riot of '53, when the state
police had to restore order after 100 ticketless Husky fans rushed
the gates of a game with Holy Cross. A documentary last year on
Connecticut Public Television went so far as to call the
university's men's basketball ``the single unifying force in the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Emery, 42, who did not attend Connecticut but has missed
only eight men's home games in 20 years, is known in the stands as
``Big Red'' and is famous for trying to rally the team by using his
hefty frame to spell out U-C-O-N-N as if it were Y-M-C-A, with the
fans around him chanting along.
</P>
<P>
   At shops on campus and in downtown Hartford, Husky fans have a
choice of UConn dog dishes, UConn milk-chocolate dog biscuits
(marked ``Not for animal consumption'') and UConn yard signs that
warn, ``Beware of the Dog.'' (Though the official explanation is
that the mascot was picked by students in 1934 in tribute to the
frigid hills around Storrs, the choice is more widely thought to be
a play on ``Yukon.'')
</P>
<P>
   And now, Husky fans feel they have license to be cocky. ``You
talk about Notre Dame football, you talk about UConn basketball,''
said Wayne Davidovich, 40, a carpenter from Madison, Conn., who is
not an alumnus but has owned season tickets for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive his reach. Not only are the teams undefeated, they have,
at times, overwhelmed their opponents. The men's record this year
includes scores of 102-67 and 102-60; the women have won 117-20 and
107-56. After Villanova (an impressive 10-2 record going into the
game) went down 100-76 on Wednesday, one player, Howard Brown,
mashed his face and body despondently against a pillar as he waited
his turn in the post-game interview room. ``You can't really get
used to the kind of pace and pressure they put on you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that was the doormat of its conference, the Big
East, throughout the 1980's, closing seasons with humiliating
records in the conference like 3-13 (twice), 4-12 and 5-11 (also
twice). In a sign of how much things have changed in the '90s, the
men are faulted for never winning a national championship, despite
making it to the ``Sweet 16'' of the NCAA tournament six times.
</P>
<P>
   After a recent victory at the Hartford Civic Center, where the
Huskies play half their home games because it holds larger crowds
than Gampel Pavilion on campus, a hospitality suite on the 17th
floor of the Hartford Hilton buzzed with tales of the time when the
team played on a retractable floor over the clay of the ROTC drill
shed, tickets could be had the day of the game and even the best
seats were unassigned.
</P>
<P>
   Now, fans seeking scalpers no longer simply hang out in the
Civic Center's food court. The high demand forces them to work the
frosty streets of downtown Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   For the women, who won the national championship in 1995, the
change is perhaps even more dramatic. Just 10 years ago, at game's
end, fans surged onto the court to hug the players and give them
homemade cookies. These days, if they wait long enough, they might
get an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   The stands at the women's games are peppered with parents who
have taken their daughters along, hoping that the players will
serve as role models. ``Are you going to be a Husky?'' Vince
Peterson, an insurance-company manager, asked his 4-year-old,
Courtney, during a hot-dog break on Saturday. She was wearing a
team jersey, socks and a T-shirt. ``Shea Ralph!'' she replied,
naming her favorite player, a junior guard.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Gervino, a Hartford lawyer holding a teddy bear for her
4-year-old daughter, Kayla, said the men's games are too stressful.
``Their fans yell at the coaches, yell at the players, yell at the
officials,'' she said. ``I guess the stakes are too high. This is a
lovefest: We love the players, we love the coaches, we love
UConn.''
</P>
<P>
   The team encourages the emotional attachment. In the official
guides, the men's biographies stick to birth date and major, while
the women's includes hobbies (''running, shopping and watching
`Jeopardy!'''), favorite food (``frozen yogurt with chocolate
sprinkles'') and pregame routine (''curl my hair'').
</P>
<P>
   The oncourt dominance by both teams dovetails with a 10-year, $1
billion makeover that the university calls ``UConn 2000.''
Bulldozers chug around campus, some sod is so fresh it looks like a
jigsaw puzzle, 150 new faculty members have arrived in 18 months,
out-of-state enrollment is up and donations have soared from $8.2
million in 1995 to a projected $25 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The university chancellor, Mark A. Emmert, said the timing of
the basketball dominance is perfect for his plans for an overall
renaissance. ``In a university community, there's few things that
generate more excitement than construction and winning athletics,
and we have a double dose of both,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All this has critics on campus fretting that the university may
be becoming famous for the wrong reason. Even comments from the
teams' supporters tend to bolster that view. ``We bring in these
key speakers _ Nobel Prizes and all that _ and they go in the small
halls,'' said Phil Barry, a longtime Connecticut athletic official
who retired in 1987. ``But if somebody throws a basketball up in
the air around here, you know you're going to have 5 to 10,000
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Alumni still bring their children to see the farm animals and
slurp ice cream (14 percent butterfat) at the dairy bar just down
the hill from the cow barns, but few can imagine the days when the
university was Connecticut Agricultural College and the basketball
team was the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   As if to mark the new era for Connecticut sports, the team on
Saturday introduced a second mascot _ a 10-foot inflatable husky,
complete with huge, floppy sneakers _ that is to join the beloved
Jonathan the Husky Dog, who's just a guy in a furry white suit. The
fans booed the newcomer, happy to dance with the Husky that brought
them.

CHATTANOOGA TIMES FOLDS AFTER LONG NEWSPAPER WAR
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
(ms) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chattanooga Times, the newspaper that Adolph S. Ochs took
over 120 years ago with borrowed money and the same stubborn
confidence that later led him to buy The New York Times, published
its final edition Monday as control passed from Ochs' 13
great-grandchildren to the owner of its evening rival, The
Chattanooga Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   The two newspapers fought pitched battles against each other in
the 1970s. Although the hostility was muted after a joint operating
agreement took effect in 1980, they retained distinct
personalities. The Times featured a liberal editorial page and
in-depth, analytical coverage; The Free Press fought back with
scrappy, locally oriented coverage and a deeply conservative
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the two newspapers become one, carrying the nameplates
of both. But while Chattanooga becomes a one-newspaper town, it
will keep two editorial voices. The 70,000 or more subscribers to
the merged newspaper will have the chance to read two editorial
pages, _ The Times' opinions on the left-hand side, The Free Press'
on the right.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to the sale _ an expensive battle between two
newspapers with daily circulations of just over 40,000 and profit
margins in the single-digit range _ was favored by neither the Ochs
descendants nor Walter E. Hussman Jr., who bought The Free Press 10
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the chief executive of Wehco Media Inc., the 52-year-old
Hussman controls lucrative cable and broadcast properties in
Arkansas and Louisiana and had emerged victorious from a fierce
newspaper war in Little Rock eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In national terms, the loss of The Times further cuts the ranks
of towns with more than one newspaper. Among large cities, New
York, Chicago, Denver, Boston and Seattle stand almost alone as
cities with more than one newspaper.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some people looked over their shoulders. Others
stayed away from the edge of the platform. On Monday, many people
were being just a little more cautious after hearing what happened
to 32-year-old Kendra Webdale, who was pushed in front of the
uptown-bound train on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm shocked, and I'm looking over my shoulder,''
said Daniela Lopez, 18, a student from Flatbush, Brooklyn, as she
waited for the same train at the same station _ East 23d Street _
only a few feet from the spot where Ms. Webdale had been pushed to
her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents always told me to stay behind the orange line,''
Miss Lopez said, keeping a sizable distance from the two colored
strips _ one yellow, one orange _ that are designed to keep riders
at least 30 inches from the edge of the tracks. ``Today, I'm really
standing back.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the subway system struggled to keep a sense of
proportion. So bizarre and infrequent, attacks like the one on Ms.
Webdale might best be compared, they said, to lightning bolts, or
bricks falling with fatal precision onto pedestrians from Manhattan
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering what a varied and heavily visited city we live in,
you have to wonder why this sort of thing doesn't happen more
often,'' said Nancy Shupack, 47, a native New Yorker who teaches
cosmetology at West Side High School in Manhattan. She said she has
used the subways all her life, without being threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to be focused, and be aware of the signs that
someone may act aggressively,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Police and transit officials said they could not find exact data
on how frequently incidents like the one involving Ms. Webdale have
occurred or been attempted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a 20-year-old woman was killed when pushed from between
cars of a moving train by a teen-ager who was trying to mug her.
And in a highly publicized incident in 1979, a 17-year-old high
school student, Renee Katz, was pushed in front of a train at the
West 50th Street subway station. She survived, but lost her right
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Al O'Leary, chief of public information for New York City
Transit, said some people seem not to guard against the dangers. He
described a scene of cavalier indifference on the platform at 86th
Street in Brooklyn Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were reading their newspaper stories about this young
woman's death as they stood right at the edge of the platform,'' he
said. ``The point is that subways are heavy machinery, they do not
stop quickly, and please don't stand near the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though such horrific attacks have been rare, the death of
Ms. Webdale provided a stark reminder, particularly for passengers
at the 23d Street station, of what can happen on narrow subway
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``On most days, I would say that the subway system is safe,''
said John Laracuente, 35, a native of Chelsea who said he has used
the 23d Street station frequently for most of his life and has
never been accosted. ``Today, after what happened here yesterday,
I'd have to say the subways are going down.''

   TRADING BEGINS SMOOTHLY AS EURO ENTERS MARKETS
</P>
<P>
   The euro had a nearly flawless debut in world markets as
European financial institutions opened for business without a hitch
and Europe's new single currency climbed in value against other
major currencies.
</P>
<P>
   In its first full day of trading, the euro opened at $1.17 and
climbed to nearly $1.186 before falling back to about $1.18. Far
from being unsettled by the uncertainty or technical glitches, the
stock markets in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Madrid all jumped by 5
percent or more. But the reaction was much more subdued in the
consumer marketplace, where there was little evidence of change.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how the euro will fare against the dollar and what
kind of challenge it will make against the U.S. currency.

PLAYOFF GAMES REKINDLE THE INSTANT-REPLAY DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a rash of high-profile controversial officiating calls
marred several games during the National Football League regular
season, there was a move afoot to reinstate instant replay for the
league's post-season play. Criticized as both an overreaction and
as hastily conceived, the instant replay playoff proposal was
retracted.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt some league officials approached last weekend's
wild-card playoff games with fingers crossed. Their wishes were not
granted.
</P>
<P>
   What some may have feared came to pass _ and fumble _ at the
conclusion of dynamic games in San Francisco and Miami this weekend
as officials' calls once again became a source of debate and
discord.
</P>
<P>
   Television replays appeared to show that San Francisco 49ers
wide receiver Jerry Rice fumbled the football before he was down
with about 30 seconds remaining in the 49ers game with Green Bay.
The fumble was recovered by Green Bay's Bernardo Harris.
</P>
<P>
   But the game officials ruled that Rice was down, and that a
whistle had blown before the football came loose. Four plays later,
San Francisco's Terrell Owens scored the dramatic, game-winning
touchdown in the 49ers' 30-27 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Green Bay's general manager, Ron Wolf, fumed in his
team's locker room, arguing strenuously that the league must
institute instant replay next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody in their right mind knows that was a fumble,'' Wolf
told reporters. ``Maybe you didn't watch any football this year;
we've had a lot of bad calls. The league has to address it and
correct these errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, can it be done? I'm not sure. Replay has failed so many
times. But I would think after what happened to Buffalo these last
couple of weeks we've got Buffalo's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I would assume we'd get some more votes and get this thing
passed. It needs to be passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, George Young, the NFL's senior vice president of
football operations, said of the 49ers-Packers game, ``I thought it
was a great game and a great ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Young confirmed that under the instant-replay system used by the
league from 1986 to 1991, Rice's fumble would not have been a
reversible call because the whistle had blown indicating Rice was
down. All play after the whistle in that situation is irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning minutes of the Miami-Buffalo game Saturday,
Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie passed to Andre Reed, who was
tackled at the goal line. When a touchdown was not called, Reed
jumped up, bumping an official as he argued the call.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was ejected from the game and issued an unsportsmanlike
conduct penalty. Instead of having the ball within inches of the
goal line, the Bills, who trailed by 10 points at the time, were 15
yards away and eventually settled for a 33-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo regained possession and drove to the Miami 5-yard line
in the final seconds before a Flutie sack and fumble cut short its
rally. Miami advanced with a 24-17 victory.

 ADVERTISING: FALLON McELLIGOTT STRENGTHENS ITS NEW YORK BRANCH  
(lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After some stops and starts that made a ride on the
subway seem smooth by comparison, Fallon McElligott is hoping that
a reconfigured management team will get its operations in New York
back, well, on track.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon McElligott, the creatively focused shop based in
Minneapolis, is known for sassy campaigns for brands like BMW cars,
Lee jeans and Miller Lite beer. The agency's top executives have
been seeking to gain a better foothold in the competitive New York
market as part of ambitious growth plans that include opening an
office in London.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Fallon McElligott hired Jamie Barrett as creative
director for the New York office, known as Fallon McElligott New
York City. Barrett, who had most recently been a leading creative
executive on the Nike Inc. account at Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland,
Ore., completes a four-person team of managers that also includes
Alison Burns, who was hired in July as president for the office
after working at agencies such as Bartle Bogle Hegarty.
</P>
<P>
   ``After eight years at Wieden, I was mentally and emotionally
ready to try something new,'' Barrett, 37, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you do 100-plus commercials for Nike, you feel maybe you
have something else to prove,'' he added. ``Having been given the
opportunity to work on a creatively glamorous account like Nike, I
relish the opportunity to work on accounts not as seemingly
glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallon McElligott New York City ``was a perfect opportunity,''
Barrett said, ``because it felt like a place ready to explode; all
it needed was to get all the pieces together.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallon McElligott has been trying for several years to piece
together a New York presence. After opening a small service office,
the agency decided to expand through a majority-owned joint venture
with Andy Berlin, who has held executive posts at agencies
including Goodby, Berlin &AMP; Silverstein in San Francisco (now the
Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners unit of Omnicom Group).
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture agency, named Fallon McElligott Berlin, opened
in 1995 and handled a roster of blue-chip clients that included BMW
motorcycles sold by a unit of BMW AG, Coca-Cola Co. and the NBC
unit of General Electric Co. But in November 1997, after the
collapse of negotiations for Berlin to buy the majority interest in
Fallon McElligott Berlin, the agency was dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   As Berlin and other executives left to form Berlin Cameron &AMP;
Partners, Fallon McElligott combined remnants of the joint venture
with its small office to open a full-service New York outpost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an entrepreneurial opportunity wrapped up in a brand
name,'' Barrett said of Fallon McElligott New York City, which has
about 65 employees handling accounts with billings estimated at $75
million out of an agency total estimated at $500 million. There are
about 525 employees in Minneapolis and 10 more in London.
</P>
<P>
   Among the New York clients for Fallon McElligott _ for
advertising, interactive marketing, public relations and graphic
design _ are Time and Fortune magazines, published by the Time Inc.
unit of Time Warner Inc.; Conseco Inc., the insurance conglomerate,
and Nikon Inc.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most recent significant gain came in early December, when
Georgia-Pacific Corp. named Fallon McElligott New York City to
handle consumer paper products like Angel Soft, Coronet, MD and
Sparkle; spending for those brands has run about $13.5 million a
year but could be increased for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely see the opportunity in New York as being to
compete on a larger scale than simply against the creative
boutiques,'' said Ms. Burns, 35, who joined Barrett for the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burns said one goal was ``defining New York accounts'' like
local retailers, which she said would ``provide opportunities to
make a creative mark in this city and help separate us from
Minneapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   She described the other target as ``the soft underbelly of large
agencies that are not delivering'' outstanding campaigns ``for
clients with large budgets'' because, she said, they are too
focused on ``service and relationships rather than the creative
product.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Barrett's second stint at Fallon McElligott, as he
worked for the agency from 1984 to 1990. He left to join the New
York office of Chiat/Day, now the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of Omnicom,
and then moved to Portland in 1991 to work for Wieden &AMP; Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always maintained good ties with Pat,'' Barrett said,
referring to Pat Fallon, the chairman at Fallon McElligott, who
spends two or three days a week at Fallon McElligott New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why I'm back,'' he added. ``If you make a
decision to return to an agency 10 years later, you had a good
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Both executives said they were aware of the daunting pitfalls
that confront agencies staking claims to the New York market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest danger is to believe that if you build it, they
will come,'' Ms. Burns said. ``We take New York seriously. It's a
tough environment. You need to have a strong sense of purpose, a
strong team and an indefatigable will to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who see significance in odd coincidences, Barrett and
Ms. Burns both described stints in sports journalism before they
started their careers in advertising. Barrett once wrote for Squash
News, while Ms. Burns once edited articles about women's rugby.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She came to New York from Buffalo in the spring of
1995, like so many young, ambitious people, in search of adventure
and the writer's life. But unlike the dreamers who envision fame
and fortune in the towers of Manhattan and find only misery and
loneliness in its slums, Kendra Webdale seemed ready for the city.
</P>
<P>
   She was 29, had a degree in communications from the State
University of New York at Buffalo and had had various jobs,
including one in local journalism that whet her appetite. She was,
by all accounts, self-reliant, well-read and flexible: trusting,
even with strangers, but wary and tough when she had to be.
</P>
<P>
   She found a roommate and a walk-up apartment in Manhattan's
Flatiron District, took a receptionist's job at a recording company
and found her way into the stream of life in the city: running
every morning before dawn, going to the library to research ideas
for her screenplay, finding inspiration in the hills of Central
Park and the canyons of midtown. She often took pictures like a
tourist.
</P>
<P>
   She was slender and blonde and had dates and boyfriends, though
there was no one serious in her life, acquaintances said.
Thoughtful, vivacious, she made friends easily _ at work, in her
building and in the bars of the East Village. Above all, her family
and friends said, she loved New York: for its crowds, for its whirl
of daring and diversity, for its daily sense of possibility.
</P>
<P>
   There was, in all of this, no way to foresee the sudden end on a
rainwashed Sunday afternoon _ the man in the beige coat approaching
on the subway platform at 23rd Street, his mumbled incoherent words
and, as she turned away, the hands on her back, hurling her onto
the tracks into the path of the onrushing train.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webdale, 32, was killed instantly. And on Monday, as the
29-year-old man who had been grabbed on the platform by witnesses _
a man with a long history of mental illness _ was arraigned on a
murder charge, New Yorkers who had come to think of their city as a
safer, gentler place were abruptly confronted with images of their
own worst nightmare _ the crazy subway pusher _ and the reality
that all the plunging crime statistics can mean nothing in a moment
of madness.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the victim's grieving relatives, friends and co-workers
tried to make sense of an essentially senseless act, however, there
were some voices of reason, if not of understanding or forgiveness,
and they came from her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a random incident,'' the victim's father, Ralph T.
Webdale, said from his home in Fredonia, 35 miles southwest of
Buffalo. ``Kendra always liked New York, and she was very
comfortable in the city when we visited there. She just absolutely
fell in love with the city. She'd been there three years. She felt
safe there. I think it was a random, ridiculous thing. It could
have been anyone, and any place.''
</P>
<P>
   Webdale, 57, vice president for finance and the chief financial
officer for Brooks Memorial Hospital in nearby Dunkirk, and his
wife, Patricia, 57, a payroll worker, raised five daughters and one
son, recalled the slain woman on Monday as considerate,
compassionate and loving, a gentle person who cared deeply about
others and about her adopted city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kendra had always wanted to go to New York,'' Mrs. Webdale
said. ``We're proud of her, that she organized herself and got a
job and enjoyed her life. He dream was to write a screenplay. She
was seriously researching the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred miles away, Ralph T. Webdale Jr. and Kim Webdale,
the victim's brother and sister, spent three hours sorting through
his sister's possessions on Monday in her fourth-floor walkup at
158 East 23d Street. Afterward, they spoke briefly to a reporter,
and echoed their parents comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the kind of person who would have helped the kind of
person who did this,'' the brother said. He showed some of the
photographs they had found in her room _ Kendra, blonde and
blue-eyed, on the sidewalk, smiling, and in a bar with four
friends, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the most beautiful girl _ not only outside, but inside
as well,'' Kim Webdale said. ``We will miss her very much. She was
not afraid of the subway. She rode it all the time. Kendra loved
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears welled up, and she could not go on.
</P>
<P>
   The third of six children, Kendra Webdale was born in Buffalo in
1966, but the family moved to Fredonia, when she was eight and she
graduated from Fredonia High School in 1984. Her siblings Besides
Kendra, Kim and Ralph, the siblings are Kelly, Suzanne and Krista.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Kendra attended the State University of New
York at Cortland for two years, then transferred to the
university's branch at Buffalo, where she graduated in 1988 with
what her mother called good grades and a degree in communications.
</P>
<P>
   She later worked in a variety of jobs, among other things as a
switchboard operator at the hospital in Dunkirk where her father is
a corporate officer. From July 1995 to March 1996, she was the
editor of two weekly publications in Buffalo _ The West Side Times
and The Buffalo Rocket _ which are distributed free and have a
combined circulation of 26,000.

WAREHOUSE MANAGER'S THUGGERY NEEDS ARRESTING
</HEADLINE>

BY Ken LLoyd, Ph.D.  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Our manager, who owns this warehouse, has punched holes in
his office wall and recently used profanity over the loudspeaker
that was directed toward every employee. The 30 of us never know
what will set him off or what could go flying next. Not only do we
have to deal with his bad behavior, the warehouse supervisor often
makes racial comments and uses profanity. Other than finding
another job, what actions can we take? T.B.
</P>
<P>
   A. Since your manager does not know how to manage himself, it
should come as no surprise that he does not know how to manage
others either. One way to deal with him and the equally clueless
supervisor is to act collectively and assertively.
</P>
<P>
   Tell your manager that you and your associates need to meet with
him at his earliest convenience. During such a meeting,
specifically describe the behaviors that are creating problems and
then present suggestions to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   Let him see the present and potential costs associated with
fear, harassment, hostility, intimidation and safety issues in your
company. Tell him that you hope he will make the necessary changes
soon, as you would prefer to resolve matters within the
organization rather than seeking outside remedies.
</P>
<P>
   You and your associates have many rights as employees, and you
should seriously consider asserting them. Rather than letting your
manager step all over you, the time has come for all of you to take
some steps of your own.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You can't imagine our shock and dismay when we were told that
the new manager of our department is going to be the owner's son.
He is a spoiled brat who lacks the training and experience to be in
management, and several of us who have been here for years are
ready to quit. Should we tell the owner he is making a big mistake?
M.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. When a new manager is brought in from the outside, it is not
uncommon to find a combination of employee resentment and
resistance. And this negative reaction is intensified if the new
arrival has previously established himself as a spoiled brat whose
skills and experience appear to be rather thin.
</P>
<P>
   Although much depends on your working relationship with the
owner, if you approach him now, there is virtually no chance that
he will say, Gosh, you're right. My son isn't qualified for this
job. What was I thinking?
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the owner's son is going to be your new
manager, and it makes sense to approach him with an open mind.
After all, there have been plenty of cases where people move into
leadership positions for which they are seemingly unqualified, but
rise to the occasion and perform at outstanding levels.
</P>
<P>
   However, if his performance turns out to be more outrageous than
outstanding, inform the owner of the specific gaps in his son's
performance, and tell him that he is not being fair to his son by
placing him in this position. Then present some alternative
positions, as well as educational options, that may better suit his
son.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the bigger picture, many companies today find real
advantages by promoting from within, and you may be appropriately
concerned that the owner of your company opted instead to promote
from within his own family.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We put in a new sick-leave policy and one of our employees
analyzed it and e-mailed just about everybody here and said the
policy is a ``step in the wrong direction.'' My instant reaction
was to terminate him, but now I'm not so sure. What do you suggest?
T.T.
</P>
<P>
   A. If this employee were standing at the proverbial water cooler
and trouncing the new sick-leave policy, you would be ill-advised
to terminate him, and you would be equally ill-advised to do so
now. For many employees today, e-mail is an electronic water
cooler.
</P>
<P>
   However, companies can have policies regarding inappropriate use
of the company's e-mail system. If you have such a policy and the
employee in question knew about it and violated it, then there may
be a basis for some action.
</P>
<P>
   While part of your decision must rest on whether this employee
is highly productive or rarely productive, it may help to step back
and look at the incident from a slightly broader perspective. For
example, if you are a company that values the employees as
resources, and truly encourages their inputs and suggestions, this
employee's behavior may be a normal and even positive outcome. It
points to a need for communication, rather than condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Although this employee advised everyone that the new policy is a
step in the wrong direction, taking action against him may be an
even bigger step in the wrong direction. &QL;

DEVILS GET $1.4 MILLION AND DRAFT PICK IN TAMPERING CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lou Lamoriello, the president and general manager of the Devils,
had his suspicions in 1994 when the St. Louis Blues tendered an
offer sheet to the free agent Scott Stevens. Even though the Devils
matched the offer and retained Stevens, who went on to become their
captain and cornerstone, Lamoriello and the Devils did not forgive
and forget. Instead, they pursued an investigation into the
dealings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than four years later, the efforts of the Devils and the
National Hockey League resulted in a settlement that awarded the
Devils a record cash payment of more than $1.4 million from the
Blues and their choice of one of the Blues' first-round picks in
the next five years of the entry draft. New Jersey will also gain
the ability to swap first-round picks once during that time period,
with the Blues able to defer the claim one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at something of this nature as a triumph,''
Lamoriello said Monday in a conference call after Commissioner Gary
Bettman handed down his decision. ``It's a detriment to the NHL. I
don't think the compensation could be severe enough. My request was
five first-round picks, plus damages.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who came to the Devils as compensation for the Blues'
signing of Brendan Shanahan in 1991, was a restricted free agent
when the Blues tendered him an offer sheet worth $17 million over
four years on July 4, 1994, three days after his contract with the
Devils expired.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues had been angered by the decision of an arbitrator to
send Stevens to the Devils rather than their offer of Rod
Brind'Amour, Curtis Joseph and draft picks. They were particularly
miffed because they had sent five first-round picks to the
Washington Capitals when the Blues signed Stevens as a free agent
in 1990, then lost him just a year later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Devils suspected there had also been tampering in the
signing of Shanahan, an allegation the team raised when arguing
successfully to acquire Stevens as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello, who would not disclose details of what his
investigation had produced, suspected that a deal was in place long
before the official unveiling of the offer sheet between Jack
Quinn, who was then the president of the Blues, and Richard
Bennett, who was then Stevens' agent and who died two months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a process of negotiations, when they are ongoing and you
are speaking, you can usually sense when there is something else
involved,'' Lamoriello said. ``I sensed that I was talking to
myself.'' I just felt as though there was something funny in the
way things transpired, the way things went. I was the sole person
that could be negotiating, but I felt very strongly reading some of
the articles that did come out of St. Louis and things I was
hearing, that something happened. Where there was some smoke, I
wanted to make sure there wasn't any fire.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The league investigated, forcing the current management of the
Blues to open its books. According to Lamoriello, the league found
the evidence he had lacked, in the form of an offer sheet that
preceded the end of Stevens' deal with the Devils by ``a
substantial period.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Bettman said: ``I view the Blues' conduct with
respect to Mr. Stevens to be abhorrent and deserving of the
harshest sanctions. Violations of the no-tampering provisions
directly undermine the integrity of the league and the game.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Blues said they would not contest the penalty, but in a news
conference yesterday, their chairman, Jerry Ritter, was hardly
happy to be left taking responsibility for actions of his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am appalled at the severity of the penalty,'' Ritter said,
while adding that he was also appalled by the actions of the former
management in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Among the penalties imposed was a $500,000 payment that the
Devils had to include in matching the Blues' offer. The Devils will
receive an additional $925,000, and the league will collect a
$75,000 fine, for a total cash payment of $1.5 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello said that Stevens was unaware of the illegal
dealings.

ORIOLES-CUBA SERIES RAISES SECURITY CONCERNS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Security concerns may undermine the Baltimore Orioles' latest
effort to arrange a two-game home-and-home exhibition series with
the Cuban national baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   An Orioles delegation is scheduled to travel to Cuba later this
week to negotiate the series, which the club began trying to put
together three years ago, but its trip may be aborted by Major
League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball official said Monday that no final decision had been
made, but he acknowledged that many concerns have been raised,
including those involving security. The official said such hatred
of Fidel Castro existed among Cuban expatriates in this country
that allowing a major league team to play in Cuba could put major
league players at risk in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a lawyer on the players' side said Cuban players in
the majors and other Latin players had such strong feelings about
the treatment players received in Cuba that they would likely
oppose the idea of a major league team playing there. Other
players, the lawyer said, would most likely support the position of
their fellow major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official disclosed Monday that the Orioles
had received permission to send a delegation to Cuba to discuss the
possibility of a game in Havana and a game in Baltimore in March.
Officials interested in creating better relations with Cuba
apparently believe sports is one way to begin to thaw the hostile
relations between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years or so, various initiatives have been
undertaken to send a single team or an all-star team to Cuba. But
United States and Major League Baseball policy never allowed the
initiatives to get far.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles began their attempt about three years ago, but their
initial plans were halted when Cuba shot down two planes flown by
expatriates in 1996. The club periodically revived its efforts,
becoming most active recently.
</P>
<P>
   By gaining special licenses from various government agencies to
travel to Cuba, the Orioles went beyond any point they had reached
previously.
</P>
<P>
   Club officials have discussed the matter with baseball officials
and were never told to end their efforts. But baseball officials,
having taken a closer look, apparently see greater risks.
</P>
<P>
   A initiative on the Cuban front came to light Monday. The lawyer
on the players' side said that while major league players were on
strike in 1994, an intermediary representing the Cuban government
approached the players association about the possibility of playing
games in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The union, the lawyer said, checked with government agencies and
determined that it would violate United States law if it made any
kind of arrangement with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   About two months ago, Cuba's sports minister, Humberto
Rodriguez, raised the possibility that Cuba might allow its players
to play in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are receptive to any proposal by the major leagues as long
as it respects the principles of Cuban socialist sports,''
Rodriguez was quoted as saying in an interview in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, Castro told United States newspaper editors in
Havana that he was not opposed to Cuban teams competing in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, Cuba has been embarrassed and angered by
the defection of a series of players, including Orlando Hernandez
of the Yankees and his half-brother, Livan Hernandez of the Florida
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   For a Cuban player to play for a United States team without
defecting, the Cuban government and Major League Baseball would
have to reach an agreement on pay. The Cuban government would want
the players' salaries, but the union, if not baseball officials,
would find that a major problem. &QL;

INTUIT'S CHIEF URGES DIVISION OF MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior computer-industry executive, testifying in
federal court Monday, urged the judge to divide or limit Microsoft
Corp. so that the company could not use its market-dominating
Windows operating system to promote its other products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me reasonable for the court to make a distinction
between operating systems and other applications,'' said William
Harris, the chief executive officer of Intuit Inc., which makes
Quicken, the market-leading personal-finance software. ``To the
extent that the operating system is an essential service,'' one
that consumers have no choice but to use, ``such market power
should not be used to leverage into other markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, the second-to-last government witness, took the stand
Monday after a two-week holiday break. He is arguably the most
senior industry executive to testify and the first to promote
specific remedies, or penalties, should the court find that
Microsoft engaged in illegal monopolistic practices.
</P>
<P>
   Though he did not say so specifically, Harris' prescription
sounded like a call to break up Microsoft. ``Without such a broad
remedy,'' he said in written testimony, ``Microsoft's ability to
control consumer access will continue to increase.''
</P>
<P>
   That testimony apparently took Microsoft by surprise. A company
lawyer, John Warden, opened his cross-examination of Harris on
Monday morning by chastising him for offering this testimony
without giving Microsoft any warning. Then Warden asked him whose
idea the discussion of possible remedies had been _ his or the
government's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my idea,'' Harris said. ``In the context of discussing
the importance of the operating system to the industry,'' he added,
it was only natural ``to look for actions, or solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft is found to have violated antitrust laws, the
Justice Department will propose remedies to the judge, leading to a
new round of courtroom arguments. Warden intimated Monday that
Harris' suggestion would lead to government regulation of the
software industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you suggesting that we bring back the people on the
Interstate Commerce Commission and make them the Interstate
Operating System Commission?'' Warden asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, Harris said. Then Warden asked him, ``You modify your
software in response to technological advances in the industry,
don't you? Microsoft should have the same ability, shouldn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Harris answered, but he added that there was a distinction
between Quicken and Windows. Unlike Quicken, he said, ``the
operating system is an essential service that customers must avail
themselves of.'' He added that Microsoft's power was growing
because the company was beginning to use Windows as a ``choke
point'' for access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of whether a company holds an illegal monopoly is
whether it can raise prices without fear of competition, because
there is no comparable product available to consumers. The
government and Microsoft's competitors have frequently pointed out
that unlike Windows, the prices of other computer products have
fallen markedly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The cost of Windows has gone up, but ``Microsoft has added many
new features and functionality to Windows,'' Warden said. ``You
agree with that, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Harris responded: ``Yes I do _ just as every other software
vendor, including Quicken, has added features and functionality to
their applications over the years. That's a normal part of the
software business.'' Nonetheless, he added, Quicken's price has
declined.
</P>
<P>
   A good part of Harris' testimony dealt with the exclusionary
contract Microsoft forced Intuit to sign so that Microsoft would
include a link to Quicken's Web site on the ``channel bar.'' That
is an advertising box that used to appear automatically on the
opening screen of Windows but is now optional.
</P>
<P>
   The contract forbade Intuit to deal with Netscape Communications
Corp., maker of the principal competing Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Warden defended the contract but also pointed out that Microsoft
had canceled the restrictive provisions in April, a few weeks
before the government's antitrust suit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Warden also argued that Intuit had chosen to include Microsoft's
Web browser with Intuit products instead of Netscape's because
Microsoft's was technically superior, not because of any pressure
from Microsoft.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  EDITORS: New to correct baby's weight and year Texas Children's
Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit was established 
 
TEXAS NEONATAL ICU WORKING WITH RECORD NUMBERS 
 
By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In a low-lit room he shares with his bigger brother,
baby Ikem, the smallest of the seven surviving octuplets, lies
nearly motionless, wrapped in bunting on a warming bed.
</P>
<P>
   The beeping of a monitor is his lullaby. A Beanie Baby dog and
bear, only slightly smaller than he, sit near his head. Tubes and
lines run from his hands, feet and face.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Ikem moves a tiny right hand near his ear, fingers
clutched in a fist. He opens his eyes for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   For an outsider getting a first glimpse of the baby who weighed
only 17.6 ounces at birth, the focus inevitably shifts from Ikem's
innate charm and baby-appeal, to the ventilator and IV keeping him
alive. It's a jarring contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this sight is commonplace at the Texas Children's Hospital
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, which every year cares for 900 of the
sickest babies in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Children's Neonatal ICU (or ``nee-cue,'' as staffers refer
to it) served as a backdrop while attention was focused on the
world's first surviving set of octuplets born to Nkem Chukwu and
her husband, Iyke Louis Udobi, on Dec. 8 and Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital is a record-breaker in its own right, and is
playing an increasingly important role as the number of infants
born prematurely with low birth weights continues to climb.
</P>
<P>
   With 120 beds, and plans to add 40 more in the next two years,
it is the largest unit of its kind in the United States. The NICU
can handle 60 babies who are ``level three'' patients, requiring
some sort of breathing assistance, either through mechanical
ventilation or other positive-pressure devices.
</P>
<P>
   The Chukwu babies, one of them born at 25 weeks and the rest
born at 27 weeks (full term is 37 or more weeks), are all level
three patients. They remained in critical but stable condition
Monday. Six of the seven surviving babies _ girls Chidi, Chima,
Ebuka and Echerem, and boys Jioke and Ikem _ are breathing on their
own; the other, baby girl Gorom, is receiving assistance from a
ventilator. Baby Odera died Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Because of intense media interest, and the parents' request for
privacy, the hospital has taken additional security measures,
putting the newborns in isolation rooms along the rear wall of the
unit. A uniformed Houston police officer sits in front of the
rooms. Two hospital security officers patrol the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   A staff of more than 350 doctors, nurses, respiratory
therapists, nutritionists and other experts provide
around-the-clock care. An on-site breast-milk bank serves 100,000
meals a year.
</P>
<P>
   The babies rest in ``pods,'' or groupings of four to six, with
nurses perusing thick binders of medical charts at an island in the
middle. Preemies frequently have heart, lung and intestinal
problems, and several hundred surgeries a year are performed right
there, with doctors bringing a mini-operating room to the pod.
</P>
<P>
   Legions of volunteers sew quilted covers for the incubators and
hold the older babies, providing skin-to-skin contact. A six- or
nine-month stay is not uncommon (one child recently went home after
a yearlong stay), and the volunteers fill in as comfort-givers
while parents are at work or tending to needs at home. Doctors say
the Chukwu babies are likely to remain in the unit until March. The
five surviving sextuplets born to Chris and Christopher Collins of
nearby Kingwood in November will be there at least until February.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard Weisman, chief of neonatology at Texas Children's,
said the last two months of 1998 have been the unit's busiest since
it was established in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In the period between the births of the Collins sextuplets and
the Chukwu octuplets, the hospital, which rarely turns patients
away, reached its level three capacity and sent three babies to
neonatal units at Hermann Hospital and Ben Taub.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, the unit had 119 babies, 56 of them in level
three. Thirty-five of the babies were the result of multiple
births, according to a hospital spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Fertility drugs, which help countless couples have children,
also contribute to the growing number of multiple births. These
often produce underweight and premature babies.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman said the annual number of twins born has increased by 50
percent over the last 18 years. In 1996, there were more than 6,000
births of triplets or more, nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be a significant part of this increase in very
low birthweights,'' Weisman said.
</P>
<P>
   The murmurs of nurses and doctors and the low-key setting belie
the stress of the place. To keep the unit staffed with six Baylor
College of Medicine faculty members, three ``fellows'' (doctors
learning the neonatology specialty) and eight Baylor medical
residents, Weisman has to hire more than three times that many.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the doctors provide hands-on patient care for an
average of only four months at a stretch. The rest of the year they
spend on research, teaching or administration; Weisman explains
they need time away from the NICU _ the job carries a high burnout
rate. Every detail matters, and there are hundreds of details to be
kept track of daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty high pressure cooker. These patients don't have
little problems, they have big problems,'' said Weisman, who spends
only three months out of the year seeing NICU patients. ``The
margin for error is very, very small. You don't have leeway for
making mistakes.''

 WASHINGTON: President Clinton.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who is generally more
moderate than Gregg and Hatch, underscored once again his
determination to see a full trial. ``As a precedent it has to be
done right,'' he said of an impeachment trial after attending a
health-care event at the White House. ``I think it's the trial of
all time. I don't think there has ever been a trial in the history
of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence which is as important as this one.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the House, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who is expected
to be elected speaker this week, said he would like to see a House
prosecution team led by Rep. Henry J. Hyde make the full case that
led the House to approve the articles of impeachment charging
Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly like to see Henry Hyde be able to present
the testimony and what he needs to do to put his case forward,''
Hastert said, ``but that decision is in the Senate and we'll see
how that works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, an author of the compromise plan, said he still believed
a Republican majority would coalesce around his proposal once
lawmakers returned to the Capitol this week and studied its
details. ``I have hopes that it will because I think it's logical,
but I have still to persuade 28 members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said he wanted to see the Senate operate in a bipartisan
way to avoid a ``residue of partisan bitterness'' that could hurt
its ability to reach compromises on legislation.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican aide close to the negotiations under way in the
Senate said the chances that Gorton's plan ``as proposed to the
letter'' would be approved were ``almost nil.'' But he added that
``a close facsimile or a cousin of the plan is probably something
that still has momentum.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Senate Republican whips were to meet on Tuesday morning to
assess the sentiment of their caucus, and officials said that a
number of changes were under discussion in the Gorton-Lieberman
plan in an effort to attract more Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   They ranged from giving slightly more time for the House and the
White House to present their cases to the Senate to taking actual
votes on the articles of impeachment instead of test votes. Another
possibility would be to dispense with the test votes and simply
take a vote to adjourn the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us are open to some modifications,'' said Lieberman,
the other author of the plan. But he said he still wanted to avoid
numerous witnesses and to stop a trial from dragging on even if
there were no hopes of gaining the votes to convict the president
and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key turning point in all these discussions is whether
witnesses are called or not,'' Lieberman said. ``Then it gets into
a very different kind of procedure that I'm afraid will become not
only more sordid but will become more partisan and inevitably
become a long trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators have only a few days to iron out these details. Senate
Republicans and Democrats both plan to caucus on impeachment on
Wednesday, the first day of the new Congress. Clinton on Monday
staged a White House event on aid for the chronically ill _ one of
a series of public appearances intended to help him dominate the
public policy agenda. His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that the
president intended his State of the Union speech to showcase the
agenda that he will pursue this year regardless of the progress of
the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president believes,'' Lockhart said, ``and those
who have watched him believe, that one of the main reasons that he
continues to enjoy support from the American public is he puts
their interests first, he puts their business first, and that's
what he's going to continue doing,''

INFORMERCIALS GET FAT IN '98 ON DIET DESIRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Couch potatoes across the world saw 1998 as a time
to slim down, making televised pitches for exercise- and
diet-related products among the top grossing infomercials of the
year, an industry tracker has reported.
</P>
<P>
   Americans' determination to get in shape helped L.A.-based
National Media Corp.'s Quantum Television unit place four of its
shows in the top 10, according to the Infomercial Marketing Report
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The list is based on confidential sales figures from all the
companies in what has grown into an $800 million industry, said
Steve Dworman, who publishes the report.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has long been considered the epicenter of the
infomercial universe. Two of the industry's pioneers _ eternally
peppy Mike Levy and his ``Amazing Discoveries'' series, and Ron
Popeil of Ronco fame _ are Angelenos, and a host of post-production
facilities and other companies have sprung up across the L.A. area
to service the industry.
</P>
<P>
   For '98, the infomercial for Bioslim, a dietary supplement, was
the top grosser with about $80 million in sales. Quantum's show
about T-Fal cookware pulled in about $30 million for 10th place,
Dworman said.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise, cosmetic or dietary products held six of the top 10
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weight loss has always been a popular category,'' Dworman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales volume industrywide, though, was down slightly from 1997
when Total Gym grossed about $95 million sales to lead the year.
Total Gym finished third in '98.
</P>
<P>
   The drop is due to a combination of factors, industry experts
said, including the higher cost of television time and less of it
being available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four years ago on Lifetime (cable channel) they used
to air infomercials until 7 a.m. not until 5:30 a.m. or 6 a.m.,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kirby, president of National Media and chairman and chief
executive officer of Quantum Television, said variety is the key to
his company's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a product-driven business,'' he said. ``Product is and
always has been king. The most innovative marketers are the ones
who garner sales.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is not surprised that exercise equipment and dieting
programs are popular with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 25 percent of all Americans are overweight so that's
a pretty big potential universe of customers to reach. We believe
there will always be a market for three to four innovative fitness
products a year in this industry,'' Kirby said.
</P>
<P>
   Dworman noted that viewers don't mind making a significant
financial commitment in their pursuit of a more healthy lifestyle
because many of the products cost more than $100; Quantum's
Timeworks exercise machine tops the scales at $599.
</P>
<P>
   It was designed by John Pitre, who also invented a $10,400 home
exercise gym that claims to give a total body workout in four
minutes. The Rom, as it is known, is made in Van Nuys, a Los
Angeles suburb. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, working to insure that
two top Khmer Rouge defectors are put on trial for their roles in
the deaths of more than 1 million Cambodians in the 1970s, is
quietly trying to organize an international tribunal under U.N.
auspices that would not be opposed by China and the current
Cambodian government.

   U.S. officials said one compromise would call for the defectors,
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, to be charged with crimes against
humanity that occurred from 1975 to 1979, when the Khmer Rouge
under the leadership of Pol Pot ruled Cambodia _ and not for crimes
that took place afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they hoped that such a plan would placate
Beijing, which was a steadfast supporter of the Maoist-inspired
movement from the 1960s until the early 1990s, when a U.N. peace
agreement ended virtually all foreign support for the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have argued that they were unaware of the mass
killings in Cambodia as they were occurring in the 1970s. The full
extent of the Khmer Rouge atrocities became clear only after they
were driven from power by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese discovered the archival records of the Khmer
Rouge bureaucracy that disclosed the systematic torture and killing
of Cambodians as well as the killing fields that held the remains
of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is particularly sensitive to China's concerns
about an international tribunal because Beijing can veto any
proposal for a trial that comes before the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Khieu Samphan, who was the head of state of the Khmer Rouge
government, and Nuon Chea, who as Pol Pot's second in command was
known as ``Brother No. 2,'' defected late last month after spending
most of the last two decades in jungle redoubts along Cambodia's
border with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Pol Pot, they oversaw the Khmer Rouge and their reign
of terror, during which at least 1 million Cambodians are estimated
to have been executed or to have died of starvation, disease and
overwork. Pol Pot died in April in a Khmer Rouge guerrilla camp in
western Cambodia, apparently of natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acknowledged that a proposal to limit the charges
to crimes that occurred from 1975 to 1979 might be seen as
benefiting the United States, which gave critical diplomatic
support to the Khmer Rouge after the Vietnamese invasion. But they
insisted that their goal was not to shield Washington from blame
for propping up the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go some way to satisfying the Chinese if we want a
trial that is granted legitimacy by the Security Council,'' said an
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Our
overall goal is to bring the men most responsible for the mass
murder of the 1970s to trial in the best forum possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said Monday that
``our preferred course would be some sort of internationally
recognized tribunal created by the Security Council to give it the
maximum legitimacy, but I wouldn't rule out other options that
would meet the test of accountability and justice for the people
who suffered so tragically.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said their hopes of bringing the Khmer
Rouge defectors to justice had risen with the announcements by King
Norodom Sihanouk that he would refuse to grant pardons to the two
defectors and was himself ready to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   The king, who has close ties to the Chinese government and is
undergoing medical treatment in Beijing, headed the country for
more than two decades. He was the titular head of the Khmer Rouge
guerrillas during the civil war from 1970 to 1975, and then was
briefly head of state of Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge period.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials say they are puzzled by the indecision of
Cambodia's prime minister, Hun Sen. He initially suggested last
month that he was willing to pardon Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea in
a spirit of national reconciliation but then turned around and
announced that he would support a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cambodian specialists have suggested that Hun Sen's
original position reflected a fear that he and others in his
government might be subject to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen was a low-level commander in the Khmer Rouge army until
he fled to Vietnam in 1977. Historians have not found any evidence
that he was directly responsible for the mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say that since the cooperation of Hun Sen's
government will be essential for bringing the two defectors to
trial, they hope that any tribunal would consider criminal charges
only against the most senior leadership of the Khmer Rouge.

 NEW YORK: of 26,000.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis M. Gallagher, general manager of Rocket Communications,
which owns the publications, recalled that Ms. Webdale supervised a
small staff of writers and editors, met deadlines and had what he
called a charming personality, happy without being bubbly.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1996, however, the taste of local journalism
was no longer sufficient. Ms. Webdale's longstanding plan to move
to New York finally became a reality, her parents said. While her
sister, Kim, had lived in New York City for nearly a decade, Kendra
did not move in with her or even unduly rely upon her. She had her
own plans and hopes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Through newspaper advertisements, her mother said, she found a
roommate _ the name, Lindsey, was all the family could remember on
Monday _ and the small walkup flat on East 23d Street. She
occasionally took trips home to Fredonia, but never thought of
moving back, her parents said.
</P>
<P>
   She eventually found a job as a receptionist at the Masterdisk
Corp., in midtown Manhattan, which has 15 employees and produces
master recordings of pop music. She was remembered by employees and
managers there on Monday as so likable that workers from other
companies in the building often stopped by her fifth floor desk in
the mornings to chat or say hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a beautiful, beautiful girl,'' the building's security
guard, who asked to remain unnamed, said. He said Ms. Webdale
opened her office each morning and at lunchtime would come
downstairs to smoke a cigarette on the sidewalk. ``If I had a bad
day, or a problem with my wife and I didn't feel like talking, as
soon as I saw Kendra everything would be fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Levine, the company's president, issued a statement
calling Ms. Webdale ``an exemplary employee and individual,'' and
adding: ``What we will most of all remember is her bright smile and
sweet demeanor. We will forever miss her. It is a tremendous and
painful loss to all who knew her.''
</P>
<P>
   In off hours or on days off, Ms. Webdale loved to lounge on the
hills of Central Park, friends said. She also spent hours at the
New York Public Library researching ideas for a screenplay she
hoped to write, her friends and parents said. She had always been
trim and something of an athlete _ her father taught her to
waterski in Lake Erie when she was a teen-ager _ and she kept in
shape in New York, rising before dawn for a 5:30 daily run through
her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Enrico Cordero, who lives down the hall from Ms. Webdale,
recalled how they had met, just passing on the steps and greeting
one another with a smile and a hello, and how they later became
friends and confidants, sitting together often at the head of the
stairs to smoke cigarettes and talk. The ash tray they used was on
the landing there on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke of television programs they liked, of new wave and
rock music, of dating problems and jobs. She was thinking of
changing jobs, but had apparently not confided this to anyone but
him, Cordero said. ``She loved hanging out,'' he said, remembering
making the rounds of East Village bars with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember one time I was kind of depressed and I wanted
to go out,'' Cordero said. ``She saw I was depressed and she came
out here, sat out here and we talked for an hour and a half. I can
honestly tell you she did not complain about anything once.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webdale and her sisters and mother all met in New York last
September and participated in the Run for the Cure, a Central Park
event to raise funds for breast cancer research. They gathered
again for Christmas in Fredonia, and it was their last time
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was pretty, perky, gentle, kind, fun, mischievous,'' her
devastated mother said.

JAGUARS' COACH MEETS HIS MENTOR, ON OTHER SIDELINE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ When Tom Coughlin was the New York Giants'
wide receivers coach in the late 1980s under Bill Parcells, he was
a relentless man on a staff of relentless men. On Christmas,
Parcells called the Giants Stadium office to leave a message on
Coughlin's voice mail. The phone rang. No one would be working on
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang again. Coughlin answered. He was the only coach
at the office that day _ had been for hours. ``I don't know if I
should be proud of that story or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Coughlin is still living each day as though it
has a fuse attached to it. Now the Jacksonville Jaguars' general
manager and coach, Coughlin developed his intense work ethic under
Parcells _ actually, he learned most everything about football from
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin will meet with his old friend in the second round of
the American Football Conference playoffs on Sunday when the
Jaguars play the Jets at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher meets pupil. Friend against friend. The winner will
probably get a date with the Denver Broncos, who play the Miami
Dolphins on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin was complimentary of Parcells as he spoke to a small
group of news media members, but it was what he said away from the
pack in a corner of the team's complex that showed both his
competitiveness and affection for his former coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's someone who I have a great deal of respect for,''
Coughlin said. ``Normally, I work myself up for a game, and at the
end of the week, I don't like the other guy, the other coach.
That's going to be hard with Bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were together, I just gave him everything I had, which
was in return for what he gave me. I've always tried to instill in
my staff that your reputation is based on your work ethic and you
have to prove yourself every day. The other thing that I learned
from him is that it's necessary to have a chain of command.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin also learned that it wasn't necessary to be chummy with
your assistant coaches to get them to perform. ``There's no social
with Bill,'' he said. ``You just work your butt off.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, they are mirror images of each other _ tough,
sometimes nasty, disciplinarians and franchise builders. What
Coughlin has done with the Jaguars in four seasons as head coach is
one of the most impressive feats in football this decade. The
Jaguars, only a shade over four years old, are one of only six
teams to make the playoffs each of the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville is prospering while the Carolina Panthers, granted
entrance into the National Football League the same year as the
Jaguars, have struggled, dismissing Dom Capers and hiring George
Seifert as coach on Monday. The reason why is simple: Coughlin
apparently made smarter choices than his Carolina counterparts did.
The cornerstone of the Panthers was quarterback Kerry Collins, who
this season quit on the team, and the center of the Jaguars is left
tackle Tony Boselli, who will most likely be a Pro Bowler for the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin is one of the most complex men in football. He is a
perfectionist, irritable, hard driving. Players used to be forced
to keep their feet on the floor during team meetings. He once got
mad at a valet driver who turned on his car radio. Pick your
nickname, he has so many _ Technical Tom, Tom the Terrible,
Tenacious Tom or Tom the Taskmaster. This is a man who every summer
watches three movies: ``The Godfather,'' ``Patton'' and ``A Few
Good Men.''
</P>
<P>
   He is smart, a great talent evaluator and a solid tactician. At
one point last year, the Jaguars were crippled by injuries, losing
three defensive tackles and a top cornerback and linebacker.
Jacksonville also used three different quarterbacks and a revamped
offensive line after Boselli was hurt. Still, Coughlin rallied the
Jaguars to an 11-5 finish. Quarterback Mark Brunell missed almost
the entire month of December with a high ankle sprain, but the
Jaguars still won the AFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin has also tried to have a better relationship with his
players, something that was once a weakness. Several years ago,
after Coughlin joined a small group of veteran players in their
Saturday ritual of doughnuts and chitchat for the first time,
slowly, one by one, the players got up and left. No one was
comfortable with Coughlin, who used to be as distant as Neptune.
Now, after realizing he needs to be more personable, he joins them
on occasion, and players don't run and hide.
</P>
<P>
   Because Coughlin and Parcells are such good coaches, the game
between their clubs is almost guaranteed to be a well-played chess
match. ``The thing about Parcells is he's going to have his team
ready,'' Boselli said, ``and Tom will have us ready. You're going
to have two well-coached teams on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin says the last time he spoke with Parcells was a month
ago, but some New England coaches believe that Parcells gave
Coughlin some tips on how to beat them the week of Sunday's
wild-card game. Far-fetched? Maybe. But everyone in the league
knows that Parcells often gives Coughlin advice on a number of
issues, and no one would be surprised if Parcells slipped in a few
tidbits on the weaknesses of his old team.
</P>
<P>
   But when two buddies play each other, well, that is where a
coaching friendship gets dicey. Coughlin knows all of Parcells'
tricks, and Parcells knows Coughlin well. In fact, Coughlin
remembered how the wind increases at Giants Stadium after a gate
under the tunnel near the west end zone is lifted. When Coughlin
was coaching in New York, and an opponent would try a field goal,
that door would mysteriously find its way open, increasing the
vortex of wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be looking for that one,'' Coughlin said with a smile.

 &HT;    Researchers release results of emissions study
 &HT;    (ATTN: FLORIDA EDITORS)
 &HT;    By Trebor Banstetter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ About 1.4 million Florida car and truck
owners shouldn't be required to test their vehicles' emissions,
according to the recommendations of an independent consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But those who must get their car or truck inspected should pay
more than double the current fee for each test, concludes a study
of Florida's emissions testing program by Sierra Research of
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the state legislature released Monday,
researchers recommended exempting cars less than four years old
from inspections. The exemption would affect about 220,000 cars in
Palm Beach County. The report also recommended switching the annual
tests to every other year, and changing to a newer, more powerful
method of detecting auto pollution. About 500,000 cars in the
county still would be tested.
</P>
<P>
   And it suggested increasing the fee from $10 to $22.50 per
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're suggesting changes that would focus the program on the
dirty vehicles without worrying too much about those vehicles you
know are running clean,'' said Richard Joy, the study's primary
author.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the latest voice among a growing number of critics
who want to alter or abolish the emissions testing program, which
cost motorists in six counties $48 million in 1998. But it is not
the outright denunciation that some suspected would be issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the (legislators) who demanded this report
were hoping it would say you don't need to do (tests) at all,''
said Randy Lewis, a spokesman for the companies that conduct the
emissions tests. ``It looks a lot different than what they
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that testing companies make a hefty profit from
a program that cannot demonstrate any substantial results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about air quality _ those companies could care less
about air quality,'' said state Rep. Jim Fuller, R-Jacksonville, an
outspoken critic of the program. ``This is about money, and how
much they can make from our state's car owners in a program that's
totally unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, who chairs the House Transportation Committee, said he
plans to file a bill this year to abolish the testing program
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Emissions testing began in 1991 in an attempt to diminish air
pollution in auto-clogged regions of the state. The reasoning is
simple: Well-maintained cars spew out less pollution. The annual
tests, conducted in Palm Beach and five other counties, are
designed to weed out ``gross polluters,'' which are about 5 percent
of the vehicles on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 4.8 million cars were inspected, according to the
Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The private companies that hold the lucrative emissions testing
contracts pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into politicians'
coffers, and hired high-powered lobbyists, to ensure the survival
of the testing program, state records show.
</P>
<P>
   Through their political action committee, called AirPac,
emissions testing companies donated $274,300 to candidates and
political parties during the 1998 elections. That's almost double
the $144,250 AirPac gave during the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The group funneled $115,000 directly to the Republican Party of
Florida and $66,500 to the Democratic Party. The rest went to
various candidates in $500 donations, including Fuller and most of
the legislators on the House and Senate transportation and
environmental protection committees, which must pass any bills that
affect the testing program.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant's study, which cost $125,000, was commissioned by
the legislature last year after a Palm Beach Post investigation
found no evidence that tests have done anything to improve
Florida's air. Tougher regulation of car and truck manufacturers
has been the primary reason for cleaner air across the nation, the
Post found, not emissions tests.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant's recommendations included:
</P>
<P>
   Exempting vehicles less than four years old from the tests. The
state tested about 1.44 million cars that age in 1998; almost all
of them passed. ``Since they fail so rarely, it really doesn't make
sense to test them,'' Joy said.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting the test every other year instead of annually.
Researchers found that such a change would only slightly increase
the amount of air pollution, and would be extremely popular with
motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a more powerful emissions test that would do a
better job of detecting pollution. The new type of test would rev
the car's engine to simulate driving up a hill, while the current
test examines the engine while it is idling.
</P>
<P>
   Those recommendations are similar to changes that will
automatically go into effect if the legislature fails to act on the
testing issue when the current contracts expire this April.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one crucial difference: Current law caps the fee at
$10, while the report recommends increasing it to $22.50.
</P>
<P>
   Testing companies argue they cannot be profitable without a fee
hike, because the changes would reduce the number of cars being
tested by 65 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just cannot support the program without raising the
fees,'' said Curt Kiser, a former Republican state senator who is
now a lobbyist for Envirotest Technologies, which tests cars in
Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties.
</P>
<P>
   Testing opponents argue that a fee hike is not necessary,
because testing companies already make a tremendous profit.

STOCK SPLIT, NEW OFFERING FOR INTERNET REGISTRAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Network Solutions Inc., which has a temporary
monopoly on the distribution of Internet addresses, announced plans
Monday for both a stock split and a secondary offering of 4.58
million shares. The moves will reduce its parent company's holdings
below 50 percent and give Network Solutions greater flexibility to
make acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Diversification is key since it is expected that Network
Solutions will this year lose its exclusive government contract for
registering the popular Internet addresses that end in .com, .net
and .org. That lucrative monopoly accounts for nearly all the
company's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The stock split announced Monday, to take effect at the close of
business on Feb. 26, will increase the number of shares outstanding
from approximately 16.4 million to 32.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed secondary offering would reduce the ownership of
the parent company, the Science Applications International Corp.,
to 45 percent from the 72 percent it owns now. Analysts said the
new offering, combined with the increased shares, would enable the
company to diversify beyond the domain name registration business.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Preissler, an analyst at Paine Webber in New York, said the
moves would ``further help the company become a little more
independent and choose its own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the stock at some point becomes poolable,
which would enable Network Solutions to make acquisitions without a
heavy accounting charge.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions shares rose $24.125 Monday to close at $155.
</P>
<P>
   Preissler said he did not anticipate a substantial drop in
Network Solution's stock price as a result of the split.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that this is a company that has consistently
exceeded expectations by quite a bit,'' he said. ``As long as they
continue to deliver the profits they have in the past, I am less
concerned about valuation than I might be on something that has no
profit anytime in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions has enjoyed phenomenal growth as the exclusive
global registrar for the basic Internet addresses known as domain
names, registering some three million such addresses at $70 each.
Its income for the first nine months of 1998 grew threefold, to
$7.5 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $2.5 million, or
20 cents a share, for the first nine months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Christmas, the company's stock prices tripled,
jumping to an all-time high of $172.25 after announcing several key
alliances with the Netscape Communications Corp. and Yahoo.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, MEDIA TAKE SIDES IN CONGRESSIONAL TAPE FLAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What started out as a spat between Reps. Jim
McDermott and John Boehner over an illegally taped phone call has
turned into a broad legal battle pitting the newspaper industry
against the Justice Department, with each side claiming the case
has enormous implications.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post Co., The New York Times Co. and several
other media outlets and organizations say they will enter the fray
on McDermott's side. They say the First Amendment to the
Constitution protects the Seattle Democrat's right to leak to
newspapers an illegal recording of a telephone call among a group
of Republican leaders, including Boehner, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott has declined to say whether he provided the tape to
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are exceedingly important because a ruling that
held the First Amendment didn't protect disclosure could greatly
curtail news reports about issues that are very important to the
public,'' said Theodore Boutrous Jr., a lawyer representing the
Post and the Times, as well Dow Jones &AMP; Co. Inc., the A.H. Belo
Corp. and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. ``Many
of the most important news stories in our history have come in
cases where the source may have obtained information in a manner
that is subsequently challenged in court.''
</P>
<P>
   But siding with Boehner, the Justice Department argues that
another important principle is at stake: the privacy of cellular
telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of legal protection, cellular telephone
communications are highly vulnerable to surreptitious electronic
surveillance,'' the Justice Department argued in a brief filed last
week with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
``The large and rapidly growing percentage of the nation's
telephone traffic carried by cellular networks would be exposed to
unauthorized interception, disclosure, and other uses.''
</P>
<P>
   The entry of the Justice Department and the news media comes as
Boehner is attempting to persuade a panel of appellate judges to
reinstate his lawsuit against McDermott, which was dismissed in
July by U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan. The judge ruled that the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, which restricts the
taping of cell phone conversations, violates the First Amendment
when it is applied to the disclosure of illegally intercepted
telephone conversations by someone who did not participate in the
interception.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from an incident in December 1996, when Boehner,
sitting in the parking lot of a Florida waffle house, used his
wife's cellular telephone to participate in a conversation among
Republican leaders, including Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation, in which the Republicans were discussing how
to handle ethics charges against Gingrich, was intercepted on a
police scanner by John and Alice Martin, a Florida couple active in
Democratic politics. The couple _ who later pleaded guilty and paid
a fine _ illegally recorded the conversation and delivered the tape
to McDermott, then the ranking Democrat on the House ethics
committee investigating Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, the contents of the tape recording were
published by The New York Times, the Atlanta Journal/Constitution,
and the capital newspaper, Roll Call.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department launched an investigation, but to date
has taken no action against McDermott. Boehner dipped into his
campaign treasury to sue McDermott, and it is that suit that was
dismissed last summer and is now under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district court ... concluded, contrary to explicit Supreme
Court precedent and to basic common sense, that the First Amendment
gives a blanket immunity to all who encounter stolen, confidential
information to disseminate it across the world,'' Boehner's lawyers
argued in their brief last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman McDermott, quite simply, can not hide behind the
First Amendment to avoid being held responsible for his knowing and
deliberate criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the Boehner vs. McDermott case are now comparing
it to the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, New York Times Co. vs. United
States, in which the Supreme Court refused to bar The New York
Times from publishing a top-secret history of U.S. involvement in
Indochina that had been provided to the Times by antiwar activist
Daniel Ellsberg. Ellsberg had stolen the material from the
Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner argues that in the Pentagon Papers case, the court
merely refused to restrain newspapers from publishing the
documents, but did not rule out later punishing the papers for
doing so. (The government attempted to prosecute Ellsberg, but the
case was thrown out because evidence against him had been illegally
obtained.)
</P>
<P>
   But the news media, which will file its brief on McDermott's
behalf next month, argues that the Pentagon Papers is a similar
case showing the potential importance of allowing newspapers to
publish illegally obtained information.

SUSPECT HAD LONG HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: With NY-SUBWAY-VICTIM, NY-SUBWAY-KILLING) 
(rl) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He graduated from the prestigious Bronx High School
of Science. His roommates described him as gentle and not prone to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also a loner, spending his time walking by himself or
sequestered in his rented room listening to music. And for the
better part of a decade, officials said, Andrew Goldstein, 29, the
man accused of pushing a young woman in front of an oncoming train
on Sunday night, bounced back and forth among city and state mental
hospitals, private hospitals, halfway houses and outpatient
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein often told his roommates that the pills he took each
day were for a memory problem. When he was arrested on Sunday, he
told detectives that he was paranoid. After he was arraigned on a
second-degree murder charge yesterday, his lawyer, Kevin Canfield,
said ``he has a history of schizophrenia.''
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in December 1997 on a misdemeanor assault charge
for injuring a woman in a Barnes and Noble bookstore in Queens, and
was placed in a city psychiatric ward for two weeks. But his
roommates and law enforcement officials said they had no other
indication that he might turn to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt someone would hurt him before he would go out and hurt
somebody,'' said one of Goldstein's roommates, John Olson, 20.
``I'd never think that this guy could do something like this. He
was a pussycat.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were many signs that he was troubled, officials said
there were apparently no grounds to place him in an institution.
Under state law, people must be judged both mentally ill and a
danger to themselves or others to justify an involuntary
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Until he was arrested on Sunday night and accused of killing
Kendra Webdale, 32, by pushing her in front of a subway train at
the 23d Street and Broadway station, Goldstein lived in a rented
room in a basement apartment in Howard Beach, Queens. Roommates
said he spent his time taking solitary walks, listening to Pink
Floyd songs, watching television and sometimes just sitting and
staring into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed very lonely,'' said Mario Ocampo, 20, whose mother
rented Goldstein the room. ``He was always alone. He was always
asking me to come down to watch TV or asking if he could come up
here to watch TV. Once I caught him in his room just staring at his
legs. And the cleaning lady saw him staring dead-on at the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   He once showed great promise. In 1987, Goldstein graduated from
the Bronx High School of Science, the elite public high school,
school officials said. But two years later he was committed to a
state mental institution. Most recently, law enforcement officials
said, Goldstein was an outpatient at the Bleuler Psychotherapy
Center on Queens Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the latest in a long string of facilities to try to
treat his mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Goldstein was committed to the Creedmoor Psychiatric
Center, a state-run center in Queens. He was in and out of
Creedmoor three times until he was finally discharged in August
1993.
</P>
<P>
   After he left Creedmoor, he spent more than a year in the Leben
Home for Adults, a 361-facility in Elmhurst, Queens, that provides
room and board for mentally ill adults. At the time, he received
treatment at the New York Psychotherapy and Counseling Center. Then
came his treatment at Bleuler. Officials there did not return calls
seeking comment about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's only prior contact with the law, police officials
said, came on Dec. 14, 1997, when he was arrested at a Barnes and
Noble bookstore in Forest Hills, Queens. A law enforcement official
said Goldstein had been harassed by several youths in the store
and, as he rushed toward the door while trying to leave, knocked a
woman into a bookcase, injuring her eye and face.
</P>
<P>
   The record of that case was sealed, the official said, because
the woman did not want to proceed with the case. But the police
brought Goldstein to Elmhurst Hospital Center for evaluation, and
he was kept for two weeks, said a hospital official.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, law enforcement officials said, he went to Bellevue
Hospital for treatment. In August he went to Hillside Hospital in
Glen Oaks, Queens, to ask for help. He was evaluated and given a
prescription for 10 days worth of medication, said Carol Hauptman,
a hospital spokeswoman. But when hospital officials called him back
to see if he was taking his medicine, she said, they found he had
given them the wrong number.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Goldstein was arraigned on second-degree murder
charges in Manhattan Criminal Court. An assistant District
Attorney, William Greenbaum, said: ``He admits pushing her onto the
track. The evidence is overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's court-appointed lawyer, Kevin Canfield, requested
that his client be placed on a suicide watch. The judge ordered
Goldstein to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. He is scheduled to
appear in court again on Feb. 2. ``He's very disturbed, I can say
that,'' Canfield said. ``He has a history of schizophrenia.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who was dressed in green chinos and a black jacket,
seemed unsteady on his feet. Short, clean-shaven and slightly
pudgy, with dark curly hair, he stared ahead and blinked repeatedly
as prosecutors read the murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives and prosecutors were trying Monday to retrace
Goldstein's steps on the day of the murder. Detective Lt. John
Shields said Goldstein came into Manhattan at around 10 in the
morning, ate fast food, wandered the streets and listened to CDs at
the free listening stations in a Virgin Megastore.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 5 p.m., Shields said, Goldstein walked up to Ms.
Webdale on the south end of the northbound platform of the N and R
station at 23d Street and Broadway. ``He just spoke to her
briefly,'' he said. ``He asked her the time. And shortly thereafter
he pushed her.''
</P>
<P>
   Three cars of an oncoming train ran over Ms. Webdale before the
train stopped, the police said.

 Big Macworld Opens Its Gates in S.F.  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista and Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Macintosh revival rolls into town this morning, and there's
plenty for the faithful to whoop about. For now.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 68,000 Macophiles are expected to stream into the
Moscone Center at this year's Macworld Expo to trade Mac tips, kick
the tires on new products and revel in Apple Computer's remarkable
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino company is set to show off new top-of-the-line
Power Mac G3 desktop machines based on the iMac's curvy,
translucent design, along with a new operating system for corporate
users of high-end computer servers and workstations, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The personal computer pioneer is back in the black after two
years of knee-buckling losses; interim Apple CEO Steve Jobs is
expected to announce a fifth-straight profitable quarter in a
keynote speech today; a flabby, unwieldy product line has been
whipped into shape; sales of the iMac are shooting off the charts;
powerful new Macs are on the horizon; and Apple's market share has
climbed to about 5 percent, according to ZD Market Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there were questions about Apple's survival the last few
years, the issues now seem to revolve around innovation, new
products and excitement,'' said Macworld Expo show director Rob
Scheschareg. ``We expect a big walk-up crowd because of interest in
the iMac.''
</P>
<P>
   With Moscone Center as the temporary epicenter of the Mac
universe, city transportation officials anticipate a traffic crush
and advise the use of public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hype and hoopla surrounding the weeklong computer
show, though, long-term concerns about Apple linger.
</P>
<P>
   Apple must overcome a historic problem _ inspiring software
companies to write programs for the Mac _ if it is to complete its
self-proclaimed five-step rehabilitation, industry observers said.
It's a chicken-and-egg conundrum: Having more applications spurs
Mac sales, but software-makers are reluctant to invest in writing
new programs until sales increase.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing with Wall Street analysts in October, Apple CFO
Fred Anderson outlined a ``hierarchy of survival'' based on Abraham
Maslow's ranking of societal needs. He said the PC-maker has
accomplished the first two steps and is working on stages three
through five of that comeback plan: (1) survival, (2)
stability/profitability, (3) setting a product strategy, (4)
regaining application support for Apple platforms and (5) driving
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said there are no signs of an immediate return to
Apple's glory days, when software developers made cutting-edge
products for the Macintosh platform before Windows. The cold
reality is it's still a Windows world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if Apple has any realistic shot at getting its
old leading-edge position back. I think it's too late for that,''
said Jeff Tarter, publisher of Soft-letter in Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were hard-pressed to think of any new Mac-only programs
besides those made for graphic artists and publishers, who have
remained Apple's most loyal customers. Most consumer and business
Mac programs are also available for Windows, although the reverse
is not always true.
</P>
<P>
   Even longtime stalwart Mac developers like Adobe Systems and
Macromedia have shifted more of their resources to writing software
for the lucrative PC market.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Macromedia, which made its mark as a Mac
developer, said PC sales now account for 57 percent of its
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The story is in the numbers. Despite the iMac's sales, there are
37.2 million Windows-based computers in U.S. households and only
about 5 million Macs, according to Media Metrix, a New York company
that is considered the A.C. Nielsen Co. of home computer usage.
</P>
<P>
   And while Mac sales were basically flat for three years, the
number of home PCs grew by 50 percent during the same time , said
Bruce Ryon, general manager of Media Metrix technology division.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no incentive for any developer to try Mac first,''
said Ryon, who once worked for Apple's consumer division as a
business development manager.
</P>
<P>
   Popular desktop games, for example, used to be released in Mac
versions first before Windows. But now, many games are developed
for Windows only because the smaller Mac market doesn't yield
enough sales, Ryon said. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Analysts said Apple's best chance for growth is in the
consumer market, and the company has made important strides by
successfully marketing the iMac as a quick and easy way to connect
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   However, that sales strategy may not boost Macintosh software
sales because consumers don't see the iMac as a device to play
games or run programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the focus of this machine is to download
Web pages rather than running software off a disk,'' Tarter said.
</P>
<P>
   According to numbers released last month by PC Data Inc., a
Reston, Va., market researcher, the iMac accounted for 8.2 percent
of retail and mail-order computer sales in November, making it the
top-selling model. Some analysts expect the company to report sales
as high as 535,000 units in the quarter ended December 25.
</P>
<P>
   But iMac shipments have not translated into more Macintosh
software development, said Chris Shipley, editor of Demo Letter, an
industry newsletter in San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't seen any startup software-makers target the Mac
market for the past year, Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
   Scheschareg said the expo has the same number of exhibitors
(450) and projected attendance (68,000) as a year ago. He noted,
however, the addition of gaming and consumer areas, technical
conferences and first-time vendors such as Real Networks and VR
Toolbox.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry observers expect the iMac to spur development and
sales of new peripheral devices _ including technology based on
Universal Serial Bus, which makes it easier to plug in joysticks or
digital cameras, and ultra-fast FireWire connections.
</P>
<P>
   Apple, which is in a self-imposed quiet period before it
announces its fiscal first-quarter results on January 13, declined
to comment.

AMERICA ONLINE MAY LINK TO CBS NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS News will announce a deal with America Online Inc. later
this week to become the exclusive broadcast news provider for the
online service, executives involved in the agreement said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal lacks only some final details, the executives said.
When completed, it will mean that CBS will replace ABC News as the
provider of news in text, video and audio on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   For CBS, the move to American Online has the potential to
jump-start what has been a lackluster presence on the Web. By wide
consensus, CBS News has lagged far behind the other news networks
in terms of what it has offered to users of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For America Online, a deal is likely to mean a more favorable
financial arrangement than the service had with ABC, one executive
said.
</P>
<P>
   The exact terms of the deal were not available Monday, but one
executive involved in the negotiations said that it would be along
the lines of ``promotion for promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was reported in the Hollywood Reporter on Monday.
Executives from CBS, America Online and ABC, declined to comment on
the record. An America Online spokeswoman, Wendy Goldberg, labeled
it ``a rumor, and we don't comment on rumors.'' Gil Schwartz, the
chief spokesman for CBS, said, ``We don't have anything to
announce.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Bergmann, a spokeswoman for the ABC News online
service, said, ``It's our standing policy not to comment on
contractual arrangements.'' The America Online contract is known to
be near an end.
</P>
<P>
   An executive involved in the CBS deal said it would include
America Online's affiliated services, AOL.com and Compuserve. That
will give CBS access to America Online's 15 million subscribers, by
far the biggest number on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet services of the other network news organizations
have been far ahead of CBS. CNN's Web site and MSNBC.com, which NBC
operates with Microsoft Corp., are among the most heavily
trafficked sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, CBS had been in talks with CNN about a merger of
news-gathering resources. That arrangement might have required CBS
to pay for access to CNN's news material. The CBS chairman, Mel
Karmazin, said in December that he was looking instead for a way to
generate revenue from CBS' news product.
</P>
<P>
   CBS does have a promotion-for-pay arrangement with the online
services that use its Sportsline and Market Watch products. And CBS
had already established a relationship with America Online last
fall in a promotion campaign for its new fall prime-time
entertainment lineup. That promotion was regarded as highly
successful by CBS executives.
</P>
<P>
   An executive involved in the America Online-CBS negotiations
said that American Online was also concerned with competitive
Internet moves being made by Walt Disney Co., the parent of ABC,
which recently started an Internet portal, the Go Network.

 Debtors Faced With House of Cards  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Home equity lenders these days are advertising tantalizing offers
for startlingly high levels of credit _ offers likely to be
particularly enticing to people suffering from a post-holiday
financial hangover.
</P>
<P>
   Some solicitations offer hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some
tout loan amounts higher than the value of the properties securing
them. And some direct mailers catch the attention of those in debt
with faux checks made out in their names.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of marketing the loans to pay for home improvements _
their traditional purpose, and one that is likely to generate a
good return _ the mail, TV and radio solicitations encourage people
to take a dream vacation, buy a new car or consolidate credit card
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans are biting at the offers, but consumer advocates
warn of dire consequences in the event of job loss or other
financial misfortune. Unlike credit cards, home equity loans are
secured by the borrower's property, which could be lost in a
default.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so problematic to put your house on the line for
anything as insubstantial as credit card debt,'' said Linda Sherry
of Consumer Action in San Francisco. ``Most of the things you paid
for probably aren't even around anymore, and you're putting your
home on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of people who took out a home equity loan in
1997 identified debt consolidation as the main reason, up markedly
from 36 percent the prior year. Home improvement was a distant
second (23 percent in the 1997 survey) followed by education and
automobile purchases, according to the Consumer Bankers
Association's latest poll.
</P>
<P>
   Although delinquency rates on home equity loans remain low
(between 1 and 2 percent), that could change in a recession, said
Monica Steinisch of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest danger lies in ``high loan-to-value'' (LTV) loans
worth 125 percent or even 150 percent of a home's value. In a
default, borrowers could lose not only their homes, but additional
assets as well.
</P>
<P>
   High LTV loans are based on the estimated earning potential of
the borrower, not just the value of his or her home, said Sung Won
Sohn, chief economist with Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``nobody knows what's going to happen two years down the
road _ you could be out of work,'' Steinisch said.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional second mortgages tend to be capped at 80 percent of
the homeowner's equity in a house. So someone with a $350,000 house
who has a $250,000 first mortgage and $100,000 of equity could
receive an $80,000 home equity loan.
</P>
<P>
   A high LTV mortgage, on the other hand, could be valued at up to
$187,000 _ 100 percent of the homeowner's equity ($100,000) plus 25
percent of the appraised value of the house ($87,500), said Earl
Lui, senior attorney with Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Big-name financial institutions generally don't offer the risky,
high LTV loans. And the companies that do promote them only award
them to the best credit risks, Sherry said. ``It's a
bait-and-switch to get people into a new loan,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lui said the popularity of home equity loans is just one more
manifestation of Americans' love affair with credit. ``This is part
of a growing phenomenon in our society where people are living
beyond their means and taking on more debt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their risks, home equity loans aren't always a bad
thing, even when used for things other than home improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Average interest rates currently are running between 8 and 9
percent, half the level of some credit cards. (High LTV rates run a
bit higher.) And interest payments on home equity loans are
generally tax-deductible, just like the interest on primary
mortgages. So borrowers may be able to save a good deal by
consolidating credit card debts into a home loan.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many people can't resist the temptation to start
using plastic after transferring their debt to a home equity loan.
</P>
<P>
   That's why debt counselors advise people with a lot of credit
card debt to avoid home loans. Instead, they suggest reducing
interest payments by regularly transferring balances to new cards
with low introductory rates and paying off as much of the balance
as possible each month.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior is discouraged by lenders, of course, who make
money from high balances. Both credit card companies and home
equity lenders have reduced their required minimum monthly payments
to discourage customers from paying off their loans, Sohn said.
</P>
<P>
   The current deluge of home equity loan offers is no accident.
Lenders are pushing such loans aggressively these days because they
have been burned by credit cardholder bankruptcies in recent years.
With home equity loans, that credit is secured by physical assets.
</P>
<P>
   Also, banks have plenty of room for additional home loans in
their portfolios because many were paid off during the rash of
mortgage refinancings this decade, said Fritz Elmendorf of the
Consumer Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   A number of resources are available for debt holders who are
considering a home equity loan.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Credit Counseling Services, which has offices around
the Bay Area, offers worksheets and other resources on its Web site
to help people deal with all types of debt or other financial
problems. The nonprofit group also offers counseling over the
telephone or in person for about $10.
</P>
<P>
   People who have decided to take out a home loan must decide
whether they want a standard loan or a line of credit. Standard
loans must be taken out in a lump sum and repaid in monthly
installments, just like primary mortgages. Interest rates, which
are generally fixed, are now about 8.9 percent, according to Bank
Rate Monitor's daily survey.
</P>
<P>
   Lines of credit, which are becoming more popular, can be drawn
upon at the borrower's discretion, just like a checking account.
Interest is paid only on the outstanding balance. Lines of credit
generally have a floating interest rate, now about 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As with any kind of financing, shop around for the best deal on
a home equity loan. Don't just accept the first offer you receive,
even if the phony $50,000 check with your name on it makes your
mouth water. (The check is just a marketing gimmick _ you still
have to apply for the loan, and it's not guaranteed you'll get it.)
Borrowers should read the fine print and tally up startup fees and
annual fees when deciding which loan to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Ads and solicitations by lenders are required to identify their
regulator, usually the California Department of Corporations or the
California Department of Real Estate. Consumers can check out
potential lenders with those two agencies.

 BankAmerica Says 80% of Old BofA Execs to Stay  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The new BankAmerica said yesterday a large majority of managers
from the old BofA have decided to stay put, a development analysts
said is surprising given the upheaval since North Carolina's
NationsBank took control three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 percent of the old BofA's 1,134 executives and managers
are remaining, while the rest are taking advantage of severance
packages triggered when NationsBank bought San Francisco's BofA and
took its name, bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank insisted that it's keeping almost all the people it
wants. The bank offered jobs to 918 of the BofA executives and
managers, and 98 percent signed agreements to stay, spokeswoman
Melba Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the numbers are right, it's encouraging,'' said Joseph
Morford, an analyst at Van Kasper &AMP; Co. ``It could be the first
step in putting some of these social issues to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Current and former BofA employees say many managers found
NationsBank job offers irresistible because they still would let
the employees collect golden parachutes down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Practically all of the managers who agreed to stay signed
agreements that provide them their entire severance benefit plus a
10 percent premium in two years if they aren't happy at the new
bank. The payouts would be made in stock, with minimum sums
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They provided a very lucrative package,'' said a former BofA
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some bank watchers suggested that NationsBank was
hiding defections at top executive levels by releasing statistics
that included hundreds of middle managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at key positions, key roles, it's much
different,'' said Tony Price, an executive recruiter with Russell
Reynolds Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The bank declined to release separate data on the 45 top
executives who composed the old BofA's Senior Management Council,
arguing that the information could be misinterpreted. At least 15
of that group, including seven of 10 women, have resigned or been
forced out, said current and former bank employees.
</P>
<P>
   Since The Chronicle reported the departures of six senior female
executives last month, Executive Vice President Mary Wikstrom quit,
the bank confirmed. Wikstrom ran the old BofA's telephone banking
centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those 45 people had the most lucrative contracts, and money
may have been a factor,'' NationsBank's Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of managers from the old BofA who leave is an
extremely sensitive issue, given the turmoil that's rocked the bank
since NationsBank snared BofA.
</P>
<P>
   After NationsBank chief executive Hugh McColl ousted David
Coulter, his counterpart at the old BofA, analysts warned that the
bank could be vulnerable to an exodus of senior staff members as
NationsBank consolidated control.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and managers of the old BofA were covered by
so-called change-of-control agreements, contracts awarding them big
payouts if the bank were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on their rank, they were eligible to collect benefits
that ranged from less than a year's to three year's worth of salary
and bonuses. The deadline for exercising the golden parachutes
passed late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Women represented 27 percent of those covered by golden
parachute agreements, and they constituted the same percentage of
those who opted to stay, the bank said. ``There's no gain nor loss
for women,'' Spencer said.

 If Internet Stocks Are So Great, Why Are the Insiders Unloading?  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
If Internet stocks are such compelling investments, why were
insiders _ those who should appreciate underlying value _ unloading
their shares during the last quarter of 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Mom-and-pop investors rang out the old year bidding up dot-com
stocks like there was no tomorrow (perhaps you or yours took part
in the party), but a bevy of paper-millionaires inside the virtual
walls of these under-profitable wonders were doing just the
opposite: converting their stock certificates into greenbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of October, more than 300 insiders at some
24 Web-related companies unloaded millions of shares at prices
frothier than the foam atop a double latte, according to CDA
Investnet Technologies, a Maryland research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The most eager of all of the sellers appears to have been
Books-a-Million Chairman Charles Anderson, who told the Securities
and Exchange Commission in November that he planned to sell 401,468
shares of BAM stock, CDA Investnet states.
</P>
<P>
   BAM was a sleepy brick-and-mortar bookseller based in Alabama
until it converted itself into an overnight Internet sensation by
launching an ``enhanced`` e-tailing Web site in November. (I guess
all you have to do is say ``books and Internet'' in the same breath
and, presto, you have a world-beating stock.)
</P>
<P>
   But what makes Anderson's decision to unload shares even more
curious is that he was willing to pay a penalty to do so. BAM's
chairman bought 22,500 shares in October at around $3 a share. (The
stock peaked at $47 a share on November 30, and closed yesterday at
$13.25.)
</P>
<P>
   There is an SEC rule that prohibits insiders from selling shares
at a profit until six months after they are bought. If they are
sold prior to that time, the insider must give profits taken from
those shares back to his company.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Anderson voluntarily opted to pay a $767,040
penalty in order to dump his October shares sooner rather than
later. Does that mean Anderson believes that BAM shares might be
worth less than three bucks come March?
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely seemed to be some urgency there,'' says Bob
Gabele, editor of CDA/Investnet's Insider Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, drawing conclusions from the buy-and-sell decisions
of insiders can be dubious. For instance, cash-poor executives at
startups often need to exercise options during certain regulatory
windows and then sell those shares to avoid tax hits. The result:
They are often sellers even though their firms are going like
gangbusters.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, insiders are known to gobble up shares despite
any evidence that their companies expect a boost in earnings or
that their firms are takeover bait.
</P>
<P>
   So why, then, bother to watch insider trading?
</P>
<P>
   Because insider buying and selling emits a pattern of behavior.
And any deviation in that pattern can sometimes signal a
significant sea change in the psychology of the market, Gabele
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always looking for changes in behavior,'' Gabele says.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, Gabele, a veteran market watcher, thinks he has
cited a profound one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to marvel at a veritable explosion of insider
selling at the Internet-related companies,'' Gabele says.
</P>
<P>
   During previous quarters of Net mania, insiders virtually across
the sector had held their shares. And when you consider some of the
extraordinary gains these companies experienced, their decisions to
hang on to their stock sent a strong message that these companies
actually might be worthy of their lofty valuations. What's more,
insider discipline was underscored during the market meltdown of
last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Insiders) had been hanging on to their shares, and they were
conspicuous by their absence from the sellers' list,'' Gabele
notes.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional stock valuation methods being tossed out the
window, investors and analysts have been grasping for whatever
metric (Street-babble for measurement) they could intellectually
apply to justify sky-high Internet stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, disciplined insider ownership was viewed as a cornerstone
to last year's stock market recovery in general, and to the rebound
of Web stocks in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide began to turn at the beginning of October, when
insiders began to aggressively sell shares. Subsequently, there has
been a ``landslide'' of additional selling ``as insiders appear
remarkably and increasingly eager to get out while they can,''
Gabele warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fascinated by the timing of all of this,'' Gabele says.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we all should.

 AirTouch Merger Hopes Kept Alive  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell Atlantic Corp. and AirTouch Communications are in closed-door
meetings trying to resolve thorny issues surrounding their possible
merger, sources close to the negotiations said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which is rumored to be offering about $45 billion
for San Francisco's AirTouch, is trying to avoid being socked with
a bill for ``goodwill'' _ the value of a company's reputation and
its customer and business relationships _ that could dilute the
phone company's earnings for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are also reportedly hammering out what assets will
be divested if a merger goes through. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic is in the process of acquiring GTE Corp., which
operates wireless service in some of the same cities as AirTouch,
including San Francisco and San Diego. Federal rules prohibit
companies from owning two major cellular licenses in a single
market, so a deal with AirTouch would force Bell Atlantic to dump
some of either GTE's or AirTouch's cellular licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and AirTouch have confirmed they are in
negotiations but have not given details of any deal. In a prepared
statement, AirTouch said ``significant issues still remain'' and
``there can be no assurance that any transaction will result from
these discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic is courting AirTouch to help it get a ``national
footprint,'' which would give it access to more customers and the
opportunity to offer a single rate for service across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Customers have become extremely picky when it comes to wireless
service and now favor providers that can offer national service for
a low price.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which has 5.7 million cellular customers on the
East Coast, has been losing customers to companies like AT&AMP;T,
Sprint PCS and Nextel, which offer nationwide wireless service.
</P>
<P>
   That's because carriers that don't have a national network must
sign expensive roaming agreements with providers where they don't
have a presence. They pass along costly ``roaming fees'' that can
amount to 60 cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   As wireless prices drop, analysts said, the only choice for
carriers that want to survive is to build a national network and
drop the roaming charges. The latest industry statistics predict
costs for wireless service will fall to 3 cents per minute over the
next two years. Companies with roaming charges will find it hard to
compete in a market with such low rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roaming (charges) will rapidly be going away,'' said Kevin
Roe, an analyst with ABN AMRO in New York. ``It's arcane. There's
no reason why you should be paying more if you leave the home
network. They don't have it in Europe and it only existed here
because we didn't have competition in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining with AirTouch would give Bell Atlantic customers in
almost every state and catapult the company to the No. 1 wireless
carrier in the world with more than 14 million wireless customers
in the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch has 7.6 million U.S. customers, Bell Atlantic has 5.7
million and GTE Wireless has about 5 million. However, some of
those customers could be lost to divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gets Bell Atlantic closer to being a nationwide
provider,'' said Jane Zweig, an analyst with Shosteck Associates in
Wheaton, Md. ``Bell Atlantic has a very strong presence on the East
Coast, GTE has the Southern states and AirTouch gives them the
West.''
</P>
<P>
   While a merger would mean one fewer competitor, industry
watchers said the deal would be good for consumers because it would
enable Bell Atlantic to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be very good for customers who will be able to buy a
phone and use it nationally and internationally,'' said Cole of
Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent of Americans subscribe to a cellular service,
and that number is expected to hit 30 percent by the end of 1999,
according to the Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect the deal to go through, although some think
Bell Atlantic will wind up paying much more for AirTouch than the
rumored price, which is a 10 to 15 percent premium over AirTouch's
stock value.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good chance it will be higher than $45 billion,''
said Andrew Cole, senior manager at Renaissance Worldwide, a
telecommunications research firm in Boston. ``I can't imagine
(AirTouch chief executive) Sam Ginn is going to sit back and take
10 to 15 percent. It's an extremely strong possibility that there
will be other suitors for AirTouch, and Bell Atlantic needs
AirTouch to have a national footprint.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the prolonged negotiations took its toll on both
AirTouch and Bell Atlantic stock yesterday. AirTouch, which soared
after the rumors first surfaced on New Year's Eve, fell $4.19 to
$68.25. Bell Atlantic dropped $2.06 to $51.94.

 SangStat Gets OK on Drug to Stop Rejection  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A Menlo Park biotech firm said yesterday it has received Food and
Drug Administration approval for a new drug to prevent kidney
transplant rejection.
</P>
<P>
   SangStat Medical Corp. said the FDA had OKd its petition to
begin U.S. sales of Thymoglobulin. The remedy, which was developed
in Europe, is already being prescribed in 51 other countries to
help reverse acute organ rejection, a condition that occurs when a
recipient's immune system fights a kidney transplant as if it were
an invading disease.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analyst David Buck with Sands Brothers in New York
said Thymoglobulin will compete with an existing drug called Atgam
that costs $8,500 for the post-surgery treatment. Based on his
assumption that SangStat will price Thymoglobulin at $6,000 to gain
a price advantage, Buck estimated that the new drug will earn $10
million for the company this year _ and make the startup profitable
in 2000. SangStat, which went public in 1993, lost $21 million in
1997 on sales of $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's FDA approval of Thymoglobulin was SangStat's second
recent coup. In November, the company received the green light to
start selling SangCya, a drug that kidney, heart and liver
transplant patients must take daily for the rest of their lives to
prevent organ rejection.
</P>
<P>
   SangStat has allied itself with European biotech firms, notably
Rhone Poulenc Rorer Inc., to cooperate in developing, testing and
selling transplant drugs.
</P>
<P>
   SangStat coupled yesterday's Thymoglobulin news with an
announcement that former Rhone Poulenc executive Jean-Jacques
Bienaime would become its new chief executive officer. Bienaime,
who joined SangStat in June as president, will replace Philippe
Pouletty, who will remain as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Buck said the management change was expected, as Pouletty had
earlier signaled that he was grooming Bienaime for the CEO spot.
</P>
<P>
   SangStat shares gained $1.50 yesterday to close at $22.75 before
the drug approval and management change were announced. The company
hit a recent high of $40.63 in December 1997 but sank as low as
$15.13 in the fall stock slump that affected many small biotech
firms.

 Qualifying For the Roth IRAs  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  We are a retired couple with a combined adjusted gross
income of slightly more than $100,000. We are interested in opening
Roth Individual Retirement Accounts. At first we heard that you can
qualify for a Roth if you have income of less than $160,000. But
then someone told us that our income would have to be less than
$100,000. Which is correct?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Actually, both.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to roll funds over to a Roth IRA from a traditional
IRA, a 401(k) or other retirement plan, you and your wife must have
a combined income no greater than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to start a new Roth, you can do it if your
income does not exceed $160,000. For single individuals, the limit
is $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   So you and your wife won't be able to do a rollover, but you can
start new Roths, with maximum contributions of $2,000 each per
year.
</P>
<P>
   You really should. I can't emphasize strongly enough what a
great deal Roth IRAs are.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional IRAs, your investment gains are taxed as
ordinary income when you withdraw your money. With a Roth, all your
investment gains accumulate tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional IRAs, you are forced to withdraw funds after
you reach age 701/2. With a Roth, there is no requirement to remove
your funds, regardless of your age. In fact, you can go on
contributing to a Roth after age 701/2.
</P>
<P>
   401(k) Performance
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been working at my current company for a couple of years
and have been contributing to the 401(k) plan all this time.
Believe it or not, I have yet to see a statement of my balance. I
know how much I have deposited, but I just don't know how my money
is performing. I'm beginning to wonder whether my money is even
making it into the 401(k) account. What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Most 401(k) providers send their participants a report
every quarter detailing the plan's investment performance. But no
provider is legally required to send any statements unless the
participant asks. Your provider's behavior is dubious from a
customer-relations standpoint, but it's legal.
</P>
<P>
   The law does require the provider to send a statement once a
year if you ask for it. If the provider wants to play hardball, you
will have to keep asking every year. But perhaps you can get them
to put you on a regular mailing list _ and if you plead enough you
might even get quarterly reports. Give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Giltenan, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price, one of the leading
401(k) providers, says there is legislation before Congress that
would require providers to send out more than one statement per
year if a participant desires. T. Rowe Price itself sends
statements out quarterly without being asked. ``Any provider worth
its salt does that,'' Giltenan contends.
</P>
<P>
   Paying for College
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to take money from my Individual Retirement
Account to pay my son's college expenses. I am less than 591/2
years old. What is the maximum annual amount I can withdraw without
paying the 10 percent penalty tax? Also, can I use IRA money to pay
for college expenses incurred before 1998?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let's take the last question first.
</P>
<P>
   Congress liberalized the rules for education-related IRA
withdrawals, effective Jan. 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If you take money out of your IRA to pay college expenses
incurred before that date, you will get hit with the 10 percent
penalty because you are less than 591/2 years old. In addition, you
will have to pay regular income taxes on your withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   If you withdraw money to pay expenses incurred on Jan. 1, 1998,
and later, again you must pay regular income taxes. But there will
be no penalty no matter what your age. And you can withdraw as much
money as you need to meet legitimate educational expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The money you withdraw must be used only for certain narrowly
defined purposes such as tuition, fees, books, supplies and
equipment necessary to get your son through his course of study.
But you can't use it for room and board, travel expenses and other
so-called incidentals.
</P>
<P>
   In figuring how much you can withdraw penalty-free, you must
take into account any tax-free scholarships, grants or other
education-related payments your son may have received. Included in
that total would be any withdrawals from an Education IRA, if you
have one.
</P>
<P>
   If your son's education expenses amount to $20,000, say, and he
got $5,000 in nontaxable reimbursements, you can withdraw no more
than $15,000 from your IRA if you want to avoid the 10 percent
penalty.

 &HT;    Texas hauls in big ones
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas football team continued to put
together what likely will be one of the country's top recruiting
classes, by picking up commitments from the top offensive lineman
in the state and one of the best defensive ends in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   UT picked up pledges from Houston Yates offensive lineman Alfio
Randall and Cole Pittman, a defensive end from Shreveport, La. The
two commitments give UT 26, although two, including Pittman, will
enroll in school this month and their scholarships will count
toward last year's class.
</P>
<P>
   Randall is ranked No. 4 on the Austin American-Statesman's
Fabulous 55, a list of the state's top recruits. He is the 15th UT
commitment from the list. Texas A&AMP;M has the second highest number
of commitments with four, with Tennessee in third with three.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman is the best defensive player in Louisiana and before the
season was ranked as the top rush end in the country by SuperPrep
and Blue Chip Illustrated. The National Recruiting Advisor ranks
Pittman as the 89th best player in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman brought Texas Coach Mack Brown, recruiting coordinator
Hardee McCrary and wide receiver coach Darryl Drake to Sunday
morning church services, where he announced his commitment to the
congregation. He already has graduated from Evangel High School,
will enroll at Texas this month and go through spring drills in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman also took official visits to Nebraska, Florida and LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt Texas was the best place for me,'' said Pittman, who
registered 125 tackles and 21 sacks this fall. ``I'm glad I found
the college that I love.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall, who also considered Georgia, Michigan, Tennessee and
Nebraska, is UT's fifth commitment from the Fab 55's top 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns also have commitments from No. 6 Derrick Dockery,
an offensive lineman from Garland Lakeview Centennial; No. 7 Kenny
Hayter, a running back from Cypress Falls; No. 9 Artie Ellis, a
wide receiver from Spring Westfield and No. 11 O.J. McClintock, a
wide receiver from Westwood High School.
</P>
<P>
   National signing day is Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Randall had committed to Texas this summer, but withdrew it in
the fall to make sure he made a passing test score on his college
entrance exams. Both his aunt and uncle, whom he lives with, said
Randall has reaffirmed his commitment to the Longhorns.

 &HT;    Neighbors lend helping hand during bad weather
 &HT;    By Lawrence Budd and Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ After four days spent snowed in at her Bellbrook
home, Vera Sorah was ecstatic at the prospect of being liberated by
Anthony Bizzarro's labors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been out since Thursday. I'm getting cabin fever,''
said Sorah, 80, Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   All over the Miami Valley, people strived to return their lives
to normal after the weekend snowstorm. Some returned to work, while
others, like Bizzarro, took time to help their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting Bizzarro's arrival Monday, Sorah and her husband,
Elmer, 86, stayed busy taking down the Christmas tree and packing
up holiday decorations. The couple had enough supplies to carry
them through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plenty of food. I just want to get out of this
house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Sorah wasn't so anxious. On Sunday, he had taken a spill
while trying to negotiate drifts up to a foot deep that had piled
up against the garage door. ``I don't want to go out in this
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Bizzarro was hacking his way through the final patches
of frozen snow filling the Sorah's driveway. After two hours of
work, Bizzarro seemed to have prevailed. The cost to the Sorahs: a
cup of hot chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally a cup of hot cocoa will do the trick. I've already
had my first glass,'' said Bizzarro, a volunteer firefighter clad
in an insulated union suit.

   ``Most of the neighbors know me. They know to call me if they
need help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A young trio of Good Samaritans in Huber Heights _ Jasmin
Carter, 12; Lauria Bonds, 11; and Adriana Meade, 11 _ spent part of
their day off from school Monday afternoon helping friends and
neighbors dig out their driveways near Troy Pike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really look at it as hard work,'' said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel better helping people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we just hope that people don't die (in the snow and cold),
like that one man in Dayton we heard about,'' Meade said.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, when they're finished for the day, Carter said,
``We're all going over to (Meade's) house for macaroni and cheese
and hot chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Meyer, a letter carrier whose Dayton route is near Woodbine
and Woodman avenues, said many of his customers are too elderly to
shovel their walks, but some still found a way to make his life
easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made paths from one driveway to the next, and that's
nice,'' he said. ``I appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   The minute Danny Glascoe, 30, of Illinois Avenue in Dayton tried
to get his car unstuck Sunday, ``about three or four people were
helping me,'' he said. ``One guy saw me and came out of his car
about halfway down the street, and a neighbor I know ran down the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Winglewich, 64, of Kettering said his Marilyn Street
neighbor Phil Hart lent him a younger man's muscle ``when he saw I
was digging out from my steps to get to my car.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Spoonamore of North Dayton was cleaning off her own van
Monday afternoon so she could give a stranded neighbor a ride to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just always check on everybody around here _ if anybody
needs a shovel or a ride,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Hurd, 33, of Dayton was on his way across town to offer
his girlfriend a ride to work Monday morning when his Caprice
Classic stopped cold and couldn't be revived at the intersection of
Forest Avenue and Grand Street.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd knew just who to call _ his uncle, Larry Banks, who drove
all the way down from Clayton to try to restart his engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure what's wrong yet, but he's here to help me
out,'' Hurd said, watching his uncle trying to do his magic with
starting fluid and jumper cables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was asleep when he called me this morning about
eight,'' Banks complained good-naturedly. ``And I shoveled him out
twice last night, too. I still got my stuff in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurd smiled. ``Yeah, he's the one I call.''

GALAXY TRADES CALICHMAN TO NEW ENGLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- The Galaxy traded all-star defender and team captain
Dan Calichman to New England Monday for for a second-round college
pick (13th overall) and the Revolution's first-round supplemental
choice in the upcoming 1999 drafts.
</P>
<P>
   Calichman, 30, was sidelined most of last season sidelined with
a broken leg. The fiery, red-head who gave his heart and soul to
the Galaxy made a spirited comeback and rejoined the team for its
regular-season finale, but wasn't fit enough for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The New York native was instrumental in leading the Galaxy to
the MLS Cup in 1996 and was the only Galaxy player to start in all
32 regular-season games in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Calichman was one of the team's most vocal players and also one
of the most adored by fans. But he said he believes his trade
stemmed from his disagreements with coach Octavio Zambrano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been torn between trying to rip (Zambrano) apart and just
saying my piece and moving on,'' Calichman said. ``This trade made
me very upset and it was very personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously excited that New England wanted me. I have a
background in New England and certainly if there's another team to
go to, that would have been the one, but I didn't want to leave the
Galaxy.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano, who left for Ecuador Friday for a family visit, won't
return until the middle of this month. Before he left, however, he
explained his reasons for the trade, which was agreed to in
principle last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very grateful to Dan and all that he has done,''
Zambrano said. ``We will miss his leadership but I believe it is
time for the Galaxy to make a movement toward youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Jolley (23 years old) played an instrumental role for us
last season and now we need to give him time to develop into one of
the finest defenders in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Calichman said he didn't believe that for a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he says he did this to bring up the future of young
players, I'm not buying that,'' Calichman said. ``What kind of
future does (Zambrano) have? He has a one-year contract left. He
doesn't even know his future with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this was a personal decision. You can't tell me he
would give up his captain after all I did to come back for this
organization for any other reason than a personal one. He had his
reasons, but all his talk about the future and going in another
direction is for the reporters to believe, not me.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, the Galaxy was sold to Kings co-owner Philip F.
Anschutz for $26 million. Zambrano's future with the team was in
question at that time and a few of the players, including
Calichman, voiced their displeasure with Zambrano to new team
president Tim Leiweke.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy wound up retaining Zambrano as coach. Calichman
believes his trade had something to do with his comments to
Leiweke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly haven't denied I was one of the players who spoke
to Tim, but the players didn't set up that meeting,'' Calichman
said. ``The players were asked to come in and be honest and I don't
feel bad about what I said. I have no guilt, I answered questions
to what was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, this was just a personal decision because I didn't
have nice things to say and Octavio has an idea of who went (to the
meeting) and what was said and that played a big part in this
trade, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano won't get a chance to respond to Calichman's comments
until a conference call this morning, but assistant coach Ralph
Perez came to Zambrano's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was bad blood between Octavio and Dan, I can honestly
say I didn't see it,'' Perez said. ``Sure, there were some comments
that were made that took Octavio by surprise because he never
expected or anticipated some players were unhappy, but that had no
bearing on this trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only carry so many defenders and central backs,''
Perez continued. ``We have a number of players in the over-30 age
group. We had to take a hard look and make a decision, and that was
to go with younger players at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Calichman also was upset that neither Zambrano nor Perez
informed him that a trade was brewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my eyes, both of them handled this with tremendous
disrespect to me after all I have done since the beginning,''
Calichman said. ``Last year was a tough year and after all my
effort to come back this is what I get for it, not even a phone
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought at least I earned the respect for the coaches to
call me and tell me what was going on and that never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said that wasn't possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad Dan feels we didn't communicate with him,'' Perez
said. ``I don't think it's a good idea to tell players you're
thinking about trading them. What happens if it doesn't work? You
have an unhappy player then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team itself is respectful of Dan. The players admired his
ability to come back in such a quick manner and so did Octavio and
myself. But this all boiled down to a business decision and nothing
else.''

BOEING EXCEEDS GOAL IN AIRPLANE DELIVERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ By dramatically reducing its inventory of planes sent
to the desert for storage, The Boeing Co. was able to deliver a
record 559 airplanes last year _ nine more than its goal.
</P>
<P>
   When Boeing announced at the end of the third quarter it had 36
planes in desert storage that it had not been able to deliver to
customers because of the Asian economic crisis, most industry
analysts doubted the company would be able to reduce that inventory
enough to meet its goal of delivering 550 planes by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said Monday, in publicly releasing its total commercial
and military airplane deliveries for 1998, that it had only four
remaining planes in desert storage at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very positive,'' said Peter Arment, aerospace analysts
with JSA Research. ``It's a positive that should be well received
on Wall Street about how the compay is dealing with the excess
capacity out there in the world's airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's final 1998 delivery figures were released after the
stock market closed. Boeing's stock closed Monday at 32 15/16, up
5/16 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Undelivered planes are flown to airfields in the deserts of
California and Arizona for storage because the weather is ideal and
they will not deteriorate. Many of the 36 aircraft in desert
storage on Sept. 30, the end of the third quarter, were meant for
Asian customers who could no longer afford them. Boeing had to find
new buyers for those planes to meet its year-end delivery goal.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mulally, head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told
reporters last week, that ``all the financing came together'' to
allow airlines to buy or lease the Boeing planes stored in the
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally replaced Ron Woodard, who was fired as head of the
commercial business at the end of August. Despite one of the
industry's biggest boom cycles ever, Boeing lost money for the
first time in a half-century in 1997 and its production lines were
a mess as it tried to crank up production to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   To reach its goal of delivering 550 planes this year, Boeing had
to push a record 182 out its factory doors in the fourth quarter.
It ended up delivering 191 planes in the fourth quarter, for a
year-end total of 559.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered 375 planes in 1997. Included in that figure
were planes built by McDonnell Douglas, which was acquired by
Boeing in mid 1997
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's previous commercial delivery record before the merger
was 446 planes in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing plans to deliver 620 planes in 1999, an 11 percent
increase over this year's total.
</P>
<P>
   But the company enters the new year with the airplane industry
in an economic downturn. The company plans to slash its work force
by 48,000 over the next two years. Many of those job losses will
come from its commercial business in the Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   Production will begin to decline after this year. Boeing plans
to cut its production from from 47 jets per month at the end of the
fourth quarter to 43 by the end of 1999. Production will come down
even more in 2000, to about 35 planes per month.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is ending production of the MD-11, MD-80 and MD-90 models
that are built at the former McDonnell Douglas plant in Long Beach,
Calif. It also plans to cut production of its flagship 747 jumbo
jet in Everett from the current 5 per month to two per month by the
end of 1999, and possibly as few as one per month. Asian airlines
are the biggest customer for the 747, but the economic crisis in
that part of the world has forced carriers to reduce their fleets
and postpone new orders.

 NEW THEORY ON HOW HIV ATTACKS CELLS  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Using a new technique for tracking the life and
death of immune cells, AIDS researchers from the San Francisco Bay
Area have found that HIV causes the deadly disease primarily by
blocking the production and shortening the survival time of
infection-fighting T cells.
</P>
<P>
   That runs counter to the widely held view among AIDS scientists
that HIV strikes mainly by killing T cells, the body's front-line
defenders, as fast as the immune system can produce them.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial new findings include the first direct
measurements showing how the human immune system becomes locked in
a lethal battle with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   The results challenge a core tenet in the scientific dogma of
AIDS, a view that has dominated the field ever since a landmark
1995 study co-authored by famed New York AIDS expert David Ho.
</P>
<P>
   The Ho group's research pictured the AIDS virus as a virulent
attacker that destroys immune cells by the millions, which spurs a
flood of new cells _ which also become infected and die.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, according to this view, the immune system collapses
from exhaustion. That leaves the infected victims vulnerable to all
the deadly opportunistic diseases that mark the AIDS syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine,
suggests a fundamentally different process at work. The study
appears along with two separate reports on promising but very
early-stage experimental approaches to treating the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the studies foretell a new generation of
immune-system targeted AIDS therapies, experts said. Given the the
growing problem of drug-resistant strains of HIV, they note, such
new weapons in the AIDS battle are vitally important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely need new approaches,'' said Dr. Warner Greene,
director of the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology at
the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers affiliated with the Gladstone Institute and the
University of California at Berkeley suggest that the previous
theory, with its presumed flurry of T-cell output, was an illusion
of faulty assumptions and poor measurement techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists used a newly developed molecular tag to track the
ebb and flow of helper T cells. They spent more than a year
studying immune systems in healthy people and in 21 AIDS patients
being treated at San Francisco General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   This produced what the authors described as the first direct
clinical measurements of immune-system activity both in AIDS
patients and an uninfected control group.
</P>
<P>
   Results found no T-cell speed-up-and-collapse pattern in the
infected people. What researchers found instead was that, along
with reduced cell longevity, the virus caused slower cell
production _ the opposite of what had been assumed to occur during
this critical stage of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Just how the AIDS virus might damage T-cell production has yet
to be unraveled. And there are as yet no proven therapies to
address the new view of the disease, which would call for
treatments that defend the immune system, insulating it from HIV or
making it robust enough to withstand the virus. By comparison,
today's therapies take direct aim at stopping the virus from
reproducing.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS experts emphasized that nothing in the study suggests
people with HIV should change their current therapy, and certainly
no one should stop taking anti-viral drug combinations now in
widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   But the experts said the new picture of the ``dynamics'' of the
disease suggests new research priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had really done the study in humans to answer the true
physiological questions of AIDS,'' said lead author Marc
Hellerstein. ``Is it mainly a disease of cell production or
destruction? The answer can totally change your biological focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Volberding, a veteran AIDS specialist at San Francisco
General, called the new cell-tracking system at the heart of the
study a ``tremendously exciting'' tool.
</P>
<P>
   The method uses a harmless sugar molecule that can be easily
detected in the DNA of the target cells, avoiding the health risks
of radioactive or chemical markers in human test subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a tool we've been waiting for for a very long
time,'' Volberding said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious-disease branch of the
National Institutes of Health and a noted AIDS expert, said the new
study is drawing close scrutiny and could be widely influential _
if the results, which run counter to those from other
well-respected laboratories, hold up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a controversial area,'' Fauci said. ``I think it will
remain a controversial area. It's a good paper, using an
interesting technique ... but the jury is still out.''
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in Nature Medicine portrayed the UCSF-Berkeley
study as definitive evidence, but Ho indicated through a
spokeswoman at the Aaron Diamond AIDS research center in New York
that he is not yet convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, by contrast, called the new study a ``paradigm shift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This completely alters the way we think about the pathogenesis
of AIDS,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the AIDS virus infects and kills T cells. The
argument is whether that's the main cause of fatal illness or if
something else is at play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study tells us HIV does two things,'' said UCSF
researcher Joseph McCune. ``It does destroy cells, but its main
effect appears to be on the systems of cell production. What that
tells us is that we have to get rid of the virus, no question about
that, but we really need to focus our attention on the systems of
cell production.''

TELEVISION REVIEW: THE FACE OF HATE MADE PLAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (Production notes at end of the review)  
(ms) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First prize in Wednesday night's contest for crudeness and
cruelty to homosexuals must go to middle managers of a West Coast
branch of Cantor Fitzgerald, a big securities trading company. The
disgusting adolescent pranks of these million-dollar-a-year traders
drove Mark Anderson out of what he thought was a bright new career.
</P>
<P>
   But blue-collar workers, too, showed they can compete, sometimes
physically, by picking on Ron Woods, a Chrysler electrician.
Fearing for his safety, he left the company.
</P>
<P>
   And lest the working class get all the credit for
anti-homosexual enthusiasm, Cheryl Summerville was dismissed by
Cracker Barrel, a Southern restaurant chain, on the ground that her
``sexual preference failed to demonstrate normal heterosexual
values.''
</P>
<P>
   The three case histories that make up HBO's ``Out at Work''
attest that animus against homosexuals is still alive if not
exactly well around the nation. As the program, narrated by Grethe
Cammermeyer, an Army colonel who was discharged for revealing that
she is a lesbian, reminds us, in 40 states it is still legal to get
rid of people because they are not heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an upbeat note here, it is the resistance shown by
the subjects of the abuse. Ms. Summerville especially was
championed by picketing, sit-ins and other well publicized
demonstrations, which resulted in Cracker Barrel's protesting that
it did not discriminate, not that Ms. Summerville or the others who
had been discharged got their jobs back.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won election as a union delegate and went on to campaign
for a ``sexual orientation'' clause in the anti-discrimination
provisions of the new Chrysler contract. He didn't succeed
entirely, but changes have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Most striking in these accounts is the mockery, the revulsion,
the downright hate evidenced by some of those who are caught on
camera. No sympathy for Ms. Summerville is detectable among
worshipers at the local Baptist church. Elsewhere a man quotes the
Bible as his authority that homosexuals ought to be killed. The
milder punishment, defended by Cracker Barrel patrons who say their
``family values'' are offended by the presence of a lesbian
waitress, is to take away her livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Work'' is a close-up of how deeply feelings against
homosexuals can still reach and how vicious they can be.

 &HT;    NBA seeks cancellation of season
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBA leadership announced Monday night a recommendation to cancel
this season and begin preparations for 1999-2000 with ``replacement
players.''
</P>
<P>
   In what was tantamount to a direct plea to the players union to
vote for the owners' last proposal, presented Dec. 29, commissioner
David Stern and deputy Russ Granik said in a teleconference call
that the union's final offer was unacceptable. Granik called it
``in many respects a step backward.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer was presented Monday afternoon by union executive
director Billy Hunter and players association president Patrick
Ewing and then forwarded to the nine-member labor committee, which
voted unanimously to recommend killing the season, Granik said. The
full 29-member board of governors will consider that Thursday in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting to see what they're going to do,'' Hunter said
Monday night, before announcing he is going to bring all 430
players to New York for a vote Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll educate them to make an informed decision,'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   Stern made an appeal to middle- and lower-echelon players by
painting a picture of a new, small league for elite players that
would leave them out in the cold next winter. ``Our players have
been sold a bill of goods about a new league,'' he charged.
</P>
<P>
   The clear reference was to agents David Falk and Arn Tellem when
Stern said agents will take 100 players and abandon the rest. They
would then be there for a reconstructed NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cancel season we've been directed by committee to make
plans for the '99-2000 season. It's not necessarily a pretty sight
early on,'' Stern said. ``If we have to rebuild, we will rebuild.
We have draft choices (among a pool of players). If we can't make a
deal with this issue we have to deal with the issue of replacement
players. A new league would skim off a view players and that would
be it. a sad thing to contemplate and I'm sorry our own players
can't deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it is clear that the union will face decertification
because it could not make a deal the only union members next season
presumably would be those who compete in the new league that has
been proposed only in the most general terms. ``Decertification is
of no interest to us one way or the other,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the enormity of the task of reconstructing TV
contracts and ticket prices for a downscale NBA, Stern said, ``We
are aware of what that entails'' and even suggested the he
preferred that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be commissioner of a league that doesn't have tiers
of competitiveness and doesn't lose money,'' Stern said. He spoke
of a modeling the NBA as a hybrid of other sports leagues and said
that meant dealing with competitive issues. ``I want to have 29
teams that fans think can compete and have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the NBA could simply declare an impasse on Thursday and
open its doors to anyone wishing to play, he said, Nothing prevents
us (from doing that) but the committee has agreed not to do that.
Having come this far, with the uneasiness and lack of definition,
the season's lost. We're not going to play this year.''
</P>
<P>
   If the season is canceled Thursday the decision will be
irrevocable, Granik said. ``if we cancel the season that means the
season is canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there was simply no progress, that the league and the
union were still far apart on such issues as maximum salaries,
percentage of income in years four through six of the proposals and
the numbers for rookies.

NURSES IN CHEMOTHERAPY OVERDOSE FACE CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts licensure officials decided Monday to
take action against 18 nurses involved in two 1994 chemotherapy
overdoses at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for their role in the
widely reported medication errors, which resulted in the death of
one patient and serious cardiac injury to another.
</P>
<P>
   Two nurses have signed consent agreements with the state nursing
board accepting a year's probation and rigorous retraining in
cancer chemotherapy administration. For the other 16, there will be
a disciplinary hearing and possible sanctions ranging from license
revocation to a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   The state's action reopens a not-quite-healed wound at the
renowned Boston cancer center, which is still implementing reforms
in response to the overdoses. It also guarantees a national debate
within the profession about the accountability of nurses for
medication errors, according to those in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will cause a lot of controversy and debate among nurses,''
said Bridget Culhane of the Pittsburgh-based Oncology Nursing
Society. ``Some people feel nurses should walk on water and never
make a mistake, and others feel we should acknowledge that nurses
are human.''
</P>
<P>
   In her nine years with the Oncology Nursing Society, which
represents 27,000 nurses who specialize in cancer care, Culhane
said she knew of no other case in which oncology nurses have been
disciplined by licensure boards for chemotherapy overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   Chemotherapy overdoses may be on the rise, due in part to the
proliferation of high-dose treatments. A recent survey by Judith
Shindul-Rothschild of Boston College found that nearly half of
oncology nurses believe medication errors are increasing, a higher
proportion than among any other nurse specialties.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is growing tension between the
traditional school of thought, which insists on strict individual
accountability of medical practitioners for negligence, and a newer
view that decries the ``blame game'' and calls for systemic reforms
and greater openness about errors.
</P>
<P>
   Shindul-Rothschild said the board's decision to take action
against the nurses is ``a bitter, bitter lesson'' for all nurses,
but added: ``I don't think the board of nursing has a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call ourselves licensed professionals for a reason,'' the
Boston College nursing professor added. ``We are each and every one
of us accountable for our patients. Once you take on that mantle,
you take every responsibility that goes with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others sharply disagreed with the board's decision.
Dana-Farber's president, Dr. David G. Nathan, and its nursing
chief, Susan Grant, called it ``inappropriate and unwarranted,''
and noted that the institute, the state health department, and
national accreditation officials found no fault with individual
nurses involved in the overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   The Dana-Farber chemotherapy overdoses brought international
attention to the problem of medication errors. The episode resulted
in the death of 39-year-old Betsy A. Lehman, a Globe health
columnist, and heart damage in Maureen Bateman, a 53-year-old North
Andover schoolteacher who later died of recurrent cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Some nursing authorities commented in 1995, when the overdoses
first became known, on the conspicuous absence of nurses among
those held accountable for the errors by the Dana- Farber's
internal investigations and disciplinary processes. The hospital
did cite doctors and pharmacists as contributors.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the institute explained that it was not policy to
require nurses to double-check doctors' medication orders and
verify their accuracy with experimental protocols or treatment
plans. Such a requirement has since been implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts nursing board officials said in interviews Monday
that nurses should be held accountable for not verifying doses
regardless of hospitals' policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board did discuss that issue,'' said Theresa Bonanno, a
nurse who is executive director of the Massachusetts Board of
Registration in Nursing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law states that the nurse is fully accountable for the
safety of the care that he or she delivers,'' Bonanno said. ``So
despite the fact that there may have been an institutional policy
that said the nurses didn't have to check, it's a basic standard of
care that the nurse knows the drug or the treatment being
administered by him or her as an individual is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Culhane said the Oncology Nursing Society's voluntary guidelines
say that nurses should check doctors' orders against chemotherapy
protocols or treatment plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before treating, our guidelines say you must compare the
written orders to the formal drug protocol and identify the therapy
prescription and administration route,'' Culhane said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Reardon, a Boston attorney who represents all 18 nurses
involved in the case, said he will challenge the board's claim that
the standard of care requires nurses to delve into lengthy and
highly technical chemotherapy protocols before treating each
patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nurses were acting off not a handwritten order sheet but a
typewritten order sheet that had the protocol listed at the top,
and the doctor had filled in for individual patients what he
considered to be the appropriate dosages,'' Reardon said. ``My
contention is that satisfied the nurses' requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said his clients ``feel terrible about what
happened, just terrible. They feel a strong commitment to the
patients and the patients' families. But it arose out of an order
that was incorrectly entered.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor who wrote the incorrect order, James Foran, was in
training as a cancer specialist at the time. Now doing cancer
research in London, Foran signed a consent agreement in November
acknowledging to the Massachusetts Board of Registration in
Medicine that he was guilty of negligence, misconduct, and
malpractice. The board suspended Foran's right to renew his
Massachusetts license for three years, retroactive to October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The state pharmacy board in 1997 formally reprimanded three
Dana-Farber pharmacists for their role in the overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   The board cited two nurses for ``signing off'' on the mistaken
medication order, seven for administering the incorrect dosage for
four days to the two patients, and 16 for failing to verify the
dose during their monitoring of the drug infusions.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing board issued ``orders to show cause'' to the 16
nurses, which requires them to show the board why their licenses
should not be revoked or suspended or they should not receive other
discipline, such as remedial training or reprimand. Formal
disciplinary hearings will be scheduled sometime this year, board
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 are Nancy M. Hopkins, Christin O'Brien, Rolf W. Ludwig,
Robyn V. Woodward, Mary Edson Cowell, Leslie Rae Spencer, Karen
Anne Poreda, Heidi L. Dipietro, Shelly H. Ferman, Maura A. Murray,
Maria Minks Wadsworth, Donna Joseph, Kelly McNeill, Ilene A.
Galinsky, Susan Aikey, and Sheila B. Rozanski.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Lucca and Judith Esther Prisby signed consent agreements,
acknowledging the board's allegations as factually correct and
agreeing to obtain advanced certification in oncology nursing or to
complete 45 hours of additional training.

YOU CAN BE A VIRTUAL TOM OSBORNE AT THIS SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Jan. 2, 1984. The Orange Bowl. One second remaining on the
scoreboard. Nebraska 30, Miami 31. The Cornhuskers have scored and
it's decision time _ go for the tie or the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   And you're Tom Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   That is the role the Nebraska Education Association is putting
visitors in at Coach Osborne: More Than Winning
(www.net.unl.edu/osborne), an interactive site that commemorates
the former Nebraska coach's book while mirroring the recent PBS
special on his storied career.
</P>
<P>
   If Osborne fans missed the Jan. 1 PBS special, they can catch up
at the show's companion site, which was produced by the Nebraska
Education Association's multimedia department at the University of
Nebraska in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers' season is over, of course, but Nebraska fans
who endured the four-loss campaign are certainly aching for
nostalgia, and the Osborne site fits the bill.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chance to be Tom Osborne for a few plays.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the site's best feature is the Be The Coach
section where visitors can match their play-calling skills with
Osborne (Frank Solich might want to try it, but you didn't hear
that here).
</P>
<P>
   The site, also accessible through PBS Online
(www.pbs.org/coachosborne) includes an in-depth Osborne biography,
stories from his coaches and recruits, a discussion section and
history on Nebraska football since 1890.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska-Miami scenario in Be The Coach is among five plays
_ four offensive and one defensive _ that can be viewed on the
site. Each scenario offers three possible plays, which are actual
plays that Osborne called in real-game situations. Make the right
call and up pops a video clip of the play with Osborne explaining
his reason for calling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get the great plays that are near and dear to
Nebraska fans' hearts,'' said Joel Geyer, producer of the site and
PBS special.
</P>
<P>
   In developing the site, Osborne was asked to select pivotal
plays from the top games of his career, Geyer said. Geyer soon
discovered that Nebraska football produced more pivotal plays than
a Web site could handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a CD-rom game if someone wanted to be a little
ambitious,'' Geyer said. ``But (the education association was)
looking for a site friendly for folks with a 28.8 (bits per second)
modem and a 4-year-old computer.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a limitation Tom Osborne-wannabes will simply have to
endure.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S A SUPER SITE: The NFL and Lycos Inc. have joined forces for
this year's edition of Superbowl.com (www.superbowl.com) the
official site for Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   So what does that partnership between the NFL and the 'Net's
second-most visited hub site mean for the average Super Bowl fan?
</P>
<P>
   For one, it certainly means a killer search function on
Superbowl.com.
</P>
<P>
   But it also means increased interactivity and content.
Superbowl.com has always been a five-star site when it comes to
functionality, but Lycos' presence should mean improved technology.
</P>
<P>
   Superbowl.com will include dozens of live chats with players,
coaches and analysts; interactive fan sections; multimedia features
of current matchups and previous Super Bowl highlights; a free
user-friendly homepage builder; searchable image galleries; and
lots of official merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   NEW E-ZINES: Two speciality publications now have companion
online versions.
</P>
<P>
   Spring Training Yearbook Online (www.springtrainingmagazine.com)
fills a void when it comes to baseball spring training on the 'Net.
Before this site came along, spring-training information was
limited to individual baseball sites. The Chapel Hill, N.C.-based
magazine culls data it compiles on spring training _ ticket
information, schedules, maps, top 100 minor-league prospects, etc.
_ and posts it online.
</P>
<P>
   Goalies World Magazine (www.goaliesworld.com), produced by
Gilles Moffet of Loretteville, Quebec, mirrors its print edition
with computer rankings of 700 goalies in 17 professional, junior
and college leagues, commentary and back issues.

ANALYSTS' DOWNGRADING YIELDS DIP IN MINIMED SHARES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After a run-up that saw the company's share price
nearly double in two months, medical devices manufacturer MiniMed
Inc.'s stock dropped as much as 14 percent Monday after the company
was downgraded by two analysts.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed, based in the L.A.-area suburb of Sylmar, shares closed
the day off $7.375, or 7 percent, at $97.375, after a late rally
muted the sell-off. At one point, the issue had been down more than
$15.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of insulin infusion pumps for diabetics was downgraded
Monday by analysts at Salomon Smith Barney and ING Baring Furman
Selz, which changed their recommendations from ``buy'' to
``outperform'' and from ``strong buy'' to ``buy,'' respectively.
The changes came after an extended rally that saw MiniMed's share
price climb from $55.50 at the end of October to a 52-week high of
$110.375 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock was starting to look very pricey relative to the
existing set of (earnings) expectations out there,'' said Volpe
Brown Whelan &AMP; Co. analyst Phillip Nalbone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nalbone said he is maintaining a ``buy'' recommendation
on the company because of its future earnings potential. MiniMed
announced last month that the Food and Drug Administration will
soon begin consideration of approval for its blood glucose sensor,
also aimed at diabetics. &QL;

NBA SEASON IN DOUBT AS UNION OFFER IS REJECTED
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Calling the players' latest labor proposal
inadequate, the National Basketball Association's negotiating
committee voted unanimously on Monday to reject it, reaffirming
that it would recommend the cancellation of the season to the
league's board of governors when it meets in New York on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern made his strongest comments yet
regarding the potential loss of the season, saying that the union's
latest offer not only fell short of the league's desires but
represented a step backward. After meeting for an hour with Billy
Hunter, the union's executive director, and Patrick Ewing, the
union's president, Stern said a settlement appeared unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the union said it would put the league's latest
offer _ one that Stern has said is final _ to a vote of the full
membership at a meeting of players in New York on Wednesday. Stern
has been pressing the union's bargaining committee to do just that,
but until Monday night it had refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said all along the players should have an opportunity
to be heard,'' Jeffrey Mishkin, chief legal counsel for the league,
said when told of the union's intention to hold a vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Monday night, Hunter said the union was
changing its stance on putting the offer to a vote ``to assure that
the owners understand the level of player resolve and the degree of
opposition to the NBA's onerous demands.'' Hunter said the union
would continue to recommend against accepting the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, league officials were concerned about the format of
the vote, which Hunter did not disclose.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing the 9-0 vote by the league's labor committee
Monday, Stern said: ``The NBA owners are going to act on the
recommendation. We're going to lose a season and probably the
careers of 20 percent of our players. It's a terrible thing.'' No
professional sports league has ever lost a full season because of a
labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner also spoke openly about the future of the
league in the event of a canceled season, adding that he could
envision using replacement players.
</P>
<P>
   Stern had already said that he would recommend the season be
scrapped if the players did not accept the league's offer by
Thursday. So his dire comments and the committee's vote may be part
of a 11th-hour negotiating strategy intended to put pressure on the
union.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it worked, at least as far as persuading the players'
association to call for a general vote. More than 400 players have
been invited to New York to take part on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The player members of the NBPA negotiating committee
previously rejected the NBA's final proposal unanimously,'' Hunter
said in a prepared statement. ``The committee stands by that
determination and will continue to recommend against acceptance of
that proposal. To assure that the owners understand the level of
player resolve and the degree of opposition to the NBA's owners
demands, the negotiating committee will convene an all-players
meeting in New York on Wednesday, Jan. 6, at which time the general
membership will be asked to approve the negotiating committee's
recommendation to reject the NBA's final proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the union's members were convinced that Stern and
Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner, would recommend canceling the
season before negotiating with the union. Buck Williams, the former
union president, saw the management's action as a negotiating ploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still Monday,'' he said. ``I would caution that no one be
alarmed until the 7th at least. I'm sure Stern wants to apply as
much pressure as possible. David Stern is on banking on a player's
vote. My whole issue is that we shouldn't vote now.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, were
concerned about putting the owners' offer to a vote of the general
membership. The feeling was that the players would not be voting
for the deal but instead voting to salvage what's left of the
season and might therefore take any offer on the table.
</P>
<P>
   But with several players recently publicly requesting a vote of
the general body, Hunter and the negotiating committee decided to
gamble. If the players do not accept the deal, it sets the stage
for either a whirlwind last round of talks between the two sides or
it ensures that the NBA will become the first major sports league
to lose an entire season to labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate making a deal,'' Stern said. Reflecting on
the possibility of using replacement players in the 1999-2000
season, he said: ``It's not necessarily a pretty sight early on,
but obviously if we have to rebuild the league, we'll rebuild the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of bringing more than 400 players into New York
for Wednesday's meeting seemed daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to educate them about the pros and cons of the deal
and we will ask that they support the negotiating committee's
decision to reject the proposal,'' Ewing said. ``We'll see how the
guys vote and then take it to the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Monday night came after Ewing and Hunter had an
almost fruitless meeting with Granik and Stern. The union was
hoping its most recent concessions, including agreeing to an
absolute maximum salary limit for players with at least 10 years'
experience, would prompt the league to further negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   The main stumbling block could be how much revenue will be paid
to the players during the six-year deal. The sides also have
differences on the length and terms of a new rookie salary scale
and a number of other economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   In its proposal, the union asked that 55 percent of revenue
devoted to salaries in the fourth year, while the owners have
offered 53 percent. In the fifth year, players want 56 percent
while owners are offering 53.5. And in the final year, players want
57 percent _ the amount they received last season _ while the
league is offering 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to see a proposal that reached for ours,'' Stern
said. ``Instead I saw one that went backwards.'' Stern said, adding
that another full bargaining session ``doesn't seem likely at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is the deadline Stern set for reaching a new labor
agreement, and chances appeared small that a deal could be reached
in time to save even a 45- to 50-game season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always hope, but right now we don't have any meetings
scheduled,'' Granik said. ``Based upon how far apart we are,
there's a lot more needed to be done than simply tweaking the
offers.''
</P>
<P>
   More than three months of the season has been lost after the
owners locked the players out and about $500 million in player
salaries. Ewing alone has lost more than $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned and see on Thursday how close we are,'' Stern said.
``In order to see who's more accurate in his depiction of where we
are, we're going to have to lose a season.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing said: ``I don't think it's the interests of the owners to
blow the season up. I still believe we're going to have a season.''

NBA PLAYERS WILL VOTE ON OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA Monday had all but put an RIP banner on the 1998-99
season, rejecting the players' final proposal to end the lockout,
with the Thursday deadline looming. Shortly thereafter, however,
the Players Association announced plans for a full-scale,
rank-and-file vote Wednesday in New York on a proposal from the
owners that the union considers unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise announcement of the vote came from union head Billy
Hunter on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' He said those players who do
show up _ all 400-plus were invited, but he could not guarantee
their appearance _ will be given a full presentation of both
``final'' proposals and then be allowed to vote. When asked if the
players would back the union, Hunter said, ``I believe that's going
to occur,'' but he also said that if the players vote to accept the
owners' proposal _ which some players already have said is fair _
then he would go along with that decision as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I serve at their pleasure,'' Hunter said, adding that he would
not resign if the vote went against his recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter had repeatedly rejected calls for a rank-and-file vote,
saying that the players had authorized the 19-man executive
committee to decide whether an offer was worthy of acceptance. The
committee voted unanimously last week to reject the owners' final
offer.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say on ``Larry King Live'' why he had changed his
mind regarding a vote, but there is believed to be a substantial
number of players and agents who feel that the owners' terms are
not objectionable enough to sacrifice a season for. However, Hunter
said as many as 80-85 percent of the players support the union's
stance, a figure he based on a series of conference calls over the
past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hunter's appearance on CNN, he and Players' Association
president Patrick Ewing presented the union's final offer to
commissioner David Stern and deputy committee Russ Granik. They, in
turn, presented it to the league's nine-member Labor Relations
Committee, which, as expected, unanimously rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said it would make a similar recommendation
Thursday to the 29 owners, at which time they would be expected to
kill the season. Stern said the deadline was firm.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recommending that the players' offer be rejected,
Stern also said the owners will be given some thoughts about the
1999-2000 season, one which could be played with non-union players
if the union logjam is not broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a pretty sight,'' the commissioner said. ``If we have
to rebuild the league, we have to rebuild the league and share the
spirit of partnership that got us to where we are. At some point,
you have to give it your best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft class of 1998 has not yet signed on with the union and
there are more than 200 free agents as well. Stern said that the
1999 draft class would be considered in that group of players who
would hopefully form the new NBA. The commissioner said there would
be no use of replacement players to finish this season, however.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Granik also reiterated that the owners felt that
cancelling the season was preferable to playing under the
conditions spelled out in the union's last offer.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said talk of union decertification was ``of no
concern to us'' and that he had no plans to declare an impasse and
dictate terms of conditions. He also said players should be wary of
talk of a new league, which he said would skim 100 players, many
clients of the top agents, and then leave the other 315 looking for
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is so sad to me, it's almost unspeakable,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the sides are still wide and many, the
two men said. They are apart on what percentage should go to the
players, on how much the top players should be paid, on mechanisms
to get players even more money via salary cap exceptions, and on a
rookie wage scale. The union Monday offered to cap top earners at
salaries starting at $15 million, but also reportedly wanted
increases in that amount tied to revenue growth and raises in
excess of 10 percent.

FOR MINNESOTA, A RELUCTANT FIRST LADY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to correct hed)  (mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ There is, of course, the matter of the
silverware.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, frets the wife of the new governor of
Minnesota, ``if there is some queen and king of Sweden who come
here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you address these people? What fork or knife do I pick
up first?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a potential society page scandal, a first lady faux pas of
the first degree, and Terry Ventura knows it.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been part of the baggage as her husband, Jesse ``the
Body'' Ventura, the former professional wrestler, has become the
country's most unlikely political star. Ventura was sworn in as
Minnesota's 37th governor on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Ventura's inauguration, his wife was
busy trying to calm her butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I have just been treading water to make sure I
don't drown for the last two months,'' she said a few days before
the inauguration. To one television interviewer, she said: ``I'll
be the one tripping down the stairs in her formal gown.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that she does not appreciate the fact that her
husband, a man whose early career involved wearing a pink feather
boa and butting heads with Hulk Hogan, managed to upend the
stalwart Republican and Democratic candidates with his raucous
third-party insurgency. It is just that this extraordinary chapter
in her husband's celebrity forces her to become a celebrity, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, our victory turned into this giant Frankenstein
monster rampaging through the village,'' Ms. Ventura said from her
husband's transition office in the basement of the state Capitol.
``My phone is ringing off the hook. They have all these
expectations. They want me to give speeches. Well, the last time I
gave a speech I was at my sister's wedding. I was the maid of honor
and I said: `Congratulations. Have a great life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the down-to-earth Ms. Ventura, 43, who raises horses and
teaches riding on the couple's 32-acre ranch northwest of
Minneapolis, did not want her husband to run for governor at all.
She supported his decision, but largely stayed in the background
during his campaign. Her first reaction on election night was to
crawl into her mother's lap and cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid, a lot, of this loss of personal anonymity _ did
I say that word correctly?'' she said. ``I was afraid of the rabid
press thing, of where if you do make a mistake, my gosh, it's not
your mistake, it's the whole state's mistake. I was so enjoying our
little private life. Now the guys at the feed store want
inauguration party tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but those catty celebrity-watchers have started
to weigh in, even in mild-mannered Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone wrote into a gossip column and said why doesn't she
change her hair and she has too much hair,'' said Ms. Ventura, who
has decided to keep her dark tresses long and natural. ``My mom
said, `Well, do you like your hair?' and I said, `Yes, it keeps me
warm in the wintertime.'''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a farm family from Vernon Center, in the
southern part of the state, Terry Ventura has acknowledged that she
is not without social refinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not stupid,'' she told a Minnesota newspaper. ``I went to
Wendy Ward Charm School at Ward's when I was 13, excuse me. I know
how to walk, how to get in and out of a car without showing the
world everything.''
</P>
<P>
   With a good-natured laugh, she said in the interview from the
transition office that she briefly considered hiring first lady
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I thought to myself, that's not really why people
elected Jesse,'' she said. ``The first thing they always say is
that `You're always so real.' I'm afraid that if I did that my
husband and I might lose that appeal.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Terry Larson was a 19-year-old receptionist when she went to
ladies' night at a bar called the Rusty Nail and fell for the
bouncer, 23-year-old James George Janos. (He hadn't yet changed his
name by picking Ventura off a California map.)
</P>
<P>
   They married a year later and she went on the road with him
during his stint as wrestling's bad boy, a role that sometimes
riled up fans to the point where they would taunt Ms. Ventura and
pelt her with sno-cones. But most of the time, she said, ``I could
fade back into the shadows. That is no longer an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Ms. Ventura has had to put aside many of her
responsibilities on her Jester's Falling Tree Ranch as she prepares
for a role of throwing parties and charity fund-raisers. She will
also supervise a staff of eight at the governor's residence, even
though the first family plans to live there only part time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is being run on my dining room table,'' she said.
``I had to put an extra leaf in the table so that I could have a
typewriter and a phone and files. Every time I walk through that
room, the stress level goes right through my hairline.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ventura also plans to get involved in two policy issues:
farming, because of her background raising horses, and special
education, in part because the Venturas' 15-year-old daughter,
Jade, has a learning disability. The couple's 19-year-old son,
Tyrel, works at a hat store and has hopes of a career directing
films.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura suggested in a recent television interview that the
first lady earn a salary for her work, say $25,000. But Ms. Ventura
said that was his idea, not hers. She doesn't want to overplay the
importance of her role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not here to whisper in my husband's ear every night,''
she said. ``I'm certainly not going to be stomping up and down the
aisles of the Legislature saying you have to change this or that.''

SPORTS COLUMN: STERN PLAYS HIS UGLY ENDGAME
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Coming next season to an arena near you: 29
variations of the Vancouver Grizzlies. Choice club seats and luxury
suites on sale soon.
</P>
<P>
   That was the latest threat David Stern made to his nervous
players Monday night, and to nauseous fans. Professional basketball
with replacement players, the Charlie Ward Association. Or maybe he
just meant a union-less league whose replacement players are the
real players, just no longer under the leadership of Billy Hunter
and David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, Stern insisted, would junk the National Basketball
Association season Thursday and the value of their $150 million
investments unless the players came crawling back, on the
commissioner's non-negotiable terms.
</P>
<P>
   Vote, Stern again demanded, or starve.
</P>
<P>
   So the desperate players will vote on the owners' last proposal,
and a betting person would wager that they'll play. But there was a
better way to do this, a more compassionate way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players wanted to settle, that's clear, but Stern could
have let them do it with dignity,'' one person with ties to the
negotiations said Monday on condition of anonymity. ``How could a
man who is supposed to be so smart sit there and say, `no more
meetings,' and ever expect these players to feel anything but
contempt for him in the future?''
</P>
<P>
   Worse than bad business, this has become repulsive theater,
insensitive on many fronts, including one that is, at least
symbolically, racial. Stern moved this week from his pure-as-snow
vacation mountain to his Manhattan ivory tower but not off his
refusal to barter, even to the bitter end. In the endgame of the
most trying time of his 15-year run, he looked less like the cool
negotiator and more like a zealot fueled by thinly veiled rage,
what many of his opponents have claimed he is privately like.
</P>
<P>
   I have said all along that the union's threat to let the season
die rather than swallow a regressive deal was outrageous, but the
players did move significantly off their original positions, agreed
to what one former player agent called ``concessions that were once
unthinkable.'' Under the union givebacks, no longer would
21-year-olds or even 25-year-olds hold teams hostage. Stern argued
that he must have more, including stricter caps on salaries for
those in the league 10 years. Anyone who can't figure out what a
10-year veteran is worth is just plain dumb.
</P>
<P>
   From Stern's side, this became so bitter, so personal, payback
for the shadowy games of Falk and his imitators, for extracting
unrealistic sums for his clients without regard for their effect on
the league over all. But if Stern and the owners underestimated the
players' resolve, the union became too imbued with Falk's brazen
attitude that, in the end, he always wins. He always won the
individual contract wars, with Michael Jordan, with Patrick Ewing,
even with blanks in his gun like Kenny Anderson. But this
negotiation was different. It was collective, and carefully planned
by Stern, who took one look at the union negotiating team and was
blinded by the imagined face of Falk.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may run counter to the idea of Hunter, the union's
executive director, as some independent pilot championing a great
social cause, the reality is something closer to what Stern
believed. And it is laughable when those who may soon need a few
Knick quotes try to separate Ewing from Falk, as if the former is
earnest and the latter is evil. The inescapable truth is that Ewing
and others have been doing Falk's bidding for years.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for instance, back in 1990 a raucous union meeting
over a popular pension plan proposed by the president at the time,
Isiah Thomas. On the grounds that it meant less money for stars,
Falk opposed it. He stormed out of the meeting, Jordan and Ewing
right behind.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the very selection process for the job that
Hunter eventually got, at the 1996 All-Star Game in San Antonio
when Len Elmore, not Falk's candidate, began his 45-minute
interview with a short, prepared speech. When he finished and began
fielding questions, Ewing and Dikembe Mutombo, another Falk client,
walked out.
</P>
<P>
   The Falkanized union has sorely cost the players. Behind the
rhetoric, Hunter realized that he was left with no winning cards.
He already surrendered on issues that Falk told his clients they
would not have to. But now, half the season gone, Hunter
encountered a commissioner who wanted more than a score. He wanted
to slam dunk, and hang from the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than allow this to play out the right way, in marathon
talks, Stern wielded his leverage like a club, browbeating the
players with apocalyptic visions of the absurd. Chances are, he
won't be taken up on his bluff, which is what he deserves.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dennis Hastert, the speaker-designate, said
Monday that after a scandal-wracked year punctuated by the
impeachment of President Clinton his top priority is ``restoring
America's faith in this U.S. House of Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is clear,'' Hastert told reporters at the Capitol
before his first meeting with a new House Republican leadership
team. ``The American people want us to go to work. They want us to
produce good policy.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, a six-term Illinois Republican, was the consensus
choice of House Republicans to succeed Rep. Robert L. Livingston of
Louisiana, who abruptly stepped aside the day the House impeached
Clinton, after revelations about Livingston's own past marital
infidelities. Livingston was also the speaker-designate when he
removed himself from consideration and announced his intention to
resign from the House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans will meet on Tuesday to formally nominate
Hastert, a former high-school government teacher and wrestling
coach. The full House is to elect him on Wednesday, when the 106th
Congress meets for the first time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With political rancor seething in the Capitol, Hastert's
reputation as a conciliator will be sorely tested, especially since
the Republican majority has shrunk in the new House.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hastert expressed confidence that he could court
Democrats on important issues from Social Security reform to
national security. ``A smaller majority makes the dynamics change,
obviously,'' Hastert said. ``But I've always been a person who
believes that we need to work across the aisle.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the bruisingly partisan impeachment hearings and vote on
the House floor, however, Democrats appear to be in no mood to
accept any olive branches from Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, with the Senate moving ahead this week with Clinton's
impeachment trial, House Republican leaders are pushing ahead and
at least going through the motions of preparing a budget and other
legislative haggling that begins this time every year, as if
nothing were amiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see what's happening in the Senate as interfering with
what we're doing, setting up committees and all,'' said Rep. Tillie
Fowler of Florida, the fifth-ranking Republican in the House
hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore what he says is the urgency to get on with
ordinary business, Hastert has also tried to distance himself from
the confrontational, slash-and-burn tactics of Speaker Newt
Gingrich, whom he is to replace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Congress has to go to work,'' Hastert said. ``We have to
start to produce good things that the American people want: the
policies that address the needs of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   To help bridge the rift between moderates and conservatives
among his own rank-and-file, Hastert said he would grant wider
authority to Republican committee chairmen. Gingrich had
centralized power, leaving many chairmen grumbling about
micromanagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I have to do, I will be me, and I'm not going to try
to emulate Newt or anybody else,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before their three-hour meeting, which lawmakers said afterward
was largely devoted to ironing out details about the opening of
Congress and reviewing the rules that will govern the House,
Republican leaders touched on some of the legislative themes they
want to address in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list was working with the White House and
congressional Democrats to shore up the Social Security system, but
not at any expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want any tax increase in trying to strengthen Social
Security,'' said Rep.J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the incoming chairman
of the Republican conference.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also signaled their intention to make national
security an issue, especially at a time when rogue nations from
Iraq to North Korea are suspected of possessing, or seeking to
acquire, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and the
long-range missiles to fire them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have the Cold War threat of nuclear-tipped missiles
aimed at us,'' said Rep. Floyd D. Spence of South Carolina, the
chairman of the House National Security Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Spence added that a new danger facing the United States was ``a
proliferation of missiles throughout the world. Many countries have
them that didn't have them before.''

OLOWOKANDI HEADED FOR ITALY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Olowokandi's Bologna has a first name...
it's V-i-t-r-u-s.
</P>
<P>
   His Bologna's second name is K-i-n-d-e-r.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, Vitrus Kinder of Bologna, Italy _ the defending
champion of European League basketball _ has a contract with
Olowokandi's name on it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, NBA lockout notwithstanding, Olowokandi will have a lot of
bread in Bologna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great about this opportunity,'' said Olowokandi, a
7-foot Nigerian who demonstrated enough promise while playing for
the University of the Pacific to be selected by the Clippers with
the first pick in the last NBA draft. ``With the uncertainty of the
NBA season, I have to entertain all options.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the option he selected: earn a reported $1 million for
playing for Vitrus Kinder until Feb. 15; if the NBA season is
rescued, Olowokandi can return to the United States and play for
the Clippers. If the NBA season is flushed, Olowokandi will finish
the season in Italy and earn another $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to those familiar with basketball overseas, this is a
sweet deal, the most lucrative rookie gig in the history of Euro
hoops and the richest contract in Europe this season. Being
un-American makes Olowokandi more valuable than an American player
of equal ability; foreign leagues typically have limits on how many
Americans each team can sign. In Olowokandi, Vitrus Bologna picks
up an American-caliber player without having to sacrifice another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the playing opportunity and the compensation are
fantastic for me at this point,'' Olowokandi said at a news
conference in Washington, D.C. ``I expect this to be an excellent
experience for me in preparation for my NBA career.''
</P>
<P>
   But how excellent do the Clippers consider his adventure to be?
</P>
<P>
   If an NBA season is salvaged, the Clippers will have a rookie
center who at the very least is in game shape. Of course,
Olowokandi won't be around for any Cliff Notes version of an NBA
training camp. It would require additional time for their top pick
who has played basketball for a whopping four years to reach the
same page as his coach and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But in reaction to Olowokandi's new deal, the Clippers deferred
to the NBA's legal department. The team was unwilling to break the
league-imposed, $1 million cone of lockout silence, and the league
office prescribed the following response:
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment.''

A TOUGH DECEMBER MAY BENEFIT JETS IN PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, when Mo Lewis was a rookie, he was in a
playoff game wearing a New York Jets uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what was happening,'' says the Pro Bowl-bound
linebacker. ``I thought you're supposed to be in this every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, seven years later, he is back, and the only current Jet who
can make that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the players on the roster, the linebacker is the only
homegrown Jet with playoff experience. Over all, 19 players have
seen post-season action, but for 18 of them it was someplace else.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that the Jets, who go back to work Tuesday
for their first playoff game since 1991, are hardly a collection of
wide-eyed innocents when it comes to post-season action. On the
other hand, of the four American Conference teams still alive in
the post-season, the Jets are last in playoff-hardened players.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacksonville Jaguars, the Jets' opponents in a second-round
game Sunday at Giants Stadium, have 33 players who have been in the
post-season, 26 of them with Jacksonville. Miami has 36 post-season
players, 31 of them with the Dolphins, and Denver, the defending
Super Bowl champion, has 44, and all of them have been in the
playoffs with the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those other teams had as tough a December as the
Jets did. In fact, rarely does a team wind up its season as upbeat
and as tested. It wasn't merely the Jets' six-game winning streak,
or the fact they captured 10 of their last 11 games. Of equal
importance, was the fact that the Jets swept their three key
division opponents the last three weeks, including victories on the
road in Miami and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last four weeks were as close as you could get to the
playoffs, at home and away,'' said punter John Kidd, who went to a
AFC championship game with Buffalo back in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the coaching staff is so experienced and that carries
over to players,'' the 37-year-old Kidd added. ``Coaches have their
set ways of approaching the bye week and the playoffs. The young
guys here who haven't been in a playoff game have experienced
pressure the last few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   And the current Jets who have been in the playoffs with other
teams _ including half of the starters on offense and defense _
constitute an important core of veterans. Those with playoff
experience are team leaders, including quarterback Vinny
Testaverde, running back Curtis Martin and linebackers Bryan Cox
and Pepper Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have enough guys who have been in the tournament,''
said Jets Coach Bill Parcells. ``I've got 19 players _ that's about
35 percent of your team _ that kind of have an idea of what's going
on. And I don't have to tell a Keyshawn Johnson or Wayne Chrebet
too much about what's going on. The Buffalo and Miami games are
about as close as you're going to get to a playoff atmosphere. It's
been pretty rowdy in the last month, both home and away.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Parcells was increasingly upbeat about and impressed
with his team's performances as the season drew to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought opponents were going to have to play well,'' he
said. ``I'm more positive now that teams are going to have to play
well to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   The only defeat the Jets suffered over the last two-thirds of
the season was a last-second loss in Indianapolis to a weak Colts
team, and that surprising setback was probably instructional,
according to Parcells. `
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, the lesson was learned,'' he says of that game.
``Finally. You can learn those lessons long enough so they send you
home. I'm not worried about that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Parcells thinks his team will be ready to cope with
anything thanks to the challenge that December presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose the game,'' Parcells said, ``everyone will say,
`Well, they don't have playoff experience.' Well, that's a crock. I
know I'm going to feel good about our preparation for this game
because we'll have time. Winning those last four games makes a
believer out of me that we're going to try hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville went all the way to the AFC championship game two
years ago and should not have any difficulty dealing with playoff
pressure on Sunday. But what the Jaguars have not had to do lately
_ indeed, what they haven't had to do all season _ is play in a
bad-weather game. They have not even played up north since late
November.
</P>
<P>
   But Coach Tom Coughlin does have them accustomed to the road. In
their brief history, the Jaguars have played five playoff games,
four of them away from home. And they have managed to split those
four, winning and losing in Denver, winning in Buffalo, and losing
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin and Parcells both have an obvious toughness about them,
and the players who have prospered under them are for the most part
hardened performers. Nervousness is unlikely to play a part in this
game. Certainly not for the Jets, who, after all, were feeling
calculated pressure from Parcells from the moment they put on
T-shirts and shorts in training camp.

IRON EYES CODY, ACTOR IN ANTI-LITTER COMMERCIAL, 94
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iron Eyes Cody, the actor who played an Indian shedding a tear
at the sight of a littered American landscape in one of
television's best-known and most-honored television commercials,
died Monday at his home in Los Angeles, the police said. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Cody played the noble Indian in some 100 pictures, including
``Sitting Bull,'' ``Paleface'' and ``A Man Called Horse.''
Sometimes his roles were listed in the credits simply as ``Indian''
or ``Indian Chief.'' He also made guest appearances on television
programs like ``Bonanza,'' ``Gunsmoke'' and ``Rawhide.''
</P>
<P>
   But his most indelible appearance was in a commercial produced
by the former Marsteller agency on behalf of Keep America Beautiful
Inc. Introduced on Earth Day in 1971, the commercial showed Cody
shedding a single, eloquent tear at the sight of a landscape
befouled by garbage, litter, smoke and other pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Belen Escarano. Cody's caretaker, said Monday that the actor
originally resisted doing the commercial because, he said,
``Indians don't cry.'' But, Ms. Escarano said, Lady Bird Johnson
persuaded him to do the commercial. One version was made with the
tear, one without: the version with the tear went on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Escarano said the tear was, in fact, glycerine.
</P>
<P>
   A sequel to the commercial was produced in 1975 and a revamped
version of the original was introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cody had equally strong opinions about how native Americans
should be depicted in film, often correcting misperceptions about
Indian culture, behavior or history.
</P>
<P>
   Cody said he was born in Oklahoma to a father, Thomas Long
Plume, who was a Cherokee Indian, and a mother, Frances Salpet, who
was Cree. His father performed in Wild West shows and circuses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the television and movie-viewing public generally think
of Cody as an American Indian, his heritage was questioned in 1996
by The New Orleans Times-Picayune, which reported, based on an
interview with his half-sister and baptismal records and other
documentation, that Cody was a second-generation Italian-American
from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Cody denied that report.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Ms. Escarano said, Cody and his wife, Bertha
Parker Cody, hosted a television program explaining Indian history
and folklore. They also served as technical advisers on numerous
films, sometimes making Indian costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cody died in 1978, and one of the couple's sons, Arthur,
died three years ago. Cody is survived by another son, Robert Tree,
of Phoenix, Ariz., three grandchildren, and a niece.

HAROLD EDELMAN, 75, ARCHITECT AND PRESERVATIONIST
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harold Edelman, an architect and teacher who helped
to preserve some of New York's small treasures _ a park, an ornate
library and a quiet church _ died on Dec. 21 at the Beth Israel
Medical Center hospice in Manhattan. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   He died of cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman, the founding partner of the Greenwich Village
architecture firm that bears his name, designed buildings that were
not the lofty castles that shape the city's spiked skyline, but the
smaller buildings that fill the lower spaces, places where people
live, worship or rest when sick. His firm was the architect for the
Two Bridges urban renewal area on the Lower East Side, and designed
1,364 apartments between the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. He
also designed housing for the elderly on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan and health clinics in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But Edelman will probably be remembered for twice planning the
reconstruction of St. Mark's in the Bowery, one of the city's
oldest churches. In 1978, a nearly completed restoration project
was ravaged by fire. Colleagues said Edelman did all the design
work personally, finishing with plans for the series of stained
glass windows that frame the building's interior.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman was born in Brooklyn and received his architecture
degree from Cornell University in 1943. After serving in the Army
Signal Corps in World War II, Edelman spent a year studying in
Paris at Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts.
</P>
<P>
   He taught at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn from 1952 to 1962,
and in 1960, founded an architecture firm with his wife, Judith
Hochberg Edelman, and Stanley Salzman.
</P>
<P>
   While teaching at Pratt, Edelman learned of the impending
demolition of the Jefferson Market Courthouse, the turreted
red-brick hall in the center of Greenwich Village. He assigned his
architecture students to draft possible uses for the doomed
building. Two students suggested using it as a branch library, the
form in which it survives today.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman was one of nine architects assembled to redesign
Washington Square Park. The committee's design, drafted in response
to a city-proposed plan, maintained the crossing paths at the heart
of the park and rejected an attempt to turn half of the area into a
great lawn.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife of 51 years, Edelman is survived by a
sister, Edna Friedman of Bethesda, Md; a brother, Paul, of
Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; two sons, Marc, of Manhattan, and Joshua,
of Madrid, and four grandchildren.

NO SUSPENSE FOR BRETT, RYAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For most of the 28 former major leaguers on the
1999 Hall of Fame ballot, this morning's press conference in New
York will bring suspense and anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   For two of them, however, the announcement of this year's
inductees has been a foregone conclusion since they retired after
the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan and George Brett are among 11 players on the ballot
for the first time. The only question involving the two --
particularly Ryan -- is whether or not they will be voted in on
every ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The highest percentage of votes ever recorded on a first-time
ballot went to Tom Seaver, who received 98.8 percent (425 of 430)
of the votes from the members of the Baseball Writers' Association
of America in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the ballot for the first time include Robin Yount,
Carlton Fisk, Dale Murphy, George Bell, Mike Boddicker, John
Candelaria, Charlie Leibrandt, Frank Tanana and Mike Witt.
</P>
<P>
   While Yount and possibly Fisk stand a chance to be inducted on
their first try, it traditionally has been more difficult to be
voted in the first time around. Throughout the years, Joe DiMaggio,
Roy Campanella and Harmon Killebrew are among the candidates who
did not get elected on the first try.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's credentials during a 27-year career with the Mets,
Angels, Astros and Rangers are incredible and are comparable to
Seaver's.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who had a lifetime record of 324-292, holds 53 major
league records, including most seasons played and most seasons
pitched (27); most no-hitters (seven); most games having allowed
one hit or fewer (19); most strikeouts (5,714); most seasons of 300
or more strikeouts (six); most games with 15 or more strikeouts
(26); most strikeouts in a single season (383); and most
consecutive starts (595). The list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for any professional athlete, if they are fortunate
enough to (go into the Hall of Fame), it pretty much wraps up their
career, sums up their career,'' Ryan told the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed (with the Mets), I had no idea whether I had the
talent or the ability to make the big leagues. Then, I made it my
goal to qualify for the pension. I felt that (playing four years)
was hopefully a realistic goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who is a member of the Rangers' front office, spends most
of his time operating his Texas ranches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at my career is I was very fortunate, and I was
happy with it,'' he said. ``I don't think you have regrets. I would
have liked to have gotten into more postseason play, but a lot of
times you don't have control of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ryan is known for his strikeouts, he said he is most
proud of his durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really reflect (on my career), but I think I pretty
much get the most satisfaction out of being able to pitch as long
as I did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brett's credentials are impressive too.
</P>
<P>
   The El Segundo High graduate was a 13-time All Star, won batting
titles in three decades (1976, '80 and '90), led the AL in hits
three times (1975, '76 and '79), hit safely in 30 straight games
(1980), is fifth all-time in doubles, 13th in hits, at-bats and
total bases and is tied for 22nd in RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only player in major league history with 3,000 hits,
300 homers, 600 doubles, 100 triples and 200 steals.
</P>
<P>
   There are two players on the ballot for the 15th year, the
maximum number of years allowed on the ballot. It is the last
chance for election by the BBWAA for Mickey Lolich and Minnie
Minoso.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining players on the ballot include several who will be
close to getting the required 75 percent of the votes. Many expect
Yount to be elected in his first year of eligibility. Fisk and
Murphy also will receive strong consideration in this, their first
year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Others who could be close are Dwight Evans, Steve Garvey, Tony
Perez, Bruce Sutter, Tommy John and Jim Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining players on the ballot include Bert Blyleven, Bob
Boone, Gary Carter, Dave Concepcion, Ron Guidry, Keith Hernandez,
Jim Kaat, Dave Parker and Luis Tiant.

COMMENTARY: LATE PENSION? BUREAUCRACY JUST YAWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is a good-news story in the sense that
everything turns out all right. But it takes a while to get there,
way too long as far as Gail Bernstein is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernstein is a former public school teacher in New York
City. She put in for retirement late last June, 38 years after
first stepping inside an elementary school classroom in Brooklyn.
Altogether, she was on the job about 30 years, not counting time
when she worked outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Like many thousands of teachers before her, she figured it would
take the usual two or three months before the first pension check
landed in the mailbox. Even that seemed like a long time to Ms.
Bernstein, especially since she understood that teachers in the New
York state retirement system routinely received pensions after only
a month. But what are you going to do? Fight City Hall? These days,
you can hardly get into City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   So she waited at home in Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   When September passed without a dime in sight, she called the
city's Teachers' Retirement System. Not to worry, she was told. The
check will be in the mail by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Ms. Bernstein was badly feeling the pinch. No money
had come in for months. Her husband had died 10 years ago without
leaving any insurance. She had her regular expenses, plus she was
helping her daughter through graduate school. Her checking account
was drying up fast. ``I was at the point where I had to cash in my
two mutual funds,'' she said, ``and my credit cards were almost at
the max.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, she was told. The check would be in hand by Nov.
30.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Ms. Bernstein was on the phone to her union, the United
Federation of Teachers. Were people there helpful? ``Their reply
was: `Take out a loan. What are you worried about? When you get
your check, you'll be a rich lady.'''
</P>
<P>
   Back she went to the retirement system, which advised her to
forget about November. Now, she was ``targeted'' for Dec. 30,
though she was warned that not even that date was definite, but
then what in life is?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernstein, going broke, dared ask where in the bureaucratic
mill her paperwork lay. At the city's Office of the Actuary, said a
woman on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked for the phone number of the actuary, she said I
was forbidden to have it and I could not call them to check on the
progress of my check,'' Ms. Bernstein recalled. ``She remarked that
even she was not allowed to have this number. I was so upset I
asked to speak to a supervisor, who of course was too busy to speak
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the supervisor did call the next day, to say there was
nothing he could do. He, too, suggested she borrow money somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It's very frustrating,'' Ms. Bernstein said just before
Christmas. ``No matter where I call, they say, `Take out a loan.'
But will they pay the interest on that loan?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all polite,'' she said. ``But no one seemed to
really care. They didn't even say `Sorry,' just: `That's the way it
is. The money will come whenever it comes.' But this is my money
we're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Her long wait brought to mind the excruciating delays of three
and four years ago when thousands of public school teachers took
advantage of an incentive plan to retire early. They then twiddled
their thumbs for many months _ up to a year, in some cases _ until
pension checks arrived. ``We got beaten up big time,'' said
Jonathan Kimmel, counsel to the retirement system's board.
</P>
<P>
   The system is considerably more efficient these days, Kimmel
said. Still, ``isolated incidents'' like Ms. Bernstein's do occur,
he acknowledged. ``I won't say that it doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong in this case was not clear. ``I think my papers
fell through the cracks,'' Ms. Bernstein said. ``However, there are
a lot of people whose paperwork falls through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider this, then, a cautionary tale of what can happen when,
for whatever reason, the bureaucracy gods frown upon you. Not that
you ever had any doubts on that score.
</P>
<P>
   As for the promised good news, Ms. Bernstein's check finally
arrived on the last day of 1998: a six-month total worth
$21,415.51, plus $47.59 in interest. Pension payments should now
arrive problem-free for the rest of her life, although ``at this
rate,'' she said, ``they've shortened it a bit.''

SOURCES: FARRIS WILL CHOOSE NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA junior offensive tackle Kris Farris has
called a news conference for Wednesday morning and will announce
he's applying for the NFL draft, according to sources within the
football program.
</P>
<P>
   Farris, the Outland Trophy winner, is expected to be a late
first- or early second-round draft pick. He spoke with Bruins coach
Bob Toledo on Monday, but Toledo declined to comment on Farris'
decision.
</P>
<P>
   His departure leaves the Bruins with a major hole at left
tackle. One sophomore, Josh Webb, and three freshmen, Dave Wilford,
Blake Worley and Mike Saffer, are expected to contend for the
starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Yox all, folks: Strength and conditioning coach Kevin Yoxall, a
major component to UCLA's resurgence, has accepted a similar
position at Auburn and will depart this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yoxall said UCLA offered a better package, but the small-town
lifestyle appealed to his wife, Nancy, a native of Tyler, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo acknowledged Yoxall's impact but said the Bruins are
better equipped to handle his departure than they were a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've built the program up, and I think it'll be easier to
maintain it,'' Toledo said. ``To get to this point was pretty
tough, and it's been a big part of our success. But we're a lot
better off now than when (Yoxall) took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Borges update: Offensive coordinator Al Borges is not a
candidate for the coaching vacancy at Washington, according to
Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Toledo spoke to Huskies athletic director
Barbara Hedges, who was an administrator at USC in the mid-'70s
when Toledo was an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   After she gauged Toledo's interest in the job _ he has none _
they spoke about possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think... she's probably looking for a guy with head coaching
experience,'' Toledo said. ``That's not to say down the road that
Al wouldn't have a chance. But she called more to talk about
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't ask (permission) to talk to (Borges). He's not a
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The defensive shuffle: Toledo met with his assistant coaches
Monday and revamped the defensive assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will play a 4-3 defense next year (four linemen,
three linebackers) instead of the 3-4 they used this season. To
compensate, outside linebackers coach Bob Field will now coach the
defensive ends, and defensive line coach Terry Tumey will
concentrate on the tackles. Marc Dove will handle the linebackers,
and defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti will oversee the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the day: From Toledo, responding to criticism of the
Rose Bowl loss: ``It's not like we were embarrassed by a 6-5 team
or anything like that. We got beat by an excellent team from the
Big Ten that was a top-10 team.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster update: Linebacker Michael Wiley will have career-ending
back surgery and be placed on a medical scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins now have 21 scholarships available for recruiting.
They had 15 seniors this season and were one under the NCAA's
85-scholarship limit. Three scholarships became available when
Damian Allen (track), Zak Haselmo (transfer) and Jeff Wright
(transfer) departed. Add Wiley and Farris, and that makes 21.

 &HT;    Falcons' Whitfield is all business
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bob Whitfield kicked back the other day and put his
feet up while sitting in his Atlanta recording studio. As he waxed
philosophical on his dual careers as the Falcons' left tackle and
as an executive in the music business, it is clear that the two
jobs don't match.
</P>
<P>
   But little about the 6-foot-5, 318-pounder seems to make sense.
</P>
<P>
   The former All-American from Stanford has marched to a different
tune since before Atlanta made him the No. 8 choice of the first
round of the 1992 draft.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Whitfield was voted as a first alternate to the Pro
Bowl and has played a big role in helping running back Jamal
Anderson rush for a franchise-record 1,846 yards on an NFL-record
410 carries.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitfield, 27, never has been voted to the Pro Bowl, despite
talent widely considered sufficient enough to make it on a
consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Whitfield, an intelligent man with a quick if peculiar
wit, has an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be totally in tune, or I can be lackadaisical and out of
it,'' he said. ``I can shut down the best, or get beat by the
worst. Some (game) days, you just wake up sharper. You hear things,
and see things _ driving to the stadium, everything is just
sharper.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can wake up some days, and it's just like, 'I do not
want to do this. I'm ready to retire.' I'll be at the stadium, and
I feel like, 'I do not want to play this game; I hope that dude
across from me does not play hard.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Lester Archambeau was a senior at Stanford when
Whitfield arrived as a big and raw prospect out of Carson, Calif.
He doesn't understand his teammate any better now.
</P>
<P>
   ``What parts of Bob are normal?'' Archambeau wondered. ``He's a
big and talented guy . . . with a different sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield's role at his Patchwerk Recordings studio near the
Georgia Tech campus is more consistent and well defined.
</P>
<P>
   After starting the business five years ago, in part to help a
childhood friend who wanted to start making albums, he poured his
heart into the business, as much or more than he did football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to drive downtown after practice every day . . . stay
there 'til midnight and drive home and go to practice the next
day,'' he said. ``That was too much stress, too much anxiety. It's
like (defensive end) Chuck Smith said _ it wasn't paying my bills
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   So Whitfield stopped going in '96, except for Tuesdays, the
Falcons' off day.
</P>
<P>
   Business has improved, not so much because he's not around but
because the 3,500-square-foot studio with 48-track recording
capabilities has become a little better known. Some steady clients
over the last few years have been ``Usher,'' ``TLC,'' ``OutKast''
and ``ATLiens,'' all of whom have made recordings that have sold at
least 500,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Plaques on the purple walls stand as proof.
</P>
<P>
   His childhood friend, Curtis Daniel, runs the studio, and Norman
Kerr, a friend from Stanford, runs the music end of the business.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that 1998 will end up being the first year the
studio makes a profit, but even if it doesn't, Whitfield loves his
hobby.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, he got involved in some production work, but that
required patience. Bob Whitfield doesn't always have a lot of
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to be the producer. Hey, I played piano, drums and
trumpet,'' he said. ``It was more fatigue, more stress. I used to
sleep on the couch some nights. It was losing money, but I didn't
count it as a loss. I counted it as an experience. If it's
something you want to do . . . you can take setbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting the studio so his friend, rap artist Ras Kazz,
could get a jump start on his profession, Whitfield took it
seriously for a while. Upon realizing his skills were better suited
for football, he stepped back.
</P>
<P>
   The place still has his unique flair, however.
</P>
<P>
   The decor is generally purple and black. There is a red
billiards table. A soda machine offers the usual, plus Bud Light. A
candy and chips machine offers the usual, plus Phillie Blunt
cigars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a little something for everybody,'' he said, a big
grin creasing his face. ``It's fun to be here, but it's not my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Football is much of Whitfield's life, although the single father
spends a lot of time with daughter LaNiece, 8, and sons Kodi, 4,
and Kairo, 2.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield, who has played the game with more purpose than usual
this year, said part of the reason is because the team's success is
a motivating factor.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start playing football until ninth grade. I was too
big to play Pop Warner,'' he said. ``Sports were never big for me.
I was always a straight-A student.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started playing, I was weak as hell. I was a . . .
nerd. I'd just go to school, do my homework, run the streets a
little bit. I wasn't the athletic type. I was never honed to be a
football player. I would be bored if I was.''
</P>
<P>
   After a bad game, don't even think of asking Whitfield what went
wrong. He's likely to start rambling, saying that he forgets
things. Even teammates have a hard time talking seriously about
Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bob has always had the talent, but he's just getting
more recognition this year because of the offensive numbers we're
putting up,'' said Anderson, referring to an offense that scored a
franchise-record 442 points and finished No. 7 overall in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``His timing is incredible. He knows when to break the tension
with a joke or something. He's not a real talkative guy in the
huddle, but then again, when you just look at his face, you laugh.
He's the ugliest guy on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield is by no means alone in helping pave the way for
Anderson's big season, as a young offensive line that drew a lot of
criticism early in the year has matured faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
   But he's the anchor of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Now the questions are whether he can keep it going and for how
long.
</P>
<P>
   He has two years left on a four-year, $18.5 million contract
that included a $6.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play 10 more years if I can get it worked out where I
don't have to do no doubles (two-a-day practices) in training
camp,'' he said. ``They (stink), man. I don't need that (stuff).''
</P>
<P>
   There he goes again, marching to a different tune.

BACK-SCRATCHING MAYOR LINGERS IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York extended his weekend
political trip to Phoenix, staying until late Monday night to
burnish a mutually advantageous relationship with Sen. John McCain
of Arizona. The mayor is considering a run for the Senate, while
the senator is considering a run for the presidency _ and each man
could use the other's support.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani left New York Friday to speak at an annual gathering of
conservative Republicans in Arizona, but his aides said that he
decided to linger a little longer in the sunny, 68-degree weather
at the invitation of McCain. The senator confirmed that Giuliani
had been to his home for a reception over the weekend, along with
other prominent Republicans, and that he was bringing the mayor to
the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republicans have grown closer in recent months. The
mayor also helped the senator raise money at two events last year,
one in Arizona and one in New York City. But they did not spend
their time talking about how Giuliani might fare in the Senate,
McCain said. ``I find him an intriguing man and I enjoy his
company. I just think he's a helluva guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the sometimes volatile Giuliani would be suited
for the strained politeness of the Senate, McCain laughed. ``You're
probably asking the wrong guy,'' he said. ``I'm not known for my
mild-mannered, Clark Kent temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   That Giuliani and McCain are friendly _ and even went to a
football game together _ may amount to little more than
post-election political blather. McCain said it was ``premature''
to say whether there might be a place for Giuliani in a McCain
administration, and a high-ranking aide to Giuliani made clear that
their friendship did not constitute an implicit endorsement of the
senator for the presidency. The aide covered other bases by
emphasizing the good relationship that Giuliani also has with Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, another possible contender for the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But the interest of a prominent Republican in the mayor does
reflect Giuliani's national appeal. After attending the
inauguration of Gov. George E. Pataki in Albany on Friday, he and
several aides flew to the Phoenix assembly of conservatives and
other Republicans. The gathering was previously known as the Dark
Ages in mockery of President Clinton's annual Renaissance Weekend
in South Carolina, but organizers decided that ``Dark Ages'' might
not convey the proper political message. It is now called, simply,
the Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Giuliani impressed the crowd with his explanation
of how he had reduced crime and the welfare rolls in New York City.
Although he did not trumpet his socially moderate stands on
abortion and gay rights in front of his largely conservative
audience, he did venture the risky opinion that President Clinton
should not be ousted from office because of the Lewinsky affair. He
then spent his time hobnobbing with other stars in the Republican
firmament.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani continues to refine plans for his political future. On
Tuesday he is scheduled to announce that his chief of staff, Bruce
Teitelbaum, is leaving the administration to oversee his
fund-raising machine, which grinds away despite mayoral term
limits.
</P>
<P>
   According to several aides, Teitelbaum will be responsible for
Solutions America, Guiliani's federal political action committee.
Solutions America is supposed to be the vehicle by which the mayor
promotes himself and his policies on a statewide and national
scale, and would be central to any plan that he might have for
running for the Senate. John Gross, a friend of the mayor's and a
former federal prosecutor, will continue to serve as treasurer for
Solutions America and for two other campaign committees, Friends of
Giuliani and Giuliani for New York.

SUIT AGAINST UNION IS GIVEN CLASS-ACTION STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge has granted class-action status to a
lawsuit filed by a group of Brooklyn garment workers who accuse
their union of failing to fairly represent them in a dispute with
Liz Claiborne several years ago. But the ruling, released last
Wednesday, still leaves the workers facing an uphill fight.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in October 1997 against the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, known as Unite, by
union workers employed at Mademoiselle Knitwear, which manufactured
sweaters under the Claiborne label until Claiborne successfully
sued it for trademark infringement in a case decided early last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The workers have accused the union of selling them out in
earlier arbitration disputes with Liz Claiborne. Specifically, the
workers say the union agreed in the spring of 1997 to nullify an
earlier arbitration victory and drop a pending claim against
Claiborne in exchange for Claiborne's agreement to pay up to $20.5
million to the union.
</P>
<P>
   The union contends that the payment represented damages owed by
Claiborne under its union contract for use of nonunion
manufacturers over several years, and was unrelated to the
settlement of the arbitration disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mademoiselle factory in Brooklyn, once a union showcase
before it was caught in a web of angry litigation, sought
bankruptcy-court protection after Claiborne filed its
trademark-infringement case. It closed late last year, after the
death of its owner, Shraga Newhouse, last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rhine, who represents the workers, said that as many as
500 former Mademoiselle employees could be affected by the
class-action case against Unite, scheduled for trial in September
before U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But such cases are difficult to win, legal scholars say, and
this case has already sustained several legal setbacks. In August,
Baer dismissed all the workers' original complaints against Liz
Claiborne and all but two of their complaints against Unite,
saying, ``Obviously it will be difficult for the workers to
ultimately prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, an investigation of the union's actions, initiated
by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan in response to the
workers' complaints, was closed without any finding of unlawful
activity, according to documents filed with the U.S. bankruptcy
court. Similar complaints by Mademoiselle, filed with the National
Labor Relations Board, have also been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, JoAnne Mort, Unite's director of communications,
called Baer's decision last week ``a purely routine, procedural
ruling, which has no bearing on the merits of the case.'' She
added, ``In fact, the case has no merit, as indicated by the many
prior rulings in favor of Unite from Judge Baer, the National Labor
Relations Board and other impartial authorities.''

SUSPECTS IN MILLIONAIRE'S DISAPPEARANCE PROCLAIM INNOCENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Appearing confident and describing the case against
them as weak, Sante and Kenneth Kimes pleaded innocent at their
arraignment Monday on charges of murder, conspiracy and fraud in
the disappearance of Irene Silverman, a Manhattan millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   The mother and son, in their first court appearance since they
were indicted on murder charges last month, proclaimed their
innocence and demanded fair treatment in a hearing marked by the
theatrical atmosphere that has surrounded them since their arrest
in July.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors accuse the Kimeses of carrying out an elaborate
scheme to murder Ms. Silverman and steal the title to her East 65th
Street mansion last summer. Investigators have been unable to find
the missing woman's body, so, six months after her disappearance,
the case against the Kimeses is based entirely on circumstantial
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   At the arraignment in Manhattan, Mel Sachs, their attorney,
demanded access to Ms. Silverman's mansion, asked that the Kimeses
be released on bail and said outside court that the charges should
be dismissed. Judge Herbert Altman asked for written arguments from
Sachs by Jan. 28 and ordered the Kimeses held until then.
</P>
<P>
   During the court proceedings, the Kimeses' actions sometimes
drew as much attention as the legal arguments. The two were
whispering to each other and holding hands so often that Altman
ordered them to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses' show of unity may be strategic. Their lawyer has
complained that law enforcement officials have frequently planted
informers in the Kimeses' jail cells. If one were to cooperate with
officials or turn against the other, it could vastly increase
prosecutors' chances of winning a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In court on Monday, mother and son appeared confident and in
accord. When asked what her plea was, Mrs. Kimes, 64, began a long
statement: ``Yes, your honor, I plead not guilty and I pray to be
treated as equally as any other. . . .'' But Altman cut her off
abruptly and snapped, ``That will be enough!''
</P>
<P>
   Kimes also maintained a determined stance. When asked by the
judge whether he and his mother wished to have separate lawyers, he
responded, ``We would like to stay with Sachs, given the weakness
of the charges.''
</P>
<P>
   As they left the courtroom, Kimes, 23, smiled at a half-dozen
reporters and four sketch artists covering the hearing and said,
``Good morning, take care.'' Mrs. Kimes smiled and said, ``Good
morning, thank you, we're innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, a dozen television photographers and
other reporters swarmed around Sachs. A British television crew is
making a documentary and at least two writers said they were
working on books. Sachs was repeatedly asked why they had been
holding hands in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with it,'' he said. ``Perhaps it's
being forgotten that is a mother and child. It was nothing more
than a sign of the deep and abiding love that they have for one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses are also suspects in homicides in California and the
Bahamas. On the day Ms. Silverman disappeared, the Kimeses were
arrested in Manhattan on charges of using a bad check to buy a car
in Utah, but prosecutors have produced no witnesses or forensic
evidence linking them to her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says the Kimeses kept records outlining their
plan to steal the title to Ms. Silverman's mansion. If prosecutors
can present a convincing account of malfeasance by the Kimeses
leading to Ms. Silverman's disappearance, they may be able to win a
murder conviction, legal experts say. A murder conviction under
such circumstances is difficult, the experts warn, and the
prosecution could have to settle for a conviction on the lesser
fraud charges, they add.

`FAB 5': WOMEN ASSUME ARIZONA GOVERNORSHIP, OTHER TOP POSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HAL MATTERN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A group picture of the five women was splashed across
the pages of ``People'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Their faces were superimposed on the bodies of the Spice Girls
in ``George'' magazine. And they have been featured in national
newspapers and on network television.
</P>
<P>
   But they aren't entertainers. On Monday, they became the five
most powerful women in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull, Secretary of State Betsey Bayless, Attorney
General Janet Napolitano, Treasurer Carol Springer and
Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Graham Keegan _ dubbed
the ``Fab Five'' by the media _ officially took office during an
inaugural ceremony on the Arizona Capitol Mall in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   They were sworn in by a sixth Arizonan, U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who praised the ``independent and wise
voters'' who elected the women, earning the state another spot in
the history books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have varying responsibilities, we have different styles,
and we even may have some philosophical differences,'' Hull said
after she was administered the oath of office by O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we share a commitment to working together for the
betterment of the state of Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated crowd of more than 1,000 packed the mall for the
ceremony, and about 600 of them lined up afterward to shake hands
with the officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong ceremony marked the first time that any of the 50
states has exclusively installed women in its top five elected
posts. And there were several other firsts associated with the
ceremony:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hull is the first woman to be elected governor of Arizona. As
a legislator in the late 1980s, she also was the first woman
speaker of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ O'Connor is the first woman U.S. Supreme Court justice. She
also was the first woman to serve as majority leader in the Arizona
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Napolitano is Arizona's first woman attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   _ Springer is the first woman state treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano, the only Democrat in the group, said the female
leaders have the same concerns as male politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot was said in the last few weeks about the Fab Five . . .
and the underlying message was that somehow we were different than
our male counterparts,'' she said. ``But on the issues that concern
me and concern us, I think we are united.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull also sought to downplay the significance of the all-woman
leadership team, saying the national media were making too big a
deal about it. The women have been interviewed by several national
media outlets since the November election, including an appearance
Monday on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all ran good campaigns, we're all qualified, we've
all got experience,'' Hull said. ``It just happened to be that we
had five very well qualified women running. We don't think it's as
different as people seem to think all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But she acknowledged that the national attention is good for
Arizona, which has suffered through periods of bad publicity, most
recently following the 1997 bank fraud conviction of former Gov.
Fife Symington. Hull, who was secretary of state at the time,
automatically became governor upon Symington's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you are talking about Arizona, nothing is too much
attention,'' Hull said. ``Our national image is important.'' &QL;

PHOENIX AREA SCORES WIN OVER AIR POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX One pollutant down, two to go.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in metropolitan Phoenix are celebrating two straight
years of meeting federal clean-air standards for carbon monoxide,
the invisible but noxious compound that helped give the region a
national reputation for bad air.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishment means the Phoenix area has a good chance of
avoiding federal fines or severe restrictions on cars, trucks and
businesses due to carbon monoxide pollution.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``While we certainly can't become complacent in our ongoing
fight for cleaner air, this is a tremendous achievement,'' Tempe
Mayor Neil Giuliano said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   But the news isn't as good when it comes to ozone, a summertime
pollutant, or particulates, the tiny bits of soot, grime and
exhaust that lodge in people's lungs and give the region's brown
cloud its distinctive coloring.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a landfill fire, particulates reached unhealthful
levels in southwest Phoenix last week, where they exceeded federal
clean-air standards. Throughout the Phoenix area, motor vehicles
are the main source of particulates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``We have had substantial, substantial success with our
invisible pollutants,'' observed Dave Feuerherd, program director
for the American Lung Association in Arizona. ``We've done
virtually nothing with our visible pollutants.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Phoenix area residents say their lungs continue to suffer
because of the lack of action. Christy Krejci of Scottsdale blamed
bad air last week when she began to have trouble breathing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``I just felt atrocious,'' she said. ``When I went to bed the
night before, I felt like I was suffocating.''
</P>
<P>
   So she packed her two young children in the car and drove north
to New River to fill her lungs with clean air. The Lung Association
told her that particulate pollution, not carbon monoxide, probably
caused her breathing problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area also faces potential problems with ozone.
Although the pollutant remained below federal pollution standards
for the last two summers, authorities worry that the levels could
rise again if the Phoenix area experiences stagnant air and
especially high summertime temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Feuerherd and other authorities say the state needs to do much
more to reduce particulate pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel trucks should be required to use a cleaner-burning fuel,
something that California has done for some time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other steps, ranging from street cleaners that
vacuum, rather than sweep, debris, to boosting requirements for
alternatively fueled vehicles, Feuerherd said.
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't likely to be dealt with in the legislative session,
which begins next week. Instead, lawmakers are expected to focus on
ways to improve the state's vehicle-emissions program, said state
Sen. Marc Spitzer, R-north Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer credited technology for helping the Phoenix area reach
its clean-air milestone with carbon monoxide, and it may work for
the other two pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question technology is a great ally,'' Spitzer
said. Such advances as the catalytic converter, cleaner-burning
fuels, and vapor-recovery hoses at gas stations have helped to
reduce carbon-monoxide levels.
</P>
<P>
   The automotive industry, responding to federal mandates, has
been building ever-cleaner cars. And the state's vehicle-emissions
program has pinpointed the bigger polluters.
</P>
<P>
   By going two calendar years without a carbon-monoxide violation,
Phoenix area officials have strengthened their case to have the
federal Enviromental Protection Agency classify the area as meeting
clean-air standards. Currently, its air quality is rated
``serious.'' The last violation was recorded in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The reclassification would mean that the EPA no longer could
threaten sanctions, including withholding federal freeway dollars,
for failing to meet clean-air goals.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect on daily life would be almost undetectable. The
emissions test would remain, as would the myriad of other measures
passed in the last decade to curb carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures would be needed to keep air quality at acceptable
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Krejci thinks reclassification would be a bad move. A resident
of north Scottsdale, she said economic penalties may be the only
way to slow galloping growth.
</P>
<P>
   Growth will continue to be a challenge, air-quality officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Maricopa County environmental officials were warning residents
to watch for carbon monoxide buildups this week. They looked
nervously to the traffic from the commuters going back to work
after the holidays, with Fiesta Bowl traffic layered on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, county officials are thinking of creating
public-health advisories for particulate pollution, similar to the
advisories issued for carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Al Brown, director of the Maricopa County Environmental Services
Department, said the advisories would be helpful in April and
during the summer monsoon, when high winds stir up particulates.

   Brown said he believes the advisories make people think twice
about how their activities contribute to air pollution. A recent
survey found that 90 percent of those polled were aware of
advisories, and that 60 percent said they did something to curb
polluting emissions. &QL;

   PHOENIX - Five capable, intelligent women were sworn in as
Arizona's top office holders Monday, ruining the day, and possibly
the next four years, for me and every other newspaper guy between
the Grand Canyon and the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   It's not polite to say, but it's true. I only bring it up it
because, sometimes, ``a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.''
</P>
<P>
   And, under the newly installed Gov. Jane Hull, Secretary of
State Betsey Bayless, Attorney General Janet Napolitano, Treasurer
Carol Springer and Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Graham
Keegan, what a man's gotta do is throw out his favorite cliches.
</P>
<P>
   They no longer apply.
</P>
<P>
   As Gov. Hull made her acceptance remarks in the Capitol,
speaking of her love for the state and her desire to put an end to
negative campaigning, it occurred to me that no matter what this
governor or her female cohorts say, you'll never see it described
as emanating ``from mouths of babes.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmless catch phrases are now slaps in the face.
</P>
<P>
   New guidelines are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for us guys, no one has stepped forward to ``take
the bull by the horns.'' And for good reason. There are no bulls
left in office. And the word used for female members of the cattle
family is construed as insulting.
</P>
<P>
   Cliche-wise, we're ``on the horns of a dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ``back to the drawing board.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for the foreseeable future, I suggest ``it's better
to be safe than sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, when referring to any of Arizona top five office
holders, the phrase ``woman of the house'' may be acceptable when
speaking of the State House. But saying ``a woman's work is never
done'' is off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, an enterprising guy could whip up a batch of a bumper
stickers saying, ``Arizona _ where chicks rule!'' But he better not
say it out loud.
</P>
<P>
   And if ``chicks'' is unacceptable, what about birds?
</P>
<P>
   Do these five ``birds of a feather flock together?'' And could
they ever ``count their eggs before they're hatched?''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   In the proper context, a writer still could say that ``sauce for
the goose is sauce for the gander.'' But the governor, secretary fo
state, attorney general, treasure or school superintendent could
never, (begin ital) ever (end ital) be called ``the goose that laid
the golden egg?''
</P>
<P>
   I know. It's confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Are there no more ``girl Fridays'' in Arizona? Or are there
(begin ital) only (end ital) ``girl Fridays?''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the fact it's no longer possible for Arizona bigwigs
to forge a ``gentleman's agreement'' should improve state politics.
</P>
<P>
   And, it's nice to live in the one state in America where it's
extremely unlikely our top elected officials ever will be ``caught
with their pants down.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even at her own inauguration party, it would be
disrespectful to call Gov. Hull the ``belle of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as, no matter who firm she governs, it would be rude to say
she ``rules the roost.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Brother is no longer watching, fellas. He and his buddies
got swept in November.
</P>
<P>
   There is no ``old boy network'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The new governor, who's bounced from one political job to
another, is a (begin ital) Jane (end ital) of all trades. And there
are four others lined up behind her.
</P>
<P>
   This has never happened before. Not in Arizona. Not anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to say ``it'll all come out in the wash,'' but that's
like saying we got women doing the state's dirty laundry. (Which is
true but impolitic.)Besides, no one knows if these five females
will get along. (Again, I wouldn't say it's because ``too many
cooks spoil the broth.'')
</P>
<P>
   These are trying times for those of us who carry the politically
incorrect a Y chromosome. I'm not sure how it will end up, with
five women in high political office. I do know, however, that
``it's not over 'til. . .'' No. Don't even go there. &QL;

IMPERIAL CHEMICAL'S SALE OF UNIT COLLAPSES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ Imperial Chemical Industries acknowledged Monday that a
$1 billion deal to sell its white pigment business to the DuPont
Co. and NL Industries had collapsed, renewing analysts' concerns
about the British company's ability to reduce a mountain of debt.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont and NL Industries pulled out of the deal because of
undisclosed conditions set by the American Federal Trade
Commission. Under the deal, DuPont, of Wilmington, Del., would have
acquired the operations of Imperial's Tioxide unit outside North
America while NL, based in Houston, would have taken those in North
America. Tioxide makes titanium dioxide, a powdery white pigment
used in paints and plastics.
</P>
<P>
   The sales were part of a drive by Imperial, the third-largest
chemicals producer in Europe, to move away from bulk chemicals. Sir
Ronald Hempel, the company's chairman, said the ``transition
strategy remains unchanged, although we are disappointed that we
have not been able to complete these transactions.'' The end of the
deal was first reported in The Wall Street Journal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts viewed the sales as crucial to reducing debt, estimated
late last year at 4.4 billion pounds, or $7.3 billion. Much of the
debt is related to Imperial's $8 billion takeover of Unilever's
specialty-chemicals division in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the collapse of the deal, Imperial also announced
plans Monday to take a charge of 120 million pounds, or $199
million, and eliminate 1,000 jobs in its decorative paints,
industrial specialty and other specialty chemicals businesses _
measures intended to save $115 million annually within two years.
But the moves left the stock markets unimpressed, confirming
Imperial's status as Britain's poorest-performing blue-chip company
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Imperial dropped as much as 9 percent, falling to
(PS)4.72, before recovering to 4.94 pounds, compared with a high of
12.44 pounds last May. In New York, shares of DuPont rose $2.1875,
to $55.25. NL closed up 25 cents, at $14.4375.
</P>
<P>
   The deal's collapse was ``quite a major blow,'' said Jeremy
Chantry, an analyst with Credit Lyonnais Securities, reiterating
that analysts had been expecting a sharp reduction in debt from the
sale of assets.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in three months that regulators dealt a
setback to Imperial's plans. In October, a $455 million deal for
the sale of its Crosfield division to W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. also fell
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, the British chemicals concern said in a
statement that it expected its profit before tax and charges for
1998 to exceed (PS)315 million _ now $522.9 _ and that its net debt
had fallen by an unspecified amount since late last year. The
profit forecast, well down from the 1997 figure of (PS)385 million,
or $632 million, was roughly in line with analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Alan Spall, Imperial's chief executive, told reporters
that the collapse of the deal would not hurt profit because the
Tioxide business _ one of the world's biggest producers of titanium
dioxide _ was making money. He said one possibility was to spin off
the business as a separate company, but he did not rule out other
offers. Some industry analysts said, however, that the depressed
state of the world chemical market could make it difficult to find
other buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early days as we take stock of the situation,''
Spall said. ``The industry will continue to consolidate, and we
have a lead position in Europe, which is very valuable. We have no
doubt that our phones will be ringing.''

12 RESOLUTIONS  FOR 1999 THAT  WILL MAKE YOU  HAPPY IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If everybody followed through on New Year's
resolutions, we'd all be trim, rich and constantly pushing the
envelope of self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many Americans are growing paunchier and say their
lives are dull, while bankruptcy filings indicate that a growing
number of consumers are facing serious money difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the problem with resolutions is that we try to achieve too
many things at once, then become discouraged when success isn't
immediate. With that in mind, here are 12 financial resolutions
that can be spread over the year _ sort of like a book-of-the-month
club centered on saving, spending and investing rather than
reading.
</P>
<P>
   The following tips won't shrink your waistline or make you a
more interesting person, but they can help you gain control of your
finances:
</P>
<P>
   January: Get your credit-card debt under control.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday spending frenzy is over, so it's time to reign in
expenditures and cut borrowing costs. Pay off high-interest
balances first, put your credit cards out of sight and switch your
debts to credit cards with lower interest rates. The average rate
is 18.75 percent, but you can do better.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Credit Counseling Services Southwest of Phoenix
suggests that you create a realistic budget and that you write down
your goals and post them in a prominent place. Also, tell friends
and co-workers about your goals, because a public declaration may
make you more committed.
</P>
<P>
   The number of personal bankruptcies in Arizona soared 25 percent
to nearly 24,700 in 1997, and another big increase is anticipated
for 1998. Simple overspending rather than, say, a medical emergency
was the reason cited by 58 percent of people who sought help from
the counseling service.
</P>
<P>
   February: Organize your financial records.
</P>
<P>
   This will not only help you prepare your tax return but may be
essential if illness requires that you turn your financial affairs
over to someone else. Make a list of important documents _ account
statements, insurance policies, paycheck stubs, loan contracts and
more _ and specify where these records can be found. Put your most
critical documents in a safe-deposit box or home safe, and make
copies for everyday reference.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank is among the many financial firms that offer tips on
keeping records. Call 800-669-2635 for its free booklet ``Getting
Financially Organized _ Money Minder Worksheets.'' The booklet also
makes it easy to track prescriptions and medical records.
</P>
<P>
   March: Quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just a good health tip but a sound financial
management tool. That's because non-smokers pay much less in
life-insurance premiums than do nicotine-addicted people.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a 40-year-old, non-smoking man can buy a 30-year
term-life policy with a $500,000 death benefit for $700 in yearly
premiums, reports Chicago-based MasterQuote of America
(800-337-LIFE), an insurance-shopping service. A male smoker of the
same age would face annual premiums of $2,130 for the same
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   April: Open a Roth individual retirement account.
</P>
<P>
   These IRAs celebrated their first birthday Friday, and they're
still one of the hottest things around in retirement planning.
</P>
<P>
   Although you can't deduct the money you place in a Roth, as with
traditional IRAs, you get better tax treatment when you withdraw
the cash. Assuming you keep the money in place for at least five
years and past age 59{, you don't face any taxes on investment
interest or earnings. Withdrawals from traditional deductible IRAs
trigger ordinary income taxes. Plus, principal pulled from a Roth
can be tapped at any time, tax free.
</P>
<P>
   Roth investors are limited to a $2,000 yearly contribution, but
you still have until April 15 to invest for 1998 taxes. You can put
aside a full $2,000 each year if your income is below $95,000
(singles) or $150,000 (married couples).
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Young, a vice president at WestAmerica Investment Group in
Scottsdale, can't figure out why every eligible person didn't open
a Roth in 1998. ``Most serious investors have $2,000 lying around,
and the Roth's a great deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   May: Establish automatic deposit and bill-paying procedures _
before you go on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   You can save gasoline and time by not running to the bank each
time you receive a paycheck. You can save postage and time by
electing to pay routine monthly bills automatically. Usually, all
you need to do is fill out a one-page form.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 97 percent of people who use direct deposit said they
are extremely satisfied with it, according to a May survey by the
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis that had a margin of error of
plus or minus 5 percentage points. Yet only about one-third of
employers offer direct deposit, reports the Direct Deposit
Coalition in St. Louis. If your company lacks this convenient and
safe means of transferring paychecks, ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   June: Join an investment club.
</P>
<P>
   These groups can be a great way to learn about the stock market
and meet new friends. Club members meet once a month to discuss
stocks for purchase and review holdings. Many also recruit guest
speakers such as executives of Arizona-based companies. Most clubs
require investment commitments of just $25 to $35 a month, so as
not to break your budget.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Investors Corp. is the main umbrella
group for investment clubs.
</P>
<P>
   July: Rebalance your investment holdings.
</P>
<P>
   It's counterproductive to tamper with your portfolio too often,
especially if you incur transaction costs or trigger taxes in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   But rebalancing your mix every half-year or so can provide a
good way to skim some profits from hot investments while adding to
laggards. ``It forces you to sell high and buy low,'' said Donna
Brotherton, a financial adviser at the Advisors Group in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Rebalancing makes more sense if you're using mutual funds rather
than individual stocks or bonds because it's easier to buy and sell
small-dollar amounts, including fractional shares. Almost all fund
families allow free switching over the phone or Internet.
</P>
<P>
   August: Resolve to earn at least 4 percent on your cash
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   There's usually no good reason to routinely tie up thousands of
dollars in a checking or savings account paying perhaps 2 percent
interest or less. You can double your return by transferring most
of the cash into a bank certificate of deposit or money-market
mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   The latter are yielding more than 4.5 percent on average these
days, about one-third of a percentage point more than six-month
CDs, reports IBC Financial Data in Ashland, Mass. Money-market
funds come with check-writing privileges that give you instant
access to your cash. While not guaranteed by federal deposit
insurance, these mutual funds are extremely secure.
</P>
<P>
   September: Teach your kids about money and investing.
</P>
<P>
   A recent University of Michigan study found a pretty strong link
on intergenerational investment behavior _ young adults were more
likely to own stocks and have bank savings accounts if their
parents did.
</P>
<P>
   Consider giving your kids investing experience by setting up a
gift account in their names and filling it with stocks or mutual
funds. One suggestion: the Stein Roe Young Investor Fund
(800-338-2550).
</P>
<P>
   Young also suggests tax-sheltered education IRAs. But because
investments here are limited to $500 a year, he thinks these
accounts are best for preschool kids. ``Even if you can put away
only $500 a year, you'll have some serious money for a child after
maybe 15 or more years to invest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   October: Put more money into the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good tip for any month of the year, reflecting the
market's tendency to rise over time _ by about 11 percent a year on
average. But September and October traditionally are the two
weakest months of the year, which may make them a good time for
bargain hunting.
</P>
<P>
   November: Check your estate plan.
</P>
<P>
   If you recently got married, divorced, lost a family member, had
a baby, moved to another state or purchased real estate, it may be
time to make sure your will or living trust still reflects your
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Also, make sure you have correctly titled accounts such as IRAs
that fall outside your will or trust. For real estate and non-IRA
investment accounts, consider ``community property with right of
survivorship,'' a titling that offers married couples tax benefits
while keeping property out of probate.
</P>
<P>
   December: Plan your taxes.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, this is the last month for taking action
that can shave your 1999 taxes. Strategies range from deferring
income into next year (if you have that option) to accelerating
deductible expenses by incurring these costs in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As for investments, consider selling laggard stocks or mutual
funds to lock in losses that offset up to $3,000 in yearly income,
and beware of buying mutual funds before they make a year-ending
distribution of capital gains. ``Buying the distribution'' in this
manner would subject you to taxes on profits realized earlier in
the year, even though you didn't share in the gains. &QL;

BETTERAIR-PHOENIX (Phoenix) - Despite some bad-air warnings and a
burning landfill fire, the Valley finished 1998 with a clean record

Valley air quality officials when they ask the EPA to drop the
``serious'' label on local air quality and deem it in compliance
with federal health standards. That move is a year or two and

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States is ready to let more people and
more money flow to Cuba, senior U.S. officials said Monday, while
rejecting a fundamental review of U.S. policy toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The moves would let Cuban citizens receive millions more dollars
from American friends and family members, allow them to buy more
U.S. food and medicine, permit more direct flights between the two
countries, renew direct mail service from the United States and let
the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national baseball team play
ball in March, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright formally recommended
the steps to President Clinton Monday, and the White House is
expected to announce them on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official, speaking in Ms. Albright's
seventh-floor State Department offices, said that the measures
``are intended to strengthen support for the Cuban people,'' to
allow them ``some elbow room'' and ``some modicum of
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said the moves are intended to increase
educational, religious and humanitarian contacts with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reforms in U.S. policy toward Cuba were reviewed three years
ago, but were halted when Cuba shot down Cuban-U.S. pilots for an
anti-Castro group. The proposals moved forward after Pope John Paul
II visited Cuba a year ago. ``The pope's visit created a wedge''
through which political light and air can stream into Cuba, a
senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor was the death last year of Jorge Mas Canosa,
leader of the Cuban American National Foundation and the most vocal
and influential anti-Castro Cuban-American political figure in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The nature and the timing of the announcement also arose in part
from a report just completed by the Council on Foreign Relations,
published under the signature of two former senior State Department
officials. The report proposed essentially similar steps, and some
bolder ones, like granting some U.S. businesses licenses to operate
in Cuba and promoting Cuban-U.S. military ties.
</P>
<P>
   The council's report said it was intended to ``break the current
logjam'' in American policy toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the U.S. embargo against Cuba, imposed 37
years ago, would remain in effect. So would additional restrictions
added after the pilots were shot down.
</P>
<P>
   But individually, some of the changes would be incremental
expansions of existing policies on private relief aid to Cuban
citizens. But taken together they represent a consensus among top
officials that, since the 40-year-old reign of Fidel Castro is
likely to end soon, the United States must ``promote a peaceful
democratic transition'' by injecting U.S. money, culture and ideas
into the isolated island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing what we can to expand the space'' in which Cuban
citizens can breathe more freely, the administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The measures endorsed by Ms. Albright can be undertaken by
presidential order, without congressional approval. But Sen. John
Warner, a R-Va., said he was ``concerned that these efforts fall
way short'' of what could have been accomplished by a national
commission that he had proposed to review and revise U.S. policy
toward Cuba. Ms. Albright recommended that no such commission be
formed, saying it could never resolve the question of the economic
embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lost opportunity for America to review a policy of
basic isolationism,'' Warner said Monday night. ``We allow food and
medicine to get into North Korea. We allow food and medicine to get
into Iraq. And we still deny this tiny country basic things.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the news in Miami, the Cuban American National
Foundation, a conservative exile group, issued a statement on
Monday saying that most of the measures to be announced are
consistent with current policy and praised the administration for
refusing to re-evaluate U.S. policy toward Cuba.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most important proposal is to increase the flow of U.S.
dollars to Cuba, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Such remittances are currently limited to $1,200 a year from a
Cuban-American family to relatives in Cuba. The amount could
increase sharply under the plan proposed by Ms. Albright: any U.S.
citizen could send $1,200 a year to anyone in Cuba except to senior
Communist officials. Religious groups, human rights groups and
other organizations may be able to send larger sums to sister
organizations under proposals still in the works, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The most politically appealing of the proposals was for holding
two exhibition games between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban
national team. Baseball is immensely popular in Cuba, a wellspring
of baseball talent despite its poverty.
</P>
<P>
   However, a baseball official said Monday night that fears of
angering anti-Castro Cuban-Americans could delay or scuttle this
week's planned trip to Havana by members of the Orioles
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles have been privately discussing such an exhibition
with U.S. officials since 1995. Their owner, Peter Angelos, is a
major financial contributor to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But in February 1996, the Cuban Air Force shot down two unarmed
civilian aircraft flown by Cuban exiles testing Castro's will.
Clinton almost immediately signed legislation to tighten the U.S.
embargo and strengthen trade restrictions against Cuba. The moves,
which pleased anti-Castro Cuban voters in Florida and New Jersey,
froze attempts aimed at thawing American-Cuban relations, including
the idea of a baseball game being played by a U.S. team in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles organization received Washington's permission for a
trip to Havana later this week to discuss how to schedule a game.
If games could be set up so that the Cuban government receives
little financial benefit from them, and that profits go to
authorized charities benefiting Cuban citizens, government
officials would grant the team the license to play ball _ once in
Havana, once in Baltimore, during the exhibition season in March.
</P>
<P>
   At least one staunchly anti-Castro senator, Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., said on Monday that he found the new steps unobjectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing here morally offends me,'' he said. ``Our ultimate
weapon against Fidel Castro is the flood of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the administration's idea of sending U.S. food
to independent restaurants and independent farmers in Cuba was
naive, since few such institutions exist and those that survive are
tiny.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, a Yankees fan, jokingly warned that ``having the
Orioles going to Havana may be good foreign policy, but it's bad
baseball strategy.'' Baltimore finished fourth in the American
League's east division with a 79-83 record last year.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the forthcoming report from the
Council on Foreign Relations helped to shape their new proposals,
in part because it has received support in conservative circles,
leading them to believe that the steps put forth by Ms. Albright to
the president on Monday would be seen as politically bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, one of the two principal authors of the Report,
Bernard W. Aronson, a former assistant secretary of state, said:
``American policy has succeeded in containing the spread of Cuban
Communism. That battle is over. We can move to a new stage in our
policy. We should, because within the shell of Communist society in
Cuba there is a fragile civil society clawing its way to the
surface.''

NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL RESTORES JOB PROTECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Reversing his predecessor's policy, Eliot
Spitzer, New York's new attorney general, announced Monday that he
would restore job protections for homosexuals at the state Law
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The decision means that homosexuals will once again be included
on the list of groups in the attorney general's office that are
explicitly protected against discrimination in employment, hiring
and access to services. The office employs 1,800 people.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's action marks a break with his Republican predecessor,
Dennis Vacco, who rescinded the 15-year-old anti-discrimination
policy in 1995, just a few weeks after taking office. At the time,
Vacco said he was not motivated by any hostility toward homosexuals
or a desire to exclude them from employment opportunities. Rather,
he said, the action was intended simply to bring the department's
workplace policy in line with the state's human rights law, which
covers age, color, creed, disability, marital status, national
origin, race and sex, but not sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's decision stirred deep anger among gay political leaders
and their supporters. They said it sent a message that his office
did not view anti-gay bias as a serious problem, even though one of
its main responsibilities is to enforce civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's motives were also sharply questioned by gay and lesbian
leaders because he had refused to condemn his political supporters
during the 1994 election for attacking his Democratic opponent,
Karen Burstein, as ill suited for office because she is a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, whose victory in 1994 made him New York's first
Republican attorney general in nearly two decades, was defeated in
November by Spitzer, a Democrat, in one of the most tightly
contested races of the political season.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's decision to restore the job discrimination ban was
greeted with expressions of gratitude and relief from gay and
lesbian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was clear hostility toward lesbian and gay people under
the Vacco administration,'' said Matt Foreman, executive director
of Empire State Pride Agenda, a lobbying group. ``We hope that
Spitzer's decision will reverse what happened under Vacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuals in the Law Department first won job protection in
March 1980 under an executive order signed by Robert Abrams, who
was then the attorney general. His successor, G. Oliver Koppell,
renewed the order in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's action was one of two executive orders that Spitzer
issued Monday, his first official day in office. In the other
order, he banned employees from making financial contributions to
any campaign committee he establishes.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Spitzer repeatedly criticized Vacco's
hiring practices, saying he had fired scores of experienced lawyers
and replaced them with younger, inexperienced lawyers who had ties
to powerful members of the Republican and Conservative parties.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's first day in office was not all serious business. Not
long after his aides began sending out faxes to the media Monday
morning, they learned that they were arriving at the other end with
the tag line: ``$8 Million Man.'' Spitzer's aides suspected it was
a prank by someone in the previous administration, a reference to
the total amount of money that Spitzer, a wealthy Manhattan lawyer,
spent in an unsuccessful race in 1994 and in his recent successful
campaign for attorney general.

 &HT;    Atlanta plans to sue gun makers
 &HT;    By Carlos Campos
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The city of Atlanta will sue gun makers this year, in
an attempt to hold them accountable for the havoc and expense
created by shooting injuries and deaths, Mayor Bill Campbell said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If the city moves forward with such a lawsuit, it would join a
growing nationwide trend akin to the lawsuits against the tobacco
industries that reaped millions in court settlements for state
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's the same issue,'' Campbell said. ``Just as the
tobacco companies were held responsible for the carnage and
health-related issues, so it is that those who provide the guns for
those that pull the triggers must be held accountable as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The cities of Chicago and New Orleans filed similar lawsuits
last year, seeking millions of dollars in damages for public
expenses related to shooting deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell did not specify which gun manufacturers the city will
target, nor did he say whether the city will join a class-action
lawsuit with other cities, or initiate a lawsuit of its own.
</P>
<P>
   He would only say that the city is interviewing lawyers to
present its case, and that the lawsuit would be filed ``definitely
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell made the announcement during his annual
``state-of-the-city'' address before the Atlanta City Council, an
upbeat speech in which he bragged on his administration's
accomplishments _ from negotiating a new downtown arena for the
Atlanta Hawks basketball team to improvements in the city's public
housing _ since he took office in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we're not a perfect city . . . but we are a great
city,'' Campell said. ``And undeniably better than what we had
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell pledged to make public safety a priority, highlighting
a plan to provide raises for police. He claimed that crime is at
its lowest point in 30 years, ``in every single category'' and used
murder statistics to make his point.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell carefully chose numbers to paint a positive picture of
crime in the city. Campbell said that the 149 homicides in 1998,
noting that Ivan Allen was mayor, were less than the 183 in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't say is that more people were murdered in 1998 in
the city than in 1977, 1978, 1983, 1984 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Jabari Simama, the mayor's director of marketing and
communications, acknowleged that the statement is unclear, and said
he plans to check the statistics before the mayor delivers a
similar speech today to the business community.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the mayor intended to communicate is that overall crime
is down to 30-year lows and that the homicide rate is lower in 1998
than it was in 1968,'' Simama said. ``The mayor did not
intentionally mean to ignore any years in between when the homicide
rates may be lower.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor outlined other goals for 1999, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ An effort to provide computer access to every Atlanta public
school student. ``In the early years of the next milennium,
economic analysts are saying that if you do not have computer
skills, you won't be able to find many jobs,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell did not provide details on the idea, but said he would
soon announce a proposal involving ``a partnership with the private
sector, Atlanta public schools, and 100 Black Men of America so
that we can work hard to make technology available to all of our
students at the very outset of their education.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Formation of a city committee to ensure every city resident is
counted during the 2000 census. Campbell said the city loses
$400,000 of federal funding for every 20 resident that are not
counted. The mayor said the city was under-counted by 13,000 people
in 1990.

SENATORS STILL SEARCHING FOR WAY TO HANDLE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators searched on Monday for the formula that
would produce bipartisan support for a curtailed impeachment trial
of President Clinton as a few more Republicans expressed opposition
to the compromise plan under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   With the 106th Congress set to convene on Wednesday, Sen. Trent
Lott, the majority leader, returned to the Capitol to prepare for
Republican and Democratic conferences on Wednesday that could
determine whether the Senate can find a way around a full trial
with extensive testimony from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   A day after some senators called on Clinton to postpone his
State of the Union Message if an impeachment trial was under way,
White House officials said Clinton still planned to deliver the
annual policy address on Jan. 19. However, they did not close the
door to a delay. House Republican leaders said Monday night that
they were still inviting the president to appear in the House as
planned. ``I don't think he should be disinvited,'' said the
majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas. Democrats close to the
White House said the president would put off his speech for a week
or so if the Senate seemed able to wrap up impeachment proceedings
quickly this month.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate still appeared far from agreement on a proposal
by Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn.,
that would condense a trial into a matter of days and then require
test votes on whether each of the two articles of impeachment sent
by the House warranted Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, neither article drew the 67 senators that would
ultimately be needed to convict Clinton, then the Senate would vote
to adjourn the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say Lott will move ahead with the proposal only if a
majority of the Senate's 55 Republicans back it, but opposition to
the plan only seemed to be growing among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious mistake,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. ``It's
not constitutional. It creates a bad precedent and I don't think
this president would take it seriously.'' And Sen. Orrin G. Hatch,
R-Utah, expressed opposition in an op-ed article in The Washington
Post, saying he feared the procedure could create a long-term
precedent and be seen ``as a repudiation of the House's decision to
impeach President Clinton.''

 &HT;    One practice enough for instinctive Haley
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Santa Clara, Calif. _ He did not dominate as he did in his glory
days, but out-of-retirement lineman Charles Haley impressed his
team so much during a 31-play stint Sunday against Green Bay that
the 49ers expect him to be even more effective Saturday against the
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Haley gets four days of preparation _ he had just one
before playing against the Packers _ and the Georgia Dome turf
should benefit the speed rusher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have been a little rusty,'' coach Steve Mariucci said,
``but he ran around and gave us some juice, some fresh legs. He had
an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley had two tackles and a pressure on Brett Favre that
resulted in a fourth-quarter interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``His presence forces you to think about him,'' safety Tim
McDonald said Monday. ``You can't expect to block him with one guy.
...His instincts carried him. It was good for him to get a game
under his belt and to feel the talent around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst seems OK
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, who had Monday off, came out of the game with the
Packers in good shape in terms of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest concern was running back Garrison Hearst, who played
despite a slightly pulled hamstring. He left the game late in the
fourth quarter but had only suffered cramps in his calf and
hamstring, which should not keep him out of Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was sore,'' Mariucci said, ``but he should be able
to go. The hamstring is in better shape this week than it was last.
It's just a matter of getting the soreness out.''
</P>
<P>
   Trick question
</P>
<P>
   McDonald was taken aback when a radio reporter asked whether his
team had received a favor from the Arizona Cardinals, who knocked
off Dallas, leaving San Francisco to play Atlanta instead of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even going to answer that,'' McDonald said after a few
seconds. ``Next question.''
</P>
<P>
   Before answering another query, however, McDonald said: ``It's a
tough road no matter what order it comes. Play Minnesota now, then
you've got Atlanta next. Play Atlanta now, you've got Minnesota
next. There's no getting around it. You've got to play them to get
where you want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   No road warriors
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers lost four games on the road this season and won all
their games at 3Com Park. The reason?
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost four games to playoff teams on the road,'' Mariucci
said. ``Our opponents have been very good teams. But games like
(Sunday's) are tremendous experience for our young guys. I think we
grew up a lot. Maybe now we're more ready for a playoff game on the

   Jerry Rice, who had just one catch for 6 yards Sunday, has a
sore knee that probably will limit his practice time this week. ...
The 49ers will practice today and Wednesday and head to Atlanta on
Thursday night after a workout. ``It's a short week, but it's good
that we're playing a team that we're familiar with,'' Mariucci
said.

 WASHINGTON: President Clinton.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who is generally more
moderate than Gregg and Hatch, underscored once again his
determination to see a full trial. ``As a precedent it has to be
done right,'' he said of an impeachment trial after attending a
health-care event at the White House. ``I think it's the trial of
all time. I don't think there has ever been a trial in the history
of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence which is as important as this one.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the House, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who is expected
to be elected speaker this week, said he would like to see a House
prosecution team led by Rep. Henry J. Hyde make the full case that
led the House to approve the articles of impeachment charging
Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly like to see Henry Hyde be able to present
the testimony and what he needs to do to put his case forward,''
Hastert said, ``but that decision is in the Senate and we'll see
how that works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, an author of the compromise plan, said he still believed
a Republican majority would coalesce around his proposal once
lawmakers returned to the Capitol this week and studied its
details. ``I have hopes that it will because I think it's logical,
but I have still to persuade 28 members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said he wanted to see the Senate operate in a bipartisan
way to avoid a ``residue of partisan bitterness'' that could hurt
its ability to reach compromises on legislation.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican aide close to the negotiations under way in the
Senate said the chances that Gorton's plan ``as proposed to the
letter'' would be approved were ``almost nil.'' But he added that
``a close facsimile or a cousin of the plan is probably something
that still has momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican whips were to meet on Tuesday morning to
assess the sentiment of their caucus, and officials said that a
number of changes were under discussion in the Gorton-Lieberman
plan in an effort to attract more Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   They ranged from giving slightly more time for the House and the
White House to present their cases to the Senate to taking actual
votes on the articles of impeachment instead of test votes. Another
possibility would be to dispense with the test votes and simply
take a vote to adjourn the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us are open to some modifications,'' said Lieberman,
the other author of the plan. But he said he still wanted to avoid
numerous witnesses and to stop a trial from dragging on even if
there were no hopes of gaining the votes to convict the president
and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key turning point in all these discussions is whether
witnesses are called or not,'' Lieberman said. ``Then it gets into
a very different kind of procedure that I'm afraid will become not
only more sordid but will become more partisan and inevitably
become a long trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators have only a few days to iron out these details. Senate
Republicans and Democrats both plan to caucus on impeachment on
Wednesday, the first day of the new Congress. Clinton on Monday
staged a White House event on aid for the chronically ill _ one of
a series of public appearances intended to help him dominate the
public policy agenda. His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that the
president intended his State of the Union speech to showcase the
agenda that he will pursue this year regardless of the progress of
the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president believes,'' Lockhart said, ``and those
who have watched him believe, that one of the main reasons that he
continues to enjoy support from the American public is he puts
their interests first, he puts their business first, and that's
what he's going to continue doing,''

IMF CONSIDERING A MAJOR OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS throughout to restructure article, moving up reference to
Soros' letter in the Financial Times and discussion of the risks of
the overhaul.)  (sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund, sharply criticized
for how it handled crises from Southeast Asia to Russia, is
discussing an overhaul of the fund's operations that could let it
intervene directly in national economies long before they get into
deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas being discussed within the fund _ and by outsiders
like the billionaire investor George Soros _ build upon and go
substantially beyond proposals made by President Clinton and
leaders of other industrial powers in October.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, trying to calm the panic among investors who were
pulling out of developing nations, the administration backed some
cautious proposals that would allow the fund to act earlier, before
currencies collapsed and economic ``contagion'' spread around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   The first real experiment with a new approach began in November,
when the IMF put together a $41 billion ``precautionary'' loan
package for Brazil, hoping that early intervention would prevent
the kind of crisis that struck Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The central idea now being discussed within the IMF _ and
outlined in a speech Sunday by Stanley Fischer, the fund's No. 2
official _ is to turn the fund into a ``lender of last resort,''
making available pools of money for countries that, like Brazil,
appear threatened by global economic forces beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   Soros outlined his ideas for an enlarged role for the IMF by
suggesting in the Financial Times that the fund become a global
``central bank.'' But the Clinton administration made it clear on
Monday that it has reservations about such a grand expansion of the
fund's role. Such a system, while intended to head off trouble,
could create new risk. The IMF, for instance, has shown little
ability to predict which nations are most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there remains the problem of what to do about nations
like Russia, which have resisted the kind of economic reforms that
would qualify them for IMF aid. But when countries like Russia get
into trouble, the West feels compelled to provide aid anyway, as it
did last summer, when it determined that Russia was too big _ or
too nuclear _ to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of interesting proposals out there, but there
are a number of concerns associated with all of them,'' a senior
Treasury official said Monday, on condition that his name not be
used. ``We're still working through how to address those concerns,
and whether we can adequately address them at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Fischer, the one-time chairman of the
economics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
stressed that he was not seeking to ``turn the IMF into some kind
of superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything we are trying to do works, there shouldn't be
five crises in a year, as we've just had, and the IMF should be
able to do less lending rather than more,'' he said. ``The whole
idea is prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said that he was speaking for himself, but acknowledged
that many of the ideas had been widely discussed within the fund in
recent months. So has the question of how the widely criticized
institution can better its image. In December, it hired Edelman
Public Relations Worldwide and Wirthlin Worldwide, a polling
company, to recommend how the fund can explain itself around the
world. That may be especially difficult in Asia and Russia, where
the higher interest rates prescribed by the fund are blamed by many
for deepening rather than alleviating their recessions.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Fischer's proposal would reward countries for good
behavior _ as defined by the IMF and its board, which is dominated
by the United States, Japan, and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Nations that strictly supervise their banking systems, that
disclose far more information about their financial state, and that
balance their budgets would ``pre-qualify'' for help from the IMF.
Presumably investors would be reassured, and currency speculators
would not take the risk of betting against that nation's currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``For such a scheme to work, lender-of-last-resort loans would
have to be denied to countries that do not qualify,'' Fischer said
in his speech to the American Economic Association. To deal with
that problem, Fischer said, the IMF may charge higher interest
rates to countries that do not meet the fund's criteria or make
those countries agree to tougher conditions once they come to the
IMF for help.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were echoes of Fischer's proposal in the recommendation
from Soros.
</P>
<P>
   Soros argued that the IMF should act more like an international
central bank, that in a crisis would ``impose conditions not only
on the country concerned but also on the creditors'' who lent the
country money, thus regulating capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, that idea would encounter considerable resistance
both within Congress and among developing nations. In both places,
suspicions of the IMF run high, and many countries have recoiled at
the idea that the fund, in return for offering its aid, could
dictate economic and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moment at least,'' Lawrence H. Summers, the deputy
Treasury secretary, said in a speech on Monday, ``it is difficult
to imagine nations ceding control over their money or their banks
to an international institution.''

   LIVING? LET LIVE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The septuagenarian sex therapist DR. RUTH WESTHEIMER listened to
the talk about Social Security and health care. But like the agenda
planners and policy makers at Renaissance Weekend, the annual
Democratic battery-charging session held in Hilton Head, S.C., she
continued her silence about the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an entire year, I have absolutely not talked about the
issue,'' she said Monday. ``I have a proposal for a book in the
works based on the phrase that Henry Kissinger used, `Power is an
aphrodisiac,' but I will never talk about people who are alive.
David and Bathsheba, yes, and Queen Victoria, and I might go as far
as the Windsors.''
</P>
<P>
   OLD AT HEART &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What is a 17-year-old singer like TIM DRAXL doing in
a Greenwich Village piano bar called Eighty-Eight's?
</P>
<P>
   Not ordering drinks, that is for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like alcohol at all,'' he said. ``Can't stand it.''
And even if he wanted a martini or a Manhattan, the waiters and
waitresses have been told he is not to be served.
</P>
<P>
   But he is to sing. He opened Monday night and is scheduled to
appear again Tuesday and next Monday and Tuesday, performing
standards by Gershwin and Cole Porter, among other songwriters. The
club's owners say he is one of the youngest performers to appear in
a New York cabaret, and one of the youngest to arrive with a
five-album record contract from a major label, Sony/Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tells me I'm so young,'' he said Monday. Grown-ups
also wonder why he likes the music of the 1930s better than, say,
the music of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not normal,'' he said. ``I listen to pop, but I have a
stronger passion for this music. It's more, I think, music for the
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   ONE CHECK FITS ALL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``We've had a few people ask, but no one's bought,''
LORENZO CESARE said shortly before 2 p.m. Monday from behind his
teller's window in the Thomas Cook currency exchange at 1590
Broadway, near 48th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The unbought item he was talking about was the euro, the single
currency that 11 European nations began using on Friday.
Specifically, he was talking about euro traveler's checks; hard,
cold cash euros will not be issued until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Then EDWARD MAHER, a baker from Lake Ronkonkoma, N.Y., walked
in. He asked for traveler's checks; some in pounds, some in francs.
</P>
<P>
   Cesare told him that Thomas Cook had stopped selling traveler's
checks in francs because France had made the switch to the euro. So
he bought two 50-euro traveler's checks at $61.50 apiece, along
with several hundred dollars' worth of pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm curious how easily this is going to be accepted,'' said
Maher, who is scheduled to leave Wednesday for a trip to London and
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The articles I've read all equate the way Europe used to be
until last week with going to New Jersey and having to use
different currency,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   BARGAIN GIFTS
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A lot of gift givers on the Upper West Side must have
given music-loving friends or relatives copies of ``The Good
Life,'' the autobiography that TONY BENNETT wrote with help from
the jazz scholar WILL FRIEDWALD. The week before Christmas, a tall
stack of ``The Good Life,'' which was published at $25 last year by
Pocket Books, dominated the 50-percent-off table at the Barnes &AMP;
Noble near Lincoln Center; a sign, perhaps, that book buyers had
not snatched it up as fast as better sellers in the store, on 66th
Street between Broadway and Columbus Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, bargain hunters noticed that the pile of ``The Good
Life'' was much shorter than before Christmas. Towering over it
were two new titles: ``At Home in the World,'' by JOYCE MAYNARD
(Picador, originally $25) and ``Journey to Beloved,'' by OPRAH
WINFREY and KEN REGAN (Hyperion, originally $20).

EDITORIAL: SENATOR RODHAM? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Jan. 5:
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton's spokesmen say she has not thought of
running for the Senate in 2000. But Robert Torricelli, who heads
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, floated what
certainly looked like a trial balloon over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli says he had no inside information from the White
House about the first lady's plans, but he told Tim Russert of NBC
that his guess was that Mrs. Clinton would run for the seat now
occupied by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring at the end of
his term. This could simply be wishful thinking. Torricelli's job
of raising money for Senate candidates would be easier if a
fund-raiser as formidable as Mrs. Clinton was involved in the New
York campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Mrs. Clinton has made no attempt to discourage
talk about the Moynihan seat suggests she has not ruled the idea
out entirely. Running while her husband is still president would
certainly be a dramatic break with tradition, and it also suggests
a first lady who is thinking of building a career and legacy that
is separate from and extends beyond the tarnished record of
President Clinton. Her candidacy would represent a remarkable
change in the dynamics of a marriage in which his career has come
first.
</P>
<P>
   As for public reaction, there are surely those who would think
it opportunistic and unseemly for a first lady to hit the campaign
trail. One thing Mrs. Clinton would probably not have to worry
about is charges of carpetbagging. Both Robert Kennedy and James
Buckley won despite what might be charitably regarded as
late-breaking residency. Empire State voters tend to regard anyone
famous as an honorary New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the public reaction might not be so predictable as
some Democrats imagine. The fact that Mrs. Clinton wows party
donors in the Hamptons does not automatically mean that her appeal
will extend across the board. Nor does the fact that Andrew Cuomo
has announced that he will check with Mr. Clinton and Vice
President Gore before running mean that other ambitious Democrats
would fold automatically.
</P>
<P>
   It might even be true that Republicans in the mold of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani would welcome Mrs. Clinton's candidacy as a
polarizing force that would turn out their own votes. Once the
campaign heated up, both political rivals and the press would
probably take another look at such mysteries as Mrs. Clinton's
migrating billing records.
</P>
<P>
   All that is simply to say that the conditions that make New York
attractive to famous candidates can also make it tough for them.
Our one prediction for the 2000 Senate race is that no one will win
it in a walk. But we are strongly on the side of large fields,
intense competition and the general theory of the more the merrier,
including those who move to New York to find work.

IN VINO NO VERITAS, BUT RELIGION INTERVENED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Consider a typical 1980s New York evening in the life
of Susan Cheever, the writer, daughter of the famous novelist and
alcoholic:
</P>
<P>
   First, she had ``the dressing drink,'' a sherry or two while
dressing for a dinner party. Next came ``a couple of stiff ones,''
Scotch in winter, gin and tonic in summer, martinis if your host
offered them, served at cocktail time. Then came wine with dinner,
often a whole bottle. Finally there was a nightcap, usually Scotch,
and maybe a liqueur. ``I loved Cointreau,'' Ms. Cheever said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the decade and the birth of her second child, Ms.
Cheever had reformed. In other words, she had given up hard liquor
for white wine, which was hardly drinking at all. Or so she told
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you start at lunch, and it's a Sunday, and you have
a case, and three bottles are in the fridge,'' Ms. Cheever said.
``You'd be amazed to find out how quickly there's none in the
fridge. But officially you're still working on one glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheever had her last drink in April 1991. Her father, John
Cheever, had his last drink in 1975, seven years before his death.
Now, maybe inevitably, comes Ms. Cheever's new memoir, ``Note Found
in a Bottle: My Life as a Drinker,'' published this week by Simon &AMP;
Schuster. If it does not ``redefine alcoholism,'' which is Ms.
Cheever's stated goal, it does catalog firsthand the drinking
rituals of at least certain families in the old Puritan-descended
upper class. (The Cheevers came to America in 1630 on the Arbella,
which set sail with three times as much beer as water, plus 10,000
gallons of wine.)
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother Cheever taught me how to embroider, how to say
the Lord's Prayer, and how to make a perfect dry martini,'' Ms.
Cheever says in the first sentence of her book. She completes the
paragraph with this: ``I watched enthralled as she twisted the
lemon peel with her tiny white hands and its oil spread across the
shimmery surface. I was six.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheever's book takes its place among other alcoholic memoirs
of the 1990s. Pete Hamill's ``A Drinking Life'' was published in
1994 and Caroline Knapp's ``Drinking: A Love Story'' in 1996. But
its particular interest lies in its literary provenance. It also
makes Ms. Cheever an interesting target. Although Publishers Weekly
called her book ``a powerful story written in precise, emotionally
intense prose,'' Jonathan Yardley dismissed her last week in The
Washington Post as a ``professional daughter, alcoholic variety''
who is adding ``another chapter to her endless exploration and
glorification of a life that long ago lost any claim on the
attentions of others.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cheever daughter responded thus to Yardley: ``That's
just what he did to Daddy. He's getting old and no less cranky.''
(For the record, Yardley said he was a great admirer of Cheever's
short stories, but not his novel ``Falconer.'') But enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheever, 55, is the author of eight other books, fiction and
nonfiction, including ``Home Before Dark,'' a memoir of her father
that chronicles not only his drinking but his bisexuality.
</P>
<P>
   She talked Monday in her sunny and modest East End Avenue
apartment, and was more likable than the self-absorbed baby boomer
she describes in ``Note Found in a Bottle'' _ a woman who had three
bad marriages, and who at the height of her drinking (1985)
sometimes slept with three men in one day. (Her husband, her
ex-husband and a lover.) ``It made sense at the time,'' Ms. Cheever
said. Of course: ``I was dying inside. It was insane.'' By early
1990, a few months after her son was born, she was thinking
constantly of suicide, and had a plan to jump out the window. Why
that way? ``Quick,'' she said. ``And certain.'' A psychiatrist
prescribed Prozac, which helped.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, she finally went to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting on
the Upper East Side _ she had attended other meetings years before
with her father _ and on the way back, as she describes it,
experienced ``a profound shift'' that ``came through the grace of
God.'' Raised as a ``rogue Episcopalian'' (her parents didn't
bother to baptize her until a few days before her confirmation, at
age 13), she said she now goes sporadically to the 8 a.m. Sunday
service at the Episcopal Church of the Heavenly Rest on Fifth
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it happens, it's one of the places where I sometimes
encounter God,'' she said. In other words, ``I couldn't stop
drinking by myself. And when I involved God in my effort to stop, I
was able to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of her friends are skeptical. ``I was at a dinner party
last summer, and this woman who's known me a long time said'' _ the
tone here is incredulity _ ```Susie, do you believe in God?''''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Ms. Cheever seems like any other freelance writer
and single parent of two children (ages 15 and 9) trying to keep
her life together in New York. She writes a parenting column for
Newsday, peeks into rich people's homes for Architectural Digest
and teaches in a graduate writing program at Bennington College.
</P>
<P>
   She is also a state record holder in her class, or so they told
her at a power-lifting meet on Sunday, in the bench press, squat
and dead lift. ``It's fun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, she hopes that the Cheever drinking disease will stop with
her, and not pass on to her children.
</P>
<P>
   And, she prays all the time. ``I think my principle prayer,''
she said, ``is, `help _ please.'''

LANDLORD OF MISSING COUPLE IS HELD ON FRAUD CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than a year after a Manhattan couple argued with
their landlord and then disappeared, the landlord, Robert
Rodriguez, was arrested Monday, and investigators searched his
Orange County home, as well as the apartment building where the
couple lived.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who had refused to allow the police to search his
property, was not charged in connection with the mysterious
disappearance of his tenants, but with a variety of ``white-collar
crimes,'' including tax fraud and grand larceny, according to
law-enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, the New York Police Department
acknowledged only that Rodriguez was in custody, that two search
warrants had been executed, and that ``Mr. Rodriguez owns the
building at 76 Pearl St. where Michael Sullivan and Camden Sylvia
resided prior to their disappearance on November 7, 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple were last seen in a video store after arguing with
Rodriguez over the lack of heat in their apartment on Pearl Street,
in the financial district. Rodriguez himself disappeared for two
weeks shortly after friends discovered the couple were missing. He
then reappeared without explaining his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Rodriguez has declined to cooperate with police
seeking to find Ms. Sylvia, 36, an artist and real estate agent,
and her companion, Sullivan, 54, an actor and art-gallery worker.
In particular, he has refused to let the police search his
property. Frustrated investigators have even flown over the
seven-acre Orange County home in helicopters and sent dogs sniffing
for anything that might provide the basis for a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said the search warrants were executed
shortly after Rodriguez's arrest Monday _ one for Rodriguez's home
in Slate Hill and the other for the Pearl Street apartment
building.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of searching for evidence of the white-collar
crimes, investigators could presumably look for clues concerning
the whereabouts of Ms. Sylvia and Rodriguez. But since search
warrants are narrowly drawn, investigators might be confined to
Rodriguez's house, or even parts of his house, rather than the
entire property of the Slate Hill estate and the Pearl Street
building.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Marro, Rodriguez's lawyer, declined to comment
immediately on the arrest, saying he had not heard from Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Goldfeder, the lawyer for the families of Ms. Sylvia and
Sullivan, said: ``This is the first real break in 14 months in this
case. It's the first opportunity for the authorities to find
something that may resolve the disappearance.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, six investigators were in Rodriguez's locksmith
shop on the ground floor of the apartment building, taking out milk
crates full of items from the shop. Kim Magistro, a neighbor of the
missing couple, said the investigators were also questioning Gina
DeLarosa, a friend of Rodriguez who lives in a second-floor
apartment. Ms. Delarosa has an unlisted number and could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the building, on three different floors, six yellow
ribbons in memory of the missing couple had been tied to the fire
escapes by their friends.

EDITORIAL: THE EURO IS LAUNCHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Jan. 5:
</P>
<P>
   The euro, the new currency for most of Europe, got off to a
strong start Monday as it appeared to be the magnet for capital
that its designers desired. The euro gained against the dollar, and
big European stocks _ now traded in euros _ rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the euro exists at all, and that polls indicate it
is popular among citizens of most European countries, is a great
accomplishment for a generation of European leaders _ most notably
Helmut Kohl of Germany _ that has largely passed from office.
Finance ministers had good reason to break out the champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the most important new institution created along
with the euro is off to a disturbing start. The European Central
Bank, under the presidency of Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands,
has demonstrated a tendency toward excessive secrecy. The votes of
its members on monetary policy changes are to remain confidential
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg got the job last May as a result of a deal in which
France acquiesced only after it was agreed that he would resign in
about four years to be replaced by a French official. Now
Duisenberg says he might ignore that deal and stay in office for
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank was designed to be more independent
than even the Federal Reserve or Germany's Bundesbank. But the
various national governments retained the authority to choose the
bank's top official. By seeming to thumb his nose at that political
compromise, Duisenberg has provided a reminder to European voters
of just how much sovereignty their governments have given up. That
reminder could come back to haunt him if, or when, Europe's economy
runs into difficulties and the Central Bank needs supporters.

FOUL TROUBLE HAUNTS USC IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC had a rare weekday matinee at the Sports
Arena, which is just as well, because the Trojans demonstrated
against eighth-ranked Arizona on Monday that they still aren't
quite ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   At least when their top player gets in foul trouble. Or they
play a top-10 team.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans wilted in the second half of an 87-78 loss to the
Wildcats before 4,116, but USC coach Henry Bibby seemed more
enraged by the officiating than the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Center Brian Scalabrine, USC's leading scorer, played most of
the contest in foul trouble after picking up his third foul just 14
seconds into the second half. Scalabrine joined point guard Brandon
Granville, who already had three fouls in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Two other starters _ Jeff Trepagnier and Sam Clancy _ picked up
their third fouls less than three minutes into the second half. Add
to that the fact Bibby received a technical foul in the first half
from referee Dave Libbey, and it wasn't too hard to translate his
post-game comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was in Tucson, Ariz., instead of Los Angeles, for
whatever reasons,'' Bibby said. ``The officials should never be
able to set the tone and I'm not saying they did or didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got in foul trouble. We lost a lot of momentum with the
fouls being called. That deflates you. It takes its toll on what
you're trying to do on the floor. It took Brian Scalabrine out of
the game. ''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier was a little calmer in his analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to the refs now. We get bad calls every game,''
Trepagnier said. ``We just play through that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans may have been upset with the officiating, but their
offense also disappeared in the second half. After building a 44-35
halftime advantage, led by several alley-oop dunks to Trepagnier,
the Trojans lost their rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   USC shot 27 percent in the final 20 minutes and was outscored by
18 points. Unlike Saturday's dramatic comeback victory over Arizona
State, USC received little help from its shooting guards. Seniors
Adam Spanich and Elias Ayuso were 4 for 18 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure, but I think we were settling for bad shots,
forcing too many shots,'' Clancy said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of USC's offensive woes were due to the disappearance of
Scalabrine, who scored a season-low eight points. After getting
into foul trouble, the 6-foot-9 center abandoned going inside and
stayed on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do what I wanted to do. Why I started pulling up
outside was a mistake,'' Scalabrine said. ``That was a big mistake
on my part, not being aggressive. I had to change the way I played.
With the fouls, I wasn't as aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Trojans were depleted by foul problems, they
still led 66-61 when Ayuso hit a 3-pointer with 7:36 left.
</P>
<P>
   Then Arizona star Jason Terry decided to join the game. Terry,
who scored just two points in the first half, drove the lane for a
basket. He then added a 3-pointer and followed with a steal and
layup. By the time Terry finished, the Wildcats had outscored the
Trojans 11-1 and taken a 72-67 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans never recovered from that spurt, failing to get
closer than three points the remainder of the game. Terry finished
with 16 points and made 6 of 8 shots in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't contain him on penetration,'' Bibby said. ``He got
by our people and penetrated. You've got to respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's bid to gain respect this season has only been slowed
against premier teams. The Trojans (9-2, 1-1) have lost to
then-No.10-ranked Kansas and to the No.8 Wildcats (9-1, 1-1), who
were undefeated before losing to UCLA last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For USC, the toughest part was losing at home. After squeaking
past Arizona State on Saturday, the Trojans were hoping to sweep
the homestand before this week's tough trip to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't lose any home games in the Pac-10,'' Scalabrine
said. ``One of our goals was to go undefeated in the Pac-10 and
they took it away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only highlight for USC was the play of Clancy. He
didn't see a minute of action against Arizona State, then started
against Arizona and finished with 16 points and 10 rebounds before
fouling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been looking for a player to fill that slot. He did
exactly what we wanted him to do,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The loss snapped USC's nine-game winning streak at the
Sports Arena.... This is Arizona's first victory at the Sports
Arena since 1996.... USC shot a season-low 36.6 percent, the first
time the Trojans shot below 40 percent.... The Trojans are just
3-15 against ranked teams since December, 1996.... USC has scored
78 points in both losses.

MERGER RUMORS ABOUND AT BIG AUTO SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (js) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ When top auto executives gather here each winter for
the North American International Auto Show, the talk in the halls
is usually about the latest car or, more recently, the latest sport
utility vehicle or pickup truck. But at this year's show, there is
also another theme: merger rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Daimler-Benz A.G. and Chrysler Corp. announced their
merger last May, and particularly since the two companies completed
the deal last November, the industry has been full of speculation
on who might link up next. But top industry officials here said
Monday that while many auto makers were cautiously and tentatively
holding discussions, that did not necessarily mean another deal was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The company most often mentioned as a potential acquirer is Ford
MotorCo., which has accumulated $22 billion in cash, a hoard equal
to nearly a third of its market value. Just before Christmas,
rumors started that Ford was in talks to acquire Volvo of Sweden or
BMW of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, who became Ford's chief executive on Friday with
the retirement of Alex Trotman, expressed amusement Monday at the
rumors. ``I was lying back on a beach over the Christmas period
reading about all these wonderful strategic meetings being held
that I clearly wasn't involved in,'' Nasser said in an interview at
Ford's huge, two-level display here, which is almost as long as a
football field.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser declined to discuss either Volvo or BMW but did say,
``Everyone's talking to everyone else.'' Yet Ford views the
prospect of an acquisition as a potential opportunity rather than a
necessity, and therefore is in no hurry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haste, in these circumstances, I wouldn't put a premium on,''
Nasser added.
</P>
<P>
   BMW has insisted that it wants to stay independent and that the
controlling Quandt family has no intention of even discussing a
sale. ``BMW will remain independent and, contrary to all the
speculation and rumors in the industry, there have not been any
discussions,'' said Helmut Panke, a member of BMW's management
board.
</P>
<P>
   Panke was particularly emphatic that BMW had not been
negotiating any deals with Ford. ``I can really confirm that there
haven't been, are none and will be no discussions'' with Ford, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bodil Eriksson, a senior vice president of Volvo, said Monday
that while the company was willing to talk to other auto makers
about cooperating on production and other ventures, it was not
interested in being acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo is small by industry standards. In terms of sales, it is
twice the size of Microsoft Corp. but only one-seventh the size of
Ford. Smaller auto makers that lack broad ranges of models and
international operations are increasingly seen as the most likely
to engage in mergers.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp., already the world's largest auto maker,
has shown little interest in growing through acquisitions. G.
Richard Wagoner Jr., GM's president, said Monday that there had
long been speculation that the auto industry would undergo
considerable consolidation, but the DaimlerChrysler deal might yet
turn out to be an exception rather than a new rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about this business getting down to `X'
major players _ 5 or 10, pick a number _ for a decade,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Jens Neumann, a member of Volkswagen AG's management board, took
a similar position, saying that informal talks did not
automatically mean that more big transactions were on the way.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler officials started the current merger speculation
by insisting that their transaction was necessary to achieve
greater economies of scale. But even DaimlerChrysler has had
trouble moving quickly on further deals.
</P>
<P>
   Jurgen E. Schrempp, the company's co-chairman, said in
mid-November that he expected a decision by the end of 1998 on
whether to buy Nissan Motor Corp.'s stake in Nissan Diesel. But no
decision has been reached, and Thomas Stallkamp, DaimlerChrysler's
president for North American operations, said Monday that the
company was concerned the Japanese economy might not have hit
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has also been rumored to be interested in Nissan, but Ford
executives have become leery of any deal because of concerns that
Nissan's balance sheet may not reflect the true extent of its
debts. &QL;

RECENT RAIN OF LITTLE HELP TO N.J. AND N.Y. RESERVOIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday's rain _ bountiful in some areas, sparse in others _ did
little more for the reservoirs serving New York City and
northeastern New Jersey than stop the steady decline in levels that
began last fall, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   All the reservoirs remain well below normal, despite the storm,
according to officials in New York and New Jersey. While they
welcomed the rain, they cautioned that significantly more was
needed and warned that residents must continue using water
judiciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it didn't amount to very much and it's not
going to change our situation dramatically,'' Cathy DelliCarpini, a
spokeswoman for New York City's Department of Environmental
Protection, said of the storm. ``What we need is some consistent
rainfall. One storm is not going to make up for several months of
below-normal rainfall.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, New York City's three major reservoir systems
received only nine-tenths of an inch of rain on Sunday, which
provides little more than the 1.3 billion gallons of water that the
city uses each day, Ms. DelliCarpini said. By Monday afternoon,
runoff from the rain had pushed water levels in all the reservoirs
from 51 to 51.3 percent of capacity, she said. Normally, at this
time of year, they should be 78 percent full.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the city's daily supply comes from three big
reservoirs in the headwaters of the Delaware River in the
southwestern Catskills. They rose only a tenth of one percentage
point _ from 36.2 to 36.3 percent of capacity _ because the storm
that hit near them produced sleet and frozen rain that has not
melted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any appreciable runoff and that's what we need,''
said Christopher Roberts, a spokesman for the Delaware River Basin
Commission, a four-state agency that regulates water use in the
Delaware's watershed. ``So, we're still in pretty bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless major storms hit by mid-January, Ms. DelliCarpini said,
New York City's water managers plan to declare a ``drought watch''
sometime between the middle and the end of the month. Under a
``watch,'' officials would intensify appeals for voluntary
conservation of water, including running public announcements
encouraging water savings. Officials began to call for conservation
on Dec. 14, although this was a low-key appeal.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, New Jersey declared a ``drought warning'' for
about 2 million people served by 13 reservoirs in the state's
densely populated northeastern corner. As in New York City, the
warning was primarily an appeal to conserve by running washing
machines and dishwashers only with full loads, taking shorter
showers, repairing all leaks and using water intermittently while
brushing teeth or shaving.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's 13 reservoirs received an average of 2.2 inches of
rain. Water storage in them rose Monday to 45.1 percent of
capacity, up from 42.9 last Thursday. But normally at this time of
year, the 13 would be nearly 79 percent full.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to continue to conserve,'' said Shing-Fu Hsueh,
water supply administrator in New Jersey's Environmental Protection
Department. He said the storm cut the rainfall shortage in the
state's northeastern corner since July from 13 to 11 inches. And,
he added, without heavy storms soon, the state is likely to declare
a water emergency and to impose mandatory cutbacks in water use in
40 days. Before the storm, officials had planned to mandate the
restrictions in 30 days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave us another week or so on an emergency,'' he said of
the rain. ``If we get lucky, we won't have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's situation is not as ominous. About 2.2 million of
its 3.2 million residents rely on reservoir water. Most of the
reservoirs there are at or above normal, primarily because they are
big, have large watersheds to collect runoff and are not as
vulnerable to rainfall shortages as the rest of the region is.
</P>
<P>
   The only problems now are reservoirs that serve about 150,000
residents in and near Greenwich, Norwalk and Ridgefield, said James
Okrongly, head of public water supply planning in Connecticut's
Public Health Department. All are less than half-full, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping a wary eye on them,'' Okrongly said.

STRIP CLUB USES LEGAL LOOPHOLE TO STAY OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWBURGH, N.Y. _ When Robert Hopkins opened a strip club along
the tattered main street here earlier this month, he expected to
wrangle with city officials, who had warned him he was not
permitted to offer adult entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   So one of the first things he did was hang a sign near the
entrance of his club, Lips, announcing that it would admit minors.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Hopkins was following a route mapped out by a state
Supreme Court justice in Manhattan, who declared that a New York
City strip club could not be subject to laws regulating adult
entertainment if minors were allowed inside.
</P>
<P>
   In that decision, Justice Stephen Crane said that Ten's World
Class Cabaret, an East Side topless club, could remain open despite
the city's strict zoning codes because the city's law defined an
adult establishment, in part, as one that does not admit minors.
</P>
<P>
   Ten's World got around the issue by saying it would allow young
people inside if they were accompanied by an adult.
</P>
<P>
   City lawyers appealed the decision (and the City Council quickly
went to work to change the definition of adult establishment), and
arguments are scheduled for Jan. 5 in the Appellate Division in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Newburgh's adult entertainment law, and the laws of other cities
across the state and country, include a loophole similar to New
York City's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the zoning law used all across the country,''
said Mark Alonso, the lawyer who represented Ten's World. ``It was
passed down from one town to another. Once they came up with the
concept of using zoning laws to fight topless clubs, it became very
popular.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hopkins, 51, a real estate developer who lives in Goshen and
is new to the strip club business, the judge's ruling came along at
the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an easy way we found of not arguing with the town over
the adult establishment law,'' he said. ``If we didn't have an
argument with the town, we could just make it a normal above-18
admission. This is a technicality.''
</P>
<P>
   Newburgh city officials say Hopkins was told long before he
opened his business that a strip club would not be allowed because
the site is too close to a residence and across the street from an
adult bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as Lips opened on Dec. 11, Hopkins was charged
with violating the city's zoning ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   James Morrill, Newburgh's building inspector, declared Lips an
adult club, subject to adult entertainment rules, even if it
sometimes admits minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a minor shows up without a parent, the minor would be
turned away,'' said James Morrill, the building inspector.
``Therefore it does exclude minors.''
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with Ten's, for a minor to be allowed into Lips,
a parent or legal guardian must accompany him or her, tour the
facility first and sign a waiver accepting responsibility, Hopkins
said. The minor must sign a waiver, too.
</P>
<P>
   Only one boy has tried to get into the club since it opened, and
he was turned away because the man accompanying him could not prove
he was the boy's guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said he did not relish allowing youngsters into strip
clubs, but said Newburgh's laws are unconstitutional because they
go beyond restricting where strip clubs can operate by effectively
banning them.
</P>
<P>
   Newburgh's zoning law, adopted in 1996, does not allow adult
businesses within 1,000 feet of a home, house of worship, school or
other adult business; Hopkins said no place in the city meets that
definition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the designated district,'' he said. ``We are in the
Industrial-2 zone, where you could almost produce nuclear warheads,
and still there are residences allowed here. We're not being
cavalier about letting minors in. We want to follow the letter of
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, some advocates of adult entertainment are
critical of using the admission of minors as a legal strategy for
keeping clubs open.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the January issue of Stripper magazine, a national
trade journal for the strip-club industry, warns against using
minors to circumvent zoning laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's risky to allow under-age kids into clubs,'' the
magazine's publisher said. ``You could open yourself up to a lot of
other charges, like child endangerment. You don't want to do that
in some small town.''

EDITORIAL: UNSETTLING THE CITY'S CAMPAIGN LAW 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Jan. 5:
</P>
<P>
   Pity the candidate who ventures now into New York City politics.
The ground rules for local elections have suddenly become vastly
more chaotic as lawyers for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani squabble with
the city's Campaign Finance Board about the formula for matching
public subsidies with private political contributions. This
internecine argument threatens to unsettle candidates in special
elections for City Council this year and could undermine one of the
best and fairest campaign finance reform systems in the country.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this issue so disheartening is that it all goes back
to a puerile political contest last year between the mayor and
Council Speaker Peter Vallone. Vallone wanted a referendum on
Yankee Stadium. To block any such vote, Giuliani had his cronies
cobble together a slapdash charter reform item that, like all
charter referendums, automatically bumps a normal referendum from
the ballot. The language of Giuliani's charter reform sounded
enlightened _ it banned corporate donations _ and the voters
adopted it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the mayor's lawyers are arguing that their charter
item not only bans corporate donations but also wipes out
improvements in the campaign finance law that were enacted last
year by Vallone and the City Council. The council had adopted a
two-tiered approach to the voluntary campaign reform law. If a
candidate took contributions from corporations, whether IBM or the
local pizza parlor, the city would match all donations dollar for
dollar up to $1,000. If the candidate refused corporate money, the
match went to $4 for every dollar donated, for contributions of up
to $250.
</P>
<P>
   The charter vote knocked the corporate contributions out of the
city's system, but the mayor and the Campaign Finance Board are at
odds about what is left. The Finance Board has notified the city
that, with all participating candidates now shunning corporate
money (albeit by fiat), all should get the 4-to-1 match, which
would help entice people into the system. However, Robert Harding,
the mayor's budget director, argues that, with no corporate
contributions available to be refused, the entire system reverts to
a 1-to-1 match.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone and the council need to tidy up this mess, by making it
clearer that all candidates who choose the city's finance plan will
now have the 4-to-1 match. Without such an effort, the next sorry
steps will inevitably lead to the courthouse, where a legal fight
between the mayor and the campaign board will merely extend the
confusion and convince many candidates that even a model campaign
finance system is not worth the trouble.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Jan. 5:
</P>
<P>
   The annals of justice contain few scenes as bizarre as the
goings-on in Cambodia last week. In late December Khieu Samphan and
Nuon Chea defected from the straggling remains of the Khmer Rouge
guerrillas and turned themselves in to the government. In the past
the Cambodian leader, Hun Sen, has favored prosecuting Khmer Rouge
leaders, whose regime in the late 1970s killed more than 1 million
people. Instead Hun Sen declared that these men should be welcomed
``with bouquets of flowers.'' They were, quite literally. Then, as
Seth Mydans of The Times reported, they were treated to beach
vacations. After this engendered outrage in Cambodia and worldwide,
Hun Sen said he supported a trial for his guests. He should prove
it by arresting them, and then the United Nations must quickly move
toward setting up a court.
</P>
<P>
   Trials of the most important Khmer Rouge leaders have been
discussed for years. In 1997 Hun Sen signed a letter asking the
United Nations for help in setting up such trials. But he has never
been serious. He has treated defecting Khmer Rouge officials as
allies and given them political power. He has manipulated memories
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Last April the death of Pol Pot robbed Cambodia of the
opportunity to try the man known as ``Brother Number One.'' But
last month's defectors were near his level. Nuon Chea was known as
``Brother Number Two,'' and Khieu Samphan was the head of state in
the Khmer Rouge government. They are now in the town of Pailin,
which is run by Ieng Sary, a former high-ranking Khmer Rouge
official who was given amnesty when he left the guerrillas in 1996.
Hun Sen, however, insisted in the past that the government had
control of Pailin, and so could arrest them.
</P>
<P>
   Three international jurists hired by the United Nations are in
Cambodia, looking at the evidence against the most important Khmer
Rouge leaders and assessing the feasibility of trials. They are due
to give their report at the end of this month. If the evidence is
there, and experts say it is, the Security Council should approve
trials of the top surviving Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes against
humanity. Given that Cambodia's justice system is a tool of Hun
Sen, the trials will have to be internationally run. But they can
have considerable Cambodian participation and should be in Phnom
Penh, where they can do the most good for the victims and for
Cambodia's still-traumatized society.  &QL;

NBA SEASON DOWN TO LAST SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The lockout game clock is down to its final
precious seconds, and now NBA players will get the chance every
athlete craves: to decide the outcome with everything on the line.
And this time, literally (begin ital)everything(end ital) is on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA rejected the players association's final offer Monday,
and owners will vote Thursday on a recommendation to kill the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But first, a last-gasp shot by the players. The union announced
it will conduct a vote Wednesday of its 400-plus members on the
league's final offer. A majority no vote probably means no season.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA labor relations committee, which includes Lakers owner
Jerry Buss, voted unanimously to recommend cancellation after
reviewing the union's final proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have had to see a proposal that reached for ours.
Instead it in many ways went backwards,'' commissioner David Stern
said. ``We don't anticipate making a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, the only pro league never to have lost a game to labor
conflict prior to this season is perilously close to becoming the
first in history to lose an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations having failed, the players now hold their own fate
in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of players _ including New Jersey Nets stars Jayson
Williams and Keith Van Horn _ had pressed for a membership vote in
recent weeks. Union leaders resisted, saying the membership had
given final authority to the 19-player negotiating committee.
</P>
<P>
   They begrudgingly changed course Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee... will continue to recommend against acceptance
of the (owners' final) proposal,'' union director Billy Hunter
said. ``To assure that the owners understand the level of player
resolve and the degree of opposition to the NBA's onerous demands,
the negotiating committee will convene an all-players meeting in
New York... at which time the general membership will be asked to
approve the negotiating committee's recommendation to reject the
NBA's final proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Free agent Malik Rose, a member of the negotiating committee,
predicted 70 percent of the players would vote against the NBA's
offer. Privately, league officials are convinced a vast majority of
players will take their deal rather than lose the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they elect to go against the (union's) recommendation,''
Hunter said, ``then we'll have to live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   And if everything goes wrong this week, everyone involved will
have to live with some heavy consequences, Stern warned.
</P>
<P>
   If owners vote to cancel the season, they will then proceed with
plans for a 1999-2000 season _ probably without the union's 400
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may or may not be dealing with those players if we cancel
the season,'' Stern said. ``I think the parties will start on their
separate courses and we may or may not be dealing with those
players anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern is assuming superagent David Falk will try to launch a
rival league, using his clients, Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing and
Alonzo Mourning among them, and other superstars as the main draw.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern said the rest of the union's members will be left out
in the cold. The NBA, he said, will start anew with college
draftees and other available, nonunion players _ presumably from
European leagues and the Continental Basketball Association, though
he didn't offer such specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily a pretty sight early on, but obviously if
we have to rebuild the league, we will in fact rebuild the
league,'' Stern said. ``We're looking for people who share the same
idea of partnership that got us where we've gotten to.... We're not
talking about members of the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting between league and union leaders ended after
barely an hour. Hunter presented the players' last offer, which
included absolute maximum salaries for all players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the (union's) final proposal moved towards the NBA in
nearly every significant area, the commissioner and deputy
commissioner (Russ Granik) felt that anything short of total
capitulation to their position is unacceptable,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Though union leaders agreed to cap individual salaries, they
still insisted that players receive 57 percent of league revenues
in the final year of the agreement. Owners, who imposed the lockout
when the players' take hit 57 percent last season, are offering no
more than 54.5 percent, with each point representing approximately
$20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't in any way significantly different, at least in my
judgment, from where the union has been on prior offers,'' Granik
said. ``We're far apart on every issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stern: ``The proposal which was delivered would have been a
good one to start from six months ago.''

 STRUCTURES IN MOTION SEEN AT SYNAPSES  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a picture familiar to generations of high school biology
students: the human brain and its intricate circuitry, fine nerve
networks that resemble the branches of a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after peering closer than ever before at the elaborate
branches of individual nerve cells, scientists have discovered that
the twigs, known as dendrites, are decorated with tiny ornaments,
called dendritic spines _ and that the ornaments can move.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it appears that these critical parts of the brain can
change and even multiply, a notion that revolutionizes previous
views of the structures as passive receptacles.
</P>
<P>
   Exquisitely small, dendritic spines typically serve as the
receiving end of the synapses, which are neuronal connecting sites
where nerve cells transmit signals to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Synaptic connections allow the brain to detect sensations.
Synapses also are the principal means by which the brain records
memory and coordinates movement.
</P>
<P>
   Using the latest in laser and video imaging technology, brain
experts have seen and recorded dendritic spines sprouting and
changing form within fractions of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why this happens is an enigma. But early clues, laid out
during recent scientific meetings in San Francisco and Los Angeles,
suggest some intriguing possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The brain, it seems, may have the power to create new synaptic
circuits when necessary _ like an unlit room that sprouts its own
power outlets to accommodate new lamps.
</P>
<P>
   This may help explain the brain's phenomenal ability to rake in
huge amounts of information and rapidly store it for long-term use,
researchers say. Unraveling how the brain works, scientists add,
may help open new doors to treating common neurological disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding how synapses form is very important to
understanding brain function,'' said Stephen Smith, a professor in
the Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology at Stanford
University School of Medicine. ``Somehow, trillions of circuits get
wired up in the brain, and that's what allows the brain to do what
it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in Smith's lab at Stanford, Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratories in New York and the Friedrich Miescher Institute in
Basel, Switzerland, have all produced stunning time-delayed images
showing the submicroscopic dendrites in action. A sample of such
video can be seen at San Francisco's Exploratorium museum, part of
a current exhibit on memory.
</P>
<P>
   This was no easy feat considering the dimensions involved _ some
dendritic spines measure less than a micron, or a millionth of a
meter, in width.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss researchers used a green fluorescent material derived
from jellyfish to tag a protein called actin, which helps muscles
contract. Results showed actin also concentrates in dendritic
spines, helping them to move and change shape.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting pictures make the knobby spines look like glowing,
pulsating Christmas tree bulbs clinging to the spidery outer
branches of the nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Each ``pulse'' corresponds to a physical change in the anatomy
of the nerve cell. This happens ``faster than almost anyone
imagined,'' in the space of a half-second or less, said Andrew
Matus, one of the Swiss researchers.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``almost anyone'' because noted molecular biologist
Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the DNA double helix, suspected
long ago that dendritic spines might ``twitch'' for reasons then
unknown. Now, Matus said, there is photographic evidence suggesting
that ``Crick's general idea turns out to be absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have been making headway in identifying the
even smaller structures found within the dendritic spines.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologist Kristen Harris of Children's Hospital and Harvard
Medical School in Boston reported on the latest such work during a
recent Society for Neuroscience meeting in Los Angeles. She
suggested that dendrites and their mysterious ornaments come in
different species, with varied shapes and internal features,
possibly because they all have different functions.
</P>
<P>
   In one set of experiments, drugs were applied to thin brain
slices from laboratory animals in order to block synaptic activity.
Results showed a sudden bloom of dendritic spines, as if nerve
cells had sent out search parties for the missing signals.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been shown that after excessive brain activity, such
as in epileptic seizures, large numbers of dendritic spines
disappear. One explanation could be that the brain tries to
maintain a certain optimal level of activity by regulating the
number of connecting sites, sending out or retracting dendritic
spines as needed. An absence of dendritic spines has also been
found in brain autopsies of schizophrenics.
</P>
<P>
   Just what happens to make them appear or disappear is still
being investigated. But it is all part of a new view of the central
nervous system as an astonishingly malleable thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of dynamics in the architecture,'' Smith said.
``The more we look, the more it seems there are dynamic processes
going on at many levels.''

 &HT;    BCS might modify big-bowl criteria
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Fans had a number complaints about the new Bowl
Championship Series (BCS) this season, but one most-often heard was
that the system gave automatic slots in the big bowls to teams like
Syracuse (8-3) simply because they were conference champions.
</P>
<P>
   SEC commissioner Roy Kramer said Monday that the BCS might
discuss modifying that stance in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always felt it was important to take care of the
conference champions because those titles should mean something,''
Kramer said in an address before the Football Writers Association
of America. Kramer also said the BCS might someday consider moving
all four of its games back to New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Rare misses
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Jeff Hall missed a 33-yard field goal on Tennessee's
first possession after the Vols had driven to the Florida State 16.
It was the first time all season that Hall had missed from 35 yards
or less after making nine in a row.... An extra-point try by
Florida State's Sebastian Janikowski was blocked in the second
quarter. It was only the second miss all season for the sophomore
who was the Lou Groza Award winner.
</P>
<P>
   Boos for the VP
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who wants to be the next president of
the United States, may have lost some votes from native
Tennesseans. Gore timed his arrival at Sun Devil Stadium just
perfectly to keep about 100 Volunteers fans from getting to their
seats as they tried to board the stadium elevator. Secret Service
agents blocked off a long corridor leading to the elevators 15
minutes before he arrived and 15 minutes after Gore was safely in
his luxury seat.
</P>
<P>
   Said one angry fan: ``I paid $135 apiece for these tickets. If I
miss the kickoff I'm not going to vote for the guy. I don't care
where he's from!''
</P>
<P>
   Another backup QB
</P>
<P>
   FSU played with backup quarterback Marcus Outzen, who took over
when Chris Weinke suffered a neck injury on Nov. 7. Coming to the
desert with a backup quarterback is nothing new for coach Bobby
Bowden. In 1983 and 1984 FSU played at Arizona State, and in both
games the Seminoles' No. 1 quarterback was knocked out of the game.
Florida State won both games.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee defensive tackle Ron Green was carried off the field
in the first quarter with a sprained knee.... Florida State had two
roughing the kicker penalties in the first half. The second took a
Tennessee field goal off the board and the Vols scored for a 7-0
lead.

DAVIS, ANSTEY HAPPY ABOUT VOTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mavericks guard Hubert Davis joined teammate Chris
Anstey yesterday in blasting the NBA union and saying the players
should accept the league's latest proposal before the season winds
up unceremoniously being canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't make any sense why we're not playing,'' Davis
said. ``I've talked to a lot of NBA guys, and a lot of guys said
they'll take \Rcommissioner David Stern's final offer\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully everyone will wake up and see how lucky we are and
get back on the court. The good part about it is we'll figure out
what's going to happen this week.''
</P>
<P>
   After refusing to let the players vote throughout the heated
negotiations with the NBA owners, union leader Billy Hunter has
relented and will let members vote on commissioner Stern's offer
tomorrow in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Anstey said they can live comfortably with the outcome
of tomorrow's vote, which can possibly save the season. They're
just glad the outcome is finally in the hands of the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes that we don't accept \RStern's offer\S,'' Davis
said, ``then I can accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anstey was one of the first group of NBA players who, early last
month, said the players should vote on whether to accept any of the
NBA offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least now we'll know what every single player in the league
is thinking,'' Anstey said. ``I guess then hopefully we'll get a
season underway by means of a vote. If not, that means the majority
of the players don't want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said if the players vote to not accept his offer, he will
begin working on a league with replacement players. That will
consist of rookies, and players from the Continental Basketball
League and foreign leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds a bit extreme, and it's a bit of a shock coming
out of left field,'' Anstey said. ``You have to take commissioner
Stern serious that there may not be a season. I think he's gone
past trying to use bluff tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and several other players have taken exception to Hunter
and those players on the 19-member executive committee who have
steadfastly referred to Stern's proposal as a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work six months playing basketball, so I don't know what a
bad deal is,'' Davis said. ``The minimum salary is right around
$300,000 \R$272,500\S. I think that's probably a top salary for a
CEO.''

   Davis, who was scheduled to make $645,000 this season, said he
never voted for those 19 players on the executive committee to
represent him in the negotiations. Most of the players on the
committee, including Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, Juwan Howard
and Alonzo Mourning, are represented by powerful agent David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how they got picked,'' Davis said. ``I want
to play, and I can't see how we can't be thankful for where we are.
You've really got to understand how blessed we are.''

VOTE OF UNION MEMBERS IS LATEST PROPOSAL

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Minutes after the NBA owners' Labor
Relations Committee unanimously rejected the players' supposed
``final'' offer last night, players union executive director Billy
Hunter decided to allow a vote of all 450 players on the owners'
latest proposal delivered 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, scheduled tomorrow in New York, could decide the fate
of the 1998-99 NBA season and the general direction of the league.
If the majority votes to accept the owners' proposal, a 45-to-50
game schedule could begin as early as Feb. 1. If players reject the
offer, owners are prepared to vote to cancel the entire season at
their Board of Governors meeting Thursday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be close, real close,'' said a Western
Conference All-Star, who asked to remain anonymous. ``I know there
are some players coming out and calling for this vote or what not.
But a lot of us have been behind the union from the start back in
Las Vegas. It'd be a shame to back down now after coming this far.
But at least now there'll be no mystery. It's all up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern and players like Kevin Willis, Keith
Van Horn and the Mavericks' Hubert Davis have been calling for a
union vote in recent weeks. But until last night, Hunter rested his
strategy with a 19-player negotiating committee of mostly
``high-end'' salary players who continually turned down ownership
offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The player members of the NBPA negotiating committee
previously rejected the NBA's final proposal unanimously,'' Hunter
said last night. ``To assure that the owners understand the level
of player resolve and the degree of opposition to the NBA's onerous
demands, the negotiating committee will convene an all-players'
meeting in New York \Rtomorrow\S, at which time the general
membership will be asked to approve the negotiating committee's
recommendation to reject the NBA's final proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the decision to hold the vote, the season seemed in
desperate peril. With the Thursday deadline Stern set to recommend
canceling the season approaching, owners voted to reject a union
offer and even begin preparations for a 1999-2000 season featuring
replacement players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still very, very far apart,'' said NBA deputy
commissioner Russ Granik. ``We went over their proposal and there's
not any significant differences to make us optimistic. With the
clock ticking like it is, it felt like a step backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Stern, ``This is a terrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA, just months ago the only U.S. professional sports
league to never miss a game because of labor problems, is now a
vote away of becoming the first to cancel an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, over how to divide the league's annual $2 billion
revenue, has already wiped out two months of the season. Granik
said the sides remain at odds over a cap on high-end salaries, the
percentage of revenues paid in player salaries during the last
three years of a six-year deal, a rookie pay scale and salary-cap
exceptions. The key issue remains the percentage of revenue paid to
players, with the sides apart by 7.5 percent over the six years, or
around $225 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the players vote to reject the proposal and this season is
canceled, Stern promised to swiftly begin preparations for a league
of replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not necessarily be a pretty sight early on,'' he
said, ``but if we have to rebuild the league we will.''

DAVIS, ANSTEY HAPPY ABOUT VOTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mavericks guard Hubert Davis joined teammate Chris
Anstey yesterday in blasting the NBA union and saying the players
should accept the league's latest proposal before the season winds
up unceremoniously being canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't make any sense why we're not playing,'' Davis
said. ``I've talked to a lot of NBA guys, and a lot of guys said
they'll take \Rcommissioner David Stern's final offer\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully everyone will wake up and see how lucky we are and
get back on the court. The good part about it is we'll figure out
what's going to happen this week.''
</P>
<P>
   After refusing to let the players vote throughout the heated
negotiations with the NBA owners, union leader Billy Hunter has
relented and will let members vote on commissioner Stern's offer
tomorrow in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Anstey said they can live comfortably with the outcome
of tomorrow's vote, which can possibly save the season. They're
just glad the outcome is finally in the hands of the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes that we don't accept \RStern's offer\S,'' Davis
said, ``then I can accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anstey was one of the first group of NBA players who, early last
month, said the players should vote on whether to accept any of the
NBA offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least now we'll know what every single player in the league
is thinking,'' Anstey said. ``I guess then hopefully we'll get a
season underway by means of a vote. If not, that means the majority
of the players don't want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said if the players vote to not accept his offer, he will
begin working on a league with replacement players. That will
consist of rookies, and players from the Continental Basketball
League and foreign leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds a bit extreme, and it's a bit of a shock coming
out of left field,'' Anstey said. ``You have to take commissioner
Stern serious that there may not be a season. I think he's gone
past trying to use bluff tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and several other players have taken exception to Hunter
and those players on the 19-member executive committee who have
steadfastly referred to Stern's proposal as a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work six months playing basketball, so I don't know what a
bad deal is,'' Davis said. ``The minimum salary is right around
$300,000 \R$272,500\S. I think that's probably a top salary for a
CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who was scheduled to make $645,000 this season, said he
never voted for those 19 players on the executive committee to
represent him in the negotiations. Most of the players on the
committee, including Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, Juwan Howard
and Alonzo Mourning, are represented by powerful agent David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how they got picked,'' Davis said. ``I want
to play, and I can't see how we can't be thankful for where we are.
You've really got to understand how blessed we are.''

U.S. AGREES TO SETTLE DISCRIMINATION CASE WITH BLACK FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for brief inserts in 2nd and 7th grafs.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture has agreed to pay hundreds of
millions of dollars to settle a lawsuit brought by thousands of
black farmers who say the department discriminated against them by
denying loans and other subsidies, representatives of the
department and the farmers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Gray, the department's civil rights director, said the
department will not admit to having discriminated against the
farmers, but will agree that its procedures in handling bias claims
have been flawed. Under the terms of the consent decree, which
could be formally announced as early as Tuesday, the department may
have to pay as much as $300 million and possibly more for claims
dating back 16 years, depending on how many farmers come forward
with claims, Ms. Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Black farmers who have an active discrimination case or who file
an affidavit of discrimination that names specific individuals in
the department who denied them loans will be eligible for $50,000
tax-free, and will have all their debts to the Agriculture
Department forgiven, said John Boyd Jr., president of the National
Black Farmers Association, which filed the 1997 lawsuit that led to
the settlement. The average debt for most black farmers is between
$75,000 and $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers who have better documentation of bias can forgo the
$50,000 award and negotiate higher awards with an outside
arbitrator, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 farmers around the country are part of the
class-action lawsuit, Boyd said, and another 1,000 to 2,000 farmers
are likely to file claims once the settlement is announced. The
majority are likely to claim the $50,000 award, he said, as they
lack the explicit proof of discrimination necessary to get a larger
arbitrator's award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous victory for black farmers across the
nation,'' said Boyd, whose group represents about 60,000 farmers
and their family and other supporters. ``We met with the president.
We tied a mule to the White House gate. We lobbied Congress. And
finally farmers are getting some relief for the way they were
treated in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, when the Reagan administration abolished the
Agriculture Department's Office of Civil Rights, many of the
nation's 18,000 black farmers _about 80 percent of whom are in the
South _ have complained that they have been denied loans and
subsidies simply because they are black. While they have watched
white farmers in their counties receive thousands of dollars of
loans, the farmers say, they were told by local officials of the
department that the programs have run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried for nine years to get a farm operating loan,'' said
Boyd, himself a tobacco farmer from the remote fields of southern
Virginia, near Baskerville. ``Back in 1992, the county supervisor
for the department threw my application in the trash. He said they
didn't have any more money. When the investigator asked him why he
had made only two black farm loans, he said black farmers were
lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the farmers, who originally sought $3 billion, were
able to document that loans to black farmers took far longer to
process than loans to white farmers, and that far more of their
applications were denied. By 1996, when the civil rights office was
restored by the Clinton administration, the department had admitted
that some discrimination had taken place, and that the backlog of
discrimination cases was enormous and in disarray. The department
did not try to justify the higher rate of denials.
</P>
<P>
   Black farmers began to hold large and visible protests in
Washington, at one point tying a mule to the White House fence.
President Clinton met with Boyd and several other leaders in
December 1997 and promised to seek a resolution of the case, and
Congress eventually passed a bill that extended the statute of
limitations in the case beyond the usual two years.
</P>
<P>
   By last October, the path toward a settlement seemed clear,
although the details were still to be worked out. The department's
inspector general issued a report saying the civil rights office
was in disarray, and recommending that an outside body administer
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, when a federal judge ruled that the black
farmers constituted a legitimate class for purposes of the lawsuit
_ a major victory for the farmers _ a spokesman for Dan Glickman,
the agriculture secretary, said the department wanted to resolve
the issue quickly and compensate those who had claims. The case was
scheduled to go to trial next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this goes a long, long way, maybe all the way, toward
resolving the outstanding complaints against the department,'' Ms.
Gray said Monday, ``They were concerned about having their
complaints processed within the department, so the settlement will
allow them to have their concerns processed outside of the
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cash awards, Boyd said his group remains concerned
that many of the department officials who presided over the
original discrimination still have their jobs and will not be
punished under the settlement. Ms. Gray acknowledged that the
settlement does not have a procedure for disciplinary action
against department officials, but said the department would change
its internal procedures for investigating bias claims in a way that
could lead to greater discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already drafted and cleared through the department new
regulations which will allow us, we think, to process complaints in
a more timely fashion,'' she said. ``We certainly have changed some
of our procedures as it relates to our responsibility to follow up
with disciplinary action.''

CLAIBORNE WILL MAKE IT OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC linebacker Chris Claiborne is expected to
announce today that he is forgoing his senior year and will make
himself available for the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne had lunch with USC coach Paul Hackett on Monday but
did not tell Hackett his intentions even though he has already made
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just talked. We had a little meeting,'' Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne said the subject of whether he decided to turn pro
never came up in the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. He didn't ask me,'' Claiborne said. ``He represented his
side. Maybe he wanted to wait (until today).''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne will hold a press conference today at USC to make his
official announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Claiborne has tried to keep his decision secret, he let
his guard down last week in El Paso and said that he intended to
hire an agent soon. A close friend, asked Monday if Claiborne had
made up his mind to turn pro, said his decision was so obvious,
``don't try to break your neck figuring this one out.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne said Monday that he is ``leaning heavily to one side
of the coin.''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting choice of words, since he will make millions if
he is one of the top five draft picks, as he has been projected by
some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign Claiborne is leaving: He said Monday that he did
not believe he could raise his NFL stock by returning for another
season.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne attended Monday's USC-Arizona basketball game with
former teammate Brian Kelly, who plays for the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   What about Soward? USC is hopeful that wide receiver R. Jay
Soward will also attend today's press conference and announce that
he is staying.
</P>
<P>
   Soward told his father after the Sun Bowl last week he was
returning for his senior year, but USC would prefer an official
statement before Friday's NFL deadline for underclassmen to state
their intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Postseason bowl trips: Free safety Rashard Cook has accepted an
invitation to play in the Hula Bowl on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Ken Bowen will play in the All-Star Gridiron
Classic in Florida, which pits a team of Florida players against
players from across the country.
