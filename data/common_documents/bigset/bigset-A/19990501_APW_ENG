<HEADLINE> Jarrett Still Seeks 1st Season Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Nine races, no wins.  
</P>
<P>
	That's the frustrating score for Dale Jarrett, who heads into  
Sunday's California 500 still looking for the 19th win of his 
Winston Cup career. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett had plenty of time to think about it Friday as rain  
washed away the opening day of practice and qualifying for Sunday's 
race at California Speedway. NASCAR planned to qualify the entire 
43-car field in one session of time trials sandwiched between two 
one-hour practice periods today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it has been frustrating because we're fortunate that  
in the last few years we have won some races,'' Jarrett said. ``I 
like to think that when we get down into the last few laps of a 
race that I know how to take care of business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't done that this year and I've had a couple of  
opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those came last Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway, where  
Jarrett posted his third runner-up finish of the season. His Robert 
Yates Racing Ford trailing Dale Earnhardt's Chevrolet across the 
line by about two car-lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I had myself in position, but I also realized that  
there wasn't a Ford out there that got in front and stayed there 
very long. And there were too many good cars behind me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like on that particular day my chance was going to come  
with help and trying to make a pass at the end,'' Jarrett added. 
``I just never got that opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that Jarrett can take solace in is the fact that, even  
though he isn't among the seven drivers who have posted at least 
one win in the first nine races, he is second in the standings, 
trailing Jeff Burton by just 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
	A crash in the season opener in Daytona cost Jarrett a  
37th-place finish. Since then, his only finishes out of the top 
five have been 11th in Las Vegas and eighth in Martinsville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel much better about our race team and our chances to win  
right now than I did say five or six races ago,'' Jarrett said. 
``Back then, we were finishing OK, but really weren't performing 
that well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few weeks, we've performed much better and I think  
we're ready to get into Victory Lane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett is certainly hoping that improvement in performance  
translates into a good finish Sunday on the 2-mile oval where he 
struggled last year. 
</P>
<P>
	After crashing in qualifying last year, Jarrett started 36th. He  
was moving steadily through the field before an engine failure 
relegated him to 41st place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I really like this racetrack,'' said Jarrett, who  
finished eighth in 1997 in the inaugural Winston Cup race at the 
California track. ``It's extremely fast, but there are a couple of 
grooves here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found a groove here last year near the top of the track and  
found a very fast way around before we had our engine problem. It's 
a wide track that's going to let you have fun racing.''

<HEADLINE> Colts' Draft Pick Burlsworth Buried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISON, Ark. (AP) -- On the day he was supposed to be picking  
out wedding rings with his fiancee, Brandon Burlsworth was buried. 
</P>
<P>
	A third-round draft choice last month, he was supposed to be  
getting ready to play for the Indianapolis Colts, blocking for 
Peyton Manning and opening holes for running backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Burlsworth, 22, was killed in a traffic accident last Wednesday  
as the 6-foot-3, 318-pound lineman drove from working out at the 
University of Arkansas in Fayetteville to his home in Harrison, a 
city of about 11,000. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 mourners gathered Saturday at the Harrison High  
School auditorium. Two rows of flowers ran the length of the 
basketball court. More than 100 members of Burlsworth's family were 
present and players from Harrison's football team wore their blue 
and yellow jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	Others there included Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles,  
Razorbacks coach Houston Nutt, former Arkansas coach Danny Ford and 
Baltimore Colts president Bill Polian. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of Burlsworth's former Arkansas teammates served as  
pallbearers, along with one friend from his high school. Many more 
of his Arkansas teammates were in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	On stage near the casket was Burlsworth's No. 66 Colts jersey  
with a framed picture of him, depicting the player wearing his 
trademark black-rimmed glasses and crewcut. A Colts helmet was on 
the stage as was a collage of photographs of Burlsworth's life and 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Razorbacks program announced Friday that university  
officials would retire the number 77 that Burlsworth wore for 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	But Burlsworth had more to his life than football. He had a  
master's degree in business administration and was the first 
Arkansas player in school history to get an advanced degree before 
playing his last game. He started as a walk-on and grew to the 
anchor of the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	He was preparing to marry Heather Nichols.  
</P>
<P>
	Burlsworth's hometown preacher, the Rev. Arlis Thrasher, said  
the couple was to have spent Saturday picking out wedding rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners viewed a highlight tape of Burlsworth's play. On the  
tape, he delivered crushing blocks to protect quarterback Clint 
Stoerner and punched holes in defensive lines for Arkansas running 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison High School football coach Tommy Tice recalled that  
Burlsworth started slow, but his character carried him through. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I welcomed him into that weight room ... he was  
a gangly awkward sophomore, who we used a sun dial to time the 
40-yard dash. But that heart and desire is what separated him from 
the others,'' Tice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tice said Burlsworth got to the weight room early -- often  
arriving before the coaches -- and stayed late. 
</P>
<P>
	Tice said he encouraged Burlsworth to accept scholarship offers  
from smaller schools when he was a senior. ``He told me, Coach, I 
want to be a Razorback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nutt mixed amusing stories about Burlsworth in his emotional  
talk. He said teammates would tease Burlsworth about his glasses, 
and Burlsworth would respond, ``I got to see what I hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nutt said Burlsworth's respect from teammates was evident in  
that he was elected captain by a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	``He not only lived his life right, he lived right every single  
day,'' Nutt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Huckabee sent a letter to the Burlsworth family. It  
spoke of how much Huckabee had enjoyed watching Burlsworth play, 
but even more Huckabee's letter commended Burlsworth family for the 
way he was raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Polian said Burlsworth was ``a shining example'' to others.  
</P>
<P>
	``As we got to know Brandon ... it was evident he was embarking  
on a long and successful NFL career.'' Polian said. ``Others will 
play guard for us, but we won't replace Burlsworth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tice said the school will go ahead with plans it made before  
Burlsworth's death to hold a day in his honor next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to retire his high school jersey. ... It is not  
the type ending to the story that I wanted,'' Tice said.

<HEADLINE> Moore Eyes Bosch Grand Prix Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAZARETH, Pa. (AP) -- It didn't matter that only two drivers got  
around tricky Nazareth Speedway faster than Greg Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	The CART points leader, foremost among critics of the  
aerodynamic package that has slowed the cars by more than 12 mph, 
thinks smaller wings will make for a caution-filled race that will 
be anything but a crowd pleaser. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the pace car may lead more laps than the winner,'' he  
said after practice Friday for Sunday's Bosch Grand Prix. ``Running 
here with so little downforce will be a dicey situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Moore, whose fast lap in a Mercedes-powered Reynard was  
169.080, has a plan for winning the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good pit stops,'' he said. ``There's not going to be much  
passing, so we'll do our passing in the pits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way the cars were running, with the fast lap of Helio  
Castro-Neves at 172.357 in contrast to Patrick Carpentier's 1998 
record qualifying speed of 184.896, Moore might not have many to 
pass Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Between Castro-Neves and Moore on the speed chart is Mark  
Blundell. He also is unhappy with the wings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to run 5,000 pounds of downforce here,'' he said.  
``Now we're running 2,000 less. It took me 10 laps just get decent 
tire pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro-Neves so much faster than the rest with his Mercedes  
engine, is less concerned about the wings, downsized this year on 
the short ovals because CART thought the cars needed to be slowed 
in the interest of safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's bothering me a little less than the other  
guys,'' he said of his laps in one of only two Lola chassis in the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	But he stopped short of saying he preferred the smaller wings.  
</P>
<P>
	Had he done so, Bryan Herta might have wondered about him.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they tell you they like them, they're lying,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Richie Hearn, like Herta far down on the speed chart, said he  
knew the wings would be a problem. But he didn't know just how bad 
they could get. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car is bad enough on its own,'' he said. ``But it's  
horrible in traffic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell's Reynard-Mercedes was much better, but he could see  
Hearn's point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running by yourself is great, but running in the draft is very  
difficult,'' Blundell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore noticed that, but said drivers can't back down because a  
loss of momentum while following a car will make it virtually 
impossible to pass. He figures that will translate into countless 
mistakes and a dull race where no one will take any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to watch carnage, sure, it will be entertaining,''  
Moore said. ``If you want to watch follow-the-leader, it'll be very 
entertaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-fastest in practice was rookie sensation Juan Montoya,  
making his debut on an oval track. The 23-year-old Colombian, a 
winner two weekends ago in Long Beach, Calif., went 168.828. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time Bosch Grand Prix winner Paul Tracy was next at 168.711.  
Adrian Fernandez, Christian Fittipaldi, Patrick Carpentier, 
Mauricio Gugelmin and two-time Nazareth winner Michael Andretti 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Jimmy Vasser was 15th.

<HEADLINE> McDougal To Attend Steele Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Susan McDougal's lawyer says she plans to  
attend the opening of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's latest 
case, the trial of a Virginia woman who provided helpful testimony 
for Mrs. McDougal a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection begins Monday in Alexandria, Va., for Julie Hiatt  
Steele, who is accused of obstructing Starr's investigation into 
the allegation by Kathleen Willey that President Clinton made an 
unwanted sexual advance toward her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Susan will be there front row center Monday morning in support  
of Julie,'' said McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos. He and his client 
were in Washington this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyer, Nancy Luque, has not sought to call Mrs.  
McDougal as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers argued unsuccessfully in pretrial  
proceedings that Starr's office made a series of misrepresentations 
in order to trick Ms. Steele into making statements for which she 
subsequently was indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	In a risky move for a criminal defendant about to go on trial,  
Ms. Steele took the witness stand last month on behalf of Mrs. 
McDougal, who was being prosecuted in Little Rock, Ark., for 
refusing to testify to a grand jury in Starr's probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele maintained that she was prosecuted by Starr because  
she wouldn't support Mrs. Willey's account of the unwanted sexual 
advance by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	A juror in McDougal's trial later said he found Ms. Steele's  
testimony compelling and that it gave added credibility to Mrs. 
McDougal's story that she was frightened of Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal maintained she was prosecuted because she refused  
to falsely implicate the Clintons in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was acquitted on an obstruction count while the  
jury deadlocked on two criminal contempt charges. Starr is 
considering whether to seek a retrial on the two contempt charges.

<HEADLINE> Families of Captured Soldiers Happy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For more than a month, they have kept the most American of  
vigils, with yellow ribbons, readied suitcases and tear-rimmed 
hopes for their captive soldier sons. 
</P>
<P>
	So while reports remained unofficial today that Steven Gonzales,  
Andrew Ramirez and Christopher Stone would soon be released by 
Serbian forces, those closest to them were hopeful the waiting was 
nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just thank God so much for answering our prayers,'' Rosie  
Gonzales, Gonzales' mother, told reporters in Huntsville, Texas. 
``We can't wait to hold him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Gilbert, said the family ``can't wait to watch (the  
soldiers) get on the bus and get out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales, 22, Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles and Christopher Stone,  
25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., were taken captive March 31 while 
patrolling the Yugoslav-Macedonia border as part of a peacekeeping 
mission, seven days after NATO launched its bombing campaign in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday, families were yet to be told officially that the  
three would be freed, despite statements by the Rev. Jesse Jackson 
that the soldiers would travel Sunday to Croatia with his 
delegation. Jackson met with the soldiers on Friday in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say we're very happy,'' said Dorcas Reliford, the  
mother-in-law of Stone's sister, from her home near Smiths Creek. 
``We're waiting for confirmation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, Kathy Ross, a spokeswoman for Vivian Ramirez,  
Andrew's mother, expressed caution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The family is just kind of waiting until they know something  
concrete,'' Ms. Ross said. ``It has not gone at all through 
government channels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ross said the Ramirez family will not comment until they  
receive official word of his release. 
</P>
<P>
	But hope infused neighbors who came to teh Ramirez home, many  
bearing flowers. ``I feel wonderful now,'' said Lala Szalonek, 72, 
who brought a brimming vase. ``I'm excited. I'm shaking inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tricia Stone, Stone's wife, was ``packed and ready to go'' in  
the event of her husband's release, said her stepmother, Lisa 
McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is praying and she is very hopeful that it is true,'' she  
said. Mrs. Stone and the couple's 4-year-old son, Ryan, have been 
staying with Ms. McKinney in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Capac, Mich., near Stone's hometown, Linda Eldred spent the  
day adorning her downtown floral-and-gift shop with new yellow bows 
-- and making many more to give away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't known that kind of excitement since my brother and  
husband came home from Vietnam,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Race Spectators Killed by Debris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Three spectators were killed and at least  
eight injured when struck by debris that flew into the stands after 
a three-car crash in the VisionAire 500 Indy Racing League event 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators sitting in the area where the crash occurred said a  
tire and suspension parts flew into the fourth-turn grandstands at 
Lowe's Motor Speedway and struck the spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway officials early Sunday identified two of the spectators  
killed as Randy D. Pyatte, 21, and Jeff Patton, no age available, 
both of Connelly Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Area hospitals reported treating at least eight people,  
including one child who was in critical condition. Hailey McGee, 9, 
of Conover, was flown to Carolinas Medical Center in nearby 
Charlotte with bruises to her brain and lungs. Also flown to 
Carolinas was Jeremy Jones, no age given, of Connelly Springs. He 
was listed in serious condition with a chest injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Three adults flown to University Hospital in Charlotte were  
listed in good condition. Wesley J. Rice, 29, of Newton, had a 
stomach injury; Matthew J. Picklesimer, 26, of Claremont, had a 
head laceration, and Amanda R. Shondelmyer, 11, Hickory, had a head 
laceration and an injured right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the injured were transported by ambulance to Northeast  
Medical Center in Concord. Nathaniel Blosser, 19, of Hickory, was 
treated for a puncture wound and released and David Duncan, 27, of 
Newton, was treated for a shoulder injury and also released. Chad 
Duncan, 22, of Conover, David's brother, was held overnight because 
of a leg injury but hospital officials said he likely would be 
released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	As rescue workers were attending to the injured, the track  
canceled the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrible thing,'' said speedway president H.A.  
``Humpy'' Wheeler, who went into the stands where the debris landed 
and tried to comfort some of the spectators. ``It's very 
regrettable. It's something we'll live with for a very, very long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety minutes after the crash, the nearly 50,000 spectators had  
filed out of the track and investigators were working at the 
accident scene, taking measurements and roping off the area. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1.5-mile superspeedway's sprawling infield, about 200  
drivers and crew members gathered for a somber prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``My teammates and I are just full of sorrow,'' 1998  
Indianapolis 500 winner Eddie Cheever said. ``Our thoughts and 
prayers are with the individuals and families. The decision to stop 
the race was the right one. We all leave Charlotte with extremely 
heavy hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul Jr. and Stan Wattles slammed hard into the fourth-turn  
retaining wall on lap 61 of the 208-lap event and went spinning 
down the front stretch, collecting the car of Scott Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	Television replays could not show conclusively what kind of  
debris flew into the stands. But Joe Tiano, a Hickory resident who 
was sitting about 150 feet away in a neighboring section of stands, 
said a wheel and suspension parts flew into the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came up here like a rocket and then started bouncing  
around,'' Tiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities cleared the section of the stands and the race was  
red-flagged while emergency workers attended to the injured. While 
medical personnel worked, track security employees stood around 
them holding up white sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody who was taking pictures had their cameras taken away  
by the cops,'' Tiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the spectators who died was sitting in the 15th row, and  
the other two appeared to be about 10 rows higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes of the crash, the three drivers were examined at  
the infield care center and released, and about 15 minutes later, 
Wheeler went on the public address system to tell fans the race was 
being canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never done anything like this before,'' Wheeler said.  
``But it seemed like the right thing to do in respect to those who 
lost their lives up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was similar to an accident last July in which three  
spectators were killed by debris after a racing crash at Michigan 
International Speedway. The track later increased the height of its 
catch fences by 2 1/2 feet, to 17 feet, in an effort to prevent a 
recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte's catch fences were raised to 15 feet in 1997 in  
preparation for the track getting its first IRL race. Charlotte has 
been holding NASCAR Winston Cup races since it opened in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler and IRL founder Tony George, who joined him at a hastily  
arranged news conference after the race was canceled, said they 
were unsure from which car the tire came. The cars of both Wattles 
and Paul were missing tires after the crash, but Wattles' impact 
occurred the closest to where the spectators were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts go out to everyone up in the stands,'' Wattles said  
after he was released from the infield care center. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the first spectator fatalities in the history of the  
track and the IRL, which was founded in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte allows spectators to sit in all rows of the track's  
seats for Winston Cup races, but for IRL races the speedway bans 
fans from sitting in the bottom seven rows closest to the racing 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Charlotte's been one of the leaders in protecting and  
taking care of their spectators,'' said Leo Mehl, executive 
director of the IRL.

<HEADLINE> Florida OKs School Voucher Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The nation's only statewide program to  
let students attend private schools at taxpayer expense is being 
praised as a historic reform -- and denigrated as the ruin of 
Florida's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Legislature on Friday sent a bill creating the voucher  
program to Gov. Jeb Bush, who had made the program a centerpiece of 
his campaign and one of his top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an effort to improve public schools, but it's also a  
recognition that when there's chronic failure it's just morally 
right to provide parents other options,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, all students in the worst public schools,  
regardless of their income or their grades, will be eligible for 
vouchers ranging from $3,000 to $25,000 a year to help pay for 
private or parochial school tuition. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools will be graded A, B, C, D or F, based on student  
performance. Students in schools that get a failing grade will be 
entitled to go to private school. The tax money will be taken out 
of public education. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents have threatened to sue, claiming it will destroy  
public education and violate the constitutional separation of 
church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bigger threat than any kid walking into a school with a gun  
is the Republican legislature putting all the schools under siege 
with vouchers,'' said Democratic Rep. Les Miller, minority leader 
of the Florida House. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores in only four of Florida's 3,000 public schools are now so  
bad they would qualify. But with tougher standards approved last 
year, the number of flunking schools could climb to 170. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee and Cleveland have started voucher programs in recent  
years. Vermont has allowed tax dollars to be spent for private 
school tuition in rural areas for more than a century. Maine has a 
program similar to Vermont's. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's Constitution specifically prohibits using taxpayer  
dollars to aid religion, said the Rev. Barry Lynn, executive 
director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand how voucher supporters could read the clear  
and unambiguous language of their state constitution and still 
think they can get away with this stunt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington-based Institute for Justice, which has intervened  
in courts on behalf of school choice programs elsewhere, has 
promised to defend Florida's program. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first money-back guarantee for public schools,''  
said Clint Bolick, the organization's litigation director. ``This 
program is a national model for school reform, and Gov. Jeb Bush 
deserves enormous credit for his vision and courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Russell, president of the Florida State Conference of  
Branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People, said his organization will try to block the program. Other 
opponents include the Florida PTA, the state's two teacher unions 
and the American Civil Liberties Union.

	U.S. POWs Close To Freedom  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson traveled to Yugoslavia  
to win the freedom of three U.S. POWs, and that is exactly what he 
did. Jackson is to escort the three soldiers to Croatia -- and 
freedom -- on Sunday. Jackson will also carry a letter from Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to President Clinton outlining steps 
to stop the conflict over Kosovo. Jackson said it includes a 
stunning offer by Milosevic to meet face-to-face with Clinton. 
Meanwhile, U.S. officials reacted cautiously to news that the three 
soldiers might be freed.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Dozens of people were killed today  
when a NATO missile struck a civilian bus crossing a bridge in 
Yugoslavia today, news reports and witnesses said. The private Beta 
news agency reported 60 people dead while the state-run Tanjug 
agency said 40 people had been killed. Pentagon officials said they 
could not confirm the reports, and NATO had no immediate comment on 
the attack.

to refugees from Kosovo. The first group of about 400 people is 
expected to arrive Tuesday at Fort Dix. A total of 2,000 to 3,000 
refugees are expected in coming weeks. The refugees will stay one 
to two weeks while arrangements are made for them to live with 
relatives or other sponsors. Of an estimated 500,000 ethnic 
Albanians in the United States, more than 200,000 are in the New

meeting, thousands of opponents circled outside. Officials of the 
nation's largest group of gun owners -- at 2.8 million members -- 
refused to cancel the meeting despite requests from Mayor 
Wellington Webb and other local officials. ``We will not be silent

panicked and scrambled for life preservers as it took on water and 
sank suddenly on Lake Hamilton near this popular tourist town, the 
city manager said. The dead included three children. The driver of 
the boat was among the survivors. Twenty people were on board and 
none were wearing life preservers, officials said. The boat sank in 
one or two minutes as it cruised less than a mile offshore, the 
city manager said.

	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization was deadlocked today  
as it made a desperate push to agree on a new director-general and 
avert a leadership vacuum at a crucial time for the global economy. 
At a bad-tempered meeting of the WTO's decision-making general 
council, supporters of former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore 
clashed with backers of Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai 
Panitchpakdi. The deadlock made it increasingly likely that the WTO 
would have to function without a leader. Yesterday, Italy's Renato

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Election a Tight Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- It is an election made for conservatives.  
</P>
<P>
	Voters headed to the polls today to choose from among seven  
Republicans and two Democrats seeking the 1st Congressional 
District seat once held by Bob Livingston. A May 29 runoff was 
expected between the top two finishers. 
</P>
<P>
	The only independent poll conducted so far shows a close race  
between former Gov. Dave Treen, ophthalmologist Monica Monica and 
state Rep. David Vitter, all Republicans. They are the favorites, 
but it was the campaign of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke 
that attracted attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke placed a distant fourth in the poll of registered voters  
living in the middle class suburban New Orleans district with an 85 
percent white population. But he claims to have a huge pool of 
committed ``silent voters'' who rarely admit their support to 
pollsters. 
</P>
<P>
	After bombarding voters with phone messages against the Kwanzaa  
holiday and the creation of a stamp honoring Malcolm X, Duke 
appeared in television spots criticizing federal laws that ban 
segregation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know that forced integration has been a disaster for  
our communities and schools,'' Duke says in the ad. ``We need at 
least one man in Congress to stand up for our heritage and 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Louisiana's open primary system, all nine candidates are  
on the same ballot. Voters don't have to cast ballots along party 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate has been dominated by talk of who is the most  
conservative, and there has been considerable sniping. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen supports public executions for drug dealers. One long shot  
hopeful brags that he is a 33-year-old virgin. All are for lower 
taxes and increased military spending. Most oppose abortion and 
more restrictions on gun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica says her father loved her so much he gave her the same  
name twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston announced his resignation in December after admitting  
marital infidelities, although he was designated House 
Speaker-elect. He has endorsed Treen.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters Celebrate Hoffa Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teamsters are gathering for a ceremonial  
inauguration for James P. Hoffa, sworn in last month as president 
of the union once led by his late father, Jimmy Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters  
were expected at Saturday's event. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa was sworn in March 22 after a federal judge affirmed his  
December victory over Tom Leedham, who ran a candidate of the 
union's reform wing. Balloting was held after a campaign finance 
scandal overturned Ron Carey's 1996 re-election. Carey was barred 
from the rerun. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've indicated long ago that as long as President Hoffa keeps  
his pledge to work in the interests of Teamster members, I would 
support him,'' Leedham said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he doesn't keep that pledge, myself and thousands of  
Teamsters are going to hold his feet to the fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The election was held under federal supervision as part of the  
union's deal with the Justice Department almost a decade ago to 
help loosen the grip of organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Election officer Michael Cherkasky certified the results of  
Hoffa's victory in January. However, he barred one of Hoffa's 
running mates from taking office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa's father, Jimmy Hoffa, rose to the top of what was in 1957  
the nation's largest union. He remained in power for a decade until 
he was sent to prison for jury-tampering and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Hoffa was an effective and highly popular labor leader  
who allegedly had close ties to organized crime. Jimmy Hoffa 
disappeared in 1975 and is presumed dead, a victim of Mafia 
infighting. 
</P>
<P>
	He rose through the ranks of the Teamsters from his job as a  
warehouseman while his son has worked for the 1.4 million-member 
union as a labor lawyer in Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Fewer Books Bought in '98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Adults in the United States bought 30 million  
fewer books in 1998 than the year before, according to a new 
consumer survey. The apparent culprit is a good economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Book buying seems to react counter-cyclically to the  
economy,'' said Sandra Paul, an official with the Book Industry 
Study Group, which announced its survey Friday at BookExpo America, 
the publishing industry's annual national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``In good times, consumers seem to spend their money on other  
kinds of entertainment or on more expensive durable goods. In 
tighter economic times, consumers once again think about books,'' 
Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the BISG, adults bought 1.04 billion books last  
year, compared to 1.07 billion in 1997. It was the first such 
decline since the BISG started tracking adult purchases in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of that loss comes from fewer purchases from book clubs and  
independent booksellers, according to the BISG. 
</P>
<P>
	But the survey arrives soon after the Association of American  
Publishers announced a 6 percent increase in publishers' dollar 
sales from 1997. The Census Bureau, meanwhile, has reported a 2.6 
percent increase in bookstore dollar sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation could explain the increase in dollar sales even as the  
total number of book sales declined, but there may be other 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The BISG survey does not include sales to schools, libraries or  
businesses. It also does not include sales of children's books or 
track purchases on college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done everything we can,'' Paul said when asked if the  
figures were reliable. The study group's findings are widely read 
within the publishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey is based on diaries from 16,000 households.

<HEADLINE> Another Air Force Satellite Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A military communication satellite  
was stuck in an orbit thousands of miles too low today following 
the third failed mission in a row for the Air Force's premier 
rocket. The fiascoes have cost taxpayers $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we have three failures in a row of any system ...  
something is not right,'' said Brig. Gen. Randy Starbuck, who is in 
charge of Cape Canaveral Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
	The $800 million Milstar satellite never made it to its intended  
22,300-mile-high perch Friday. Instead, it circled Earth in a 
lonely, lopsided orbit that reached no more than 3,100 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials said they're not sure what went wrong. The  
preliminary indication was that the Titan IV rocket did its job 
during the first several minutes of the launch, but that the upper 
stage needed to propel the satellite higher did not fire properly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, we do not know and we're not going to  
speculate,'' Starbuck said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force controllers will try to boost the satellite using  
on-board fuel and thrusters. 
</P>
<P>
	A different type of upper-stage motor malfunctioned three weeks  
ago, leaving a missile-warning satellite in a useless orbit 
following its launch aboard a Titan IV. And last August, a Titan IV 
rocket and the spy satellite on board were destroyed in a midair 
explosion less than a minute into the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Starbuck said there appears to be no similarities among the  
three failures. ``But we will continue to look for those and if 
there is one, we'll find that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force will not launch any rockets until the problem is  
understood, Starbuck said. Boeing already has delayed the launch of 
its new Delta III rocket from Sunday to Tuesday -- or possibly later 
-- so engineers can make sure there are no links with the latest 
Titan IV trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been decades since the same kind of rocket failed three  
times in a row. The Titan IV, the nation's most powerful unmanned 
rocket, has been flying since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department's newest Milstar satellite was to have  
joined two less sophisticated Milstars already in orbit. In all, 
the Air Force planned six such satellites to provide secure, 
jam-proof communication between U.S. military commanders and troops 
in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials stressed that Friday's mishap will not  
hamper military communication or national security. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milstar program was criticized by the General Accounting  
Office last fall as outdated and inefficient. The satellites were 
conceived during the Cold War and designed to withstand the 
radiation from a nuclear blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin Corp. built the satellite as well as the Titan  
IV rocket.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Try To Grow Brain Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Scientists want to fix the things that go wrong  
inside your head. Their plan: Grow replacement parts for broken 
brains. 
</P>
<P>
	They make it sound easy. Just brew a batch of gray matter. Drill  
a hole in the skull. Put in the new stuff. Wire it up like the 
original. 
</P>
<P>
	Voila! New brains.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite its whiff of mad scientist run amok, this scenario is  
surprisingly close to reality. Researchers can already do amazing 
things with mouse brains. And as they so fondly and frequently 
point out, mice really are an awful lot like us. 
</P>
<P>
	Some human experiments already hint at what's possible. Since  
the 1980s, doctors have cautiously tested transferring brain cells 
from aborted fetuses to victims of Parkinson's disease. For some, 
it seems to work remarkably well, restoring lost control of 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	But to those on the cusp of this new technology, Parkinson's is  
almost too easy. It involves the death of just one small bit of 
material, the brain cells that make the message-carrying 
neurotransmitter dopamine. 
</P>
<P>
	No, they have their sights on much more complicated targets. In  
the years to come, they see the possibility of rewiring broken 
spines, patching up strokes, correcting multiple sclerosis, undoing 
inherited metabolic disorders, maybe even rebuilding the wrecked 
brains of Alzheimer's disease victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean not just putting in cells to produce a neurotransmitter  
or make a little local connection,'' explains Dr. Jeffrey Macklis 
of Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. ``I 
mean really rewiring complex circuitry in the brain. Ten years ago, 
this would have been considered totally crazy. Five years ago, it 
would have been a little bonkers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macklis goes on to talk about his mice, the critters of choice  
for those who study such things. When immature cells are 
transplanted under precisely the right conditions, they migrate 
across the animals' tiny damaged brains. They take root in just the 
spots where they are needed. They morph into the exact brands of 
cells that are missing. They connect up with other parts of the 
brain. In short, they seem to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mice brains are fundamentally not that different from  
humans','' says Macklis. ``The idea of using immature cells and 
guiding their differentiation to rebuild complex circuitry is no 
longer crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, human fetuses were the only source of brain  
material for such jobs, but they were never ideal. Doctors' qualms 
go beyond the ethical thickets of recycling aborted material. 
Fetuses will always be in short supply; it takes several to treat 
just one patient. And quality is hard to control, especially 
considering that many were aborted for a reason, such as genetic 
abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
	But now scientists seem certain that transplanting brain  
material -- what they call cell therapy -- is about to become 
practical. The reason is the discovery of entirely new reservoirs 
of brain material. At dozens of universities and biotech firms, 
they are developing three main varieties -- animal brains, cancerous 
growths and the tissue wellspring called stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	One of these sources can be found at a gleaming biomedical lab  
off a country road about 60 miles west of Boston. The first thing 
that makes the place seem a little odd is the technicians' get-ups: 
green surgical scrubs with knee-high black rubber boots. Then 
there's the smell. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite fans that turn over the air 19 times an hour and filter  
it cleaner than an operating room's, the lab carries a certain 
barnyard redolence, an unmistakable eau de pig. This lab is also a 
barn, home to 65 or so grunting, rooting animals. But the end 
product is brain parts, not pork chops. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is literally the cleanest pig facility on the face of the  
earth,'' says David Boucher, the veterinary technician who makes 
sure the walls sparkle, the germs stay far away and the animals 
themselves enjoy unpiglike spotlessness. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be the world's most expensive pig facility, too. The  
275-pound Yorkshire sows -- ``the girls,'' Boucher affectionately 
calls them -- cost between $20,000 and $30,000 apiece to raise this 
way. However, the price will fall dramatically if pig cells are 
approved for routine human medical use, and production scales up. 
</P>
<P>
	When it's time for a still-experimental transplant, the  
technicians kill three artificially inseminated pigs that have been 
pregnant exactly 27 days. Then they surgically remove their 
fetuses. (Killing the sows, they say, is the only way to get the 
unborn pigs out antiseptically.) It takes the brains of 26 pig 
fetuses to gather 48 million dopamine-producing cells, enough for 
one person with Parkinson's. The cells are shipped to a hospital, 
and less than 72 hours later, they are inside someone's brain. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, these pig cells have been tested on 20 people with  
Parkinson's, six with epilepsy and six with Huntington's disease. 
Of the first 11 Parkinson's patients treated, three improved 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt this can work and produce tremendous  
benefit,'' says Dr. Greg Stewart of Genzyme, which is developing 
the treatment with Diacrin, another biotech firm. 
</P>
<P>
	While the supply of fetal pig cells is not a problem, there are  
other drawbacks. Patients may need to take immune-suppressing drugs 
to keep their bodies from rejecting the tissue, and there is a 
remote chance that dangerous animal viruses might be passed along. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's an elegant way to solve the problem,'' says  
Dr. Michael Levesque of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	A bit more elegant, perhaps, is a method being tested at the  
University of Pittsburgh. Doctors there are experimentally 
transplanting human cells into the brains of stroke victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The cells are similar to stem cells, the factories that  
manufacture various kinds of tissue inside the body. But there's a 
catch: These cells began as cancer, grown in test tubes from a 
22-year-old's testicular tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	The transplants are being tested on 12 stroke victims. All  
suffer paralysis or other serious disability, even though the 
strokes destroyed only a small bit of their brain tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Three seem to have improved. One walks better, another is less  
stiff, while a third has better control of arm and leg movements. 
Are the extra cells responsible? Or is this the natural course of 
recovery? 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Douglas Kondziolka, the surgeon in charge, does not know.  
Still, he says, ``We were hoping for a glimmer of efficacy so we 
could continue on. We've seen even a little more than a glimmer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fixing a stroke, however, is far more challenging than relieving  
Parkinson's. A stroke leaves a dead zone inside the brain. Missing 
are many kinds of cells that were hooked up in complex patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	In their attempt at repair, surgeons add their cancer-derived  
cells to the ring of damaged tissue that surrounds the dead area. 
Just why this might do some good isn't completely clear. But the 
doctors speculate that the new cells help the hurt ones by 
restoring connections, releasing neurotransmitters and pumping in 
amino acids. 
</P>
<P>
	As best they can tell, the transplanted cells have been  
transformed from cancerous gonadal cells to stable nerve cells 
through a series of manipulations. But the idea of using cancer 
cells makes some doctors uneasy. Others worry that the challenges 
of repairing strokes are just too vast to even attempt yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe that we will be able to treat strokes and the  
more complicated disorders. I just don't think we're ready to do 
that yet,'' cautions Dr. John Kessler of Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Many agree that the most elegant solution of all to the supply  
problem is stem cells. These are the body's mother cells. They 
divide over and over to form new tissue, such as blood cells and 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
	For generations, scientific dogma held that the adult brain  
cannot repair itself, because it lacks stem cells. Wrong. Recently, 
scientists found that adult brains do indeed harbor stem cells, 
although their exact function is still a mystery. But when coaxed 
properly in a test tube, they will divide over and over again, 
making brand-new neurons. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, it seems, cancer cells and animal cells may be  
unnecessary. The real thing, human brain cells, will be available. 
But what kind of stem cell is the proper seed? 
</P>
<P>
	Since stem cells divide endlessly, a single sample started from  
a human fetus could provide all that's needed. But the recipient's 
immune system might attack these as foreign. Perhaps the patient's 
own body is a better source of stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	At Cedars-Sinai, scientists isolate stem cells from tissue saved  
during brain operations on Parkinson's patients. In the lab, these 
stem cells produce new brain cells. These in turn mature into 
dopamine makers, the specific kind of brain cells that people with 
Parkinson's lack. Finally, they are put back into the patients' 
brains. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if this works, however, the approach has an obvious  
shortcoming. The only source of these brain stem cells is the 
patient's own brain, not a particularly accessible reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
	However, brain stem cells may not be a necessary ingredient for  
custom-making new brain tissue. Scientists believe it may be 
possible to reprogram more readily available kinds of stem cells, 
such as the ones that produce skin, so that they will churn out 
brain cells, instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But are transplants necessary at all? Maybe not. Repairs might  
actually be engineered by remote control without ever putting 
anything into the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists talk of stimulating the stem cells still inside  
the brain so they divide and send off new nerve cells. Farfetched 
as this sounds, they say it may be possible to direct the cells to 
travel to distant parts of the brain and then take on the 
specialized duties of cells that are missing or damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, to cure a stroke or head injury, a reliable supply of  
brain cells is just the start. Somehow they must be wired up so 
each communicates with its neighbor in a sensible way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest hurdle is not getting cells into the nervous  
system,'' says Kessler. ``It's not getting them to differentiate 
and to live. The biggest hurdle is getting them to reconnect in the 
proper way. That is an extraordinarily daunting process, when you 
think of the billions of connections that have to be formed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet scientists such as Macklis and Dr. Evan Snyder, a Children's  
Hospital colleague, think this is entirely possible. For one thing, 
their experiments suggest that damaged parts of the brain send out 
help signals that can recruit transplanted cells and show them what 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	In mice, at least, immature neurons injected into the head will  
travel across the brain to where cells are dying. There they assume 
the form of the missing cells, stitching themselves seamlessly into 
the brain's circuitry. 
</P>
<P>
	Cells injected into the brain's fluid-filled ventricles  
eventually migrate all through the head. The researchers say such 
an approach might eventually conquer diseases that involve many 
parts of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole idea of bringing in replacement cells from someplace  
else grew out the belief that the brain cannot repair itself. But 
with the discovery of brain stem cells, that dogma is crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cell therapy might be even more interesting, not less,'' says  
Snyder. ``Not only might it mean we put back cells that the brain 
does not grow on its own, but maybe we will do it by augmenting a 
natural response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In short, these scientists envision a day when repairing a  
broken brain will involve no transplants, no operations. Instead, 
it will mean triggering the brain to awaken its supply of stem 
cells, to grow its own spare parts, to literally fix itself.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Firms Being Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is investigating whether big  
Wall Street investment firms conspired to fix the lucrative 
compensation they receive for arranging stock sales for companies 
going public. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department inquiry takes aim at one of the financial  
industry's most important and growing businesses -- underwriting, 
which generated $12.5 billion in revenues for the firms in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was disclosed Friday in a filing with  
securities regulators by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., Wall Street's 
largest privately held securities firm, which said it had received 
a civil subpoena for documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman said the investigation would not delay its unrelated  
plans to sell billions of dollars of its own stock next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Subpoenas from Justice's antitrust division also went to most of  
the top underwriters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is looking at ``the possibility of  
anti-competitive practices in underwriting services for initial 
public offerings,'' spokeswoman Gina Talamona said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  
Goldman said the subpoena sought information ``with respect to its 
investigation of an alleged conspiracy among securities 
underwriters to fix underwriting fees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investment firms earned some $12.5 billion from underwriting in  
1997, the latest year for which figures are available, according to 
the Securities Industry Association. That was up from about $11.2 
billion in 1996 and $3.2 billion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation comes at a time when the market for new stock  
offerings is booming as companies look to take advantage of the 
investor confidence that is sending the Dow Jones industrial 
average to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 374 companies went public last year, raising a  
combined $36.8 billion. That compared with 172 companies and $4.5 
billion in 1990, according to Securities Data Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment firms band together in syndicates to spread their  
financial risk in initial public offerings, or IPOs, with one firm 
acting as lead underwriter. As underwriters, the investment firms 
buy a new issue of securities from the company issuing the stock 
and then resell them to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	As compensation, the underwriting firms receive a discount from  
the issuing companies on the stock's offering price. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Salomon Smith Barney, and  
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. also confirmed getting a subpoena 
from the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar request was received by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP;  
Co., according to a Wall Street executive who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. A market source familiar with the investigation said 
requests also went to Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and 
BancBoston Robertson &AMP; Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., Credit Suisse First  
Boston, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and BancBoston Robertson &AMP; 
Stephens all declined comment Friday. A call to Hambrecht &AMP; Quist 
was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. said, ``As far as we know,  
we don't believe we have received a subpoena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wide scope of the government's investigation was reminiscent  
of a landmark 1994 case in which federal regulators and the Justice 
Department accused major dealers on the Nasdaq Stock Market of 
conspiring in a form of price-fixing that cheated investors out of 
billions of dollars on their trades. 
</P>
<P>
	In settlements with the Securities and Exchange Commission in  
January, 28 major brokerage firms agreed to pay more than $26 
million in fines. In a 1996 civil antitrust settlement with the 
Justice Department, 24 firms agreed to improve their compliance 
procedures and tape-record some telephone calls made and received 
by traders. The Wall Street firms neither admitted to nor denied 
wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> WTO Deadlocked on New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization was deadlocked  
Saturday as it made a desperate push to agree on a new 
director-general and avert a leadership vacuum at a crucial time 
for the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At a bad-tempered meeting of the WTO's decision-making general  
council, supporters of former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore 
clashed with backers of Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai 
Panitchpakdi. 
</P>
<P>
	``The atmosphere is testy, tense and not terribly pleasant,''  
said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. ``It is very clear that we don't 
have consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis began Friday when Ali Mchumo, the WTO council  
chairman, proposed to delegates that Moore -- who is backed by the 
United States -- be approved by consensus because he had the support 
of 62 nations, three more than Supachai. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Japan, Malaysia, India and other Asian nations demanded  
a vote -- a move that would run against the WTO's time-honored 
practice of reaching decisions by consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore supporters fiercely resisted the vote proposal, and the  
positions were even more entrenched Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadlock made it increasingly likely that the WTO would have  
to function without a leader. On Friday, Italy's Renato Ruggiero 
left as head of the 134-member organization after a four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear who would make executive decisions while the WTO  
is without a leader, and the organization has said it would not 
appoint an acting director. 
</P>
<P>
	The post of director-general is a key one, with a new round of  
trade talks looming and a ministerial conference coming up in 
Seattle in November. The organization is responsible for pushing 
through agreements to liberalize global commerce and set fair trade 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Supachai returned unexpectedly to Thailand early Saturday. It  
was not clear whether this was a sign that he conceded defeat or 
wanted further consultations with his government. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore stayed on, but his hopes of celebrating a speedy victory  
were evaporating. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the all-important backing of the United States,  
Moore had support from South America and the Caribbean. In the 
closing stages of the contest, he picked up backing in Africa to 
push him ahead of his rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Supachai, backed by Asia and Australia, the Middle East and  
several European countries, was long the front-runner and was 
widely perceived as the candidate of developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the WTO is now caught up in high-profile disputes between  
the United States and European Union over bananas and 
hormone-treated beef. On Friday, Washington said it would bring new 
cases before the WTO against Europe, India, South Korea, Canada and 
Argentina on Friday for alleged unfair trade practices.

<HEADLINE> Derby Bettors Turn Out in Droves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- They turned out in waves Saturday at the  
125th Kentucky Derby, dipping deep into their wallets. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 151,051 at Churchill Downs was the second-largest  
in Derby history, behind only the 163,628 who attended the 
centennial running in 1974. A record crowd is unlikely now, because 
a huge section of the Downs infield was eaten up a decade ago with 
the addition of a turf track. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a day of seconds:  
</P>
<P>
	--Second-largest on-track wagering, $17,930,055 behind the  
$18,693,215 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Team Picks Up Uniforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Jose Ariel Contreras, who shut down the Baltimore  
Orioles in their historic visit to Cuba in March, said he wants the 
ball again in Monday's return game in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am ready to start in the game if they chose me to pitch,''  
said Contreras as he and other players picked for Cuban squad 
received their uniforms at a store near Parque Central. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll pitch like I did here, with hardballs and curveballs,''  
Contreras said, as he signed autographs for local fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Contreras held the Orioles scoreless in his eight-inning relief  
appearance March 28 at Latinoamericano stadium, though Baltimore 
won 3-2 in 11 innings in the first appearance by a major league 
team in Havana in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-handed Contreras struck out 10 batters -- including  
slugger Albert Bell twice -- while allowing two hits. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Saturday afternoon, Cuban sports officials had still not  
publicly announced the starting lineup. And the players, who had 
been told merely to pick up their uniforms, knew they were going to 
Baltimore but were unclear on what role they were to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really know if I am going to pitch in the game,'' said  
another of Cuba's best pitchers, Pedro Luis Lazo, who was the loser 
in the first game. ``It all depends on the manager. If needed, I'll 
work as relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also picking up his uniform was Jose Ibar, who started in the  
March 28th game. ``I'm going for Cuba,'' said Ibar, who has won 38 
games in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 fans crowded around the players outside the store as  
word spread that they were there to pick up their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Others included leftfielder Javier Mendez, designated hitter  
Orestes Kindelan and second baseman Antonio Pacheco, none of whom 
played in the first exhibition because they were tied up with the 
national baseball series. 
</P>
<P>
	Kindelan and Pacheco play for the Santiago team, which won the  
series. Mendez plays for the hometown favorite Industriales, which 
came in second. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is going to have some of the most powerful  
players,'' said Lucel Mesa, 16, an agronomy student who gathered 
with the others to get autographs. ``We're going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to Cuba's chances are the Orioles' struggles. Baltimore  
had the worst record in the major leagues entering the weekend and 
was concentrating more on ending its slump than on meeting the 
Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing discouraged Maria Fandina, a 72-year-old housewife who  
asked for Lazo's autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be a great game,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters' Hoffa Reaches Out to GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sworn-in before thousands of cheering workers,  
James P. Hoffa pledged Saturday to press the Teamsters to spread 
more political donations to Republicans and end government 
oversight of the union his father once ran. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not be an ATM machine for the Democratic Party,''  
Hoffa said in an interview with The Associated Press after an 
hour-long inaugural ceremony at the reflecting pool between 
Teamsters headquarters and the Capitol. ``We intend to approach 
issues from both sides of the aisle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a sign of Hoffa's eagerness to reach out to Republicans, he  
invited pro-union Rep. Peter King of New York to the ceremony. ``It 
makes labor more powerful when they have two sides to choose 
between,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters' PAC gave $2 million to Democratic candidates in  
last year's election races, compared to $151,800 to Republicans. 
Hoffa said he wanted to boost PAC contributions, and send more of 
that money to Republicans if they support unions rather than bash 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way it works,'' Hoffa said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa plans to meet with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. On  
his agenda: raising the minimum wage and stopping companies from 
hiring permanent replacements for strikers. Other issues include 
restricting Mexican truckers from driving their rigs and cargo on 
U.S. highways and eliminating Justice Department oversight of the 
Teamsters, which is part of an agreement made almost a decade ago 
to help loosen the grip of organized crime on the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will substitute integrity and due process for the witch  
hunts of the past,'' Hoffa said. ``We need to end the consent 
degree. That's what we need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa's father, Jimmy Hoffa, led the Teamsters for a decade  
until he was sent to prison for jury-tampering and fraud. The 
younger Hoffa was sworn in as president last month, but held a 
public inaugural to allow thousands of rank-and-file Teamsters to 
celebrate with him. His sister, Missouri Judge Barbara Crancer, 
administered the oath of office. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight 18-wheelers from around the country rolled by as Hoffa  
ascended the podium near an intersection that was temporarily 
renamed Hoffa Boulevard and Hoffa Way. 
</P>
<P>
	``This house of labor is no longer divided against itself but  
united to face the future,'' Hoffa told a cheering crowd that union 
officials estimated at between 3,000 and 4,000. ``That is our 
Teamsters union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Hoffa talked about unity, however, a reform group  
accused the new administration of threatening union members who 
refused to support its preferred candidate in an upcoming 
vice-presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's the unity when the way you deal with dissenters is to  
threaten them?'' asked Ken Paff of Teamsters for a Democratic 
Union, the group that supported Hoffa's predecessor as president, 
Ron Carey. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters spokesman Chip Roth said the allegations were false.  
``It is designed to embarrass Hoffa and undercut the unity he is 
talking about,'' Roth said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Seeks Military Spending Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Rep. Robin Hayes, whose North  
Carolina district includes two major military bases, said Saturday 
that the Clinton administration has neglected defense spending and 
left the military's resources stretched too thin. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weekly GOP radio address, Hayes said a smaller military  
has been called on to handle crises all over the globe, with the 
current action in Yugoslavia taking a further toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we have fewer resources, our military is continuously  
being asked to do more and more,'' Hayes said, citing peacekeeping 
missions in Bosnia and warplanes patrolling the skies over northern 
and southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we've stretched these military resources too thin,'' he  
said. He noted the only aircraft carrier in the Pacific has been 
moved to the Balkan region, and that some aircraft have been 
transferred from missions in Iraq to fly over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This administration has neglected the defense budget while  
sending our military on an increasing number of missions,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes' district includes Fort Bragg, home of the 82nd Airborne  
Division, and Pope Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has asked Congress for $6.05 billion to  
finance the added expense of the attacks on Yugoslavia and relief 
for refugees from Kosovo. But Hayes said that is insufficient to 
counter the drain on the defense budget that occurred even before 
the recent conflict in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were running out of cruise missiles before we ever launched  
one over Kosovo. And our airplanes faced a spare-parts shortage 
before we sent a single one to take on (Yugoslav President 
Slobodan) Milosevic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans have countered Clinton's request with a $12.9  
billion bill that adds money to increase military salaries and 
bolster training, equipment and defense facilities worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticized on Gun Control Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Critics say Gov. George W. Bush did too  
little, too late when he voiced support for instant criminal 
background checks of gun buyers at gun shows in the wake of the 
Colorado school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's either for instant checks or he's not. If the governor  
wants this to become law, he needs to make it happen,'' said Travis 
County Constable Bruce Elfant, one of those who worked for a bill 
killed in the Legislature that would have required such checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think if the governor would have shown some  
leadership early on ... he would have been widely applauded,'' 
Elfant of Austin said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's comments have put him in the middle of one of the  
touchiest issues in Republican politics -- gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bush's waffling does not bode well for a presidential  
campaign. The gun show bill is a common-sense issue,'' the San 
Antonio Express-News said in an editorial published Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty dicey issue in a Republican presidential  
primary,'' Elfant said. ``I am a Democrat, but I would be proud to 
stand with my governor if he would sign this into law. This is 
certainly not a partisan thing, believe me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law requires instant criminal background checks for  
gun-show purchases from licensed dealers. But purchasing a firearm 
from an unlicensed seller at a gun show doesn't require the check. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill in the Legislature would have added those checks, too.  
But the House Public Safety Committee defeated the measure April 
20, only hours after the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference the following day, Bush voiced his support  
for background checks. And last week, Bush said that while he still 
supports them, he believes it is too late to try to resurrect the 
gun show bill before the legislative session ends May 31. He called 
for federal action. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nina Butts, spokeswoman for the group Texans Against Gun  
Violence, said: ``If the governor is serious about tightening down 
on Texas gun shows, he can see that this law is passed. And it 
could go into effect Sept. 1. There is time left. It is not too 
late to pass it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Royce West, a Dallas Democrat who sponsored a similar  
bill, said Bush's personal popularity would be a plus in persuading 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gov. Bush is a very popular governor. I can't say for certain  
he could get it all the way through the legislative process, but it 
sure would give it a big boost,'' West said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is pushing for legislation that would jail a juvenile  
caught illegally carrying a weapon until a judge had an opportunity 
to review the case. ``We're sending a signal that we don't want 
kids illegally carrying guns, and if they do they're going to jail. 
It's very serious,'' spokeswoman Karen Hughes said.

<HEADLINE> Teen Said to Mix Sheep Eye in Food </HEADLINE>

<P>
	PAINESVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- A 16-year-old student faces expulsion  
for slicing up a sheep's eye during biology class and mixing it in 
rigatoni eaten by two classmates, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, whose name was not released, admitted that he sliced up  
the eye at Riverside High School and put it in the food, said Lake 
County Sheriff's Lt. Lonnie Sparkman.

<P>
	The two 17-year-old girls who ate the pasta on Monday didn't get  
sick, authorities said. The boy was suspended for 10 days, said 
school Principal Dennis Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his 17-year-old brother were later placed in a juvenile  
detention facility for threatening to duplicate the April 20 school 
shootings in Littleton, Colo., that left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were charged with aggravated menacing and inducing  
panic, said William Crosier, a deputy sheriff.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Agrees To Free Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic  
agreed Saturday to hand over three captured U.S. soldiers to the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson, who urged NATO to reward the gesture by halting 
the bombing of Yugoslavia for one night. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said he would be carrying a letter from Milosevic  
offering a face-to-face meeting with President Clinton to resolve 
the five-week conflict. Despite Jackson's pleas to give Yugoslavia 
a ``night of peace from bombs,'' U.S. officials said the prisoners' 
release would have no effect on NATO's air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The end of the conflict will come when they stop persecuting  
innocent people in Kosovo,'' Vice President Al Gore said in 
Louisville, Ky. ``We can't stand by with that kind of atrocity 
going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers' possible release after a more than a month in  
captivity could be a sign Milosevic is moving to find a way to end 
the Kosovo crisis. The Yugoslav leader might also be trying to 
improve his image in the United States and to exploit anti-war 
rumblings in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO jets flew missions over Yugoslavia on Saturday, and air  
raid sirens sounded in Belgrade shortly after nightfall. The 
state-run Tanjug news agency said 40 people were killed earlier 
Saturday when a missile hit a civilian bus in Kosovo, while five 
other people died in a strike on the province's second-largest 
city, Prizren. The private Beta news agency put the toll at 60 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said the three  
soldiers would be handed over to Jackson, who led a religious 
delegation to Belgrade and met with Milosevic on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president took the decision in support of Jesse Jackson's  
peace efforts,'' Tanjug said. ``We do not see them as enemies but 
victims of war and militarism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic conferred with key advisers after seeing Jackson, who  
later said Yugoslav officials decided to ``release the three 
Americans held captive and to allow them to leave with us 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said the three U.S. soldiers would accompany his  
delegation back to Croatia on Sunday, where they would then fly to 
the nearest U.S. air base, likely in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials were cautious in their initial responses to the  
announced release. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson called Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy  
Berger, to brief him on developments involving the three soldiers, 
and Berger relayed the conversation to Clinton, who was playing 
golf in Virginia on Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were able to secure the release of the prisoners, that  
would be a positive development,'' said National Security Council 
spokesman David Leavy. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Jackson also  
called Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to confirm the 
soldiers' release. Asked whether the release would bring a halt to 
NATO airstrikes, Rubin suggested it would not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Albright indicated to Jackson our position remains  
unchanged,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He made several pleas for NATO to halt its airstrikes, saying  
``in the coming days, we shall urge all parties to seize upon this 
initiative'' and undertake new negotiations to end the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government of Yugoslavia has made their statement with the  
releasing of the prisoners,'' Jackson said. ``Suppose tonight ... 
they (the U.S. soldiers) were hit and killed along their way to 
freedom? How ridiculous that would be. How unnecessary that would 
be, how insane that would be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that the response tonight is one of appreciation of  
this diplomatic gesture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seized March 31 were Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of  
Smiths Creek, Mich.; Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, 
Texas; and Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers were conducting a routine patrol along the  
Yugoslav-Macedonian border in support of a NATO force deployed 
there in the event that a peace deal enables them to enter Kosovo 
to serve as peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson also said Milosevic addressed the four points raised by  
the United States and NATO: halting the violence in Kosovo, 
allowing the return of refugees, the presence of a multinational 
force and a political solution to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he is going to send to President Clinton a letter laying  
out his response to those four basic concerns, the desire to meet 
with him and to take this matter to resolution through 
negotiations,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Jackson's religious delegation said that during the  
meeting Jackson prayed with Milosevic and held his hand. Then, the 
whole American and Yugoslav delegation held hands and bowed their 
heads in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson had met with the three soldiers Friday in Belgrade, and  
the three told him of being held in isolation. The Friday meeting 
with Jackson was the first time the three had seen each other since 
their capture. They appeared generally healthy, but still showed 
cuts and bruises they suffered when captured. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez's family members in Baldwin Park, Calif., greeted the  
apparent releases with cautious joy Saturday. The captured 
soldier's grandmother, Mary Pantoja, choked back tears, saying, ``I 
just hope it's true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Huntsville, Texas, the parents of Gonzales celebrated the  
news. ``We can't wait to hold him,'' his mother, Rosie Gonzales, 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO continued its bombing campaign Saturday, with a missile  
attack on a bridge north of the Kosovo capital, Pristina, that 
killed dozens of people, state-run media and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tanjug news agency said the missile cut the vehicle in two,  
sending part of it plunging off the bridge. Independent journalists 
saw about 15 bodies trapped in the charred remnants of the part of 
the bus which fell off the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Further south in Prizren, five people -- including two children  
and a pregnant woman -- were killed when a slum was hit, Serbian TV 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance launched the air campaign to force Milosevic to  
accept a Western-dictated peace deal for Kosovo, including 
widespread autonomy for the province and 28,000 NATO troops to 
enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians comprised about 90 percent of Kosovo's prewar  
population of 2 million people. More than 600,000 of them have fled 
Kosovo and Serb forces since NATO's air campaign began March 24.

<HEADLINE> Wild Event Wins Turf Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Wild Event passed Garbu in the final  
yards and scored a head victory in a three-horse photo in the 
$333,300 Early Times Turf Classic at Churchill Downs Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven weeks ago, Wild Event lost to Garbu as the favorite at  
Gulfstream Park. This time, Garbu caught Aboriginal Apex at the top 
of the stretch and opened a length lead, but Wild Event, under 
Shane Sellers, began to slowly cut into the margin. 
</P>
<P>
	As the fourth choice in the field of seven, Wild Event returned  
$13.20, $5.40 and $3.20. Garbu paid $4.40 and $3, and finished a 
nose in front of Hawkskley Hill, the favorite, who returned $2.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained by Lou Goldfine, the winner covered the 1 1/8 miles in 1:47  
1-5 in the Grade I event and earned $206,646 for Arthur Appleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Garbu had won two straight since trainer Bill Mott added the  
anti-bleeder medication Lasix. 
</P>
<P>
	More Than Ready was just that in the $120,400 WHAS Stakes for  
2-year-olds. The colt took the lead turning into the stretch and 
pulled away for a 4 1/2-length victory over House Burner. 
</P>
<P>
	More Than Ready is trained by Todd Pletcher, who has a  
reputation for outstanding results with 2-year-olds in their second 
race. More Than Ready's first start was a 7 1/2-length victory at 
Keeneland three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	As the second choice in the field of 12, More Than Ready paid  
$9.40, $5.80 and $4.00. Patrick Byrne, who won the WHAS in 1997 
with Favorite Trick, trained House Burner and the show horse, 
favored Admiral Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	House Burner paid $10.20 and $6.20. It was another half-length  
back to Admiral Perry, who paid $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
	James T. Scatuorchio paid $187,000 for More Than Ready as a  
yearling and got back $74,648 in purse money Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by John Velazquez, More Than Ready was fifth around the  
turn. Velazquez kept Pat Day and House Burner inside and behind the 
leaders turning into the stretch. After four whacks with the whip, 
More Than Ready had opened a comfortable advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	In other stakes races on Derby Day:  
</P>
<P>
	--Rock and Roll held off Liberty Gold by a half-length in the  
$166,350 Churchill Downs Handicap. Ridden by Pat Day, Rock and Roll 
paid $15 after covering the seven furlongs in 1:22 4-5. Fourth into 
the turn, Rock and Roll caught Orville n Wilbur's inside the final 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	--Next to last turning into the stretch, Shires Ende moved to the  
middle of the track and ran past seven opponents to score a 
two-length victory in the $119,600 Ashland Mile. Ridden by 
Velazquez, Shires Ende paid $80.20 after covering a mile on the 
grass in 1:35 2-5. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sellers got Zuppardo Ardo off the rail in the final 100 yards  
and caught a tiring Prospector's Song for a half-length victory in 
the Humana Distaff Handicap. Last early in the field of nine, 
Zuppardo Ardo paid $10.60 after running the seven furlongs in 1:23 
2-5. French Braids nipped Prospector's Song by a nose for second.

<HEADLINE> Four Texas Cities Choose Mayors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Incumbent mayors headed for expected re-election  
victories Saturday in Dallas, San Antonio, El Paso and Brownsville. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Kirk, Dallas' first black mayor, was trying to become the  
city's first mayor to win consecutive four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
	With 36 percent of the city's precincts counted, Kirk had 17,708  
votes, or nearly 74 percent, to 22 percent for his nearest rival, 
immigration lawyer Margaret Donnelly. Perennial candidate Jack 
Ludwig had less than 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Antonio, with 42 percent of the precincts counted, Peak  
had 26,253 votes, or 85 percent. Four challengers divided the rest 
about evenly. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez also led after early voting, with  
11,153, or 54 percent. City councilwoman Barbara Perez had 33 
percent, with two others splitting the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, turnout was light.  
</P>
<P>
	Results were unavailable from Brownsville, where Mayor Henry  
Gonzalez was being challenged by Blanca Sanchez Vela, wife of a 
federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk, a lawyer and former Texas secretary of state, has promised  
to focus his second term on fixing streets, keeping the city safe 
and promoting economic development in south Dallas, the city's 
poorest district. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent much of his first four-year term pushing through  
referendums to build a sports arena and develop an area along the 
Trinity River near downtown. Each passed by fewer than 2,500 votes.

<P>
	In San Antonio, Peak also sought a second term with a pledge to  
focus on basic city services. Peak's opponents were

	El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez was expected to easily beat city  
councilwoman Barbara Perez, his closest competitor.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Security Problems Nothing New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As concerns deepen that China may have stolen  
prized U.S. nuclear secrets, some Republicans are trying to link 
the espionage case to President Clinton and the controversy over 
his Asian-American fund raising. But so far Republicans keep 
turning up evidence of security flaws dating to the days when they 
controlled the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the bulk of the suspicious activity at the labs that is  
now the focus of intense FBI scrutiny started in the early to mid 
1980s, long before Clinton emerged on the national scene. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say some serious security breaches haven't  
occurred during the Clinton presidency. Just in the last week, 
evidence has emerged publicly that highly classified nuclear 
weapons computer files were transferred to an unsecured computer as 
late as 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But if FBI suspicions prove correct, the nuclear scientist at  
the center of the controversy began to spy early during the Reagan 
administration. And the most serious breach detected so far, the 
loss of design information on the W-88 nuclear warhead, dates to 
the mid-1980s. Also, concerns about lax security at Energy 
Department labs, most notably at the one in Los Alamos, N.M., have 
been around for at least two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't regard it as a political problem for Clinton, I regard  
it as a national security problem for the nation because the errors 
were made on the watches of both Republicans and Democrats,'' said 
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., named by Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss., to follow the China espionage issue on behalf of the 
Senate GOP leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the criticism directed at Clinton focuses on the  
administration's response once internal concerns about possible 
espionage surfaced in 1995: 
</P>
<P>
	--An Energy Department counterintelligence official alleges  
higher-ups barred him from alerting Congress to the loss of W-88 
technology to China. 
</P>
<P>
	--FBI Director Louis Freeh told the Senate Intelligence Committee  
that the Justice Department in 1996 rejected an FBI bid to obtain a 
search warrant for the computer of Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory scientist suspected of funneling classified 
weapons information to China. Lee denies the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some Republicans have called on White House National Security  
Adviser Sandy Berger to resign, claiming he was slow to grasp the 
seriousness of the espionage problem. Berger politely declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators are working on legislation that would  
transfer counterintelligence tasks at Los Alamos and two other labs 
from the Energy Department to the FBI, although the Energy 
Department's counterintelligence responsibilities already are run 
by an official from the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said he thought ``some are  
trying to politicize national security issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The China espionage issue is politically charged because  
Republicans, for much of Clinton's second term, have been trying to 
show that the White House has been more concerned about raising 
campaign money than protecting national security. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Republicans charged that China secretly funneled money  
to Democratic candidates and sought to leverage the contributions 
into political clout inside the White House. Last year, they 
alleged Clinton softened his policy on the export of satellite 
technology to China in exchange for Beijing's secret political 
largesse. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House steadfastly denies any connection.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a member of the Senate Intelligence  
Committee, renewed his call last week for appointment of an 
independent counsel to investigate China's involvement in illegal 
political contributions. ``Here you have important, startling 
revelations about why we should have an independent counsel,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a floor speech last week, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who led a  
House investigation into the fund-raising controversy, focused on 
the espionage issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get to the bottom of it,'' Burton said. ``And those  
who let this happen, for whatever reason, campaign contributions or 
because they like Chinese or whatever reason, they need to be held 
accountable and brought to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Gates, who headed the CIA under President Bush, said  
any suggestion that Clinton tolerated Chinese espionage because of 
political donations is absurd. ``That's all just a measure of how 
poisonous the atmosphere has gotten in Washington,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said there are plenty of tough questions Clinton must  
answer, such as why security at the labs remained so lax well into 
his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,  
said the most anyone can point to so far are ``inferences'' as to 
the administration's motives on China and security matters. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it's clear that China began intensive spying in the  
United States as long ago as the late 1970s and into the 1980s when 
cultural and scientific exchanges with the United States showed the 
rulers in Beijing how far behind their country had fallen in 
weapons technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their nuclear weapons program was generation-one,'' Shelby  
said. The administration, he said, must rethink its China policy 
and realize that Beijing is not a ``strategic partner'' but a 
``strategic competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of whether the charges aimed at the Clinton  
administration pan out, it appears certain the GOP will pursue 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got dots all over the map and connecting them is the  
tough stuff,'' Specter said. ``But I believe that's what has to be 
done.''

<HEADLINE> DNA Leads to Murder Charges in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- DNA collected from a crime scene almost 12  
years ago led to rape and murder charges against a man already 
sentenced to more than 200 years in prison, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred B. Harris was charged Friday with beating 71-year-old  
Raymond Brooks with an iron skillet and stabbing him to death on 
June 25, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks' wife, Bertie, was taking out the trash and returned when  
she heard her husband of 52 years scream. She was hit in the face 
and raped, while her husband lay nearby in a pool of blood, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 33, had been a suspect in the case, but at the time  
police didn't have enough evidence to charge him, said Detective 
Kevin Durkin. 
</P>
<P>
	Durkin, who left the homicide squad in 1993 and returned last  
year, said he never forgot about the case. And since technology had 
improved greatly in the meantime, he decided to submit samples from 
the scene to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement crime lab in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, semen taken from the crime scene was matched to  
hair belonging to Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brooks has agreed to testify against Harris, according to  
her daughter, Sharon Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have closure after the trial, and when this man goes  
to the electric chair,'' Ms. Morgan said. ``If he gets the death 
penalty, I'll be there to watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris was sentenced to more than 200 years on convictions for  
sexual battery, assault, grand theft, burglary and robbery in other 
crimes. Details of the crimes were not available Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Harry Caray Statue, Beer Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- To some, the beer cans placed in the outstretched  
hand of the statue of Harry Caray honor his memory. But others at 
Wrigley Field think their beloved announcer deserves a little more 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Since opening day, Cub fans have been placing bottles and cans  
in the hand of the 7-foot bronze statue that stands outside Wrigley 
in honor of Caray, who died last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was known for drinking beer, so what's the big deal?'' Amy  
Freeman said at Friday's game. ``Besides, this is a baseball park. 
People are supposed to be disrespectful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so fast, said Kathleen Van Ella, the agent for the sculptors  
who created the statue. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the one hand, I smile with the fans,'' Van Ella said. ``On  
the other hand, I'm an art professional, and we cringe about this 
happening on a consistent basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant DePorter, managing partner of Harry Caray's Restaurant,  
thinks his friend would have been proud to be immortalized hoisting 
a beer -- so long as the brew is Bud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harry started as a spokesman for Budweiser in 1954,'' DePorter  
said. ``One night, we sat around and figured he drank 70,000 beers 
in his lifetime -- not Bud Lite, not Miller, just Bud. We counted up 
a bunch of other drinks, too, but I don't want to comment on that 
number.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Clean Air Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Saturday endorsed federal  
standards aimed at making popular sport utility vehicles and cars 
run 80 percent cleaner, saying auto pollution can be cut 
dramatically at modest cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans love to drive, and we're driving more,'' Clinton  
said. ``But the emissions from our cars, particularly from the 
larger, less-efficient vehicles, threaten to erode many of the air 
quality gains America has achieved. As a result, many of our cities 
and states are no longer on course to meet our vital air quality 
goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the benefits may outweigh the costs by as much as  
4-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency, with a final rule expected  
by the end of the year, proposed that for the first time sport 
utility vehicles be brought in line with cars in terms of tailpipe 
emissions. It also called for the sale of only low-sulfur gasoline 
so emission control equipment can work efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the rule penalizes SUV  
drivers. He said he has asked Clinton instead to support his 
biomass research legislation, which would develop efficient fuels 
and other chemicals from plant products. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a long-term approach to the problem of global warming  
that does not assume a shift from the automobile culture or 
increased costs for American employers and consumers,'' Lugar said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican  
Conference, said the EPA should enforce existing laws before 
pursuing ``new regulatory schemes of undetermined cost and scope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner has rejected oil industry  
arguments that the sulfur reductions sought by the agency would be 
overly expensive and force some refineries to close. 
</P>
<P>
	Average gasoline prices would increase by a penny or two per  
gallon, or $12 to $24 a year for a typical family, and new 
emissions technology on cars would add $100 to $200 to the price of 
a vehicle, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an awful lot to pay for cleaner air,'' Browner  
insisted. She said the EPA estimates the cost of the tougher 
requirements at $4.4 billion, compared with $16.6 billion in 
benefits to public health. She said the proposal was tantamount to 
removing 166 million cars from the road. 
</P>
<P>
	But the oil industry has said the sulfur-reduction requirement  
alone could require more than $6 billion in new refinery 
investments and force some smaller refineries to close. It 
estimated retail gasoline prices would increase as much as 6 cents 
a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration hasn't made ``a compelling case'' for a need  
for low-sulfur fuel nationwide, said William O'Keefe, vice 
president of the American Petroleum Institute. He said the industry 
would try to get the proposal changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for:  
</P>
<P>
	--Automakers to cut smog-causing tailpipe emissions by an average  
of 80 percent, including a 95 percent reduction in sport utility 
vehicles and pickup trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refiners to slash sulfur content from an average of 340 parts  
per million to 30 parts per million, a 90 percent cut, in the 
2004-2006 period. 
</P>
<P>
	--SUVs and pickups for the first time would be subject to the  
same tailpipe emission requirements as cars. Today, those vehicles 
can legally emit two and three times the pollution as cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rule, cars would have to begin meeting the tougher  
emissions standards in 2004, with all cars, smaller minivans and 
SUVs complying by 2007. Large SUVs and pickups would have an 
additional two years to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers had asked for a longer phase-in, to 2011, and oil  
companies argue the low-sulfur gasoline may not be needed until 
after 2010, and perhaps not even then. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the administration's proposal in terms of air pollution  
is equivalent to taking 166 million cars off the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 97 percent cleaner than they were 30 years ago,  
automobiles, including SUVs and light trucks, account for one-third 
to one-half of smog-causing nitrogen oxide pollution in urban areas 
and about 22 percent nationwide. They also are major sources of 
toxic chemicals and microscopic soot in the air.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Imposes Serbia Trade Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton imposed a U.S. trade embargo  
on the Yugoslav republic of Serbia to begin ``tightening the 
noose'' around Slobodan Milosevic's military. U.S. officials 
reacted cautiously Saturday to news that three captive soldiers 
might be freed. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions forbid U.S. exports of oil, software and other  
items -- except for food and medicine -- to the Serbian province and 
coincide with a similar ban on oil products imposed by the European 
Union that also took effect Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive order, signed by Clinton on Friday night, also  
froze all official Yugoslav assets in the United States and banned 
imports from Serbia. Clinton exempted the Yugoslav province of 
Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	``With these strengthened sanctions, we will diminish the  
Belgrade regime's ability to continue its campaign of repression 
and defiance, while allowing needed supplies to reach victims of 
its reckless and brutal conduct,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, meanwhile, pressed ahead with the 39th day of airstrikes  
on Yugoslavia despite reports that Milosevic, the Yugoslav 
president, had agreed to release three U.S. soldiers to a 
delegation led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. U.S. officials welcomed 
the news cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen the statements by Rev. Jackson and his delegation,  
and obviously we would welcome the release of the American 
servicemen,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the decision would be  
``good for the POWs and their families. We just have to wait and 
see what develops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson briefed National Security Adviser Sandy Berger on the  
apparent success of his mission, and Berger relayed the news to 
Clinton, who was golfing with confidant Vernon Jordan in Virginia. 
Jackson also telephoned Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic appeared to be capitalizing on a diplomatic  
opportunity in his bid to soften his image. In an interview 
published Saturday by The Washington Times, the Yugoslav leader 
sought to distance himself from the ethnic cleansing by armed 
forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton formally notified Congress on Saturday about the  
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we continue to intensify the air campaign, this is another  
step in tightening the noose around President Milosevic's war 
machine,'' National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	European countries and the United States already had barred the  
sale of arms to Serbia and restricted financial transactions. The 
main thrust of the new order was to begin cutting off oil to 
Milosevic's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been some concerns about the effects of a broad  
embargo on civilians. But NATO members issued a 17-point statement 
from their Washington summit last weekend vowing to ``tighten the 
constraints on the Belgrade regime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials were not immediately able to calculate  
what effect the broad embargo would have on the Serbian economy. 
NATO warplanes already have been targeting Yugoslav refineries. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavy said U.S. companies were expected to comply with the  
restrictions imposed through the Treasury and State departments, 
but there has been some disagreement about enforcing the oil 
embargo in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	France has questioned the legality of a NATO proposal to ``visit  
and search'' cargo ships bound for Yugoslav ports. Russia hasn't 
decided whether to respect any embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton exempted Montenegro from the sanctions because the NATO  
allies are concerned that any actions taken to weaken Milosevic 
could have a negative effect on the democratic leadership of the 
other Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Saturday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Pentagon officials said they could not confirm Serb media  
reports that a NATO missile struck and killed civilians on a 
passenger bus in the capital of Kosovo. The bus was reportedly 
crossing a bridge north of Pristina that was not on the NATO target 
list for Friday or overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald said NATO warplanes carried  
out the heaviest bombing to date on Friday, with about 600 flights 
over Yugoslavia and 71 targets hit. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ten more B-52 bombers arrived in England.

<HEADLINE> Milstein Wants Redskins Money Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Real estate developer Howard Milstein wants to  
be paid back for the millions of dollars he spent on his 
unsuccessful quest to buy the Washington Redskins football team, a 
published report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported Saturday that a lawyer for Milstein  
asked for a refund of his $30 million deposit, plus reimbursement 
for other expenses. The Post estimated the additional costs at 
between $3 million and $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The demands were included in a letter sent by the lawyer, Irvin  
Leonard, to Stuart Haney, a trustee for the estate of Jack Kent 
Cooke, the late owner of the football team, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein withdrew his $800 million bid April 7 when it became  
clear the other National Football League owners would not approve 
him. The trustees announced Monday that they would sell the team to 
Maryland marketing executive Daniel Snyder for $800 million. Snyder 
had been an investor in Milstein's original group.

<HEADLINE> IOC Reform Panel Growing in Size </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- At least 60 people -- 2 1/2 times the  
number originally planned -- are likely to serve on the 
International Olympic Committee's new reform panel, a senior 
official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch had said previously that  
20-24 people would make up the IOC 2000 commission, which was set 
up in March to help the committee rebuild after the Olympics' 
biggest corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But so many IOC members have asked to be appointed that the  
panel has been expanded to a provisional list ``in excess of 60 
members,'' IOC executive board official Kevan Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that the high number could appear unwieldy,  
Gosper said the commission will be broken into two or three working 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, Samaranch said the panel would be divided equally  
between IOC members and outside experts. But Gosper said the 
expansion could skew the balance in favor of IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will try to avoid going away from the even split, but it  
could wind up being one-third from outside the IOC and two-thirds 
from inside,'' he said in an interview. ``It's not so easy to match 
outsiders with bigger numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The full list of members is expected to be finalized and  
announced Tuesday at a special meeting of the IOC executive board 
in Lausanne, Switzerland. A day earlier, the new eight-member IOC 
ethics committee will hold its first session. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC 2000 commission will hold its first meeting June 1-2 in  
Lausanne and make a preliminary report to the IOC general assembly 
two weeks later in Seoul, South Korea. The panel is scheduled to 
submit recommendations at a special IOC session at the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the IOC has confirmed the names of only six members  
of the reform commission: Samaranch, who will chair the panel; 
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; 1984 Los Angeles Games 
organizer Peter Ueberroth; U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill 
Hybl; IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz; and Italian industrialist 
Giovanni Agnelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said other outsiders likely to be appointed include Josep  
Miquel Abad, organizing president of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, 
and Michel Barnier, co-organizer of the 1992 Albertville Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The two other IOC vice presidents, Pal Schmitt and Dick Pound,  
will also serve on the panel, as will some other executive board 
members, Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's mandate is to study the restructuring of the IOC,  
including how members are appointed, age and term limits, and 
changes to the host city selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	The reforms are intended to reshape the IOC following the  
vote-buying scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's successful bid for 
the 2002 Winter Games. Ten IOC members have resigned or been 
expelled in the biggest purge in the committee's 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the U.S. Congress have harshly criticized the IOC and  
threatened to impose sanctions unless the committee adopts certain 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who chaired Commerce  
Committee hearings into the scandal last month, has accused the IOC 
of dragging its feet on reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch and other IOC officials have responded by accusing the  
United States of ``political interference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the IOC would not be pressured into changes.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's important you don't destabilize the existing strengths  
that have seen us through time,'' Gosper said. ``You don't throw 
out the baby with the bath water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the custodians of the Olympic movement,'' he said.  
``Our timetable should not be driven by people who really don't 
understand the movement. I don't think we should be thrown off 
course by outside advice, no matter how well intended.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T, CWA Negotiating Over Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T is in negotiations with its biggest union  
over eliminating thousands of technical jobs, a company spokesman 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Communications Workers of America, in a statement, said it  
has been discussing with AT&AMP;T ``the proposed downsizing of 2,400 to 
3,000 technicians who maintain the AT&AMP;T network nationwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T spokesman Burke Stinson confirmed that, saying the company  
has proposed to the union a package -- including 80 to 104 weeks of 
severance pay based on seniority -- to persuade that number of U.S. 
employees to leave voluntarily. If employees don't agree to leave, 
AT&AMP;T would implement layoffs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that will happen, frankly,'' Stinson said.  
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T employs 140,000 people worldwide, with about 65,000 people  
in non-management positions. The CWA represents 42,000 U.S. workers 
at AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, network maintenance has become highly  
computerized and mechanized, thus lessening the need for in-house 
technicians to maintain and monitor the network, Stinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eliminating the jobs would save AT&AMP;T $200 million a year, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But CWA contends the cuts would hurt the quality of AT&AMP;T's  
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T is talking about eliminating half, or more, of the  
skilled technicians who maintain and monitor the AT&AMP;T network,'' 
said CWA Vice President Jim Irvine. ``Clearly losing this many 
skilled employees will have a detrimental impact on quality 
service,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T disagrees. ``We pride ourselves on our quality. That's why  
we've been investing billions of dollars in the technology that 
helps run our network,'' Stinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the workers eyed for cuts have been with AT&AMP;T for 25  
years or more, Stinson said, adding he expected most if not all 
would accept the package. 
</P>
<P>
	When AT&AMP;T offered a package last year to induce 11,000 managers  
to leave, 15,300 took it, Stinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	While not outlining the entire offer to CWA, Stinson said that  
in addition to the severance, all CWA workers will be eligible to 
take their pension in a lump sum this summer.

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Prepares for Cuba Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Prosecutors have plans to handle up to 600  
arrests during protests surrounding Monday's game between a Cuban 
national team and the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they don't expect massive arrests. But Deputy  
State's Attorney Haven Kodeck said officials will be on hand to 
review any arrests and determine if a charge -- and a court date -- 
is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to keep from jamming the court system with cases  
that may not warrant arrest and could be handled in some other 
fashion. Kodeck said prosecutors will still charge protesters when 
it is deemed appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman with the Baltimore police said Saturday that  
officers patrolling outside Camden Yards will have the same leeway 
they always have in deciding whether it is appropriate to arrest 
someone, perhaps issuing a citation instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just preparing for the inevitable, if there are arrests  
in large numbers,'' Kodeck said Saturday. ``We don't want to clog 
the system up on the back end instead of dealing with it on the 
front end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokeswoman, Angelique Cook-Hayes, said police anticipate  
the demonstrations will be peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
	Protests are planned both by those supporting an end to the U.S.  
embargo on Cuba and those opposing any move to improve relations 
with Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Police expect about 1,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, there is no anticipation of any kind of mass  
arrests,'' she said. ``If we have to make an arrest, we will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kodeck said that during a meeting Friday officials were told  
there could be as many as 600 arrests, but that that would be a 
worse-case scenario. He said the meeting was called just to make 
sure law enforcement and the city's justice system were prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	With protesters expected to come to Baltimore from all over, at  
least one congressman, Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., has said that 
lawsuits are possible if peaceful protesters are arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles already have their own plans for making sure  
protesters do not disturb the festivities surrounding Monday's game 
with the Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters will be separated -- with one group at the north end  
of Eutaw Street, and the other at the south end -- in order to avoid 
any conflict between the two, said John Maroon, a spokesman for the 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, protest banners may not be displayed within the ballpark,  
in keeping with existing team policies, Maroon said.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Wins Kentucky Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Charismatic, a claiming horse in  
February, became a miracle worker on the first Saturday in May. 
</P>
<P>
	At least he was to jockey Chris Antley after storming to a neck  
victory over Menifee in the 125th Kentucky Derby at Churchill 
Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was merely unbelievable to owners Bob and Beverly Lewis.  
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't that incredible?'' Lewis said. ``You can have a claimer  
today and all of a sudden have a champion tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shocking is what it was to many in the crowd of 151,051 as  
Charismatic paid a winning mutuel of $64.60, third largest in Derby 
history behind $184.90 by Donerail in 1913 and $72.40 by 
Gallahadion in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	While trainer D. Wayne Lukas claimed his fourth Derby win and  
his third of the 1990s, trainer Bob Baffert failed to become the 
first to win three straight Derbys. His three horses ran out of the 
money -- Prime Timber was fourth, the filly Excellent Meeting fifth 
and the gelding General Challenge 11th in a field of 19 
3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are you going to do?'' Baffert said. ``You can't win them  
all. I'm just glad for the Lewises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Lukas, it was a case of lucky 16. Charismatic was only the  
second Derby winner since 1900 to break from the No. 16 post; the 
first was the Lukas-trained Thunder Gulch in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Luck also smiled on Lukas and the Lewises long before the Derby  
when no offers were made to purchace Charismatic after a February 
claiming race. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said he was ``scared to death'' that would happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic was eighth in the run down the backstretch and moved  
to fifth entering the final turn. By the time he was exiting the 
turn, he was third and driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee was way back on the backstretch but also moved into  
contention on the turn and joined the battle as the crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
	At the head of the stretch, the winner was third on the outside,  
with Cat Thief, also trained by Lukas, on the rail and Worldly 
Manner in between and beginning to fade. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic then took the lead away from Cat Thief inside the  
eighth pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we were on our way to winning the Derby,'' jockey  
Mike Smith said, ``but here came Charismatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After gaining the lead, Charismatic withstood the driving  
Menifee, who gave trainer Elliott Walden his second runner-up 
finish in his second Derby. His Victory Gallop finished behind Real 
Quiet last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee finished three-quarters of a length ahead of Cat Thief,  
who was 1 1/4 lengths ahead of Prime Timber. 
</P>
<P>
	The entry of Excellent Meeting and General Challenge was the 9-2  
favorite, meaning no betting choice has won since Spectacular Bid 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	It was, as it often is, a roughly run race.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was the worst race to ride in that I can recall,'' said  
Robbie Davis, who rode 12th-place Ecton Park. ``It was more like a 
bumper car race than a horse race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert also said his three horses had traffic problems on the  
first turn, and that's when he knew he wouldn't get a third 
straight Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how to act,'' Baffert said. ``We're sort of lost  
souls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have any luck. I'm disappointed we didn't get a  
chance to run. Now I don't have to worry about the Triple Crown,'' 
said Baffert, who came close to winning it the last two years but 
didn't when Silver Charm and Real Quiet each ran second in the 
Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Antley got the mount on Charismatic when Jerry Bailey elected to  
ride Worldly Manner for the Godolphin stable of the Makhtoum family 
of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Worldly Manner was making his first 
official start since winning the Del Mar Futurity on Sept. 9, but 
did participate in a trial race in Dubai on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miracles were made to come true,'' said Antley, winning his  
second Derby in his eighth try. ``This is the greatest sport there 
is. It is the sport of kings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Antley wasn't riding because he was overweight and  
had thoughts of quitting. He tested positive for marijuana and 
cocaine in 1988 and willingly surrendered his riding license in 
1989, listing substance abuse as the reason. He won his license 
back in 1990 and rode Strike the Gold to victory in the '91 Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I was going to be back,'' he said. ``I told my  
dad, `The Derby's coming soon and wouldn't it be neat if I could 
ride in it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, there was Antley, feeling like a king on the  
back of a strapping chestnut colt who had the blanket of roses 
draped over his withers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unbelievable!'' shouted Bob Lewis. It was the Lewis' second  
Derby victory, the first coming with the Baffert-trained Silver 
Charm in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody in America gave this horse a chance,''  
said Lukas, who was voted into racing's Hall of Fame on Tuesday. 
``He's a greatly improved horse. Every day, he gets better and 
better and better and that's a dangerous situation here in the 
Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, Lukas, who scored his 11th victory in a  
Triple Crown race, said, ``The thing Charismatic has going for him 
is he's getting so good so fast. Whether it's good enough, I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody knows now.  
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, however, also said he wasn't always high on Charismatic,  
who was racing for the third time in 28 days and 15th time in his 
career -- more than any other Derby starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably, in my career, never misjudged a horse as I did  
this one,'' Lukas said, referring to the son of Summer Squall, the 
1992 Derby runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic ran in a $62,500 claiming race on Feb. 11 at Santa  
Anita, finishing second. He followed with seconds in an allowance 
and in the El Camino Real Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on April 3, the colt came in fourth behind General  
Challenge, Prime Timber and Desert Hero in the Santa Anita Derby, 
and Lukas said he would go on to the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the trainer saw fit to send Charismatic in the Lexington  
on April 18 at Keeneland, and won. But that triumph wasn't enough 
to make most people consider Charismatic a serious Derby contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic also paid $27.80 to place and $14.40 to show in  
earning a record $886,200 from a record $1,186,200 purse. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the first horse to win a Derby off a victory in a prep  
race since 1991 when Strike The Gold won the Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, ridden by Pat Day, who was seeking his second Derby  
victory in his 17th try, paid $8.40 and $5.80. Cat Thief was $5.80 
to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief is owned by William T. Young and wasn't coupled in the  
betting with Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish after Prime Timber were Excellent  
Meeting, Kimberlite Pipe, Worldly Manner, K One King, Lemon Drop 
Kid, Answer Lively, General Challenge, Ecton Park, Desert Hero, 
Stephen Got Even, Valhol, First American, Adonis, Vicar and the 
filly Three Ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The two fillies were trying to become the fourth to win a Derby  
and first since the Lukas-trained Winning Colors in 1988. General 
Challenge and Valhol were trying to become the first gelding to win 
since Clyde Van Dusen in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas had high praise for Antley.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Chris was a great fit for the horse,'' Lukas said.  
``He's hungry and he's won the Derby. I like the way he looked me 
in the eye and said, `I'll get it done.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Also feeling good about Antley's victory was Nick Zito, trainer  
of Adonis and Stephen Got Even. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm also happy for Chris,'' said Zito, who won the 1991 Derby  
with Antley on Strike The Gold. ``He got his life back. That's 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Baffert, Lukas was the fifth to try to win three straight  
Derbys. He won with Thunder Gulch in 1995 and Grindstone in 1996. 
But his Deeds Not Words finished 13th in 1997, when Baffert won 
with Silver Charm. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas also duplicated Baffert's feat of a first (Real Quiet) and  
a third (Indian Charlie) in a Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were really apprehensive and nervous until we won two weeks  
ago,'' Bob Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the word to describe the Lewises was ``thrilled.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to Baltimore, God willing, with a great deal of  
confidence,'' Lewis said, meaning the next stop on the Triple Crown 
trail -- the Preakness on May 15.

<HEADLINE> Two Convicted in Gang Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Two men have been convicted of leading the gang  
rape of a woman assaulted at a public housing project over a 
two-hour period while up to 60 people gathered to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Brown and Kahbarious Jackson, both 18, were found guilty  
Friday of several charges, including rape and aggravated sodomy. 
They face up to life in prison at their sentencing June 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old victim was seeking crack cocaine when she went  
to the south Fulton County housing complex Aug. 15 to make a buy, 
attorneys said. She was dumped by a nervous cab driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and Jackson grabbed the woman, seeking either $10 or the  
cocaine they claimed Brown had given her. She had neither, so the 
two decided to call in the debt in sex -- a rape in the courtyard of 
the complex. 
</P>
<P>
	It went on for two hours, witnesses said, and did not stop until  
a woman stopped Brown as he was about to dump a bucket of water on 
the semiconscious victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said the woman had offered sex for the drugs  
and the exchange had gotten out of hand. Prosecutor Ingrid Skidmore 
scoffed at that notion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's the case, then what happened to the drugs? She  
should have left with a bag full,'' Ms. Skidmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other men were tried in the case. One was acquitted of all  
charges, and another was found guilty of sodomy. Charges against 
five others were dropped.

<HEADLINE> Marine Pilot's Trial Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The navigator of a jet that severed an  
Italian ski gondola cable, killing 20 people, admits he intended to 
deceive investigators by destroying a videotape shot during the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a hasty, stupid decision,'' Capt. Joseph Schweitzer,  
31, of Westbury, N.Y., testified Friday during the court-martial 
for his pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby is being tried on charges of obstruction of justice and  
conspiracy to obstruct for allegedly helping Schweitzer get rid of 
the tape. Ashby, who was acquitted last month of manslaughter 
charges, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer testified that he destroyed the tape by throwing it  
in a bonfire, but that it was Ashby who took it out of the cockpit 
after an emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the tape ``was my idea,'' not Ashby's, Schweitzer said,  
testifying under a grant of immunity from prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said he used the video camera during the EA-6B  
Prowler flight through the Alps on Feb. 3, 1998, and was concerned 
that he had filmed his face. Schweitzer said he was worried about 
how the public would regard the images of himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't deal with my face being superimposed on the blood  
in the snow,'' he said, explaining why he wanted to get rid of the 
tape that he originally shot as a souvenir of his six-month 
deployment to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty to the same obstruction charges facing  
Ashby and was sentenced to dismissal from the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Ashby knew a criminal investigation was  
likely when he landed his crippled jet and knowingly tried to throw 
off investigators. The defense contends the crew had no inkling of 
a criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, an Italian magistrate testified he sent a  
notice of investigation to Ashby the day after the accident.

<HEADLINE> 3 Race Spectators Killed by Debris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Three spectators were killed and at least  
nine injured when struck by debris that flew into the stands after 
a three-car crash in the VisionAire 500 Indy Racing League event 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators sitting in the area where the crash occurred said a  
tire and suspension parts flew into the stands and struck the 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to those killed, an undetermined number were injured  
when hit in the fourth-turn grandstand at Lowe's Motor Speedway at 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were at least eight, and maybe 10 or 12,'' speedway  
president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler said. ``We're just not sure at 
this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of those injured were taken to Northeast Medical Center in  
Concord. ``They do not at this point in time seem to be critical,'' 
said Barry Hawthorne, vice president for patient care. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency helicopters took three people each to two Charlotte  
hospitals, Carolinas Medical Center and University Hospital, all of 
them in serious condition, said Kirsten Bass, a spokeswoman for 
both Charlotte hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	As rescue workers were attending to the injured, the track  
canceled the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrible thing,'' Wheeler said. ``It's very  
regrettable. It's something we'll live with for a very, very long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety minutes after the crash, the nearly 50,000 spectators had  
filed out of the track and investigators were working at the 
accident scene, taking measurements and roping off the area. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1.5-mile superspeedway's sprawling infield, about 200  
drivers and crew members gathered for a somber prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``My teammates and I are just full of sorrow,'' 1998  
Indianapolis 500 winner Eddie Cheever said. ``Our thoughts and 
prayers are with the individuals and families. The decision to stop 
the race was the right one. We all leave Charlotte with extremely 
heavy hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul Jr. and Stan Wattles slammed hard into the fourth-turn  
retaining wall on lap 61 of the 208-lap event and went spinning 
down the front stretch, collecting the car of Scott Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	Television replays could not show conclusively what kind of  
debris flew into the stands. But Joe Tiano, a Hickory, N.C., 
resident who was sitting about 150 feet away in a neighboring 
section of stands, said a wheel and suspension parts flew into the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came up here like a rocket and then started bouncing  
around,'' Tiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities cleared the section of the stands and the race was  
red-flagged while emergency workers attended to the injured. While 
medical personnel worked, track security employees stood around 
them holding up white sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody who was taking pictures had their cameras taken away  
by the cops,'' Tiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the injured spectators was sitting in the 15th row, and  
the other two appeared to be about 10 rows higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes of the crash, the three drivers were examined at  
the infield care center and released, and about 15 minutes later, 
Wheeler went on the public address system to tell fans the race was 
being canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never done anything like this before,'' Wheeler said.  
``But it seemed like the right thing to do in respect to those who 
lost their lives up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was similar to an accident last July in which three  
spectators were killed by debris after a racing crash at Michigan 
International Speedway. The track later increased the height of its 
catch fences by 2 1/2 feet, to 17 feet, in an effort to prevent a 
recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte's catch fences were raised to 15 feet in 1997 in  
preparation for the track getting its first IRL race. Charlotte has 
been holding NASCAR Winston Cup races since it opened in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler and IRL founder Tony George, who joined him at a hastily  
arranged news conference after the race was canceled, said they 
were unsure from which car the tire came. The cars of both Wattles 
and Paul were missing tires after the crash, but Wattles' impact 
occurred the closest to where the spectators were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts go out to everyone up in the stands,'' Wattles said  
after he was released from the infield care center. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the first spectator fatalities in the history of the  
track and the IRL, which was founded in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte allows spectators to sit in all rows of the track's  
seats for Winston Cup races, but for IRL races the speedway bans 
fans from sitting in the bottom seven rows closest to the racing 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Charlotte's been one of the leaders in protecting and  
taking care of their spectators,'' said Leo Mehl, executive 
director of the IRL.

<HEADLINE> Beef Pricing Suit Goes Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- A lawsuit accusing the nation's largest  
meatpacker of using unfair practices to control the price of beef 
has been cleared to proceed by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling from U.S. District Judge Lyle Strom on Friday means  
that 10 cattlemen can try to prove that IBP Inc. engages in illegal 
practices. The class-action lawsuit includes all producers who sold 
cattle for slaughter to IBP since February 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The cattle owners filed suit two years ago, claiming that Dakota  
City-based IBP colluded with other meatpackers to restrain 
competition and control prices. 
</P>
<P>
	IBP controls more than a third of the U.S. beef packing industry  
and last year processed more than 14 billion pounds of beef and 
pork. The company's sales last year totaled $12.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends IBP is violating antitrust laws by using  
large purchases of captive supplies of cattle -- rather than bidding 
on open auction markets -- to unfairly depress prices paid to 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	IBP has argued that an oversupply of beef and limited access to  
foreign markets are to blame for low livestock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for IBP, said he had not seen the  
ruling and could not comment on specific allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no sense for us to do anything to hurt cattle  
producers when we depend upon them to supply our plants,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and Tom Daschle, D-S.D., have  
introduced legislation that would require mandatory price reporting 
and increase access to domestic and foreign markets.

<HEADLINE> Bruins Can Wrap it Up at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Bruins have had few problems winning  
postseason home games. But the draining, physical style of their 
first-round series has Boston coach Pat Burns throwing history and 
home-ice advantage out the window. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins take a 3-2 series lead into Sunday's Game 6 with the  
Carolina Hurricanes after an exhausting 4-3 double-overtime victory 
in Game 5 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those games that could go either way, home ice  
doesn't mean nothing,'' Burns said. ``Nothing means nothing. Once 
the puck hits the ice it's going to be a battle again. Somebody is 
going to come out of this playoff series very sore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bruins aren't the only team worn down. It was Carolina's  
longest game in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``That game was a marathon,'' Carolina coach Paul Maurice said.  
``We can't fault any of our players. The physical effort has been 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they have for most of their Eastern Conference series, the  
Hurricanes jumped ahead early and the Bruins found themselves down 
2-0 at the end of the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not a good first period team, but I hope we get it  
figured out for Sunday,'' said Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe. 
</P>
<P>
	But the deficit didn't matter.  
</P>
<P>
	Boston scored three goals in a span of 1:52 in the third period  
to take lead. That was enough to quiet the sellout crowd at 
Greensboro Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is the old comment of the 2-0 lead that it is the worst  
lead in hockey,'' Dafoe said. ``But we did it and we came up with 
an unbelievable five minutes there with three huge goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Hurricanes got the momentum back when Sami Kapanen beat  
Byron Dafoe to tie it at 3-3 with just 1:45 left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole series has been (like) that, back and forth,''  
Burns said. ``Now it's just like a flip of the coin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Boston finally got the win -- and the series lead -- when  
Anson Carter broke free for a backhander with 5:15 left in the 
second overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's deflating because of how hard we played, but that's why  
you've got to win four games to win the series,'' said Carolina 
captain Keith Primeau. ``We just have to go in here (Boston) and 
get a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina knows its toughest challenge is to beat the Bruins on  
the road. If they manage to do that, the odds increase when the 
Hurricanes play host to Game 7 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This series in some ways will grind now,'' Maurice said. ``The  
effort is going to be there, the intensity is going to be there, 
but it's not going to be quite as fast as it was. Both teams can't 
play that hard through Game 7.''

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Wins Kentucky Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Charismatic, a claiming horse in  
February, became a miracle worker on the first Saturday in May. 
</P>
<P>
	At least he was to jockey Chris Antley after storming to a neck  
victory over Menifee in the 125th Kentucky Derby at Churchill 
Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The win before the second-largest crowd in the race's history  
was merely unbelievable to owners Bob and Beverly Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Shocking is what it was to many in the crowd of 151,051 as  
Charismatic paid a winning mutuel $64.60, third-largest in Derby 
history behind $184.90 by Donerail in 1913 and $72.40 for 
Gallahadion in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	While trainer D. Wayne Lukas claimed his fourth Derby win and  
his third of the 1990s, trainer Bob Baffert failed to become the 
first person to win three straight Derbys. His three horses ran out 
of the money -- Prime Timber was fourth, the filly Excellent Meeting 
fifth and the gelding General Challenge 11th in a field of 19 
3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a case of lucky 16 for Lukas. Charismatic was only the  
second Derby winner since 1990 to break from the No. 16 post; the 
first was the Lukas-trained Thunder Gulch in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The entry of Excellent Meeting and General Meeting was the 9-2  
favorite, meaning no betting choice has won since Spectacular Bid 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic was eighth in the run down the backstretch and moved  
to fifth entering the final turn. By the time he was exiting the 
turn, he was third and driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee was way back on the backstretch but also moved into  
contention on the turn and joined the battle as the crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
	At the head of the stretch, the winner was third on the outside,  
with Cat Thief, also trained by Lukas, on the rail and Worldly 
Manner in between and beginning to fade. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic then took the lead away from Cat Thief inside the  
eighth pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we were on our way to winning the Derby,'' jockey  
Mike Smith said. ``But here came Charismatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After gaining the lead, Charismatic withstood the driving  
Menifee, who gave trainer Elliott Walden his second runner-up 
finish in his second Derby. He finished behind Real Quiet with 
Victory Gallop last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee finished three-quarters of a length ahead of Cat Thief,  
who was 1 1/4 lengths ahead of Prime Timber. 
</P>
<P>
	It was, as it often is, a roughly run race.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was the worst race to ride in that I can recall,'' said  
Robbie Davis, who rode 12th-place Ecton Park. ``It was more like a 
bumper car race than a horse race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert also said his three horses had traffic problems on the  
first turn, and that's when he knew that he wouldn't get a third 
straight Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how to act,'' Baffert said. ``We're sort of lost  
souls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have any luck. I'm disappointed we didn't get a  
chance to run. Now I don't have to worry about the Triple Crown,'' 
said Baffert, who came close to winning it the last two years but 
didn't when Silver Charm and Real Quiet each ran second in the 
Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Antley got the mount on Charismatic when Jerry Bailey elected to  
ride Worldly Manner for the Godolphin stable of the Makhtoum family 
of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Worldly Manner was making his first 
official start since winning the Del Mar Futurity on Sept. 9, but 
did participate in a trial race in Dubai on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miracles were made to come true,'' said Antley, winning his  
second Derby in his eighth try. ``This is the greatest sport there 
is. It is the sport of kings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Antley wasn't riding because he was overweight and  
had thoughts of quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I was going to be back,'' he said. ``I told my  
dad, `The Derby's coming soon and wouldn't it be neat if I could 
ride in it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	When it was all over, there at Chris Antley, feeling like a king  
of the back of a strapping chestnut colt who had the blanket of 
roses draped over his withers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unbelievable!'' shouted Bob Lewis. It was the Lewis' second  
Derby victory, the first coming with the Baffert-trained Silver 
Charm in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are you going to do?'' Baffert said. ``You can't win them  
all. I'm just glad for the Lewises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody in America gave this horse a chance,''  
said Lukas, who was voted into the Hall of Fame on Tuesday. ``He's 
a greatly improved horse. Every day, he gets better and better and 
better and that's a dangerous situation here in the Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, Lukas, who scored his 11th victory in a  
Triple Crown race, had said, ``The thing Charismatic has going for 
him is he's getting so good so fast. Whether it's good enough, I 
don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody knows now.  
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, however, also admitted that he wasn't always high on  
Charismatic, who was racing for the third time in 28 days and 15th 
time in his career -- more than any other Derby starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably, in my career, never misjudged a horse as I did  
this one,'' Lukas said, referring to the son of Summer Squall, the 
1992 Derby runner-up. Charismatic ran in a $62,500 claiming race on 
Feb. 11 at Santa Anita, finishing second. He followed with seconds 
in an allowance and in the El Camino Real Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on April 3, the colt came in fourth behind General  
Challenge, Prime Timber and Desert Hero in the Santa Anita Derby, 
and Lukas said he would go on to the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the trainer saw fit to send Charismatic in the Lexington  
on April 18 at Keeneland, which he won. 
</P>
<P>
	But that triumph wasn't enough to make most people consider  
Charismatic a serious Derby contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic also paid $27.80 to place and $14.40 to show in  
earning a record $886,200 from a record $1,186,200 purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, ridden by Pat Day, seeking his second Derby victory in  
his 17th try, paid $8.40 and $5.80. Cat Thief, ridden by Mike 
Smith, was $5.80 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief is owned by W.T. Young and so wasn't coupled in the  
betting with Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish after Prime Timber were Excellent  
Meeting, Kimberlite Pipe, Worldly Manner, K One King, Lemon Drop 
Kid, Answer Lively, General Challenge, Ecton Park, Desert Hero, 
Stephen Got Even, Valhol, First American, Adonis, Vicar and the 
filly Three Ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The two fillies were trying to become the fourth to win a Derby  
and first since the Lukas-trained Winning Colors in 1988. General 
Challenge and Valhol were trying to become the first gelding to win 
since Clyde Van Dusen in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas had high praise for Antley.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Chris was a great fit for the horse,'' Lukas said.  
``He's hungry and he's won the Derby. I like the way he looked me 
in the eye and said, `I'll get it done.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Also feeling good about Antley's victory was Nick Zito, trainer  
of Adonis and Stephen Got Even. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm also happy for Chris,'' said Zito, who won the 1991 Derby  
with Strike The Gold with Antley up. ``He got his life back. That's 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Baffert, Lukas was the fifth to try to win three straight  
Derbys. He won with Thunder Gulch in 1995 and Grindstone in 1996. 
But his Deeds Not Words finished 13th in 1997, when Baffert won 
with Silver Charm. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas also duplicated Baffert's feat of a first (Real Quiet) and  
a third (Indian Charlie) in a Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were really apprehensive and nervous until we won two weeks  
ago,'' Bob Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the word to describe the Lewises was ``thrilled.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to Baltimore, God willing, with a great deal of  
confidence,'' Lewis said of the May 15 Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic became the first horse to win a Derby off a victory  
in a prep race since 1991 when Strike The Gold won the Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Luck smiled on Lukas and the Lewises long before the Derby when  
Charismatic wasn't claimed out of that February race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was scared to death,'' that the colt would be claimed, Lukas  
said after the race.

<HEADLINE> Staying Outside Helped Charismatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- This Kentucky Derby was a Demolition  
Derby, and the winner was a horse that stayed wide of all the 
bumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Antley and Charismatic took the overland route and never  
had a straw in their path, passing horses in the far turn and got 
in position to chase down Cat Thief and Worldly Manner in the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Menifee had all kinds of trouble before Pat Day  
threaded him through two holes in the 19-horse field and got him 
out from behind Worldly Manner for one last rush that fell a neck 
short of Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the worst race to ride in that I can recall,'' said  
Robbie Davis, aboard 12th-place finisher Ecton Park. ``It was more 
like a bumper car race than a horse race. I was expecting someone 
to fall, but they were jammed in there so tight that there wasn't 
room to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a disaster,'' Davis said. ``They could run this race  
back and there would be a different winner every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This was my worst trip ever in horse racing,'' said Gary  
Stevens, who finished 11th on General Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a lot of bumping along the rail in the first turn, but  
the eventual winner was several lanes away. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said General Challenge was between two horses in the  
first turn. ``They picked me up and carried me about four 
strides,'' Stevens said. ``I don't know how I didn't fall. Then 
when I was over on the far turn, I got hit again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Bob Baffert, who was trying to win his third straight Derby  
with Prime Timber, Excellent Meeting and General Challenge, the 
race ended early. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all decided in the first turn,'' Baffert said. ``There  
were just too many horses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew we were dead at the first turn,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Antley said he picked a spot in the second group of horses.  
</P>
<P>
	``From that point on, everything was going right and just  
continued to go right,'' Antley said. ``As we approached the 
quarter pole, I was three or four deep and was confident with the 
two in front of me because I hadn't really put him down hard yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``From that point on, it's just a matter of hoping nobody comes  
on and gets you,'' Antley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Day: ``When I made it to the quarter pole, there was a  
horrible jam. I had to snatch him there, and there was lots of 
stuff going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee split two horses early in the stretch run and then  
weaved between two others. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got clear at the three-sixteenths, he came hard,'' Day  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the best horse won,'' said Jose Santos, who rode  
ninth-place Lemon Drop Kid. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Desormeaux, who finished fifth on Excellent Meeting, said  
he had a ``horrible trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the filly was shuffled back leaving the gate and that  
she literally galloped for much of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``She never took a deep breath,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Notes From the 125th Kentucky Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- It just doesn't pay to be the favorite in  
the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 20th straight year, the betting favorite failed to bring  
home the bacon. Spectacular Bid was the last betting favorite to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, there were two chances for the favorite to win and  
both failed. The Bob Baffert entry of Excellent Meeting and General 
Challenge left the gate as 9-2 favorite. They finished fifth and 
11th, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner, Charismatic, wasn't the longest shot in the field,  
but close. He went off 30-1 and won with the third-longest odds of 
any winner in the 125 Derbys. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, who was trying to become the first trainer in history  
to win three straight Derbys, had too much history against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Another jinx also proved too difficult to overcome for Answer  
Lively. 
</P>
<P>
	No 2-year-old champion has gone on to win the Derby since  
Spectacular Bid. And no winner of the Breeeders' Cup Juvenile has 
won the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Answer Lively is now the latest answer to both those questions.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO PLACE FOR GIRLS:* Three Ring finished last among the 19  
horses who ran in the 125th Kentucky Derby. Excellent Meeting, the 
other filly in the race, finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three fillies have beaten the colts on the first Saturday  
in May. And no female jockey has ever ridden a Derby winner. The 
Friday before the first Saturday in May is the girls' day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Oaks, also 125 years old, is restricted to fillies  
and was won this year by Silverbulletday, trained by Bob Baffert, 
the trainer of Excellent Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The last filly to win the roses was Winning Colors in 1988.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WRONG COUNTRY:* For bettors enthused about Worldly Manner,  
there was good news from England early Saturday. The news from 
Churchill Downs was not so good. Worldly Manner finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	At Newmarket, Dubai-trained Island Sands won the 2,000 Guineas  
race, the first classic of the British racing season, by a 
half-length over Enrique. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Island Sands and Worldly Manner are owned by Godolphin  
Racing, the Dubai branch of Sheikh Maktoum al Maktoum's racing 
operation. Both are trained by Saeed bin Suroor. And both were 
unraced in about eight months going into Saturday's races. 
</P>
<P>
	Island Sands was coming off a layoff of 260 days since his last  
formal race. And Worldly Manner last ran at Del Mar on Sept. 8, 
when he won the Del Mar Futurity by five lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheikh Maktoum purchased Worldly Manner from his breeders, John  
and Betty Mabee, last summer for $5 million and kept the horse in 
Dubai over the winter. His only race this year prior to the Derby 
was in an informal trial. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FRESH VOICE:* Even before the horses crossed the finish line in  
the 125th Kentucky Derby, Luke Kruytbosch fulfilled the dream of a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one week into his new job as Churchill Downs' track  
announcer, Kruytbosch, 36, called his first Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first started calling races, the general manager who  
hired me asked about my goals and I told him that one day I wanted 
to call the Kentucky Derby,'' he said. ``I just get chills thinking 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kruytbosch was just the fifth track announcer at Churchill since  
the track installed a public address system in 1940. He took over 
from Kurt Becker, who resigned after a two-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to coming to Churchill, Kruytbosch was the track announcer  
at Hollywood Park in Los Angeles, where he had been since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO CHARGE:* Valhol had an electrifying ride in winning the  
Arkansas Derby prep on April 10, but he didn't make much of a 
charge at the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol was 15th, about a week behind the winner Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Willie Martinez rode Valhol on Saturday in place of  
regular jockey Billy Patin, who had ridden him for all three of his 
career starts. 
</P>
<P>
	But Patin is under investigation by Arkansas racing authorities  
after a device to deliver an electric shock was reportedly found by 
an Oaklawn Park employee after the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CLOSE, BUT:* Elliott Walden practically owns Churchill Downs.  
Except for a few seconds on the first Saturday in May. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second year in a row, Walden trained the second-place  
horse in the Kentucky Derby. This year it was Menifee losing by a 
neck to Charismatic. Last year, it was Victory Gallop losing to 
Real Quiet by a length and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden was the leading trainer at the Downs in the spring  
meetings in 1997 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Phillie Prison Alumni Hold Reunion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Like high school chums with fond pasts to  
recall, former prisoners at one of Pennsylvania's oldest prisons 
returned on Saturday with the jailers who once guarded for their 
own ``alumni reunion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first-ever such social event at the 170-year-old,  
stone-walled Eastern State Prison gave all who once dwelled behind 
its foreboding walls a chance to swap stories about their time at 
the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 29 years having passed since the last prisoner  
left, those who gathered Saturday said they were happy to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got good memories of that place,'' said Thomas Finn, a  
former guard. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the former inmates entered an outdoor corridor that  
separates one of the prison's dilapidated 14 cellblocks before 
shaking hands and walking through worn-down halls to find their old 
cells and posts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow, I didn't realize it was this big!'' said retired guard  
Tony Guida, 67, as he surveyed a courtyard. It was his first time 
back inside the prison since it closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern State opened in 1829, and went on to become the first  
prison to use the Pennsylvania System, which tried to reform 
inmates through isolation and spawned a century of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	The original seven-cellblock prison was built to hold as many as  
250 inmates and used as a model for nearly 300 other prisons around 
the world, prison historians say. 
</P>
<P>
	Architect John Haviland's mission -- per a mandate from the state  
Legislature-- was to create an environment that forced inmates to 
become regretful and penitent. 
</P>
<P>
	It worked, according to Leo Benales, 75, who began serving a  
robbery conviction at Eastern State in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the impact and the enormity of what happened to me, (the  
prison) could have sucked the life out of me,'' Benales said. ``I 
was scared. That was an impact I'll never forget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reform system was eventually abandoned in the 20th century,  
and by 1925, nearly 1,700 inmates shared cells, meals and exercise 
time in group recreation areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison was closed in 1971, 26 years after a recommendation  
by the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone has fond memories of the place, said Richard  
Fulmer, a sociology professor at Millersville University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started working there when I was 21,'' Fulmer said. ``One  
time, I was in my office alone with an inmate and he reached down 
for a knife. Instead of putting it on my throat, he stuck it in the 
blotter on my desk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern State developed a unique atmosphere as its inmates grew  
old while serving their typically long sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It tended to be a much more mellow place,'' said Sean Kelley,  
a prison historian. ``Most of the guards who spent a lot of time 
there were almost looked at as one of the guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tell that to Benales. In 1945, he said notorious bank robber  
``Slick'' Willie Sutton, who was housed in a cell across from his, 
asked him to help build a tunnel to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	Benales didn't go with him. Sutton and two others were caught  
soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me he was an unsuccessful crook,'' Benales said. ``He spent  
more time in jail than he did robbing banks.''

<HEADLINE> TV Stations Meeting Digital Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most TV stations required to begin digital  
broadcasts by Saturday are on schedule, broadcasters and federal 
regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 40 ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox affiliates in the nation's  
top 10 TV markets are being required by the Federal Communications 
Commission to meet the May 1 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many TV stations, as well as the 40 top-ten market stations  
subject to the May 1 deadline, have already moved ahead to launch 
their DTV operations,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said in a 
statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some stations in nine of the top 10 TV markets -- all but Chicago  
-- and in smaller markets voluntarily began offering digital 
broadcasts last November. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 66 stations are either already providing digital  
broadcasts or plan to by May 1, the National Association of 
Broadcasters said Friday. Eventually, all TV stations will have to 
switch to higher-quality digital television before 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	Most stations offer digital versions of their regular TV shows.  
To receive them, people need to buy a pricey digital TV set. Some 
20,000 digital sets have been sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital technology lets broadcasters squeeze more video and data  
into existing channel space, giving them numerous options. They 
could use it to provide high definition TV, which offers sharper 
pictures than standard digital. They could also offer additional TV 
channels for sports or movies, or stock quotes and other data 
transmitted to home computers -- or a combination.

<HEADLINE> Sheikh's Derby Entrant Disappoints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Worldly Manner's trainer and owner cut a  
sharp figure as they led the parade of 19 horses to the paddock 
Saturday for the 125th running of the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in fashionably cut dark blue suits, eyes shaded from the  
late-afternoon glare by stylish sunglasses, Sheikh Mohammed al 
Maktoum and trainer Saeed bin Suroor walked beside the massive 
colt, the sheikh's first-ever entrant in a Triple Crown race. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an impressive entrance for the sheikh, a member of the  
ruling family of the United Arab Emirates, but he left Churchill 
Downs disappointed. Worldly Manner faded to seventh in the stretch, 
finishing nearly five lengths behind winner Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheikh bought Worldly Manner, who won three of four starts  
as a 2-year-old, from breeders John and Betty Mabee late last 
summer for a reported $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt wintered in Dubai and was the mystery horse of this  
year's Derby field, coming into the race without a 3-year-old prep 
race other than a private trial in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Jerry Bailey was noncommittal when asked whether a prep  
race would have helped Worldly Manner. ``We'll never know,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheikh Mohammed originally planned to run as many as three  
horses in the Derby. Prado's Landing finished well back in the Blue 
Grass Stakes and Aljabr was scratched from the Derby with lameness 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Worldly Manner, who went off at 14-1 from the No. 11  
post position. 
</P>
<P>
	He got off cleanly and stalked the leaders four wide through the  
first mile. Coming around the second turn, the colt looked ready to 
bid for the lead in the stretch, but weakened and fell back. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last two furlongs, he just stopped,'' bin Suroor said.  
``Jerry said that when he started to push that he stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Suroor made it clear the sheikh won't give up his Derby  
quest after one failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy to be here, and we'll be back next year,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Jockey Makes Triumphant Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Chris Antley came into the Kentucky Derby  
happy just to have a ride. 
</P>
<P>
	He left as a two-time winner, piloting Charismatic to a neck  
victory over Menifee in Saturday's 1 1/4-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a dream,'' said Antley, who won the 1991 Derby aboard  
Strike the Gold. ``Miracles are meant to happen and it happened for 
me today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antley, who overcame drug problems at the beginning of the  
decade, spent much of last year struggling to gain control of his 
weight, which ballooned to 147 at one point between Thanksgiving 
and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the hardest thing I've ever been through,'' he said.  
``I didn't think I'd be back. My dad told me to do something else, 
that I didn't need to ride. He wanted me to take it easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told my father I have a goal in life and that I would die  
trying to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antley began running through the streets of Columbia, S.C.,  
where he was living with his father -- earning him the nickname 
Forrest Gump. He got his weight back to a more manageable 114. 
</P>
<P>
	In late February, with his weight under control, Antley decided  
the time was right for a comeback. Trainer D. Wayne Lukas asked 
Antley to watch Charismatic run an April race at Keeneland and soon 
after asked him to ride the colt in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent the spring with Chris and saw an intensity in him I'd  
never seen before,'' Lukas said. ``I just thought he was a great 
fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's hungry and has a passion to get back into the upper  
echelon of this sport. He's also won the Derby before, he finishes 
well and he's very confident. I loved the way he looked right at me 
and said `We'll get it done.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Antley's first two Derbys in 1988 and 1989 produced ninth- and  
10th-place finishes aboard Private Terms and Shy Tom, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	But Antley tested positive for marijuana and cocaine in 1988 and  
willingly surrendered his riding license in 1989, listing substance 
abuse as the reason. He won his license back in 1990 and rode 
Strike the Gold to victory in the '91 Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his 1991 win, he finished third aboard rap star  
Hammer's colt Dance Floor in 1992 before disappointing eighth and 
10th place finishes in 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing, however, was as tough on him both physically and  
emotionally as the events of the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was easy,'' he said with a long pause. ``My first one was  
one of those right place, right time things. This one has a lot 
more sentimental value than anything I've done in my career.''

<HEADLINE> WTO Deadlocked on New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization was deadlocked  
Saturday as it made a desperate push to agree on a new 
director-general and avert a leadership vacuum at a crucial time 
for the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At a bad-tempered meeting of the WTO's decision-making general  
council, supporters of former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore 
clashed with backers of Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai 
Panitchpakdi. 
</P>
<P>
	``The atmosphere is testy, tense and not terribly pleasant,''  
said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. ``It is very clear that we don't 
have consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis began Friday when Ali Mchumo, the WTO council  
chairman, proposed to delegates that Moore -- who is backed by the 
United States -- be approved by consensus because he had the support 
of 62 nations, three more than Supachai. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Japan, Malaysia, India and other Asian nations demanded  
a vote -- a move that would run against the WTO's time-honored 
practice of reaching decisions by consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore supporters fiercely resisted the vote proposal, and the  
positions were even more entrenched Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadlock made it increasingly likely that the WTO would have  
to function without a leader. On Friday, Italy's Renato Ruggiero 
left as head of the 134-member organization after a four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear who would make executive decisions while the WTO  
is without a leader, and the organization has said it would not 
appoint an acting director. 
</P>
<P>
	The post of director-general is a key one, with a new round of  
trade talks looming and a ministerial conference coming up in 
Seattle in November. The organization is responsible for pushing 
through agreements to liberalize global commerce and set fair trade 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Supachai returned unexpectedly to Thailand early Saturday. It  
was not clear whether this was a sign that he conceded defeat or 
wanted further consultations with his government. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore stayed on, but his hopes of celebrating a speedy victory  
were evaporating. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the all-important backing of the United States,  
Moore had support from South America and the Caribbean. In the 
closing stages of the contest, he picked up backing in Africa to 
push him ahead of his rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Supachai, backed by Asia and Australia, the Middle East and  
several European countries, was long the front-runner and was 
widely perceived as the candidate of developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the WTO is now caught up in high-profile disputes between  
the United States and European Union over bananas and 
hormone-treated beef. On Friday, Washington said it would bring new 
cases before the WTO against Europe, India, South Korea, Canada and 
Argentina on Friday for alleged unfair trade practices.

<HEADLINE> White House Pets Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consider this -- more pets than presidents have  
been in the White House. Lots more. 
</P>
<P>
	In tribute to the more than 400 beloved felines and canines of  
administrations past, White House pet photos and memorabilia were 
to go on display today at the New York Public Library in an exhibit 
sponsored by The American Pet Products Manufacturers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard not to love someone who's petting a dog,'' said Ron  
Elmore, a presidential pets expert and dean at the College of 
Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University. ``Pets have been 
extremely important in our national history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a preview of the exhibit Friday, Elmore recalled instances  
where the president's pet played a role in its master's political 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, Richard Nixon defended his candidacy for vice president  
when a story spread about a secret slush fund he kept. In a 
nationally televised address, Nixon did admit to taking one 
``gift'' -- his dog Checkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids love the dog, and we're going to keep it!'' an  
emotional Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Checkers is given credit for saving Richard Nixon's political  
career,'' Elmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents and pets go all the way back. George Washington  
received his dog, Vulcan, from the Marquis de Lafayette, a 
Revolutionary War comrade, as a gift. James Garfield named his dog 
Veto as an indirect warning to Congress. Abraham Lincoln's beloved 
dog, Fido, was killed by a knife-wielding drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, Lyndon B. Johnson named one of his first dogs  
Little Beagle Johnson to ensure he would share in the family 
moniker. And President Bush's spaniel, Millie, had a best-seller, 
``Millie's Book, As Dictated to Barbara Bush,'' that outsold Bush's 
own memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, dogs are not the only animals to have lived at the  
White House. One photo at the exhibit features Ronald and Nancy 
Reagan riding horses, with Nancy holding a ``Just say no'' sign. 
There are also several photographs from the Kennedy administration, 
including one shot of Jacqueline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy, Jr. 
with two parakeets.

<HEADLINE> Clash 2, Burn 1, SO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Ronald Cerritos scored in regulation and  
Dario Brose won the game with a rare shootout penalty kick to lead 
the San Jose Clash over the Dallas Burn 2-1 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Brose got the penalty kick in the fifth round to clinch the  
victory for the Clash (5-2). 
</P>
<P>
	He overran the ball during his shootout attempt, giving  
goalkeeper Matt Jordan time to reach the edge of the penalty area 
before Brose could attempt a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan was judged to have handled Brose's shot outside the area.  
The goalkeeper was ejected and San Jose was awarded the penalty 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose played almost the entire game a man short. Defender  
John Doyle was ejected in the seventh minute for a two-footed 
tackle on midfielder Ted Eck. 
</P>
<P>
	Temoc Suarez put Dallas (4-3) ahead in the sixth minute, but  
Cerritos tied the score in the 13th minute with an 11-yard shot 
after Jeff Baicher stole a pass by Eric Dade. 
</P>
<P>
	Dade later left with a broken cheekbone.

<HEADLINE> Four Texas Cities Choose Mayors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Incumbent mayors of Dallas, El Paso and San  
Antonio rolled to huge wins Saturday, while Brownsville's mayor 
lost his bid for a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Kirk, the first black mayor of Dallas, and Howard Peak of  
San Antonio both campaigned on themes of improving basic city 
services and played down promises of major civic projects. 
</P>
<P>
	With 85 percent of the vote counted, Kirk had 27,759 votes, or  
nearly 74 percent, to nearly 22 percent for immigration lawyer 
Margaret Donnelly. Perennial candidate Billy Jack Ludwig had 5 
percent. Turnout was well below 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready, willing and relieved'' to declare victory, Kirk  
said. ``We've really turned this city around, and I'm looking 
forward to continuing that progress over the next four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In San Antonio, with all votes counted, Peak had 40,388 votes,  
or 85 percent. Four challengers divided the rest about evenly. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez pulled in 30,253 votes, or 56  
percent, in the final count. City councilwoman Barbara Perez had 32 
percent, and two others split the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brownsville, Henry Gonzalez was defeated by Blanca Sanchez  
Vela, wife of a federal judge. With all ballots counted, Ms. Vela 
received 4,700 votes, or 56 percent to Gonzalez's 44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk, a lawyer and former Texas secretary of state, promised to  
focus his second term on fixing Dallas streets, keeping the city 
safe and promoting economic development in south Dallas, the 
poorest part of town. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Antonio, Peak sought a second term with a pledge to focus  
on basic city services. Peak's opponents were Tony Garza, Joseph 
Rodriguez de Cisneros, Eloy Centeno and Louis Podesta. 
</P>
<P>
	In El Paso, Ramirez made waves by lobbying unsuccessfully with  
officials in Juarez, Mexico, to ban drinking by underage Americans. 
Mexico's legal drinking age is 18. He also got in a spat with the 
president of the city employees' association, which endorsed Ms. 
Perez.

<HEADLINE> The Social Security Blame Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just in case the distinction was too subtle  
for some, it's been made crystal clear. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, lawmakers' endless talk about Social Security is not  
aimed at making a major overhaul of the retirement program happen 
this year. It's more about making sure the blame falls on the other 
guy when it doesn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it happening this year because I don't believe the  
president will really honestly address it,'' Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott said, in language that sounded like engraving on a 
tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's chief of staff John Podesta fired back that ``we are  
disappointed that some have chosen to raise the level of rhetoric 
without at the same time advancing specific ideas of their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of both political parties had claimed as a major goal  
this year shoring up Social Security for the time in the 
not-to-distant future when the program is expected to be 
overwhelmed by aging baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, a convivial group of Democrat and Republican  
lawmakers left a White House meeting voicing optimism they could 
get the job done before politicking for the 2000 elections spoiled 
the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	What's happened since then?  
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, what was going on was a blame game: who's going to  
be responsible for killing Social Security?'' said Rep. Bob Matsui, 
D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., insists that although he personally  
doesn't think it would be right to hold up Social Security reform 
for the sake of having something to campaign on, there is a belief 
among members of his party that if Democrats don't budge ``we can 
go into the campaign with enough issues that favor the Democrats to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders, meanwhile, have told their  
rank-and-file that polling suggests that moving a GOP-sponsored 
Social Security plan this year would be too politically risky. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans who have tried to suggest possible  
avenues for compromise have met resistance, even from within their 
own parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a proposal first outlined in his State of the Union  
speech, touched politically sensitive nerves, but also offered some 
cover to both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Appealing to Republicans' fiscal conservatism, Clinton proposed  
using trillions in expected surpluses to accumulate in Social 
Security's trust fund over the next 15 years -- while the baby 
boomers are still in the work force -- to pay down the nation's 
debts to private bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists agree that can reasonably be expected to improve  
the economy so that the nation could more easily afford to pay 
retirement benefits as the number of elderly Americans doubles over 
the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Clinton would refund some income tax surpluses in the form  
of government incentives offered to encourage retirement savings by 
low- and middle-income workers in new 401-(k)-style personal 
investment accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts are similar to those that many Republicans would  
like to start so that stock market earnings might eventually be 
able to make up some of the cash shortfall expected to face Social 
Security after baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	However, siding with Democrats concerned about putting people's  
Social Security benefits at the risk on Wall Street, Clinton would 
keep the personal accounts as an add-on, and have the government 
handle some experimental private investment of Social Security's 
cash reserves instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Clinton's plan has spurred Republicans to offer their  
own proposal to use Social Security surpluses to reduce the 
national debt, they panned it as a ``tricky accounting'' scheme and 
``socialism'' at highly publicized congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats on Capitol Hill have not bothered to mount much of a  
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, some Democrats have bristled at any hint that the  
administration might be negotiating with Republicans, and last week 
they aimed their fire at a GOP lawmaker who approached the White 
House to suggest a possible compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, made a courtesy phone call to Clinton before announcing 
his proposal Wednesday. It would integrate private individual 
retirement accounts with Social Security, but still maintain a 
government guarantee to make up the difference if people's accounts 
don't earn enough to provide them with the full Social Security 
benefits promised under current law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our challenge is to put politics aside,'' Archer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Democrats wasted no time accusing Archer of  
plotting to dismantle Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a stealth attack,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., of  
Archer's plan. ``If you take it to it's logical conclusion it is 
the delayed execution of retirement security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert has said, ``Make no mistake. Any  
efforts to enact a Social Security reform plan must be done in a 
bipartisan manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the current atmosphere, however, such cooperation seems  
unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Derby Turning Into Wayne's World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A horse whose future was so grim that he  
ran in a $62,000 claiming race in November won the Kentucky Derby. 
A horse who hadn't finished out of the money in his last 11 starts 
came in third. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who trained them both -- the horse that couldn't win and  
the horse that couldn't lose -- was the same. That should come as no 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	D. Wayne Lukas has four Derby wins now, a distinction shared by  
H.J. ``Derby Dick'' Thompson and surpassed only by Ben Jones, who 
won six. The difference between Lukas and the illustrious company 
he now keeps is that he can't imagine a Derby going on without him 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday marked the 125th running of this race. It also marked  
the 19th consecutive race that Lukas has managed to cull at least 
one entry from his coast-to-coast empire, for a staggering total of 
35. To put that into perspective, consider that he's had more Derby 
starters finish out of the money (26) than Thompson had starters 
(24), and more than twice as many as Jones (11). 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Lukas won this race was with Grindstone in 1996.  
That day, he also finished third, sixth, 10th and 18th in a 
19-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of the racing game may want magic, but he gives them  
science. They may want folksy, but he gives them corporate. They 
may want quality, but he force-feeds them quantity. 
</P>
<P>
	And what anyone else in the thoroughbred game wants only matters  
so much any more. Because Lukas has turned this joint into Wayne's 
World, claiming as big a chunk of it as anyone. That includes rival 
trainers and two-time Derby winners Bob Baffert and Nick Zito, with 
whom he was competing for the unofficial title of trainer of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be foolish to stand here and tell you I knew he was going  
to win this race,'' he said Saturday. ``But I'll say this: This 
horse had a great 60 days. And I'll say this: I misjudged this 
horse as much as any horse I've ever trained, and that's a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Teamsters' Hoffa Reaches Out to GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sworn-in before thousands of cheering workers,  
James P. Hoffa pledged Saturday to press the Teamsters to spread 
more political donations to Republicans and end government 
oversight of the union his father once ran. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not be an ATM machine for the Democratic Party,''  
Hoffa said in an interview with The Associated Press after an 
hour-long inaugural ceremony at the reflecting pool between 
Teamsters headquarters and the Capitol. ``We intend to approach 
issues from both sides of the aisle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a sign of Hoffa's eagerness to reach out to Republicans, he  
invited pro-union Rep. Peter King of New York to the ceremony. ``It 
makes labor more powerful when they have two sides to choose 
between,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters' PAC gave $2 million to Democratic candidates in  
last year's election races, compared to $151,800 to Republicans. 
Hoffa said he wanted to boost PAC contributions, and send more of 
that money to Republicans if they support unions rather than bash 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way it works,'' Hoffa said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa plans to meet with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. On  
his agenda: raising the minimum wage and stopping companies from 
hiring permanent replacements for strikers. Other issues include 
restricting Mexican truckers from driving their rigs and cargo on 
U.S. highways and eliminating Justice Department oversight of the 
Teamsters, which is part of an agreement made almost a decade ago 
to help loosen the grip of organized crime on the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will substitute integrity and due process for the witch  
hunts of the past,'' Hoffa said. ``We need to end the consent 
degree. That's what we need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa's father, Jimmy Hoffa, led the Teamsters for a decade  
until he was sent to prison for jury-tampering and fraud. The 
younger Hoffa was sworn in as president last month, but held a 
public inaugural to allow thousands of rank-and-file Teamsters to 
celebrate with him. His sister, Missouri Judge Barbara Crancer, 
administered the oath of office. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight 18-wheelers from around the country rolled by as Hoffa  
ascended the podium near an intersection that was temporarily 
renamed Hoffa Boulevard and Hoffa Way. 
</P>
<P>
	``This house of labor is no longer divided against itself but  
united to face the future,'' Hoffa told a cheering crowd that union 
officials estimated at between 3,000 and 4,000. ``That is our 
Teamsters union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Hoffa talked about unity, however, a reform group  
accused the new administration of threatening union members who 
refused to support its preferred candidate in an upcoming 
vice-presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's the unity when the way you deal with dissenters is to  
threaten them?'' asked Ken Paff of Teamsters for a Democratic 
Union, the group that supported Hoffa's predecessor as president, 
Ron Carey. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters spokesman Chip Roth said the allegations were false.  
``It is designed to embarrass Hoffa and undercut the unity he is 
talking about,'' Roth said.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Named Cardinals GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Bob Ferguson, credited with a leading role in  
transforming the Arizona Cardinals from perennial losers to a 
playoff winner, was promoted to general manager by the NFL 
franchise on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals owner and president Bill Bidwill said Ferguson  
``earned the right'' to fill the newly created position. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has proven to be one of the game's most astute evaluators  
of college and professional talent, he is an excellent 
communicator, and his expertise on draft day has been undeniable,'' 
Bidwill said in a statement. ``We hope his guidance will help take 
us where we want to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson will oversee football philosophy, players, coaches, pro  
and college scouting, the NFL draft, and free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bidwill will consult with Ferguson on salary cap  
and player contract matters along with assistant to the president 
Rod Graves, who will continue as the team's primary contract 
negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I'm very flattered and appreciative,'' Ferguson said  
in a telephone interview from the Cardinals' headquarters in Tempe. 
``But I've been around the block a number of years and worked my 
way up the hard way. I'm ready for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson, 48, is a 22-year veteran of various NFL positions. He  
joined the Cardinals as vice president for player personnel in 
February 1996, following three seasons as player personnel director 
for the Denver Broncos. Before that, he was in management positions 
with the Buffalo Bills for eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson was a leading voice in the Cardinals' decision to draft  
quarterback Jake Plummer in the second round in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his new job will be an amplification of his previous  
duties as head of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it will be very similar, but I'll probably be out  
front more,'' Ferguson said. ``I'm going to be involved with 
everything on the football side. I'm going to have input into what 
we're doing on the football side on a large scale. ... and that 
means player acquisitions and trades, the players themselves and 
what we do with the team itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Cardinals were 9-7, their first winning season  
since 1984, and made the playoffs for the first time in 16 years. 
Their first-round victory at Dallas was the Cardinals' first 
playoff victory since they won the NFL title in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of last year's wins came in the final seconds behind  
Plummer's scrambling big plays, and suddenly the once laughable 
franchise became the darling of Phoenix-area fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real proud of all that. It's very personal to me,''  
Ferguson said. ``I wear my heart on my sleeve and these things are 
personal with me and my family. I can't tell you how many years 
I've dreamed of being a general manager, let alone in an area like 
this with a team like this that's up and coming.''

<HEADLINE> Quotes From the Kentucky Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jockey and trainer quotes on each horse in Saturday's 125th  
running of the Kentucky Derby: 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic: ``As we approached the quarter pole I was three or  
four deep and was confident with the two in front on me because I 
hadn't really out him down hard yet. From that point on, it's just 
a matter of hoping nobody comes on and gets you.'' -- jockey Chris 
Antley. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee: ``The field was bunched up significantly going into the  
last turn. At the head of the stretch, there was a terrible jam. I 
had to wheel him out of there, and then he came out running.'' -- 
jockey Pat Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief: ``He gave all he had. I would have liked to get him  
back a little farther, but he was so sharp I couldn't. But it was 
all right. We were in the right spot.'' -- jockey Mike Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber: ``They ran away from me at the end.'' -- jockey  
David Flores. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting: ``We had a horrible trip. We got pinched back  
leaving the gate and then the horses in front were getting shuffled 
back, and I ended up last and she wanted to go.'' -- jockey Kent 
Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberlite Pipe: ``We got a chance to run turning for home, and  
he made a big run at them. ... There were just better horses.'' -- 
jockey Robbie Albarado. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner: ``I was in perfect position. ... As it was, he  
was kind of pulling me the whole way around. He ran very good.'' -- 
jockey Jerry Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	K One King: ``I am satisfied with the ride he got. You know,  
there's really only so much a jockey can do.'' -- trainer Akiko 
Gothard. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid: ``I don't think the best horse won. The race was  
a mile and a quarter, and my horse ran a mile and three-eighths. I 
had no chance to get in.'' -- jockey Jose Santos. 
</P>
<P>
	Answer Lively: ``He tried hard, but they tried a little  
harder.'' -- jockey Craig Perret. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge: ``This was my worst trip ever in horse  
racing.'' -- jockey Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecton Park: ``This was the worst race to ride in that I can  
recall. It was more like a bumper car race than a horse race. ... 
This was a disaster.'' -- jockey Robbie Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Desert Hero: ``My horse got knocked sideways and it intimidated  
him. He came back with cuts on his legs.'' -- jockey Corey Nakatani. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even: ``We got bumped around the first turn because  
Answer Lively was getting out and didn't make the turn. I had a 
good position but he was traveling like a horse who wasn't handling 
the track. -- Chris McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol: ``He wasn't the best horse in the race, but he will be  
around.'' -- jockey Willie Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	First American: ``I had a good trip. He moved up easy inside,  
but then he just came up empty,'' -- jockey Eddie Delahoussaye. 
</P>
<P>
	Adonis: ``I didn't go anywhere. There was too much traffic, too  
many horses.'' -- jockey Jorge Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar: ``He never had a lane. He ran, but he never got a chance  
to show anything.'' -- trainer Carl Nafzger. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring: ``I had all the problems. The saddle went over her  
neck, and that was it.'' -- jockey John Velazquez.

<HEADLINE> Fire 3, D.C. United 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chris Armas scored a goal and had an assist on  
the game-winner five minutes later Saturday night as the Chicago 
Fire beat D.C. United 3-2 in a penalty-filled rematch of last 
season's MLS Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuard Dougal, a referee in Scotland's Premier League who was  
working the game as part of an MLS exchange program, handed out an 
MLS-record 11 cards. Of the 11, 10 were yellow and the other was 
red. The previous record was 10 cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougal, rated the No. 3 referee in Scotland, has given out 26  
cards in three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Armas scored the equalizer in the 77th minute, thanks to a  
little confusion between D.C. United defender Jeff Agoos and keeper 
Tom Presthus. Agoos was trying to screen Armas off the ball, 
waiting for Presthus to come out and grab it. But Presthus, who 
wasn't expected to play Saturday night because he's still 
recovering from a severe viral infection, apparently thought Agoos 
was going to clear the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	So Armas reached around Agoos and kicked it in, tying the game  
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Five minutes later, in the 82nd minute, Armas dribbled past  
Agoos and passed to Josh Wolff, who made it 3-2 on a sharp, 
diagonal kick. Jerzy Podbrozny also was credited with an assist on 
the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago outshot D.C. 15-10, including 7-5 shots on goal. It was  
the Fire's first victory over D.C. United in the regular season. 
After two losses to D.C. in the regular season last year, the Fire 
beat the two-time defending champions 2-0 for the MLS Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	United started the night at a disadvantage, playing without four  
starters, and things quickly got worse. In the 16th minute, Brian 
Kamler was sent out of the game for elbowing, leaving D.C. a man 
down for the rest of the match. Ten minutes later, playmaker Marco 
Etcheverry left the game with a pulled right groin. 
</P>
<P>
	But United hung tough. Jaime Moreno tied the game 1-1 in the  
64th minute on a penalty kick after Lubos Kubik tripped him inside 
the 18-yard box. Moreno sent the kick toward the right side of the 
goal, and it sailed just past Zach Thornton's outstretched hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Three minutes later, D.C. United went ahead 2-1 on Roy  
Lassiter's goal on a nice cross from A.J. Wood. Fire defender 
Francis Okaroh tried to head off the ball but missed, and Lassiter 
put it in the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire got its first goal on a questionable call with 30  
seconds left in the first half. Podbrozny had a free kick from 
about 25 yards out, and Presthus stopped it with a leaping block. 
But he never got control of the ball, and it dribbled out of his 
hands and landed just behind the goal line as he fell to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Though replays were unclear, referees said the entire ball was  
behind the line and gave Podbrozny the unassisted goal.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov., Lt. Gov in Feud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A feud between California's top two  
Democrats -- one that started over the serious issue of illegal 
immigrants -- has turned into a quarrel over parking spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The rift began two weeks ago, when Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante  
became upset over Gov. Gray Davis' decision not to fight 
Proposition 187, the voter-approved ban on most public services for 
illegal immigrants. The measure has been held up by legal 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis opposes Proposition 187, but instead of fighting it  
head-on, he asked a federal court to submit the dispute to 
mediation. He said he felt bound to uphold the will of voters who 
approved the proposition in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Bustamante, who is Hispanic, lashed out with uncharacteristic  
emotion, describing how he stood proudly beside Davis on 
Inauguration Day as the governor proclaimed an end to ``wedge-issue 
politics'' in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Bustamante said he would file a friend-of-the-court motion  
against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, this week, the governor's office told Bustamante's aides  
to surrender their nine parking spaces near the Capitol. The spaces 
had been on loan from the governor's office, the Davis camp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante, who is not related to the  
lieutenant governor, denied any connection between the Proposition 
187 feud and the parking shuffle, which he said was prompted by 
construction work. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could raise an eyebrow about the timing, but it just  
happened to happen this week,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spat -- which doesn't affect the chauffeur-driven lieutenant  
governor -- prompted a round of news stories and editorials, some 
serious, some mocking, but all critical of Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bustamante and Davis agree on ``99 of 100 issues,'' Bustamante  
spokesman Phil Garcia said Friday. ``We really want to get back to 
policy, not parking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and Bustamante, both moderates, won their offices as a  
team. Bustamante helped Davis among Hispanics, the fastest-growing 
segment of California voters, and Davis gave Bustamante more 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, more than two dozen groups representing Hispanics and other  
minorities are applauding Bustamante in his dispute with Davis.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Griffey Ties Slams Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Lost in the shuffle of last year's home run chase  
and overshadowed by Jose Canseco's power surge this season, Ken 
Griffey Jr. still has a lot of drama left in his bat. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, the Seattle Mariners' slugger became the 12th  
American League player and 18th in the major leagues to hit grand 
slams in consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a chance to become the first player to hit a grand slam  
in three straight games but he lined out to pitcher Thomas Davey 
with the bases loaded in the sixth inning of Saturday night's 9-3 
loss to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The last player to get consecutive slams was Sammy Sosa in the  
midst of his pursuit of the home run record with Mark McGwire last 
July 27-28. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey's second slam in two nights came off Toronto left-hander  
Graeme Lloyd's first pitch in the eighth inning, lifting the 
Mariners to an 11-9 victory. It was much more than Griffey was 
aiming for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just looking to stay out of the double play,'' the  
Mariners' All-Star center fielder said. ``That's the biggest thing 
in that situation, staying out of the double play and giving your 
team a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey's big game -- 2-for-5 with five RBIs -- followed his  
two-homer, six-RBI game Thursday night, a 22-6 win over Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	His six RBIs against the Tigers tied his career high and his 11  
RBIs in consecutive games set a Mariners record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry much about that,'' Griffey said. ``The main  
thing is the two wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Griffey didn't come close to the 70 home runs  
McGwire hit last season, or even the 66 Sosa had. But he did hit 56 
for the second consecutive year and he had nine in the first month 
this season, one behind Tampa Bay's Canseco, the major league home 
run leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in his 11th season, he's moved past Yogi Berra into a tie  
for 47th on the all-time homer list with Johnny Mize at 359 -- or 
396 behind Henry Aaron's career mark of 755. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for a player who was mired in a 1-for-18 slump before  
Thursday night's game with Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Chili Davis, now with the New York Yankees, gave Griffey some  
advice in Griffey's rookie season in 1989, something he always 
remembers in those rare times of trouble at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was something like 1-for-16,'' Griffey said. ``Chili came up  
to me and said, `I had a stretch when I was 10-for-90. Don't worry 
about it, kid. You'll be fine.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The usually unemotional Griffey celebrated after Friday night's  
slam. As the ball cleared the Kingdome wall in right center, he 
lifted his arms in the air while rounding first base and broke out 
in a big smile as he reached the Mariners' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just emotion from coming from behind,'' said Griffey,  
who was 1-for-9 in his career against Lloyd before then. ``Anytime 
you come from behind, it gives the team a lift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey's 12th career grand slam gave the Mariners a modest  
three-game winning streak and brought them within one game of .500. 
Until now, it's been another tough season for the Mariners, who 
were a disappointing third in the AL West last year, but they 
overcame 6-1 and 7-3 deficits to win their last two. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a positive,'' Griffey said of the comeback wins. ``That  
this team never gives up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners have struggled without All-Star shortstop Alex  
Rodriguez, who usually bats No. 2 in the lineup in front of 
Griffey. Rodriguez is out for at least two more weeks because of a 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Wilson, Rafael Bouirnigal and Butch Husky were aboard on  
walks by Robert Person before Griffey's latest homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order for us to get back in these ballgames, we have to do  
the little things, which we're starting to do,'' Griffey said.

<HEADLINE> Derby Spectacle Extends Beyond Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Friends of Dave Wydalla put on the  
world's largest bachelor party Saturday in the infield at Churchill 
Downs on Derby Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends of the Atlanta man wore bright yellow T-shirts that  
read: ``D.e.b.b.i.e Does Derby'' -- or ``Dave's End of Being a 
Bachelor Incredible Extravaganza.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of dozen young men and women danced and shouted, all  
while consuming large quantities of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	``Horse racing in Brazil is boring,'' said Marcos Rizzon, who  
flew in from Rio de Janeiro. ``This is just awesome. I'll 
definitely come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the others among the 150,000 or so at Churchill Downs  
were at the track for one of the nation's largest and most festive 
sports events: the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the diamonds, pearls, feathers and ruffles of glitzy  
Millionaires' Row, celebrities such as Muhammad Ali, Wendy's 
founder Dave Thomas, country singer Travis Tritt, rapper Master P 
and actress Lynda Carter made the obligatory rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, attended their  
first Derby on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're coming back, now that we know what we're missing,'' Gore  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said it was not a campaign event for Gore,  
who is running for the Democratic nomination for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, however, said Kentucky remains politically influential.  
</P>
<P>
	``Kentucky is always a player in the national election,'' Gore  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Derby, those who intend to stand out among the madness  
wear a hat. Something special. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took me about two weeks to put this together,'' said  
39-year-old Skip Koepnick of Grand Rapids, Mich., who said he has 
attended every Derby for the last 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He took a second to adjust his lid, describing in detail how the  
rotating horses on either side of a likeness of Churchill's famed 
twin spires were powered by a battery pack around his waist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get a lot of positive response -- people wanting to take  
pictures and ask questions,'' he said. ``But that's what Derby Day 
is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The craziness begins early in the infield, where lines at the  
betting windows snaked 10 or 12 deep more than an hour before the 
11:30 a.m. first post. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcohol is readily available but is not supposed to be brought  
into the track. One group of enterprising men found the most 
creative smuggling method -- hiding bottles of bourbon in 
hollowed-out loaves of French bread. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing is off limits in the infield -- from throwing a football  
or a Frisbee to lounging on inflatable sofas and easy chairs to 
fishing for red and blue plastic fish with toy poles in a baby pool 
surrounded by inflatable palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the third year for the pool and it gets bigger every  
year,'' said Liz Groves of Columbus, Ohio, who has been to each of 
the past 17 Derbys with her husband, Greg. ``The first year, we had 
diving competitions off coolers but they shut us down because we 
were too rowdy. We had lifeguards and everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those put off by the anything-goes revelry of the infield,  
the paddock offered a more subdued experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this area, everyone is a fine southern gentleman or lady,''  
said Charles Matasich of Proctorville, Ohio, a spectator at each of 
the last 33 Derbys. ``This is the greatest sporting event in the 
world. The Breeders' Cup is for business. Derby Day is for nothing 
but pure fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that moment, a well-dressed fan asked to have his picture  
taken with Matasich. Small wonder. Matasich is more commonly known 
around Churchill Downs as ``Derby Man,'' and his hat and jacket are 
cluttered with nearly 15 pounds of Derby pins, key chains and 
patches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people here are the friendliest in the world,'' Matasich  
said. ``That's why most of them come back year after year.''

<HEADLINE> Goldman Ups Stakes Minority Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After discussions with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a  
minority-owned securities firm and one owned by a woman are getting 
larger and more lucrative roles in underwriting Goldman, Sachs &AMP; 
Co.'s initial public offering of stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Utendahl Capital Partners, considered the largest black-owned  
investment bank in the nation, and Muriel Siebert &AMP; Co. were moved 
up into the ``major bracket'' of underwriters, a grouping just 
below the top tiers of firms involved in the offering, a person 
close to the situation said Friday on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman, Wall Street's largest privately held securities firm,  
expects to raise about $3 billion by selling a piece of itself to 
the public next week. Goldman will be its own lead underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	The IPO is expected to be the second biggest in Wall Street  
history, behind the $4.4 billion sale of stock by Conoco Inc. last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has waged a campaign to increase the number of  
minorities working on Wall Street and to give them greater ability 
to tap the Street's profitable businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Jackson's Wall Street Project had fought for at  
least one firm, Utendahl, to be a co-manager of the Goldman deal. 
That's a first-tier ranking unprecedented on Wall Street that would 
have garnered Utendahl millions of dollars more in fees than it 
will make. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said that two other firms also moved to higher  
brackets, but not as high as Utendahl and Siebert. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty minority- or women-owned firms are included among the  
approximately 115 firms underwriting Goldman's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most inclusive (listing) in terms of the number of  
women and minority firms that I have seen,'' said Muriel Siebert, 
head of her self-named brokerage and the first woman, in 1967, to 
own a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Goldman nor the Wall Street Project would comment  
Friday, except to say that they had been engaged in what a Goldman 
spokesman called ``a constructive dialogue regarding these 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siebert acknowledged that no minority or woman-owned firm could  
handle the co-manager's position because of the millions of dollars 
in capital the underwriter would have to bring to the table. 
Essentially, an underwriter buys the stock then sells it to the 
public, garnering lucrative fees along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the choosing is done based on ``how much capital is  
available to you,'' Siebert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firms need an adequate capital reserve in case demand for the  
stock offering falls and the underwriting firm gets stuck with 
shares it is unable to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``And none of these firms could take the responsibility if the  
market tanked,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Race Spectators Killed by Debris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Three spectators were killed when struck by  
debris that flew into the stands after a three-car crash in the 
VisionAire 500 Indy Racing League event Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators sitting in the area where the crash occurred said a  
tire and suspension parts flew into the stands and struck the 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to those killed, others were injured when hit in the  
grandstand at Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were at least eight, and maybe 10 or 12,'' speedway  
president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler said. ``We're just not sure at 
this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As rescue workers were attending to the injured, the track  
canceled the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrible thing,'' Wheeler said. ``It's very  
regrettable. It's something we'll live with for a very, very long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul Jr. and Stan Wattles slammed hard into the fourth-turn  
retaining wall on lap 61 of the 208-lap event and went spinning 
down the front stretch, collecting the car of Scott Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	Television replays could not show conclusively what kind of  
debris flew into the stands. But Joe Tiano, a Hickory, N.C., 
resident who was sitting about 150 feet away in a neighboring 
section of stands, said a wheel and suspension parts flew into the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came up here like a rocket and then started bouncing  
around,'' Tiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities cleared the section of the stands and the race was  
red-flagged while emergency workers attended to the injured. While 
medical personnel worked, track security employees stood around 
them holding up white sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody who was taking pictures had their cameras taken away  
by the cops,'' Tiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the injured spectators was sitting in the 15th row, and  
the other two appeared to be about 10 rows higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes of the crash, the three drivers were examined at  
the infield care center and released, and about 15 minutes later, 
Wheeler went on the public address system to tell fans the race was 
being canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never done anything like this before,'' Wheeler said.  
``But it seemed like the right thing to do in respect to those who 
lost their lives up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was similar to an accident last July in which three  
spectators were killed by debris after a racing crash at Michigan 
International Speedway. The track later increased the height of its 
catch fences by 2 1/2 feet, to 17 feet, in an effort to prevent a 
recurrence.

	Jackson Wins Freedom for U.S. POWs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has  
agreed to hand three American prisoners over Sunday to the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson. Jackson will also carry a letter from Milosevic to 
President Clinton outlining steps to stop the conflict over Kosovo. 
Jackson said it includes a stunning offer by Milosevic to meet 
face-to-face with Clinton. Meanwhile U.S. officials reacted 
cautiously to news that the three soldiers might be freed. Pentagon 
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the decision would be ``good for the 
POWs and their families. We just have to wait and see what 
develops.''

</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Dozens of people were killed today  
when a NATO missile struck a civilian bus crossing a bridge in 
Yugoslavia today, news reports and witnesses said. The private Beta 
news agency reported 60 people dead while the state-run Tanjug 
agency said 40 people had been killed. Pentagon officials said they 
could not confirm the reports, and NATO had no immediate comment on 
the attack.

	FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) -- Workmen made repairs today as what once  
was the Army's largest basic training base prepared to become home 
to refugees from Kosovo. The first group of about 400 people is 
expected to arrive Tuesday at Fort Dix. A total of 2,000 to 3,000 
refugees are expected in coming weeks. The refugees will stay one 
to two weeks while arrangements are made for them to live with 
relatives or other sponsors. Of an estimated 500,000 ethnic 
Albanians in the United States, more than 200,000 are in the New

villain in the Colorado school shooting. While the gun lobby held 
its annual meeting, thousands of opponents circled outside. 
Officials of the nation's largest group of gun owners -- at 2.8 
million members -- refused to cancel the meeting despite requests 
from Mayor Wellington Webb and other local officials. ``We will not 
be silent or be told, `Do not come here, you are not welcome in

amphibious tourist boat sank. Passengers aboard the open-air boat 
panicked and scrambled for life preservers as it took on water and 
sank suddenly on Lake Hamilton near this popular tourist town, the 
city manager said. The dead included three children. The driver of 
the boat was among the survivors. Twenty people were on board and 
none were wearing life preservers, officials said. The boat sank in 
one or two minutes as it cruised less than a mile offshore, the 
city manager said.

as it made a desperate push to agree on a new director-general and 
avert a leadership vacuum at a crucial time for the global economy. 
At a bad-tempered meeting of the WTO's decision-making general 
council, supporters of former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore 
clashed with backers of Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai 
Panitchpakdi. The deadlock made it increasingly likely that the WTO 
would have to function without a leader. Yesterday, Italy's Renato 
Ruggiero left as head of the 134-member organization after a 
four-year term.

<HEADLINE> Victims' Rights Hearing Held in Mo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Three months after Pope John Paul II persuaded  
Gov. Mel Carnahan to halt the execution of a convicted killer, the 
governor's action became the center of a hearing Saturday on 
victims' rights conducted by the senator Carnahan wants to replace. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Missouri law, a killer's victims must be notified of a  
decision to grant clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't happen in late January when Carnahan, at the  
pope's urging, commuted the death sentence of Darrell Mease. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Republican Sen. John Ashcroft, who faces a  
re-election challenge from Carnahan, held a hearing on victims' 
rights that featured relatives of Mease's victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of Willie Lawrence said a simple telephone call by  
Carnahan telling them of his action would have helped heal the pain 
in learning Mease no longer faced the death sentence for killing 
their paraplegic, 19-year-old son in 1988. Mease also was charged 
with murdering Lawrence's grandparents, but was never tried for 
those killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they learned of the commutation from the nightly news.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of like learning they were dead again,'' said an  
emotional Anita Lawrence, Willie's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Mease had been scheduled to die by injection on Feb. 10.  
</P>
<P>
	The issue might have died if Carnahan were not challenging  
Ashcroft for his Senate seat in the next election. Ashcroft has 
kept the topic alive, frequently speaking out against Carnahan's 
mistake in not calling the family. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent experience of the Lawrence family had made clear  
the profound impact that a commutation can have on the victims of 
crime,'' Ashcroft said during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the hearing was aimed not at Carnahan but rather focused  
on a proposal before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a proposed 
national victims' rights constitutional amendment. It would give 
victims of violent crime the right to be notified of proceedings, 
the right to make statements at all stages in the process and the 
right to be notified of a convict's release or escape. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this hearing is not to allocate responsibility  
to anyone,'' Ashcroft said. ``This is a hearing to learn how we can 
structure the proposal to protect families' rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft wants the amendment to also cover commutations.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Lawrence testimony will help us convince the members of  
the senate that the amendment is too narrow,'' Ashcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lawrences' attorney, Mark Richardson, said the family asked  
to testify at the hearing. Mrs. Lawrence and her husband, Buck, 
came at their own expense from their home in Big Fork, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan did not attend the hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	``What happened to the Lawrence family is very tragic,'' said  
the governor's spokesman, Chris Sifford. ``The governor is very 
sympathetic. We think it also is tragic that Ashcroft would attempt 
to exploit the family by making them relive it.''

<HEADLINE> Penguins' Jagr May Not Be Ready / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jaromir Jagr thinks he'll be ready to play  
soon. Probably not soon enough for the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins rallied from 3-2 playoff deficits against New  
Jersey in 1991 and Washington in 1995. The odds of overcoming such 
a deficit against the Devils in this Eastern Conference series 
without Jagr are staggering, and they know it. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr sat out his fourth consecutive game with a strained groin  
Friday as the Devils regained the series lead with a 4-3 victory, 
and he said Saturday his chances of playing in Game 6 Sunday at the 
Civic Arena are remote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I feel right now, I'd probably have to say no,'' Jagr  
said. ``But everything can change. It's day to day. But when I have 
to do stops and starts, it is impossible to do, and everybody knows 
that's the whole game, stops and starts, trying to beat guys 
one-on-one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr tried to skate Saturday during an optional practice, but  
could not go hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm scared to play and get injured worse,'' he said. ``I hope  
we win but if I play and get hurt again, I couldn't play in the 
next series anyway. I still think we can win the series without me, 
but there's no guarantee that they can win with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Jagr ignores his own advice and tries to play, it's  
questionable how effective he would be, especially with the Devils 
very aware of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at it two ways. If Jagr comes back, it could be  
disturbing because he's a great player and has obviously won a lot 
of games for them,'' Devils defenseman Scott Stevens said. ``But he 
does take a lot of ice time and takes responsibility from other 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jagr situation is one of several intriguing subplots for a  
Game 6 that threatens to be the Penguins' final home game in the 
Civic Arena -- not just this season, but forever. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL has set a May 31 deadline for the Penguins' finances to  
be sorted out in bankruptcy court and new ownership to step 
forward. But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz indicated 
Friday that it likely will be at least two weeks beyond that for 
creditors to vote on a reorganization plan submitted by former 
Penguins star Mario Lemieux's group. 
</P>
<P>
	With the arena's management company, Spectacor, refusing so far  
to renegotiate the steepest rent in the NHL, the possibility exists 
that the franchise could fold or be moved before next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins players say they can't be worried about that now,  
not with the Devils needing only one more victory to partially ease 
the pain of last year's staggering first-round upset loss to 
Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Kovalev played on the 1994 Rangers team that overcome a  
3-2 deficit to oust the Devils and went on to win the Stanley Cup, 
and he said this team can do it, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the playoffs you have to win four games. We went through  
the same thing in '94 and they had a chance to beat us in six 
games. We can still do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Penguins need much more offense than they've gotten the  
last two games, when Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur faced only 35 
shots. Almost all of their offense Friday came in a 13-second 
flurry that yielded goals by Kevin Hatcher and Kovalev. The Devils 
dominated otherwise, just as they did in winning Game 4 by 4-2 in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Devils suggested the Penguins, especially without the  
playmaking Jagr, are a soft team filled with skaters and scorers 
but few fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last couple of games, obviously, we seem to have figured  
out what we need to do,'' the Devils' Ken Daneyko said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins remind Daneyko of the Senators, who were  
second-seeded in the conference playoffs, only to be eliminated in 
four games by Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Same type of team,'' Daneyko said. ``I guess that's because  
they just feel that physical play is not that big a factor in the 
playoffs. In my mind, you've got to have both, a little bit of 
balance.''

<HEADLINE> Elway Considered a 5-Star QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	John Elway might be the best quarterback ever. Then again, he  
might not be. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't really matter.  
</P>
<P>
	The winningest and perhaps most durable QB in NFL history made  
his mark like few others. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to rank excellence,'' says George Young, the  
league's vice president for football operations and a coach and 
executive for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are all five-star generals. If you want to have  
debates in bars, or on talk radio, that's fine. But these guys 
dominate their period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those ``guys'' include such quarterbacks as Otto Graham, Sammy  
Baugh, John Unitas, Roger Staubach and Terry Bradshaw, as well as 
Elway's contemporaries, Joe Montana and Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway officially retires Sunday after 16 seasons with the Denver  
Broncos, a record five Super Bowls as a starting quarterback and, 
finally, NFL championships in his final two seasons. He leaves no 
doubt he belongs among the dozen or so ``five-star quarterbacks'' 
in the league's 79 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	His passing yardage is second only to Marino. And while Montana  
and Bradshaw each have four Super Bowl rings, Elway's two titles, 
in the words of former Buffalo coach Marv Levy, ``were the frosting 
he needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway could finish games like no one else, with 47 game-winning  
or tying drives in the fourth quarter or overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, it's a manufactured figure, invented by a Denver writer  
and embellished by the team's PR staff. Nonetheless, it shows that 
Elway belongs in a class with Staubach, Montana and Unitas, three 
other QBs known for their heart-stopping finishes. But they had 
stronger supporting casts, so dramatic comebacks weren't as 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	All had the quality that defines great athletes -- the ability to  
perform best under adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the game was on the line, he was like Michael Jordan, he  
wanted the ball,'' says Dan Reeves, who coached Elway for his first 
10 seasons. ``I think he thrived on pressure. In those clutch 
situations, I don't know of anyone who did a better job of handling 
that like John did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Says Marty Schottenheimer, who coached Montana late in his  
career and lost 15 games to Elway: ``All things being equal, John 
may have been the best because of the ability to improvise and the 
ability to do all those different things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing demonstrates that better than The Drive by Elway.  
</P>
<P>
	Not Montana's drive that beat the Cowboys in the 1981 NFC title  
game and sent the 49ers to the first of their five Super Bowls, nor 
his 92-yard drive that beat Cincinnati in the 1989 championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	No, the drive of the last two decades is Elway's 98-yard march  
in Cleveland that sent the 1986 AFC championship game into overtime 
and eventually sent the Broncos to the first of three fruitless 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	It included one lucky play that also showed how well Elway could  
improvise. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1 minute, 47 seconds left, the Broncos moved from their  
2-yard line to the Cleveland 48, where they faced third-and-18. 
Elway was in the shotgun and Steve Watson went in motion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ball was snapped a count early and hit Watson and  
bounced high in the air. Elway leaped, snagged it with one hand, 
and found Mark Jackson for a 20-yard completion and a first down. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all the losses I had to John, the only thing that has  
stayed with me is that drive,'' says Schottenheimer, then the 
Cleveland coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer's career record against Elway with the Browns and  
Chiefs was 8-15. He was 142-81 against everyone else, and were it 
not for that drive, Schottenheimer might never have carried the 
stigma that he couldn't win the big playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Staubach, the quarterback most often compared with Elway for his  
ability to improvise and late-game heroics, watched that game with 
the admiration one great athlete can have for another. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just marveled at it,'' Staubach says. ``After that, you knew  
when you watched him that he'd never quit, even if he was playing a 
bad game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Elway and the Broncos lost the Super Bowl that followed,  
by 19 points to the Giants; lost the Super Bowl the next year to 
the Redskins by 32; and fell in the title game two years later by 
45 to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	No quarterback's career seems validated until he's won a Super  
Bowl. So, Elway's three AFC championships made him a 
four-and-a-half-star general at that time. In his mind, at least, 
he needed that extra half. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Broncos finally broke through by beating Green Bay in  
the 1998 Super Bowl (Elway's 45th game-winning drive), he put aside 
plans for retirement and led the Broncos to a second Super Bowl 
win, this one over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most rewarding games I've been to was the Super  
Bowl when Elway won his first one,'' says Don Shula, who played 
with Graham in Cleveland, played with and coached Unitas in 
Baltimore and coached Marino for 13 seasons in Miami. ``It was a 
thrill to see him finally get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, the NFL's MVP in 1987, guided his team to more victories  
(148) than any other quarterback, and he threw for 51,475 yards and 
accounted for 54,882 total yards. He's the only quarterback to pass 
for 3,000 yards and rush for 200 yards in seven straight seasons 
(1985-91). 
</P>
<P>
	Elway also was hit more than any quarterback in NFL history,  
absorbing 559 sacks in 256 games, but he missed only 15 starts 
because of illness or injury. 
</P>
<P>
	When talking about other great QBs, some might remember Fran  
Tarkenton, who defined the scramble during an 18-year career spent 
mostly with the Vikings but never got that ring. He's in the Hall 
of Fame, but is he at that five-star level? 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Staubach, Bradshaw and Dan Fouts. Bradshaw had a  
supporting cast in Pittsburgh that might be the best ever, and 
Fouts had the numbers, but never won a title with San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in the last 20 years there have been Montana, Marino  
and Elway, the latter two from the quarterback class of 1983 that 
also produced Jim Kelly, who led Levy's Bills to four Super Bowls. 
Again, Kelly got there, but .... 
</P>
<P>
	Elway had the ``but,'' too, for a while. There never really was  
a question, however, about whether he belongs with the best ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll never have a discussion about the greatest quarterback  
in the game without his name being in the mix,'' Levy says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody combined all his qualities: the ability to run, the  
size, the ability to perform under pressure and the numbers in the 
win column. ... Montana was the coolest I've seen, but John may 
have been the most exciting.''

<HEADLINE> Bucks Activate Sam Cassell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Milwaukee Bucks activated guard Sam Cassell  
prior to Saturday night's game against the Boston Celtics and 
placed guard Dell Curry on the injured list with lower back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell was placed on the injured list on March 22 with a  
sprained right ankle. He originally injured the ankle earlier this 
season while he was with the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	After joining the Bucks in a three-team trade on March 11,  
Cassell re-injured the ankle in his Bucks' debut against the 
Charlotte Hornets on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell has played in just five games this season -- one for the  
Bucks -- and is averaging 17 points, 4.6 assists and 1.4 rebounds in 
25.2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, who played in the first half Friday night against  
Detroit, sat out the second half because of the back spasms and 
didn't make the trip to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	In 42 games this season, Curry was averaging 10.1 points and 2.0  
rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Romney Outlines Olympic Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Fans at the 2002 Winter Olympics may have  
to stand at some venues or use outdoor toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pre-event concerts, usually free, could charge admission.  
</P>
<P>
	And anyone thinking of being a volunteer should be ready to pack  
their lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are among the measures being considered by Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee head Mitt Romney as he tries to close a 
multimillion-dollar budget gap caused at least in part by the 
Olympic bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``One million here and one million there. It adds up,'' Romney  
said in a meeting with reporters and editors from The Washington 
Post, outlining his plans to pare $94 million from the games' 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney was traveling Saturday and could not be reached for  
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic organizers are $300 million short of their goal of  
raising $859 million in contributions and in-kind services. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee officials blame the Salt Lake bribery  
scandal for the marketing woes, while some connected with the Salt 
Lake organizing effort have said marketing was slow even before the 
scandal hit late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake is heavily dependent on sponsors because the Winter  
Games don't bring in as much television and ticket revenue as the 
Summer Olympics. In addition, Utah is not underwriting the event 
the way recent hosts Japan and Norway did. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC senior vice president Shelley Thomas said Saturday that the  
committee is looking to pare costs wherever it can in case funding 
doesn't meet expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Thomas said the cuts  
mentioned in the Post story were among those being considered but 
that no final decisions had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney told the Post that, to trim $10 million, the games'  
18,000 volunteers will be asked to bring their own lunches rather 
than eating free meals at a cafeteria on site. Cutting back on 
signs and decorations for Salt Lake City will save $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $1 million-$3 million could come from eliminating  
sections of bleachers at some outdoor events, cutting staff 
salaries, postponing staff hires and renting security radios 
instead of buying them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of cuts we're talking about making will not diminish  
the excitement and the thrill of watching an Olympic sport,'' 
Thomas said. ``Whether or not you sit on one kind of bleacher or 
another makes very little difference to the experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But fans and volunteers aren't the only ones Romney said must  
make a ``visible commitment to frugality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee officials also will be asked to  
pick up the slack -- the IOC's hospitality budget will drop from $3 
million to $2 million and the traditional chauffeured limousines 
will be replaced with donated Chevy Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	And SLOC board members will have to pay for their own meals and  
meet in the statehouse rather than hotels, a savings of $250,000. 
Thomas said the committee is practically under a hiring freeze, and 
any staff additions will be delayed till the last possible moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney also has suggested that the USOC or the IOC pay some of  
the $17 million required to operate certain venues before the games 
for competitors who want to train in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney and his staff insist the cuts will not affect the  
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't mean they won't be fabulous games,'' Thomas said.  
``But they will not be opulent. They won't detract from the spirit 
of the fans or the competition.''

<HEADLINE> NRA, Protesters Face Off in Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The National Rifle Association defiantly took aim  
today at the media and gun control advocates, while a human chain 
of protesters shouted anti-gun slogans and denounced the group for 
meeting so soon after the Columbine High School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA President Charlton Heston demanded an end to ``this cycle of  
tragedy-driven hatred'' and said gun owners were not to blame for 
the April 20 shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're often cast as the villain,'' said Heston, who wore a  
blue Columbine memorial ribbon on his lapel. ``That is not our role 
in American society and we will not be forced to play it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While 2,500 people attended the NRA's annual meeting, about  
8,000 demonstrators gathered outside. A rabbi asked the protesters 
to work to make the streets, their homes and their schools safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``After Columbine anything is possible,'' said Rabbi Stephen  
Foster of Littleton, home of the school where two young gunmen 
killed a dozen fellow students, a teacher and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much too easy to blame the NRA for last week,'' he told  
the protesters, who gathered at the state Capitol before marching 
to the convention site at a nearby hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not the NRA that took guns into that school,'' Foster  
said. ``We have to look to ourselves, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrators carried signs that read ``Shame on the NRA,''  
and ``NRA, Pusher of Child Killer Machines,'' among others. One 
placard displayed the picture of a Columbine shooting victim. 
</P>
<P>
	The gathering by the NRA, the nation's largest group of gun  
owners, was planned long before the Columbine melee. It was scaled 
back -- its gun show was canceled -- but thousands of students, 
gun-control groups and local leaders still have a message: Get out. 
</P>
<P>
	Handgun opponents have planned protests in more than a dozen  
cities, from Atlanta to Seattle. Protests were also planned in 
Johannesburg; Tokyo; London; Vienna, Austria; Sydney, Australia; 
and Auckland, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA, which elected Heston as its president last year,  
refused to cancel the conference, saying that as a nonprofit group 
it was required to hold an annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	It did cut back the meeting from three days to one, canceled  
drink-and-dinner festivities, removed billboard advertisements and 
jettisoned plans for an exhibition in a 170,000-square-foot hall 
where 350 gun makers and other exhibitors were to sell their wares. 
</P>
<P>
	For protesters and several lawmakers, that wasn't enough. Denver  
Mayor Wellington Webb called the NRA two days after the April 20 
shooting to uninvite the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a community is grieving and going through a mourning,  
when you have more than 65,000 people showing up for services and 
people are burying these kids, you shouldn't have a meeting that 
talks about selling more guns,'' Webb said after the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how many times you have to call and tell them  
they're not welcome,'' he added Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance is expected to be low. The gun show at the Jefferson  
County fairgrounds was canceled ``due to politics,'' as its host 
put it. Investigators said some of the four weapons used by the two 
teen-age gunmen in Littleton were bought at a gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA spokesman Bill Powers concedes the timing of the meeting  
couldn't be worse: ``It's a difficult situation for everyone 
involved in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting site bore no NRA signs when the first registrants  
arrived this week. Powers said the group has no plans to heighten 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have a right to express their views in a peaceful  
manner,'' he said of the critics. ``That's one of the great 
freedoms of this country. They have as much right to their opinions 
as NRA members do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Cohn, 15, remains loyal to the group despite having had a  
shotgun leveled at his head as he lay on the floor of the Columbine 
library. He believes he survived only because a girl jumped on his 
back, covering the baseball slogan on his shirt. The gunmen began 
their assault on the library by shouting: ``All jocks stand up! 
We're going to kill every one of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen spared Cohn, however, and moved on to another victim.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the guns, it's the people,'' said Cohn, who owns two  
shotguns and a rifle. ``These guys were just sick in the head.''

<HEADLINE> Derby Turning Into Wayne's World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A horse whose future was so grim that he  
ran in a $62,000 claiming race in February won the Kentucky Derby. 
A horse who hadn't finished out of the money in his last 11 starts 
came in third. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who trained them both -- the horse that couldn't win and  
the horse that couldn't lose -- was the same. That should come as no 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	D. Wayne Lukas has four Derby wins now, a distinction shared by  
H.J. ``Derby Dick'' Thompson and surpassed only by Ben Jones, who 
won six. The difference between Lukas and the illustrious company 
he now keeps is that he can't imagine a Derby going on without him 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday marked the 125th running of this race. It also marked  
the 19th consecutive race that Lukas has managed to cull at least 
one entry from his coast-to-coast empire, for a staggering total of 
35. To put that into perspective, consider that he's had more Derby 
starters finish out of the money (26) than Thompson had starters 
(24), and more than twice as many as Jones (11). 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Lukas won this race was with Grindstone in 1996.  
That day, he also finished third, sixth, 10th and 18th in a 
19-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of the racing game may want magic, but he gives them  
science. They may want folksy, but he gives them corporate. They 
may want quality, but he force-feeds them quantity. 
</P>
<P>
	And what anyone else in the thoroughbred game wants only matters  
so much any more. Because Lukas has turned this joint into Wayne's 
World, claiming as big a chunk of it as anyone. That includes rival 
trainers and two-time Derby winners Bob Baffert and Nick Zito, with 
whom he was competing for the unofficial title of trainer of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be foolish to stand here and tell you I knew he was going  
to win this race,'' he said Saturday. ``But I'll say this: This 
horse had a great 60 days. And I'll say this: I misjudged this 
horse as much as any horse I've ever trained, and that's a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was talking about Charismatic, not Cat Thief -- we think. Then  
again, with Lukas, you can never be sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing is not supposed to be about numbers, but they're  
unavoidable when his name comes up. So here are a few more, packed 
together: 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime in the next six weeks, he will top $200 million in  
purse earnings. The feat becomes even more staggering when you 
consider that the late Charlie Whittingham, whose career stretched 
more than 50 years, was the only other trainer to break the $100 
million barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas' mounts have won more than 500 graded stakes races, a  
staggering 7 percent of all the graded stakes in the last 20 years. 
He has won 13 Breeders' Cups -- more than any other and 11 Triple 
Crown races -- including six in a row from 1994 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't cast spells over the game and its fans the way Jones  
and Whittingham did, but he doesn't have to. Overwhelming it 
apparently works just as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason he was ready to kiss Charismatic goodbye just six  
months ago is because he could. On any given day, a topflight 
trainer will have as many as 50 horses in his operation; Lukas' 
numbers tend to be between 100 and 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Most trainers can't keep track of that many horses, let alone  
find the cash to steer a few every year down the long and winding 
road that ends in the shadows of Churchill Downs' twin spires. 
Lukas believes he can't afford not to. 
</P>
<P>
	The real secret of his success is keeping them all separate.  
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Charismatic was eighth in the run down the  
backstretch and moved to fifth entering the final turn. By the time 
he was exiting the turn, he was third and driving, chasing Worldly 
Manner and Cat Thief. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, meanwhile, was watching from the grandstand, standing  
between Bill Young, who owned Cat Thief, and his wife, Laura, 
apparently a fan of 30-1 shot Charismatic, owned by Bob and Beverly 
Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``You talk about being in a spot,'' Lukas recalled.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was standing with my dearest friend in the world, Bill  
Young, and Cat Thief surged to the front and I said, `He hit the 
front; here we go!' 
</P>
<P>
	``And then I started hollering at my wife because Charismatic is  
coming on the outside. At that point, I didn't know if I should 
jump up and down, holler, throw the program, or what. But then I 
just said, `I might as well go for it. It's going to happen.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a fitting conclusion to a week that saw Lukas elected to  
the Hall of Fame, because for all his accomplishments, he has 
inspired equal parts scorn and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
	His rivals are put off because he has grooms manicure the  
grounds around his stable and stack the bridles and buckets and 
blankets just so. They make fun of the creases in his jeans, and 
the starch in his manner. 
</P>
<P>
	And not surprising, they wondered aloud whether his string was  
running out the last two years, when Lukas sent Deeds Not Words 
(13th and last in 1997) and Cape Town (fifth in 1998) to the Derby 
starting line, and neither came back with much to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Lukas tried not to gloat, but he did tell a story  
that had been relayed to him by some friends. After Cape Town 
washed out, some people were having breakfast with Whittingham and 
started gloating about the bad week Lukas was having. 
</P>
<P>
	``And Charlie told them, `Shhhhh. Better to let the sleeping dog  
lie.''' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Odds Are Against Flyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In their playoff history, the Philadelphia  
Flyers have come back from a 3-2 deficit in a best-of-7 series only 
once in eight tries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers find themselves in that very situation against the  
Toronto Maple Leafs heading into Sunday night's Game 6 of their 
Eastern Conference quarterfinal series. 
</P>
<P>
	While history is working against them, the Flyers say they can't  
be worried about a possible Game 7. They can only concern 
themselves with winning the next game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporadic goal production and erratic goaltending are two big  
reasons why the Flyers find themselves one loss away from a second 
straight first-round playoff exit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, who did not practice Saturday, have scored a total  
of eight goals in victories in Games 1 and 4 but only three in 
defeats in Games 2, 3 and 5, all by the score 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's adversity,'' Flyers forward Rod Brind'Amour said  
Saturday. ``We've got no tomorrow unless we win. I think we have to 
keep playing the way we've been playing and I believe we can get 
the puck to go in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Flyers expressed similar cautious optimism.  
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel that we can do this,'' forward John LeClair  
said. ``I don't think we can change much now. We had some pretty 
good chances (in Friday night's overtime loss at Toronto). They 
just didn't go in for us. When we get our chances, we have to make 
sure we put them in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers star center Eric Lindros, still recovering from a  
collapsed lung, did skate Saturday. He's been watching the series 
closely, in hopes of returning for a possible second-round matchup. 
Although he reiterated on Saturday that he will not be ready for 
either Game 6 or 7, he spoke confidently of his team's chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at the players we have and the grit we have in here,''  
he said. ``I'm confident we can win tomorrow (Sunday) and I'm 
confident we can win in Toronto. I wouldn't be doing this (training 
for a possible second round) if I wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers believe they need another strong defensive  
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had said before the series there would be three 2-1  
games, we would have said great,'' Flyers coach Roger Neilson said. 
``They have been tight-checking games that we wanted to play. But 
it hasn't worked out for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked to me like it (Game 5) was a little more wide open,  
which was probably to their advantage. We have to get back to 
playing more like we did in Games 2 and 4. I think the players are 
confident they can get back to playing a hard-checking game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To get to a Game 7, the Flyers must get better goaltending from  
John Vanbiesbrouck. The Maple Leafs have scored goals on three 
backhand, wide-angle shots in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto's sharpshooters are sensing that weakness.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like sometimes, at bad angles, they (weak shots) have  
trickled over his pad,'' Toronto's Mats Sundin said. ``But I think 
he's played well in the series. He's only allowed eight goals in 
five games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sundin said the Maple Leafs have some momentum after winning  
Game 5 in dramatic fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We showed a lot of character again, even though they got the  
lead again,'' he said. ``I don't think we've had the lead in the 
first period the whole series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hung there patiently. We've shown sometimes this year that  
when we get down a couple goals, we get frustrated and leave our 
game plan, but we stuck to it. We hung in there, hung in there, 
hung in there. And Cujo (goaltender Curtis Joseph) made some big 
stops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers' only successful rally from a 3-2 deficit took place  
in the 1989 playoffs when they beat the Penguins in Game 6 in 
Philadelphia and Game 7 in Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> No Retirement for Elderly Bandit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A 78-year-old career criminal who  
escaped from San Quentin Prison in a crude kayak two decades ago is 
in custody again, this time awaiting arraignment on bank robbery 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Potentially he's America's oldest bank robber,'' said  
sheriff's spokesman Kirk Englehardt. ``Apparently, this guy had no 
intention of stopping. This was his retirement plan, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forrest Silver Tucker is accused of holding up a Pompano Beach  
bank on April 22. He was ordered Friday to remain in jail until his 
arraignment next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Denver, meanwhile, 70-year-old Robert Boulies pleaded guilty  
Friday to robbing a bank just one day after he was released from 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like everyone else, you always think you'll get away with  
it,'' Boulies told the judge about the Dec. 31 heist. ``I just had 
$40, didn't have a job and nowhere to stay. I needed to survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida authorities had Tucker under surveillance even before  
the heist. On the day of the robbery, deputies were waiting for him 
at his wife's home. When he arrived, he led them on a high-speed 
chase before crashing into a palm tree. 
</P>
<P>
	In his car, deputies found more than $5,500 in cash from the  
robbery, a sawed-off assault rifle, two stocking masks, pepper 
spray, a police scanner and a New York detective badge. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked like he just came off the golf course,'' said Lt.  
James Chinn. ``You'd more expect to see him go to an early-bird 
special than robbing banks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, six weeks before his arrest, he underwent a surgical  
procedure for an irregular heart beat, Tucker told deputies. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinn said Tucker was the leader of the Over the Hill Gang, a  
group of elderly men who robbed banks and stores in Florida in the 
1980s. He said the FBI had been investigating Tucker in connection 
with several bank robberies in Florida over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker's attorney, Charles White, would not comment, but during  
the hearing argued for his client's release pending trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Tucker has an interesting past,'' White said. ``(But) the  
presumption of innocence still prevails.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker's criminal record goes back to 1936, when he was arrested  
at 15 for stealing a bicycle. In 1979, he was serving a 10-year 
robbery sentence at San Quentin when he and two inmates escaped in 
a kayak made in the prison wood shop out of pieces of plastic 
sheets, wood, duct tape and Formica. 
</P>
<P>
	The craft, painted bright blue on one side with the words  
Rub-a-Dub-Dub in red, floated the three to safety across San 
Francisco Bay. The two other inmates were caught within months. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker remained on the loose until 1983, when he was arrested  
after a shootout with the FBI in West Palm Beach and was charged 
with stealing more than $374,000 from a Boston bank. 
</P>
<P>
	He took three hostages during the shootout and was captured  
after he collapsed from four gunshot wounds. He was convicted a 
year later and released on parole in 1994. Authorities didn't 
realize that he still had time to serve in California.

<HEADLINE> Former La. Gov. Wins Runoff Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Former Gov. Dave Treen won a spot Saturday in  
a May 29 runoff to replace Bob Livingston in the House. Former Ku 
Klux Klan leader David Duke and state Rep. David Vitter vied for 
the second spot. 
</P>
<P>
	With 83 percent of the precincts reporting, Treen had 29,153  
votes, or 24 percent, followed by Vitter with 26,879 votes, or 22 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke received 22,981 votes, or 19 percent. Ophthalmologist  
Monica Monica had 18,468, or 15 percent. State Rep. Bill Strain had 
13,469, or 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston was in line to become House Speaker after more than  
20 years in Congress. But he abruptly announced his resignation in 
December after confessing to marital infidelities. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently endorsed Treen, a 70-year-old former Republican  
governor and himself a veteran of 7 1/2 years in Congress. But some 
Republicans feared Duke would return to haunt the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke enjoyed a surprising, if brief, run of political success 10  
years ago after joining the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	When Livingston announced his resignation in December, Duke was  
hawking an autobiography touting his theories that blacks have 
genetically low intelligence and raising the idea of a separate 
black homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced his candidacy the same day and said later this  
would be his last political race unless he won. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine candidates -- seven Republicans and two Democrats -- ran on  
one ballot under Louisiana's unique open primary system. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls indicated Treen would likely finish on top but would fall  
short of the majority needed for outright victory. A runoff is 
scheduled May 29 if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Strain, an 18-year veteran of the state House, was considered  
the Democrats' only hope of taking the seat, but he kept a 
relatively low profile throughout the campaign and his poll numbers 
were low. 
</P>
<P>
	The also-rans in the race included area businessman Rob Couhig  
and three unknowns: Republicans Patrick Landry and S.J. LoCoco, and 
Democrat Darryl Ward. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st District in the New Orleans suburbs is 85 percent white  
and predominantly Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen gained momentum last week when House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert said he would receive seniority credit for the 7 1/2 years he 
spent in Congress before being elected governor in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke narrowly won a spot in the state House from the suburb of  
Metairie in 1989. He went on to shock the nation by winning a spot 
in the 1991 runoff for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	After former Gov. Edwin Edwards beat him in a landslide that  
year, his political fortunes faded, marked by a weak run for 
president, an abandoned second try for governor in 1995 and a 
fourth-place finish in the 1996 U.S. Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his early start, his candidacy this time out was quickly  
overshadowed and largely ignored by the other candidates. Polls 
showed him with less than 10 percent support. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the election was seen as a test of his oft-repeated  
theory that he ``flies below radar,'' meaning his supporters rarely 
admit their preferences for him in polls.

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Suburban voters chose a successor to U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Former Gov. Dave Treen won a spot Saurday in  
a May 29 runoff to replace Bob Livingston in the House. State Rep. 
David Vitter qualified for the second spot, knocking out former Ku 
Klux Klan leader David Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	With 86 percent of the precincts reporting, Treen had 30,283  
votes, or 24 percent. Vitter had 27,955 votes, or 23 percent. Duke 
received 23,887 votes, or 19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ophthalmologist Monica Monica won 19,156 votes, or 15 percent.  
State Rep. Bill Strain had 13,650 votes, or 11 percent. Four other 
candidates split the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston was in line to become House Speaker after more than  
20 years in Congress. But he abruptly announced his resignation in 
December after confessing to marital infidelities. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently endorsed Treen, a 70-year-old former Republican  
governor and himself a veteran of 7 1/2 years in Congress. But some 
Republicans feared Duke would return to haunt the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke enjoyed a surprising, if brief, run of political success 10  
years ago after joining the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	When Livingston announced his resignation in December, Duke was  
hawking an autobiography touting his theories that blacks have 
genetically low intelligence and raising the idea of a separate 
black homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced his candidacy the same day and said later this  
would be his last political race unless he won. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine candidates -- seven Republicans and two Democrats -- ran on  
one ballot under Louisiana's unique open primary system. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls indicated Treen would likely finish on top but would fall  
short of the majority needed for outright victory. A runoff is 
scheduled May 29 if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Strain, an 18-year veteran of the state House, was considered  
the Democrats' only hope of taking the seat, but he kept a 
relatively low profile throughout the campaign and his poll numbers 
were low. 
</P>
<P>
	The also-rans in the race included area businessman Rob Couhig  
and three unknowns: Republicans Patrick Landry and S.J. LoCoco, and 
Democrat Darryl Ward. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st District in the New Orleans suburbs is 85 percent white  
and predominantly Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen gained momentum last week when House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert said he would receive seniority credit for the 7 1/2 years he 
spent in Congress before being elected governor in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke narrowly won a spot in the state House from the suburb of  
Metairie in 1989. He went on to shock the nation by winning a spot 
in the 1991 runoff for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	After former Gov. Edwin Edwards beat him in a landslide that  
year, his political fortunes faded, marked by a weak run for 
president, an abandoned second try for governor in 1995 and a 
fourth-place finish in the 1996 U.S. Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his early start, his candidacy this time out was quickly  
overshadowed and largely ignored by the other candidates. Polls 
showed him with less than 10 percent support. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the election was seen as a test of his oft-repeated  
theory that he ``flies below radar,'' meaning his supporters rarely 
admit their preferences for him in polls.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Prosecutors are seeking arrest  
warrants for 10 Honduran landowners on charges of killing at least 
42 Indian leaders over the past 12 years in land disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	The special prosecutor for ethnic rights, Gilberto Sanchez  
Chandias, announced the action at a news conference Saturday. He 
did not release the names of those sought, saying that could 
interfere with police actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian groups have long accused landlords, woodcutters and some  
soldiers of killing their leaders in conflicts over land in central 
Honduras, where some 12,000 members of the Lenca tribe live. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 percent of Honduras' 6.3 million people are Indians  
belonging to seven tribes. Most live in poverty and many have 
struggled against encroachments on their lands.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- With television cameras trained on  
the Congress floor, Brazilian politicians may have to watch what 
they mutter during debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Using footage from the parliamentary TV channel, a member of  
Congress is suing a colleague, alleging he swore at her and made 
impolite signals while she addressed the lower house last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Luiza Erundina did not hear the words of Marcio Reinaldo, who  
was sitting behind her, but she claims they can be lip-read from 
the footage, reported the O Globo newspaper Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinaldo, who made a signal calling for Erundina's microphone to  
be turned off, admitted being fed up with long and repetitive 
speeches but denied swearing, the daily said.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Two men, one of them a Colombian, have been  
sentenced to more than 13 years in prison for drug and firearms 
offenses, the federal attorney general's office said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Ivan Taborda Maya of Colombia was sentenced Wednesday to  
17 1/2 years in prison for transporting and possessing cocaine, the 
office said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The court in the central state of Jalisco also sentenced Oscar  
Enrique Diaz Gonzalez to 13 years and 5 months prison for 
possessing cocaine and other charges, including firearms offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were captured in Guadalajara in May 1996 with 231 pounds  
of cocaine. Taborda transported cocaine in fruit trucks from 
Tapachula near the Guatemalan border, the attorney general's office 
said.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Bank machines, cell phones, beepers and  
broadcasts were disrupted Saturday when Mexico's Solidaridad I 
communications satellite went out of service for the second time in 
four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers for Satelites Mexicanos, which runs the satellite,  
discovered a problem Saturday morning and had to take it out of 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Moret, a spokesman for the company, told the Formato 21  
radio station that it was not clear how long the satellite would be 
out of service. He said the problem was not as serious as 
Wednesday's cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the satellite slipped slightly out of its orbit,  
causing scattered disruptions in television and radio broadcasts 
and beeper services. The problem was resolved within hours.

<HEADLINE> Blues' OT Win Over Coyotes Typical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues earned another home playoff  
game, which may not necessarily be an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues' attempt to rally from a 3-1 series deficit against  
the Phoenix Coyotes continues on Sunday with Game 6. But both of 
their victories have come away from the Kiel Center, where they 
were only one game above .500 in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, they concluded the regular season 14-4-1 on  
the road, and the home team has only one victory this series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that Phoenix did not want to make that trip,'' said  
wing Scott Young, whose overtime goal in Game 5 kept the Blues 
alive. ``Hopefully, that's a bit of an edge for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing 2-1 in Game 5 didn't seem to rob the Coyotes of any  
confidence, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just got to keep our heads above water and be ready to  
go,'' captain Keith Tkachuk said. ``We won two games in their 
building before, and we can do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 6 will start only 36 hours after Young beat Nikolai  
Khabibulin to end Game 5, making this the series' second rapid 
turnaround. The Blues didn't return home until 5 a.m. Saturday, and 
canceled a scheduled workout. 
</P>
<P>
	That could be an advantage to the Coyotes, since 36-year-old  
Blues goalie Grant Fuhr had his worst game by far of the series the 
last time he played on little rest. Playing on 20 hours rest, Fuhr 
allowed four goals in 10 shots and was yanked early in the second 
period with the Blues trailing 4-0 in an eventual 5-4 loss in Game 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to believe in yourself at this point in time,'' Fuhr  
said. ``We got one in overtime, and now we've got to go back home 
and dig deep and get another one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes also believe it's better to get right back on the  
ice after a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to happen pretty quick, so we don't have much time  
to think about it,'' Tkachuk said. ``Which is good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series has been extremely tight, with the last four games  
decided by one goal. The only exception is the Blues' 3-1 road 
victory in Game 1, and that combined with a lack of home-ice 
advantage makes for some uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't really matter where you play nowadays, it seems,  
especially in our series,'' Coyotes right wing Rick Tocchet said. 
``We're a good road club, St. Louis is a good road club, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rallying from a 3-1 deficit isn't as rare of a feat as it used  
to be. Six teams have done it in the 1990s and that includes the 
Blues, who beat Detroit in the first round in 1991. Twice this 
decade, the Coyotes, in their former guise as the Winnipeg Jets, 
have been the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully with a good effort, maybe a few breaks, we can win  
Game 6,'' right wing Terry Yake said. ``When you've got a Game 7, 
it's a crapshoot, it's anybody's series, and right now that's what 
we're hoping for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tocchet said the Coyotes could have buried the Blues in Game 3  
with the early 4-0 lead, but relaxed and let St. Louis rally to 
lose a tight 5-4 game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still won the game, but that's a lesson,'' Tocchet said.  
``You've got to put your foot on the snake and kill it. It can come 
back and bite you.''

<HEADLINE> Thousands Rally Against Army School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Singing and carrying a colorful array of  
banners, thousands of protesters rallied near the White House 
Saturday against an Army school in Georgia that has trained Latin 
American soldiers who were later accused of human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	With a large black-and-white skull topped with a graduate's  
mortarboard as a backdrop, speakers from Haiti, Mexico, Honduras, 
Colombia, Chile and Guatemala detailed what they said were acts of 
torture and repression carried out by the school's graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	The School of the Americas, in Georgia, has trained more than  
50,000 Latin American soldiers over the past 50 years and has been 
targeted by church activists since the disclosure that 19 of the 25 
Salvadoran officers linked to the 1989 slaying of six Jesuit 
priests were graduates. The protesters want it closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders of the school maintain it should not be held  
responsible for the acts of a few of its graduates. They argue the 
school, which has added human rights courses in recent years, plays 
an important part in the U.S. effort to foster democracy in Latin 
America.

<HEADLINE> Good Times Roll for Many Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sumaya Hoggard steps out of her home and sees her family's  
future in the empty lot next door in Chicago's trendy Bucktown 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hoggard and her husband, Troy, both architects, plan to  
build a three-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath house on the 3,500-square-foot lot, 
with an open floor plan, fireplaces, courtyard lawn and modern 
interiors. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost will be astronomical, but the first-time mother-to-be  
smiles confidently: the future is bright and, like many Americans, 
they're letting the good times roll. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a spur-of-the-moment decision,'' she says, one that  
required dipping into savings. ``It's obviously going to be more 
expensive to build a home than to buy one, but we wanted to design 
it ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the economy continuing to grow at a remarkable rate, many  
Americans are confidently buying more cars and homes and expanding 
their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported Friday that the economy grew at  
a strong 4.5 percent rate in the first three months of the year as 
consumers spent at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Housing 
construction, which has been propelled by low mortgage rates and 
low unemployment, jumped 15.6 percent, the fastest advance in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good economy is also hindering us,'' Mrs. Hoggard notes.  
``The market is so tight that any builder you talk to has so much 
work to do, so many projects, that they don't have the time to do 
what we want done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strong spending has been bolstered by the lowest  
unemployment in nearly three decades, record highs for consumer 
confidence, and a soaring stock market that now is reaching for the 
11,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are so confident that they are dipping heavily into  
savings to finance their buying binge. The personal savings rate, 
savings as a percentage of disposable income, dropped to a record 
minus-0.5 percent in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the strong consumer demand and tight labor  
markets, inflation remained a no-show in the first three months of 
the year. A price measure tied to the gross domestic product rose 
at an annual rate of just 1 percent, little changed from a 0.9 
percent increase in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the best-of-both-worlds situation when it comes to the  
ordinary citizen: jobs are available and inflation is in check,'' 
said Robert Dederick, an economist with Northern Trust Co. in 
Chicago. ``People are feeling good and they're spending, and even 
though this economic expansion has run a long time, it doesn't show 
any signs that its demise is anywhere imminent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Klein Jewelers in downtown Portland, Ore., Kathie Hellwege  
greets a business-suited customer who says he's ``shopping for a 
special lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing Hellwege has noticed about the economy is that gold  
jewelry is not just for weddings and anniversaries anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're buying it for more occasions, just little things,''  
she says. ``A lot of ladies are buying little things for 
themselves. Guys will buy things for themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Down the street, John Doyle stands at a cart, busy serving up  
fish-shaped cornbreads with various fillings for $1 each to a 
hungry lunch crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his partner, Sean Brown, made their startup money  
teaching English in Asia -- before an economic crisis swept across 
the world while leaving America largely unaffected. The cash helped 
them buy a house, and the good economic times here are giving them 
ideas of expanding their business -- named No Fish! Go Fish! -- into 
a sit-down restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``This business has been better than our house,'' he says.  
``Right now we're just putting all of it into building up our 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others haven't seen the benefits of the strong economy, but  
share the confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	William Walker, 33, of Philadelphia, has been out of work for  
nearly three years and is living in a homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still keeps track of the stock market and the Dow as he  
plans to return to school in the fall to study civil engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable. I wish I was able to take part in it,'' he  
says as he walks to pick up a check at the social services office. 
``By the end of the year, I think it could hit 13 (thousand).'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Notes From the 125th Kentucky Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- For bettors enthused about Worldly  
Manner, there was good news from England early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At Newmarket, Dubai-trained Island Sands won the 2,000 Guineas  
race, the first Classic of the British racing season, by a 
half-length over Enrique. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Island Sands and Worldly Manner are owned by Godolphin  
Racing, the Dubai branch of Sheikh Maktoum al Maktoum's racing 
operation. Both are trained by Saeed bin Suroor. And both were 
unraced in about eight months going into Saturday's races. 
</P>
<P>
	Island Sands was coming off a layoff of 260 days since his last  
formal race. And Worldly Manner last ran at Del Mar on Sept. 8, 
when he won the Del Mar Futurity by five lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheikh Maktoum purchased Worldly Manner from his breeders, John  
and Betty Mabee, last summer for $5 million and kept the horse in 
Dubai over the winter. His only race this year prior to the Derby 
was in an informal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Many have questioned whether Worldly Manner can win the Derby  
without undergoing the usual run of American prep races. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WIRE TO WIRE:*With 19 horses in the field, Saturday's Kentucky  
Derby figured to be a wide-open affair. One thing it did not figure 
to involve was a wire-to-wire winner. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 124-year history of the race prior to Saturday, just 21  
horses had won while leading at each point of call during the race. 
And only four horses had won wire-to-wire in the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Riva Ridge led all the way in 1972, Bold Forbes in 1976, Spend a  
Buck in 1985 and, most recently, the filly Winning Colors in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IN THE BLINK:* Five horses went into the Derby having benefited  
from the addition of blinkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Adonis, First American, General Challenge, Prime Timber and  
Three Ring all added blinkers this spring, then won their first 
race with the devices, which limit a horse's peripheral vision, 
forcing them to focus on the road ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Adonis added blinkers, then won the Wood Memorial, while First  
American put them on for his Flamingo Stakes win. Prime Timber won 
the San Felipe in his first start with blinkers, then finished 
second in the Santa Anita Derby to General Challenge, a first-time 
blinkers wearer. And Three Ring had two straight easy wins after 
she added blinkers, including a 14 3/4-length win in the Davona Dale. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FRESH VOICE:* Even before the horses crossed the finish line in  
the 125th Kentucky Derby, Luke Kruytbosch fulfilled the dream of a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one week into his new job as Churchill Downs' on-track  
announcer, the 36-year-old Kruytbosch called his first Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first started calling races, the general manager who  
hired me asked about my goals and I told him that one day I wanted 
to call the Kentucky Derby,'' he said. ``I just get chills thinking 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kruytbosch was just the fifth on-track announcer at Churchill  
since the track installed a public address system in 1940. He took 
over from Kurt Becker, who resigned after a brief two-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to coming to Churchill, Kruytbosch was the track announcer  
at Hollywood Park in Los Angeles, where he had been since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Moehler Ejected for Scuffing Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Brian Moehler walked to the dugout,  
nothing in his stride or demeanor indicating he had just been 
thrown out of a game for something he insists he didn't do. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Tigers right-hander denied having a small piece of  
sandpaper attached to his left thumb when he was ejected during 
Saturday night's 4-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was just not his nature to protest the finding of  
umpire Larry Barnett in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the type of person that's ill-natured or going to go  
up there and scream and yell and make a big stink out of it,'' said 
Moehler, who probably faces a suspension. ``He was doing his job. 
... I was so shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays became suspicious of the Tigers pitcher because  
the movement on some of his pitches seemed uncharacteristic of the 
right-hander, who allowed four runs, seven hits, walked one and 
struck out five in 6 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild asked Barnett, the plate  
umpire, the procedure for checking Moehler at the beginning of the 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Three batters latter -- after Paul Sorrento and Mike DiFelice had  
singled with one out -- Rothschild went to Barnett again and 
requested he take a close look at the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran out there and I said, `Let me see your glove.' He took  
his glove off and he held his thumb like that (facing his palm four 
fingers up). I looked at his glove and then I said, `Give me your 
thumb.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett said the sandpaper, which he described as smaller than a  
dime, appeared to be glued to Moehler's thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not confiscate it. Had it been on his glove, I would  
have taken his glove. I did not take the sandpaper off. As God is 
my witness, it was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear that Moehler was ejected. There was no visible  
reaction from the Tigers or Devil Rays and -- as far as Detroit 
manager Larry Parrish was concerned -- time for a pitching change 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Sean Runyan walked the next batter, Kevin Stocker, to  
load the bases, then gave up Randy Winn's sacrifice fly that broke 
a 3-3 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know exactly what went on out there. I know what Larry  
said, the reason for it,'' Parrish said. ``As far as I was 
concerned, I'm just worried about bringing a pitcher in to get the 
next guy out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish called the Devil Rays decision to ask Barnett to check  
Moehler ``a bootleg thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying that Mo does or does not. I'm just saying that  
in the major leagues, as long as I can remember, that's sort of 
been part of baseball,'' Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a pitching staff in baseball that don't have guys  
that deface a ball occasionally, including Roger Clemens and Nolan 
Ryan. Even guys that throw like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay slugger Jose Canseco, who leads the majors with 10  
homers, was 0-for-3 with one strikeout against Moehler. He seemed 
amused by the ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, he's a carpenter,'' he joked about the sandpaper. ``Maybe  
I should cork my bat now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild, a former pitching coach, said he wouldn't have  
protested unless he was certain Moehler was cheating. He didn't 
have harsh words for the Detroit pitcher, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the first time it's ever been done, believe me. And  
it's not going to be the last time,'' the Tampa Bay manager said. 
``Frankly, I don't blame the guy. I know the rules of the game, and 
everything else. But ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild didn't finish the sentence.  
</P>
<P>
	Moehler said he will consider appealing the finding. Asked if he  
could win, he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. I would like to, but who's word are you going to  
believe? And Barnett's a good umpire. He was doing his job. I'm not 
mad at anybody in any sense.''

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Needs Good Day in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt doesn't call it the moment  
of truth, although he admits the California 500 could be a telling 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time Winston Cup champion is coming off a victory last  
Sunday in Talladega, Ala., that ended a 40-race winless string and 
boosted Earnhardt into a tie with teammate Mike Skinner for ninth 
place in the season standings. 
</P>
<P>
	If Earnhardt, who turned 48 on Thursday, is to really compete  
for his first series title since 1994, he has to build on that win, 
piling up some top fives and top 10s over the next few weeks and 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to keep it going,'' said Earnhardt, who had only three  
top 10s in the eight races prior to Talladega. ``We proved 
something to ourselves and some other people in that race. I think 
it gave everybody on the (Richard) Childress team some new 
confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His jump into the top 10 was a timely one since qualifying for  
Sunday's race was rained out and the front of the 43-car field was 
determined by car-owner points, meaning Earnhardt's Chevrolet will 
start 10th on the 2-mile California Speedway oval. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a big improvement over last year, when he struggled to  
qualify and had to use the provisional berth for former series 
champions to get the 43rd starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his poor qualifying effort, Earnhardt ran well in the  
race and finished ninth for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like this track,'' Earnhardt said. ``You can really race  
here. It's wide, like Michigan, but it doesn't have the high 
banking like Michigan. You've got a couple of (racing) grooves and 
you can really race each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until last Sunday, Earnhardt had not led a lap this season. Now,  
he said, it's ``very important ... to keep some consistency going'' 
at California. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made some mistakes and we've had some bad luck this  
year, but we know this team is capable of running up front,'' he 
said. ``We've got great cars, good engines and the pit stops are as 
good as anybody's. Now, we just have to go out and put it all 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Series points leader Jeff Burton will start at the front,  
alongside fellow Ford driver Dale Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Right behind will be the Ford of defending race champion Mark  
Martin, the Pontiac of Bobby Labonte and the Chevrolet of Jeff 
Gordon, the winner of the inaugural Winston Cup race here in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, the two-time defending Winston Cup champion, crashed at  
Talladega and finished 36th, dropping him to fifth for the season, 
210 points behind Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to be consistent,'' Gordon said. ``There's still 25  
races this season, so all we have to do to get back into it is go 
out there and finish races and start piling up those top fives and 
top 10s. I know we're still in this thing very solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Earnhardt, Gordon says California Speedway, where he has  
finished first and fourth, is a good place to begin moving up. 
</P>
<P>
	``After you crash like we did last week, sometimes you can get a  
little tentative the next week, especially if you're at a track 
that's real tough,'' Gordon said. ``But this place is nice and wide 
and racey. You can go out and run hard and get yourself into a good 
rhythm. I'm looking forward to getting going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said that ``nobody who really knows Winston Cup racing  
ever doubted that Dale Earnhardt can still win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that he's up front again, it just makes it harder for us,  
another tough guy to beat.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-FSU Player Is Denied Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State defensive tackle Bryne  
Malone was denied bond at his first court appearance on attempted 
murder charges Saturday, a day after his arrest in connection with 
a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, 22, a sophomore last season, was kicked off the football  
team. He was charged with six counts of attempted first-degree 
murder and one count of possession of a firearm during the 
commission of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone and another man, Julian Moore, 20, allegedly drove up to  
a house in a white two-door hatchback early Friday and fired shots 
at the home of several FSU students. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Malone and Moore denied involvement, police said.  
</P>
<P>
	Larry Smith, a nose guard who played two seasons with Malone at  
FSU, said he was shocked to hear of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty much a quiet person throughout the time I've  
been around him. I wouldn't expect anything like this from him, if 
he really did it,'' said Smith, a second-round draft choice of the 
Jacksonville Jaguars last month. ``I guess it was a case of him 
hanging around the wrong kind of crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Moore was in the car with Malone and had a running  
dispute with the students who lived at the house. Moore was charged 
with four counts of attempted first-degree murder and one count of 
possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. He also 
was ordered held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7, 263-pound Malone played in nine games last season,  
recording 14 tackles and a sack. 
</P>
<P>
	He went into spring practice competing against four freshmen for  
key backup roles to defensive linemen Corey Simon and Jerry 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	After spring practice, Malone was listed on the depth chart as  
Johnson's backup at defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	FSU defensive back Abdual Howard said Malone's absence on the  
field will be felt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big loss,'' he said. ``We were counting on him to be a  
major contributor this year.''

<HEADLINE> Eleven Die in Tourist Boat Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- An amphibious tourist boat sank  
Saturday, drowning 11 people as panicked passengers scrambled for 
life preservers and nearby residents rushed to their boats to pluck 
victims from choppy water on a lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The open-air, World War II-vintage boat sank quickly on Lake  
Hamilton near this popular tourist town. A cloth canopy may have 
trapped the victims as the wheeled craft went down less than a mile 
offshore, Mayor Bob Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	A survivor, Gary Ledin, said there was little time to react.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't believe how fast that thing sank,'' he said. He was  
on the boat with his wife, Diann, who also survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Three children were among the dead, including a 2-year-old and a  
5-year-old. Eight of 20 people on board survived, including the 
driver. Only one person was hospitalized and remained on life 
support at a hospital later Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard was investigating and authorities had no  
explanation at a news conference for why the boat took on water. 
The boat had not been recovered from the lake by late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong wind made the water rough when the accident occurred on  
the lake lined by hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	The wheeled craft, known as a ``duck,'' was required to carry  
life preservers but passengers were not required to wear them, 
Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat is equipped for both land and water, with three axles,  
six wheels and the ability to hold 25 or 26 people, including an 
operator who rides in the front. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically a boat hull on wheels,'' said Coast Guard Lt.  
Bruce Fisher, chief of port operations at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat sank in one or two minutes, said City Manager Kent  
Myers. Ledin said it felt more like 30 seconds. Ledin said it felt 
more like 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents rushed to their boats to assist when they saw the  
craft going down. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people in the nearby condos saw what was happening, they  
rushed to their boats and went out to help,'' said Joe Sexson, 
director of emergency services for nearby Hot Springs National 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A list of the victims was not expected until Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Hot Springs is about an hour southwest of Little Rock and is  
popular with boaters and sightseers. After the Oaklawn Park 
thoroughbred racing season ends each April, visitors flock to 
several lakes or to Bathhouse Row, the anchor of the national park 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The amphibious boats have rolled and floated through Hot Springs  
for 40 years, offering their guests scenic views of the century-old 
bathhouses. The ducks, whose tickets cost $9, ferry visitors among 
the city's tourist attractions and to the scenic lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said the duck that sank was owned by White &AMP; Yellow Duck  
Sightseeing Tours and operated by its subsidiary, Land and Lake 
Tours Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicles are generally World War II surplus built for the  
Army to carry troops directly from land into the water, Fisher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically a boat hull on wheels,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The boats are inspected by the Coast Guard annually, usually in  
late fall or winter when the tourist season is quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Bridges, who owns White &AMP; Yellow, said his boats are well  
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always tried to make our operation as safe as possible  
and go to great lengths to maintain our ducks and equipment to the 
highest standards and to properly train our drivers,'' he said. 
``Unfortunately, sometimes, even when you do your best, accidents 
will happen.''

<HEADLINE> Voters Pick Livingston Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Suburban voters chose a successor to Rep. Bob  
Livingston on Saturday in an election that could seal the political 
future of former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gov. Dave Treen and state Rep. David Vitter jumped to an  
early lead. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke was in third 
place in what may be his final political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	With 19 of 486 precincts reporting, Treen led with 1,214 votes,  
or 23 percent, followed by Vitter with 981 votes for 19 percent. 
Duke had 961 votes, or 19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates Monica Monica, an ophthalmologist, had 887 votes, or  
17 percent; state Rep. Bill strain had 785, or 15 percent; and 
businessman Rob Couhig had 294, or 6 percent. Three other 
candidates had the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston was in line to become House Speaker after more than  
20 years in Congress. But he abruptly announced his resignation in 
December after confessing to marital infidelities. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently endorsed Treen, a 70-year-old former Republican  
governor and himself a veteran of 7 1/2 years in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Republicans feared Duke would return to haunt the  
party. The ex-KKK leader enjoyed a surprising, if brief, run of 
political success 10 years ago after joining the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	When Livingston announced his resignation in December, Duke was  
hawking a new autobiography touting his theories that blacks have 
genetically low intelligence and raising the idea of a separate 
black homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced his candidacy the same day and said later this  
would be his last political race unless he won. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine candidates -- seven Republicans and two Democrats -- ran on  
one ballot under Louisiana's unique open primary system. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls indicated Treen would likely finish on top but would fall  
short of the majority needed for outright victory. A runoff is 
scheduled May 29 if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Strain, an 18-year veteran of the state House, was considered  
the Democrats' only hope of taking the seat, but he kept a 
relatively low profile throughout the campaign and his poll numbers 
were low. 
</P>
<P>
	The other candidates were political unknowns: Republicans  
Patrick Landry and S.J. LoCoco, and Democrat Darryl Ward. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st District in the New Orleans suburbs is 85 percent white  
and predominantly Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen gained momentum last week when House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert said he would receive seniority credit for the 7 1/2 years he 
spent in Congress before being elected governor in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke narrowly won a spot in the state House from the suburb of  
Metairie in 1989. He went on to shock the nation by winning a spot 
in the 1991 runoff for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	After former Gov. Edwin Edwards beat him in a landslide that  
year, his political fortunes faded, marked by a weak run for 
president, an abandoned second try for governor in 1995 and a 
fourth-place finish in the 1996 U.S. Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his early start, his candidacy this time out was quickly  
overshadowed and largely ignored by the other candidates. Polls 
showed him with less than 10 percent support. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the election was seen as a test of his oft-repeated  
theory that he ``flies below radar,'' meaning his supporters rarely 
admit their preferences for him in polls.

<HEADLINE> Fish Patrol Guards Frigid Frontier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ON PATROL ON THE BERING SEA (AP) -- Nothing marks the boundary  
that runs down the middle of this vast, frigid waterworld. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet dozens of fishing boats cluster around it. Coast Guard  
cutters prowl along it. Surveillance jets and helicopters swoop 
over it. And, sometimes, shots are fired when poachers pay no 
attention to it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian-U.S. maritime line slices across the Bering Sea, the  
richest fishing grounds left in an overfished world and the latest 
front in the global free-for-all for control of humanity's watery 
commons. 
</P>
<P>
	It's where the Storis, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter, is on patrol  
this evening, pitching over watery hills in a nonstop hunt for 
foreign trawlers that sneak into American waters to fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Christina Dutton, into her 16th hour on duty, balances  
herself on the slanting bridge in the green glow of a radar screen, 
her red-rimmed eyes checking and rechecking the blips and dots and 
lines that will alert her to an intruder. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the line, you can't let your guard down,'' she says, then  
turns back to the navigation charts, the dials, the computer 
monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Out here, the line means everything to everyone except the  
prize: the pollock swimming 60 stories below the surface. In the 
darkness of the deep, they glide in silvery clouds, millions upon 
millions of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Once deemed fit solely for animal feed, pollock is perennially  
the second or third most consumed seafood in America. The fish 
appear in fast-food restaurants as fillets, on dinner tables as 
fish cakes and artificial crab and lobster salads. They are ground 
into a powdery flour for breads and pastries. In Japan, they're 
minced into paste for a multitude of foods known as ``kamaboko.'' 
Pollock roe, the fish egg sacs inside female pollock, fetch high 
prices in Asia, where they are delicacies. 
</P>
<P>
	These fish, the backbone of Alaska's fishing industry, represent  
about half of the 4 billion pounds of seafood swept from Alaskan 
waters each year -- a $1 billion business in a good year. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, everyone wants a piece of the pollock.  
</P>
<P>
	On the Russian side, dozens of trawlers from Japan, China, South  
Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Poland and Norway work unchecked, having 
paid the cash-starved Russian government for fishing permits. 
</P>
<P>
	These floating factories hum 24 hours a day, scooping up catches  
so large that managers measure them in hundreds of tons, with nets 
so enormous that each could hold a dozen jumbo jets. 
</P>
<P>
	With each passing year, the catch dwindles, and the vessels  
creep closer and closer to the line in the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	On the American side, the U.S. Coast Guard watches and waits.  
</P>
<P>
	Day and night, helicopters, C-130 planes and four cutters patrol  
a line as long as the road from Boston to Miami. Mission: To keep 
out hit-and-run trawlers that have already depleted the waters on 
the Russian side. 
</P>
<P>
	These men and women also work 24 hours a day, repairing engines  
and mopping galleys and running fire drills. And always -- always -- 
they must scan for rogue trawlers that sit on the line, waiting for 
their chance to pilfer a ton or two of fish. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no glory in being a fish cop. There are 20-hour shifts,  
monotonous tasks, mess-hall leftovers, cramped quarters, bad 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Squalls erupt in minutes, sometimes three or four in an  
afternoon. Blizzards dissolve horizons. Gale-force winds whip up 
swells as high as five-story buildings. Cold snaps freeze waves in 
mid-curl. Even a summer sun can hide in an instant behind freezing 
fog, sleet. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's the isolation that, as Ricky Dickerson of  
Booneville, Miss., has learned after a month away from land, chips 
away at the nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, the 18-year-old ``boot'' -- a word that means rookie  
-- is halfway through a four-hour watch on the flying bridge of the 
Storis, the Coast Guard's oldest active cutter, built in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson is fighting the roll, a wind chill of 10 below zero,  
the flesh-freezing spray, the thought that his sweetheart may not 
wait for him to finish his tour. There's nothing but a desert of 
water in his binoculars and wind that roars like a prehistoric 
animal in his ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson's lips crack as he grins. ``If you're looking for the  
end of the world,'' he says, ``you found it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	During a surveillance flight last May off the southwestern tip  
of the Aleutian Islands, a C-130 crew spotted trouble: Five foreign 
trawlers on the wrong side of the maritime line were catching 
salmon with 10-mile-long drift nets -- a violation of a U.N. ban on 
drift-net fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	While three Coast Guard cutters steamed to the scene, the  
trawlers cut their nets loose and scattered. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the poachers got away. But the cutter Boutwell  
intercepted a Russian trawler, handed over custody to Russian 
authorities, then stopped a Chinese ship after a 1,200-mile, 
four-day chase through a typhoon. The cutter Jarvis caught up to 
the fourth poacher, a Chinese ship, near Japan a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the cutter Polar Sea was tracking the last trawler  
deep into Russian territory. For three days the Chinese vessel 
zigzagged in heavy fog and rain. Then a Russian patrol boat 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the Polar Sea turned to head back to Alaska, the  
Russian boat opened fire on the fishing vessel. The trawler's 
skipper and a navigator were killed. Three other fishermen were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not just an ocean -- it's a battlefield,'' says Lt.  
Eric Vogelbacher, a 30-year-old helicopter pilot from Long Beach, 
Calif., who took part in the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also a complex, largely hidden web of life.  
</P>
<P>
	Inhabited by whales the size of ships and diatoms as small as a  
single cell, the Bering Sea pulses with at least 525 species of 
fish, shellfish, marine mammals and sea birds. This 
800,000-square-mile wilderness supports the world's most extensive 
eelgrass bed, the world's largest salmon grounds. It produces more 
than half of the nation's seafood. 
</P>
<P>
	And it is showing signs of stress.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bering Sea's fur seal population is declining. Several  
species of crab and sea birds, including the red-legged kittiwakes, 
are dwindling. The Steller sea lion, the mammal at the top of the 
Bering Sea's life chain, is endangered. Pollock, the sea's most 
abundant fish, has shrunk to half its 1985 population. And trawler 
nets that sweep ocean floors in pursuit of bottomfish like pollock 
often act like wrecking balls, disrupting plankton, plants and a 
myriad of microorganisms that whales need to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Climatic shifts or sudden changes in currents may play a role,  
but a growing number of scientists say the Bering Sea is 
overfished. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, a  
federal body largely comprised of industry representatives, issued 
an emergency order banning pollock fishing around the Aleutian 
Islands, where the fish spawn. It also reduced, at least 
temporarily, the catch limit by more than 10 percent -- which will 
cost the Alaskan fishing industry $50 million in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, quotas and controls drawn up in conference halls in  
Anchorage don't mean much 1,000 miles west, where roughly 70 
trawlers are roaming the Russian side of that invisible boundary, 
waiting for the Coast Guard's resolve to crack. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Daniels is hunched over a radar screen, studying bunches of  
green dots. That is the way the 100-ton trawlers appear on the 
console of a four-engine C-130 cruising 2,500 feet above the Bering 
Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the ships appear to be working on the Russian side of  
the sea boundary. Six are close to the line, and one is right on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The navigator frowns. ``Got one, boys -- right on the yellow  
brick road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels and six other Coast Guard airmen are collecting evidence  
of foreign vessels poaching in American waters. Every day, planes 
like this one do a 90-minute sweep up the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's heading U.S.?'' asks the pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Rocky Lee.  
</P>
<P>
	``Looking like it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Lee and his co-pilot, Lt. Dan Rocco, nose the transport into a  
dive. Tim Sheffler, the radioman, punches the ship's coordinates 
into a laptop computer and hails the Sherman, a Coast Guard cutter 
that is a few miles south. 
</P>
<P>
	The C-130 drops to 300 feet. ``Ship has just crossed over into  
American waters,'' Daniels says. ``Two thousands yards to mark ... 
There she is!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jet thunders over the blue-hulled ship, the word KAYZER on  
its bow, Russian flags whipping from its mast. The trawler veers 
west, back into Russian territory. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll let this one go, Sheffler says. The trawler didn't have  
its nets in the water and, in these post-Cold War times, it's 
better to make friends with the country that divides the patrolling 
duties on the Bering Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we'd have shown up here an hour or two later, we'd have  
caught 'em fishing,'' he says. ``But we did fine. It's a deterrent 
thing. Next time, the Kayzer will think twice about putting her 
hand in the cookie jar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In no more than 30 seconds, the skies go black. Hail the size of  
eggs bat-bat-batters the windscreen. Spindrift like talcum powder 
clings to the 133-foot-long wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee pulls the jumbo up and flicks on a de-icer, which heats the  
outer shell to 600 degrees. ``Without it,'' he says, ``we'd be a 
Popsicle in minutes and crash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's mission is over; all Lee can do is take his crew back to  
the Kodiak air base, four hours away. 
</P>
<P>
	In the churning seas below, the cutters are on their own.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Waves the color of bruises wallop the hull of the Sherman.  
Plumes of spray engulf the bow. There are no other boats, no 
planes, no birds in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	A month earlier, this cutter was prowling around Central America  
for Colombian drug runners. Today it's steaming across the Bering 
Sea to relieve the Storis, which has been patrolling a 175-mile 
stretch of the maritime line. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next three weeks, every crew member of the Sherman can  
expect to put in 18-hour days, sail 8,000 miles and feel the 
knuckles of at least three arctic storms. 
</P>
<P>
	Their ship can take a beating. Sleek, steel and 378 feet long,  
the Sherman can make sharp turns in angry seas. In her belly sits 
100 tons of ballast to snap her upright when she keels more than 40 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, the cutter is quick: It cruises at 14 knots -- and can  
hit dash speeds of 27 -- with two 3,500-horsepower diesel engines 
and twin 18,000-horsepower gas turbines. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one's outrunning us,'' says Capt. Robert M. Wicklund, 46, a  
25-year veteran from Tenino, Wash., who's been at the Sherman's 
helm for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also Wicklund's job to see that poachers don't outwit or  
outwait them. 
</P>
<P>
	He likes to approach the line in darkness and mingle with a pack  
of vessels, pretending to be a fishing boat. Radio is cut, engines 
slowed. Then the cutter zigzags like a vessel pursuing a school of 
fish. Sometimes the Sherman reconfigures its deck lighting to look 
like a trawler. Or it will wait for heavy fog or rain and go to 
``Dog Zebra'' -- code for lights out. ``We like to sneak up on the 
buggers, then pounce,'' Wicklund says. 
</P>
<P>
	For a 3,070-ton vessel to pounce, all 147 men and 20 women in  
the crew must know their duties well enough to perform them in the 
dark. 
</P>
<P>
	It means Ryan Curry, a 19-year-old apprentice seaman from  
Seattle, has to be wide awake and on the flying bridge at 2 a.m. 
for his four-hour watch -- even after a 16-hour day of fire drills, 
cleanup detail and messenger duty that ended at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	It means that in the bowels of the ship, where engines scream  
like jetliner turbines, Lt. Jeff Brown and his ``A-gang'' of 
auxiliary engineers must be able to crank up power at a moment's 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
	It means weapons officer Chris Randolph and his gunners must  
always be ready to use the 25-millimeter guns to ``persuade'' ships 
to heel for an inspection boarding. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone breaks down, that puts lives in jeopardy,'' says  
Lt. Jeff Haukom, a 27-year-old operations officer from San Diego. 
``On the Bering Sea, there's no room for mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or comfort.  
</P>
<P>
	Corridors, gangways, stairwells accommodate one set of shoulders  
at a time. Shower stalls are stainless steel boxes, 2 feet by 2 
feet wide, 7 feet high and icy to the touch. Crew members compact 
belongings into lockers 18 inches by 30 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Sleeping is on ``racks'' -- bunks as wide and soft as closet  
shelves. Each comes with a roll bar (to keep people from landing in 
a roommate's bunk), wool blanket, a tiny light bulb to read a Tom 
Clancy novel by. 
</P>
<P>
	``Invite 150 people over to your house, shut all the doors and  
windows, and try to get along for three months. That's how it's 
like living on board,'' says Lt. Taina Fonseca, 25, an assistant 
weapons officer from the Island of Vieques, off Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a place where people don't stand on deck, they lean  
against rolls. A place where black leather boots, belts and gloves 
must be polished each morning to keep from ``salting.'' Where crew 
members go to work with plastic bags and pills for seasickness. 
</P>
<P>
	On a cutter, the air smells as if someone had put lube oil in a  
humidifier instead of water. The iron floor and cork-covered walls 
throb day and night, as if a lawnmower were left running in the 
next room. Letters arrive four weeks late and rarely in the order 
written. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, the morale on the Sherman remains kinetic, expectant as  
the ship approaches the line in the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, the water boils to starboard and a gray whale breaks  
the surface in a spinning, turning, bending arc. A spurt of steam 
shoots up, then another, and another. Vaporous breaths from a 
family of giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Ausham, a 20-year-old seaman, rushes out onto the deck.  
``Look!'' More plumes of mist. ``A momma and two babies!'' Chief 
Quartermaster Peter Hoking and several navigators come out from the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	They stand in the icy drizzle, watching the spouts shrink in the  
distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see more whales up here, like we have, that's a good  
feeling,'' says Hoking. ``It reminds you that, hey, maybe you're 
doing something right, maybe you're making a difference after 
all.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Energy Boss: Spy Stayed Too Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``Communications breakdowns'' could be the  
reason a suspected spy for China continued to have top-secret 
access at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, says Energy Secretary 
Bill Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan-born scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired March 8 over  
alleged security violations after having been the target of an FBI 
investigation since 1996 into the alleged theft of nuclear warhead 
information by China in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said Friday that Lee should have been denied access  
to secrets long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems within the lab, within the Department of Energy there  
were some communication breakdowns as to why this individual was 
still pursuing security work of a sensitive nature at a time when 
there were suspicions about him,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he was fired, investigators have learned that Lee had  
transferred nuclear warhead computer codes from the lab's most 
secure computer system to his own, unclassified computer used for 
communicating both within the lab and to the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on PBS' ``The News Hour with Jim Lehrer,'' Richardson  
said an internal investigation is trying to determine if government 
or lab officials should be disciplined because Lee was not moved 
sooner and stripped of his top security clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson and other administration officials said when Lee was  
fired in March that he had been allowed to keep his security 
clearance and a sensitive job so as not to tip him off about the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, 59, had worked at Los Alamos since 1978. He has not been  
charged with any crime and, through his lawyer, he has denied being 
involved in any espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he knew of ``no evidence'' that any of the  
computer code data had been shipped via e-mail outside the Los 
Alamos facility in New Mexico but acknowledged it was theoretically 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Richardson, most of the computer code transfers  
occurred in 1994-95 but some go back as far as 1983.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Clean Air Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Saturday endorsed federal  
standards aimed at making popular sport utility vehicles and cars 
run 80 percent cleaner, saying auto pollution can be cut 
dramatically at modest cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans love to drive, and we're driving more,'' Clinton  
said. ``But the emissions from our cars, particularly from the 
larger, less-efficient vehicles, threaten to erode many of the air 
quality gains America has achieved. As a result, many of our cities 
and states are no longer on course to meet our vital air quality 
goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the benefits may outweigh the costs by as much as  
4-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency, with a final rule expected  
by the end of the year, proposed that for the first time sport 
utility vehicles be brought in line with cars in terms of tailpipe 
emissions. It also called for the sale of only low-sulfur gasoline 
so emission control equipment can work efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the rule penalizes SUV  
drivers. He said he has asked Clinton instead to support his 
biomass research legislation, which would develop efficient fuels 
and other chemicals from plant products. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a long-term approach to the problem of global warming  
that does not assume a shift from the automobile culture or 
increased costs for American employers and consumers,'' Lugar said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican  
Conference, said the EPA should enforce existing laws before 
pursuing ``new regulatory schemes of undetermined cost and scope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner has rejected oil industry  
arguments that the sulfur reductions sought by the agency would be 
overly expensive and force some refineries to close. 
</P>
<P>
	Average gasoline prices would increase by a penny or two per  
gallon, or $12 to $24 a year for a typical family, and new 
emissions technology on cars would add $100 to $200 to the price of 
a vehicle, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an awful lot to pay for cleaner air,'' Browner  
insisted. She said the EPA estimates the cost of the tougher 
requirements at $4.4 billion, compared with $16.6 billion in 
benefits to public health. She said the proposal was tantamount to 
removing 166 million cars from the road. 
</P>
<P>
	But the oil industry has said the sulfur-reduction requirement  
alone could require more than $6 billion in new refinery 
investments and force some smaller refineries to close. It 
estimated retail gasoline prices would increase as much as 6 cents 
a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration hasn't made ``a compelling case'' for a need  
for low-sulfur fuel nationwide, said William O'Keefe, vice 
president of the American Petroleum Institute. He said the industry 
would try to get the proposal changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for:  
</P>
<P>
	--Automakers to cut smog-causing tailpipe emissions by an average  
of 80 percent, including a 95 percent reduction in sport utility 
vehicles and pickup trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refiners to slash sulfur content from an average of 340 parts  
per million to 30 parts per million, a 90 percent cut, in the 
2004-2006 period. 
</P>
<P>
	--SUVs and pickups for the first time would be subject to the  
same tailpipe emission requirements as cars. Today, those vehicles 
can legally emit two and three times the pollution as cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rule, cars would have to begin meeting the tougher  
emissions standards in 2004, with all cars, smaller minivans and 
SUVs complying by 2007. Large SUVs and pickups would have an 
additional two years to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers had asked for a longer phase-in, to 2011, and oil  
companies argue the low-sulfur gasoline may not be needed until 
after 2010, and perhaps not even then. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the administration's proposal in terms of air pollution  
is equivalent to taking 166 million cars off the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 97 percent cleaner than they were 30 years ago,  
automobiles, including SUVs and light trucks, account for one-third 
to one-half of smog-causing nitrogen oxide pollution in urban areas 
and about 22 percent nationwide. They also are major sources of 
toxic chemicals and microscopic soot in the air.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees Few Images of War Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The black and white video is grainy, recorded  
by a shuddering camera from thousands of feet up. A crosshatch 
cursor targets a radar dish. An F-15 drops its bomb. Suddenly, a 
church pops into view. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. jet fighter crew quickly steers the optically guided  
bomb into a field, missing the Serbian air defense radar and the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	That dramatic video of NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia, released  
by the Pentagon, reached the TV news and Americans' homes. But 
scores of other shots and satellite photos of precision-guided 
bombs hitting bridges, fuel and arms depots, Serb army barracks and 
command centers haven't received much public play. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the driving images of war have been of ethnic Albanians  
violently chased from Kosovo by Serb forces, and Serb TV shots of 
civilians accidentally killed by NATO bombs, a downed U.S. F-117 
stealth fighter and three captured U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed Saturday to release  
the soliders, who have been held for more than a month, to the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, who led a peace mission to Belgrade. They are to 
leave the country on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Five weeks into the airstrikes, media and military experts say  
Milosevic has shaped the story so far. Meanwhile, the Pentagon and 
NATO are forced to combat public perception that the air campaign 
isn't damaging Serb forces enough and that a ground invasion might 
be necessary for victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're winning the war, but we're losing the propaganda war,''  
said Chuck Vollmer, a former Vietnam fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public  
Affairs, said that during the 1991 Gulf War, Pentagon footage of 
precision-guided bombs destroying Iraqi targets flooded TV news 
worldwide, giving coalition forces a PR boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Lichter said, the novelty of high-tech munitions has worn  
off, although 90 percent of NATO strikes are precision-guided 
compared to 10 percent in the Gulf War. The U.S. and international 
public is bombarded instead with images of more than 1 million 
refugees running for their lives from Serb forces, and of civilian 
carnage when NATO bombs and missiles go astray. 
</P>
<P>
	``The story is of massive human suffering and of a conflict more  
difficult than we imagined,'' Lichter said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the six-week Gulf War, the networks showed 594 allied  
gunfight pictures, nearly five per night each for ABC, CBS and NBC, 
Lichter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The center hasn't compiled comparable figures for NATO  
airstrikes, but Lichter said his news watchers report little TV use 
of Pentagon gun-camera footage and NATO satellite photos of bomb 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks and cable news channels, like print reporters, have  
been constrained in directly covering bomb damage from NATO strikes 
since the Serbs have barred international journalists from Kosovo. 
Yugoslav authorities also limit the movement of correspondents in 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we can go around and gather the material we  
want,'' said ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. ``It's the human face 
of this conflict that people are interested in and that's where we 
have the ability to do our own reporting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN carries many Pentagon and NATO briefings live, but most of  
its reporting also focuses on the human angle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done a good job of reporting what's going on, but the  
refugee stuff is incredibly compelling,'' said CNN spokesman David 
Bittler. 
</P>
<P>
	One opinion poll suggests few Americans are paying attention to  
the military effects of NATO's attacks. Just under one in 10 people 
said they were most interested in news of damage to Serb targets, 
according to a poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what has captured their attention most, more than  
one-third said the March 31 capture of three American soldiers near 
the Macedonia-Yugoslav border. About three in 10 said refugees 
leaving Kosovo, the Serbian province under attack by Yugoslav 
forces. One-fourth said the ethnic Albanian victims themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,000 Americans was taken April 15-18. It  
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Pentagon shots show allied bombs and missiles destroying  
Serb supply lines into Kosovo, such as roads, rail lines and 
bridges. Others show NATO hitting fuel and arms depots, sometimes 
with scores of cluster bombs exploding like Fourth of July 
fireworks. The Pentagon also has shown footage of allied jets 
coming under Serb anti-aircraft fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Zorthian, chief U.S. military spokesman from 1964 through  
1968 during the Vietnam War, said the Pentagon must be sensitive in 
releasing attack footage. Strikes against buildings -- including 
Serb political party headquarters, Milosevic's homes and state-run 
TV broadcast centers -- raise the ugly specter of NATO targeting 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you see too much of the Yugoslavia infrastructure being  
blown up, people may say it's too much,'' Zorthian said.

<HEADLINE> Pit Crew Chief Killed at Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMS TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Timothy Vouaux, a pit crew chief  
working at the Tri-City Motor Speedway, was killed when two cars 
collided during a race and spun into the guardrail where he was 
standing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vouaux, 42, of Saginaw, Mich., was the first person to die at  
the Bay County racetrack since it reopened in May 1996 after being 
closed for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	He died in surgery Saturday morning, Michigan State Trooper  
Yvonne Brantley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident, which occurred about 11 p.m. Friday, is still  
under investigation, Brantley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and family say Vouaux was a fan and participant in car  
racing for 20 years. Don Riley, who had known Vouaux for 30 years, 
said Vouaux was a good racer, but had an avid interest in mechanics 
and switched to working on pit crews himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very serious,'' Riley said. ``He didn't like conflicts  
that didn't make sense. In racing and whatever, he always wanted to 
go forward. He didn't want things holding anybody back that were 
just personal matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was truly fantastic, a wonderful person.''  
</P>
<P>
	Vouaux worked as a maintenance mechanic at the Saginaw  
Wastewater Treatment Plant. He and his wife have 6-year-old 
triplets.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Archdiocese Builds Mortuaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Archdiocese of Los Angeles bypassed local  
mortuaries and contracted with a for-profit company to build 
funeral homes at tax-exempt church cemeteries that will provide 
one-stop embalming, casketing, chapel service and burial. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which will make the nation's largest Roman Catholic  
archdiocese only the second to put mortuaries on church property, 
has prompted complaints of unfair competition from angry funeral 
directors, some of whom have served the archdiocese for more than a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	The archdiocese, which has a flock of 3.6 million, made a deal  
with mortuary consolidator Stewart Enterprises Inc. in 1998 to 
build funeral homes at six of the 11 tax-exempt, consecrated 
graveyards it operates in Southern California and at two it runs in 
the Tucson, Ariz., diocese. 
</P>
<P>
	Archdiocese and Stewart officials refused to discuss the value  
of the deal or how much the church will likely earn. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has angered rivals, who contend the church's prestige  
and nonprofit status put them at a distinct disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wrong. The church should not engage in competition with  
private enterprise,'' says John J. Horan, operator of five 
mortuaries in Denver, the only other U.S. archdiocese with a 
mortuary on its property. The Denver archdiocese owns its funeral 
home outright. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine how persuasive the church can be,'' Horan says. ``It's  
kind of hard to fight a multimillion-dollar industry like the 
church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horan says his funerals dropped from 800 a year to about 500  
when the Catholic mortuary opened there. At least one traditionally 
Catholic funeral home went out of business. Others, like Horan, 
diversified to serve other faiths and denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took all our eggs out of the Catholic basket,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	The 100-odd Los Angeles-area mortuaries were not allowed to bid  
for the archdiocese cemetery work, and the archdiocese acknowledges 
some are angry over a slight that they believe discounts their 
years of service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know there are people less than happy, but they are already  
in competition with other mortuaries. It just provides another 
option,'' says archdiocese spokesman Gregory Coiro. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart Enterprises, based in New Orleans, owns and operates 378  
mortuaries and 127 cemeteries in 23 states, Puerto Rico and six 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart is leasing the cemetery land from the church and will  
pay property and business taxes, Coiro says. The funeral home will 
bear the cemetery name and Stewart won't appear on signs. 
</P>
<P>
	The archdiocese insists money is not the issue. Coiro declined  
to discuss the archdiocese's budget but called its finances ``quite 
sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding the church's role in the funeral business seems to be  
an idea gaining momentum. In its ``A Vision for the Millennium'' 
decree, the Des Plaines, Ill.-based National Catholic Cemetery 
Conference urged Catholic cemeteries to consider operating funeral 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``To emphasize church teachings and to promote the universal  
application of the Order of Christian Funerals, the Catholic 
cemetery may consider operating its own funeral homes,'' the 
conference decree said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some rivals dismiss the religious justification.  
</P>
<P>
	``The motivation of the church leaders can be found far closer  
to Earth than to heaven: It will be a moneymaker,'' the Funeral 
Monitor, an industry watchdog newsletter based in Tiburon, Calif., 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Bagues III's East Los Angeles funeral home is a mile  
from the archdiocese-owned Calvary Cemetery, where the first 
Stewart-run mortuary opens in September. He says he sends families 
to Calvary to buy cemetery lots and commonly, within a week, they 
receive calls from Stewart salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say they are the church, and the family thinks they are  
going to the church, not Stewart,'' Bagues says. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicts trouble for the new Calvary mortuary. Stewart rates  
for a funeral run twice as much -- $4,000 compared to $2,000, he 
asserts. ``People are shopping around now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Stricklin, coordinator for Stewart's Catholic mortuary  
operations, refused to comment on the company's prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard R. Gutierrez, whose Guerra-Gutierrez Mortuary is three  
miles from Calvary, says he'll fight the church-affiliated 
competition with better service and prices and a new $2 million 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to compete aggressively,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Four Texas Cities Choose Mayors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Incumbent mayors headed for expected re-election  
victories Saturday in Dallas, San Antonio, El Paso and Brownsville. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Kirk, Dallas' first black mayor, was expected to coast to a  
second-term victory over immigration lawyer and political novice 
Margaret A. Donnelly and perennial candidate Billy Jack Ludwig. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk, a lawyer and former Texas secretary of state, promised to  
focus his second term on fixing streets, keeping the city safe and 
promoting economic development in south Dallas, the poorest part of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent much of his first four-year term pushing through  
referendums to build a sports arena and develop an area along the 
Trinity River near downtown. Each passed by fewer than 2,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio Mayor Howard Peak also sought a second term with a  
pledge to focus on basic city services. Peak's opponents were Tony 
Garza, Joseph Rodriguez de Cisneros, Eloy Centeno and Louis 
Podesta. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez was expected to easily beat City  
Councilwoman Barbara Perez, his nearest competitor. Ramirez has 
unsuccessfully lobbied officials in Juarez, Mexico, to ban drinking 
by underage Americans. Mexico's legal drinking age is 18. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brownsville, Mayor Henry Gonzalez sought a third term in a  
race against Blanca Sanchez Vela, wife of a federal judge.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Opens Olympic Recordbook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- There was no evidence of bribery -- but plenty of  
fawning over IOC members by city officials -- when Atlanta Olympics 
record were opened to the public for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine boxes of records released -- a mere fraction of the  
total -- showed no evidence of the problems that have tarnished Salt 
Lake City's Olympic bid, but they did detail Atlanta's 
take-no-prisoners strategy to win over IOC members prior to the 
1990 vote giving the city the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxes included scores of thank-you notes, fund-raising  
letters, newspaper articles and marketing plans, including one that 
warned Atlanta leaders that ``lobbying the 90-member IOC voting 
bloc is tricky business, not unlike walking through a minefield at 
midnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The records show that Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne and his  
helpers exhaustively researched each IOC member's background, 
family and hobbies. They lured them to the city several times 
before the 1990 vote, then showered them with gifts, fine food, 
entertainment and deluxe accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	When IOC members stayed at a private home in Atlanta, Payne  
instructed the hosts to ``plan major sports and cultural events. 
Leave no stone unturned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After one visit in 1989, Payne instructed the wives of the host  
families to correspond with their visiting IOC member every other 
month and he suggested topics to include in their letters. 
</P>
<P>
	While bid cities are allowed to fly IOC members to their city  
first-class, the records showed just how costly that can be. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Payne's group spent $11,120 just to fly the Swedish  
IOC delegate and his wife to Atlanta for a lobbying event five 
months before the 1990 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, which is embroiled in  
a legal fight to keep some bid records sealed, voluntarily opened 
the nine boxes of documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta History Center, which has stored the records since  
1997, gave reporters limited periods of time to look at the records 
Friday. The Associated Press had the opportunity to look at only 
five of the nine boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The records, of which there are a total of 4,000 boxes, are at  
the center of a legal dispute over whether the public should be 
allowed to view documents detailing Atlanta's bid for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletics foundation was created by Payne in 1987 to bid for  
the Olympics. The nonprofit group claims the documents are the 
property of a group of private citizens.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Milosevic Proposes Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic  
acknowledged that ``bad things happened'' in Kosovo and offered a 
plan to end the military conflict, according to an interview 
published today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview with The Washington Times, Milosevic called for  
the end to all military activities and the simultaneous withdrawal 
of 90,000 Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and of NATO forces from the 
surrounding area. His plan also would include a lightly armed U.N. 
peacekeeping mission that would include Russian forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic, who met with a Washington Times editor in Belgrade on  
Thursday outlined what he called a six-point peace plan. The 
proposal also called for the return of all refugees, peace talks 
with moderate political leaders in Kosovo and an economic recovery 
plan for Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration was skeptical of any offers from  
Belgrade and White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called Milosevic's 
proposals ``clearly inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said ``we are not anywhere  
near a serious peace proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In conceding that ``bad things'' happened in Kosovo, Milosevic  
blamed them on undisciplined paramilitary troops, some of whom have 
been punished. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not angels,'' he said in the interview. ``Nor are we  
the devils you have made us out to be. Our regular forces are 
highly disciplined. The paramilitary irregular forces are a 
different story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic, speaking in English, reiterated his opposition to any  
kind of NATO peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was prepared to face more bombing, he said that  
``one day is too much'' but he said his forces would never 
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	``We Serbs are as one on this life-and-death issue of national  
honor and sovereignty,'' he told the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> The Social Security Blame Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just in case the distinction was too subtle  
for some, it's been made crystal clear. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, lawmakers' endless talk about Social Security is not  
aimed at making a major overhaul of the retirement program happen 
this year. It's more about making sure the blame falls on the other 
guy when it doesn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it happening this year because I don't believe the  
president will really honestly address it,'' Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott said, in language that sounded like engraving on a 
tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's chief of staff John Podesta fired back that ``we are  
disappointed that some have chosen to raise the level of rhetoric 
without at the same time advancing specific ideas of their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of both political parties had claimed as a major goal  
this year shoring up Social Security for the time in the 
not-to-distant future when the program is expected to be 
overwhelmed by aging baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, a convivial group of Democrat and Republican  
lawmakers left a White House meeting voicing optimism they could 
get the job done before politicking for the 2000 elections spoiled 
the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	What's happened since then?  
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, what was going on was a blame game: who's going to  
be responsible for killing Social Security?'' said Rep. Bob Matsui, 
D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., insists that although he personally  
doesn't think it would be right to hold up Social Security reform 
for the sake of having something to campaign on, there is a belief 
among members of his party that if Democrats don't budge ``we can 
go into the campaign with enough issues that favor the Democrats to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders, meanwhile, have told their  
rank-and-file that polling suggests that moving a GOP-sponsored 
Social Security plan this year would be too politically risky. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans who have tried to suggest possible  
avenues for compromise have met resistance, even from within their 
own parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a proposal first outlined in his State of the Union  
speech, touched politically sensitive nerves, but also offered some 
cover to both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Appealing to Republicans' fiscal conservatism, Clinton proposed  
using trillions in expected surpluses to accumulate in Social 
Security's trust fund over the next 15 years -- while the baby 
boomers are still in the work force -- to pay down the nation's 
debts to private bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists agree that can reasonably be expected to improve  
the economy so that the nation could more easily afford to pay 
retirement benefits as the number of elderly Americans doubles over 
the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Clinton would refund some income tax surpluses in the form  
of government incentives offered to encourage retirement savings by 
low- and middle-income workers in new 401-(k)-style personal 
investment accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts are similar to those that many Republicans would  
like to start so that stock market earnings might eventually be 
able to make up some of the cash shortfall expected to face Social 
Security after baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	However, siding with Democrats concerned about putting people's  
Social Security benefits at the risk on Wall Street, Clinton would 
keep the personal accounts as an add-on, and have the government 
handle some experimental private investment of Social Security's 
cash reserves instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Clinton's plan has spurred Republicans to offer their  
own proposal to use Social Security surpluses to reduce the 
national debt, they panned it as a ``tricky accounting'' scheme and 
``socialism'' at highly publicized congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats on Capitol Hill have not bothered to mount much of a  
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, some Democrats have bristled at any hint that the  
administration might be negotiating with Republicans, and last week 
they aimed their fire at a GOP lawmaker who approached the White 
House to suggest a possible compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, made a courtesy phone call to Clinton before announcing 
his proposal Wednesday. It would integrate private individual 
retirement accounts with Social Security, but still maintain a 
government guarantee to make up the difference if people's accounts 
don't earn enough to provide them with the full Social Security 
benefits promised under current law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our challenge is to put politics aside,'' Archer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Democrats wasted no time accusing Archer of  
plotting to dismantle Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a stealth attack,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., of  
Archer's plan. ``If you take it to it's logical conclusion it is 
the delayed execution of retirement security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert has said, ``Make no mistake. Any  
efforts to enact a Social Security reform plan must be done in a 
bipartisan manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the current atmosphere, however, such cooperation seems  
unlikely. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> NHL Playoff Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	What home-ice advantage?  
</P>
<P>
	It certainly hasn't meant anything so far in the NHL playoff  
series between the San Jose Sharks and Colorado Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fourth time in four games, the road team won as the  
Sharks beat the Avalanche 7-3 Friday night to tie their Western 
Conference series at two games apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel really good about our situation now,'' Vincent  
Damphousse said after scoring two short-handed goals. ``... We know 
we're going back to San Jose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That won't come until Monday night. The teams will play Game 5  
tonight in Denver, with the schedule reconfigured because of the 
shootings at a suburban high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``(A 2-2 series is) a lot better than coming in here two down,''  
Damphousse said. ``Our key now is to win the game (tonight) and 
have a chance to win at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, it was New Jersey 4, Pittsburgh 3; Toronto 2,  
Philadelphia 1 in overtime; Boston 4, Carolina 3 in double 
overtime; and St. Louis 2, Phoenix 1 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose-Colorado game is the only playoff game on tap  
tonight. On Sunday, it's New Jersey at Pittsburgh, Toronto at 
Philadelphia, Carolina at Boston and Phoenix at St. Louis. The 
Devils, Maple Leafs, Bruins and Coyotes have 3-2 leads. 
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse scored two short-handed goals in the third period as  
the Sharks guaranteed themselves another home playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Korolyuk had a goal and two assists for the Sharks, who  
trailed 2-0 midway through the second period but scored the game's 
final four goals -- all coming within a 10:07 span of the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Vernon finished with 32 saves for San Jose. Patrick Roy  
stopped 18 of 24 shots before being pulled late in the final 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got embarrassed,'' Colorado captain Joe Sakic said. ``We  
can't worry about what's happened in the past. We have the 
best-of-3 and two games at home. We have to make sure we take 
advantage of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                        *Devils 4, Penguins 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Petr Sykora scored on rebound early in the third period, and New  
Jersey overcame a 13-second lapse to beat visiting Pittsburgh 
without Jaromir Jagr. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils, who also got two goals from Randy McKay, can wrap up  
the best-of-7 series by winning either Game 6 at Pittsburgh on 
Sunday or, if necessary, Game 7 at home on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr missed his fourth straight game with a groin injury, and  
the Penguins only managed 17 shots without him. The NHL's leading 
scorer also didn't sound optimistic that he would be able to play 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Maple Leafs 2, Flyers 1, OT    	
</P>
<P>
	Yanic Perreault scored 11:51 into overtime as Toronto won at  
home and moved within a victory of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Perreault's backhander eluded goalie John Vanbiesbrouck after  
the Flyers' Keith Jones and the Leafs' Dimitri Yushkevich exchanged 
first-period goals. The Flyers have lost seven straight playoff 
overtime games since an OT win in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
                     *Bruins 4, Hurricanes 3, 2OT    	
</P>
<P>
	Anson Carter scored on a backhander with 5:15 left in the second  
overtime as Boston won at Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins came into the second OT holding a 47-31 lead in  
shots, and Carter's breakaway goal on Carolina's Arturs Irbe was 
Boston's 52nd shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Thornton and Ray Bourque assisted on Carter's game-winner in  
the longest game in Carolina franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Blues 2, Coyotes 1, OT    	
</P>
<P>
	Al MacInnis tied the game with a goal in the third period, and  
Scott Young scored 5:43 into overtime as St. Louis staved off 
elimination at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues will go into Game 6 with momentum after outshooting  
Phoenix 43-27 and outskating the Coyotes throughout the second 
overtime game of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas Drake scored his fourth playoff goal on a Phoenix power  
play in the second period, but Grant Fuhr handled 26 other shots 
for his 88th playoff victory, which tied him with Billy Smith for 
second in NHL history. Colorado's Patrick Roy leads with 101 wins.

<HEADLINE> Baffert Falls Short in Derby Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Bob Baffert was in his lucky box, wearing  
his lucky tie. He even met Muhammad Ali in the paddock before 
Saturday's 125th Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it came time to deliver the knockout that would give  
Baffert a record third straight Derby win, his three entries came 
up short. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber was fourth, the filly Excellent Meeting fifth and  
General Challenge 11th, all behind the race's winner, the D. Wayne 
Lukas-trained Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	None ever challenged for the lead, with both Excellent Meeting  
and Prime Timber coming from back in the pack in the final 
quarter-mile of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge raced in traffic throughout, never moving  
closer to the lead than seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed we did not get a chance to run,'' Baffert  
said. ``I knew we were dead in the first turn. General Challenge 
was getting jerked around all over the place. This race is won on 
the first turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All week long at Churchill Downs, the white-haired Baffert, with  
his distinctive dark glasses, was the center of attention. He had 
come in second by a nose in 1996 with Cavonnier, then won in 1997 
and 1998 with Silver Charm and Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing out of the money was a new experience after the last  
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how to act,'' Baffert said. ``We're sort of lost  
souls. We didn't have any luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There were too many horses and too much traffic,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Coming into Derby week, Baffert looked well-positioned to win  
the Derby for the third year in a row. He brought a stable to 
Kentucky that included the top two finishers in the Santa Anita 
Derby, General Challenge and Prime Timber, and two fillies believed 
by many to be the equal of any 3-year-old colts in the land, 
Excellent Meeting and Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert stuck by an early decision to run Silverbulletday in  
Friday's Kentucky Oaks, but waited until Friday to announce he 
would run Excellent Meeting in the Derby, and not the Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday then won the Oaks easily, giving Baffert a shot  
at being the first trainer to train an Oaks and Derby winner in the 
same year since Ben A. Jones in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ready for the big day, with his blue tie for luck and  
sitting with Prime Timber owners Mr. and Mrs. Aaron Jones in the 
same box where he sat for the wins by Real Quiet and Silver Charm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Excellent Meeting-General Challenge joint entry, owned by  
Mr. and Mrs. John Mabee, ended up going off as the 9-2 favorite, 
but became the 20th straight Derby favorite to fail to win the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 and 1998, Silver Charm and Real Quiet won the first two  
legs of the Triple Crown for Baffert, then came up short in the 
Belmont Stakes. In his post-Derby disappointment, Baffert was able 
to find a silver lining at not winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I don't have to worry about the Triple Crown this year,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Catching Hackers Becoming Easier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They never unmasked the hacker responsible for  
Michelangelo, a famous computer virus that threw a scare into the 
high-tech world in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But it took just days to identify the people believed  
responsible for two viruses that struck this year. Cybercops also 
had no trouble finding the man who allegedly posted a fake news 
story this month about a corporate merger that caused one company's 
stock to gyrate. 
</P>
<P>
	In at least two of these cases, investigators used the digital  
footprints that every user of the Internet leaves behind to trace 
the source of the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	While this may force virus writers or hoaxers to think twice  
before they strike, it also shows how easy it is for anyone -- a 
government investigator or a skilled salesperson -- to follow your 
every online move. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same technology that tracks individuals is used to solve  
crimes and vice versa,'' said Ari Schwartz, a policy analyst for 
the Center for Democracy and Technology, an Internet civil 
liberties group in Washington. ``It's melded into one kind of 
surveillance technology which could lead to an erosion of 
privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, there's nothing all that complicated about how the law  
enforcers crack a case on the World Wide Web. In fact, it's similar 
to the way telephone records are used by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The online accounts that most people use to roam the Web or send  
e-mail are assigned a unique stamp, or ``Internet protocol 
address,'' that helps direct the exchange of data between a Web 
site and its visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Those IP addresses leave digital footprints that -- unfortunately  
for the ill-intentioned -- don't get wiped out as easily or quickly 
as a trail of bread crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Little is known about Chen Ing-hau, the 24-year-old Taiwanese  
man identified on Thursday as the author of Chernobyl, a virus that 
crippled hundreds of thousands of computers this week. But IP 
addresses were clearly pivotal in tracking down the alleged merger 
hoaxter, Gary Dale Hoke. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old North Carolina man was arrested two weeks ago  
after he allegedly posted a fictional story April 7 saying his 
employer, PairGain Technologies, was about be taken over by another 
company. The false report caused PairGain's stock to rise sharply, 
then fall after the hoax was uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke, officials said, attempted to conceal his identity with  
pseudonyms and fake e-mail addresses, but was identified through an 
IP address. He was charged Friday with five counts of securities 
fraud, punishable by up to 50 years in prison and $5 million in 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
	IP addresses were also used to track down David L. Smith, a  
30-year-old network programmer from New Jersey accused of creating 
the Melissa e-mail virus with a stolen America Online account. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa, allegedly named after a topless dancer in Florida,  
appeared on March 26 and spread rapidly around the world, clogging 
e-mail accounts and shutting down computer networks worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	But IP addresses weren't the only clues used in the Melissa  
investigation, and that's what troubles privacy advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	The main difference in the Melissa investigation was the use of  
a serial number embedded in documents written with the popular 
program Microsoft Word. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could go around society with tattoos on our forehead and  
cameras everywhere, but most people wouldn't like that. But that's 
what these serial numbers do,'' said Schwartz, whose organization 
has filed a federal complaint over a similar serial number embedded 
in Intel's new Pentium III computer chip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Law enforcement has a lot of tools out there to find out who  
these people are. We want them to find crooks,'' Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when we make technology, do we want technology that brands  
individuals, that's puts our serial numbers everywhere as we visit? 
There has to be some sense of anonymity online.''

<HEADLINE> POW Families Grateful for Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vivian Ramirez smiled broadly as she talked  
about watching a videotape of her son, Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 
standing with his arm around the Rev. Jesse Jackson in war-torn 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt very emotional. ... I could've gone in there and just  
hugged him,'' she said Friday after viewing the tape of Jackson's 
visit with Ramirez and two other U.S. soldiers being held prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, 24, Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., and  
Steven Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, were captured while 
patrolling the Yugoslavia-Macedonia border on March 31, seven days 
after NATO launched its bombing campaign in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were in good health, Jackson said. They had not been  
allowed to meet with any Westerners until a visit by International 
Red Cross officials this week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the video approved by Serb censors, Stone appears tired, and  
his eyes well with tears as he sends his love to his wife, Tricia, 
and 4-year-old son, Ryan. He says a fading bruise on hi forehead is 
``a mark from our capture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very happy and relieved that he looks well,'' Mrs. Stone  
said. ``I'm very hopeful that more positive things will come out of 
this. I pray every day and night for the safe return of Chris, 
Andrew and Steven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though thin, Ramirez appears healthier compared with the first  
video released by Yugoslav authorities just after his capture when 
all three soldiers had battered faces, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was worse before when I didn't hear anything, just the  
pictures they were showing from early times. That was unbearable,'' 
Mrs. Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she didn't know if Jackson's efforts would help speed  
the release of her son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, he will. Hopefully, I pray he will,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The mother and her daughter sent Ramirez a cassette with a taped  
message. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just told him that I loved him very much, I told him to take  
care, not to worry, that we were doing all we could to bring him 
back home,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Livingston Seat Race May See Runoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Former Gov. Dave Treen appeared led the race  
Saurday to replace Bob Livingston in the House and appeared headed 
for a May 29 runoff. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and two 
others vied for the second spot. 
</P>
<P>
	With 72 percent of the votes counted, Treen received 24,207  
votes, or 25 percent. State Rep. David Vitter had 21,022 votes, or 
21 percent and Duke won 19,199 votes, or 19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ophthalmologist Monica Monica had 15,323 votes for 16 percent  
and state Rep. Bill Strain received 11,883 votes for 12 percent. 
Four lesser known candidates split the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston was in line to become House Speaker after more than  
20 years in Congress. But he abruptly announced his resignation in 
December after confessing to marital infidelities. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently endorsed Treen, a 70-year-old former Republican  
governor and himself a veteran of 7 1/2 years in Congress. But some 
Republicans feared Duke would return to haunt the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke enjoyed a surprising, if brief, run of political success 10  
years ago after joining the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	When Livingston announced his resignation in December, Duke was  
hawking an autobiography touting his theories that blacks have 
genetically low intelligence and raising the idea of a separate 
black homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced his candidacy the same day and said later this  
would be his last political race unless he won. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine candidates -- seven Republicans and two Democrats -- ran on  
one ballot under Louisiana's unique open primary system. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls indicated Treen would likely finish on top but would fall  
short of the majority needed for outright victory. A runoff is 
scheduled May 29 if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Strain, an 18-year veteran of the state House, was considered  
the Democrats' only hope of taking the seat, but he kept a 
relatively low profile throughout the campaign and his poll numbers 
were low. 
</P>
<P>
	The also-rans in the race included area businessman Rob Couhig  
and three unknowns: Republicans Patrick Landry and S.J. LoCoco, and 
Democrat Darryl Ward. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st District in the New Orleans suburbs is 85 percent white  
and predominantly Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen gained momentum last week when House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert said he would receive seniority credit for his years spent 
in Congress before being elected governor in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke narrowly won a spot in the state House from the suburb of  
Metairie in 1989. He went on to shock the nation by winning a spot 
in the 1991 runoff for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	After former Gov. Edwin Edwards beat him in a landslide that  
year, his political fortunes faded, marked by a weak run for 
president, an abandoned second try for governor in 1995 and a 
fourth-place finish in the 1996 U.S. Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his early start, his candidacy this time out was quickly  
overshadowed and largely ignored by the other candidates. Polls 
showed him with less than 10 percent support. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the election was seen as a test of his oft-repeated  
theory that he ``flies below radar,'' meaning his supporters rarely 
admit their preferences for him in polls.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attends Press Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a year in which he was impeached and his  
life's most intimate moments were exposed to the public, a night 
out with the White House press corps wouldn't seem to be President 
Clinton's ideal evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday evening, though, Clinton put aside any lingering  
bitterness and cracked a few jokes at the annual White House 
Correspondents Association dinner at a Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton showed up late enough to miss the presentation of an  
award to Newsweek's Michael Isikoff, a reporter who dedicated the 
past year to unearthing the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Instead, the 
president came in time to hear the jokes of MSNBC anchor Brian 
Williams, master of ceremonies for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams poked fun at Washington's media elite, telling the  
audience that The Washington Post was late to the event because it 
has been ``going out to dinner on the same story since 1974,'' a 
reference to its breaking much of the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also took shots at political leaders, frequently  
mocking Vice President Al Gore for his claim that he invented the 
Internet. Clinton took the podium and responded, saying that Gore, 
who attended the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, never claimed he sired 
the winning horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton then poked fun at the press, telling the crowd that  
veteran reporter Helen Thomas of United Press International was 
upset at a proposed move in the White House briefing room because 
she remembered the last time it moved -- when the capital changed 
from Philadelphia to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, who later spoke seriously about the situation in  
Kosovo, joked with the assembled media about war coverage. He asked 
them to imagine the effects the 24-hour media would have had on 
other wars. The sub-headline on a story about President Lincoln's 
Gettysburg Address? President ``does not offer exit strategy.'' How 
about Gen. Douglas MacArthur's promise to return to the 
Philippines? MacArthur ``does not set clear timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the president and the dinner audience were entertained by  
singer Aretha Franklin.

<HEADLINE> Clear the Decks, Canseco Is Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As the brashest Bash Brother, Jose Canseco drove  
his expensive cars fast, leading to more than one run-in with the 
law. He had a menagerie that some zoos would have envied. He 
hobnobbed with the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	And he hit home runs. Lots of them. Punishing smacks that almost  
knocked the cow hide off the ball. With fellow Bash Brother Mark 
McGwire, Canseco took the Oakland A's on a giddy ride 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But when McGwire captivated the country with his 70 home runs  
last season, Canseco wasn't even an afterthought. Sure, he had a 
career-high 46 homers, but they were the quietest he'd ever hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, clear the upper decks and break out the extra balls. Less  
than a month into the season, Canseco is back. 
</P>
<P>
	With a major league best 10 home runs going into the weekend, he  
had twice as many as that other guy in St. Louis. Does he even have 
a shot at McGwire's record? 
</P>
<P>
	``No way,'' said Canseco, who signed with the Tampa Bay Devil  
Rays in the offseason as a free agent. ``Only a robot like McGwire 
can do that. I don't think people understand how difficult it was 
to do what he did. To hit 70 home runs, you guys can't even fathom 
how difficult that is. 
</P>
<P>
	``To continue that kind of pace? No way. I don't even think  
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OK, so maybe this isn't the same Jose Canseco who once had his  
own 900 number. Two months shy of his 35th birthday, Canseco still 
looks like a more handsome version of the Incredible Hulk with his 
barrel chest and bulging arms. But he's wised up. 
</P>
<P>
	He looks at his 400-plus home runs and knows he could have  
another 150 if not for injuries. He wants 600 homers, something 
only three other players have done, and he knows he probably has 
just four or five seasons to get there. He knows talent will carry 
him only so far, that he has to stay healthy to accomplish 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	And he knows every decision he makes will affect the 2 1/2-year-old  
daughter he adores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's come to terms with who he is and what his career  
means to him and what, probably, life is all about in a lot of 
ways,'' Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot was thrown at Jose in a short period of time. That  
doesn't mean some of the behavior is acceptable, but there are 
reasons for it at times. Like I said, I think he's come to terms 
with a lot of it and gotten past a lot of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who was born in Cuba but grew up in Miami, was called  
up to the Oakland A's on Sept. 2, 1985. One week later, he hit his 
first major league home run. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit 33 homers and drove in 117 runs the following year, gaudy  
totals for anyone, let alone a rookie. His RBIs were second-best in 
the AL and he was fourth in homers, earning him rookie of the year 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Canseco led the majors with 42 home runs and 124 RBIs,  
and he was a unanimous choice as MVP. He became the first player to 
hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases, and he led the A's to the 
first of three straight AL pennants. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland won the World Series in 1989, but it was Canseco's homer  
in Game 4 of the ALCS that stands out. He put Mike Flanagan's pitch 
in the upper deck of Toronto's SkyDome, some 480 feet away, a place 
where no ball had ever gone before. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fifth deck in Toronto -- that's right up there with all of  
them,'' said Wade Boggs, one of Canseco's teammates on the Devil 
Rays. ``When he connects with the ball, you really can't imagine 
the leather and the twine going that far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco hit a total of 231 homers with the A's from 1985-92, and  
had five seasons with more than 30 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was just as lively off the field. He was arrested for having  
a gun in his car at a hospital, and was cited several times for 
driving violations, such as speeding. 
</P>
<P>
	He bashed the car of his former wife, Esther, and had a  
rendezvous with Madonna. He once brought a large land tortoise into 
the Oakland clubhouse, and drew complaints from his neighbors 
because of his unusual pets. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys made me bigger than life,'' Canseco said. ``I didn't  
say you made it all up. I'd say there were some additions. I'd say 
some things were blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made mistakes, that's true,'' he added. ``But for years  
and years and years and years, it's always written in the media, 
`Jose's having a great year, but ... .' I'm responsible for my 
mistakes, but how long do you have to go on paying for them?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco was traded to the Texas Rangers in 1992, and the  
injuries began soon after. He blew out his elbow in 1993 and needed 
reconstructive surgery. He spent months on the disabled season in 
1995, 1996 and 1997, mostly with back problems. 
</P>
<P>
	After three major operations in five years, Canseco admits he  
was tempted to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being a competitor, you've always got to give yourself that  
last chance,'' he said. ``You don't want to fall short and retire 
at 34, 35 years old and then say, `Well, what if I could have stuck 
with it a little bit longer?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing for Toronto last year, Canseco proved he could still  
play. His 46 home runs were third-best in the AL behind Ken Griffey 
Jr. and Albert Belle, and his 107 RBIs were his best since 1991. He 
also stole 29 bases, second-most in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	In the offseason, the Devil Rays were eager to bolster their  
lackluster offense with Canseco's power. Still, Rothschild had 
concerns. Canseco had pleaded no contest in January 1998 to charges 
he assaulted his second wife, Jessica. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco underwent court-mandated counseling, and he and his wife  
have since reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first talked to him, I addressed (the past problems)  
with him immediately,'' Rothschild said. ``In my talks with him, I 
found him to be honest and open about it, which I think is 
important. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had had no problems last year with Toronto, and from what  
I've seen in the time I've been around him here, what's happened in 
the past has remained in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco goes about his business with a single-minded  
determination these days. He's quiet in the clubhouse, preferring 
to lead by example. He hit his 400th career homer on April 14, 
becoming only the 28th player and the first born outside the United 
States to accomplish the feat. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Canseco said it's too early to get excited about his  
numbers. Actually, he'd prefer if nobody got excited about him. 
While he's better equipped to handle the attention now than he was 
10 years ago, all he wants is to hit and stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of time to make up,'' he said. ``If I'm healthy  
for the next five years, 600 home runs is very reachable. Health 
and 600, they just go hand-in-hand. I've got a lot of good years 
ahead of me -- if my health lets me have them.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers Place Clayton on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers placed shortstop Royce  
Clayton on the 15-day disabled list today with a strained muscle 
behind his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton injured the shoulder on April 7, missing four games  
before returning. He suffered a more severe strain of the muscle 
making a throw Friday night against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas filled Clayton's roster spot by recalling infielder Kelly  
Dransfeldt from Oklahoma of the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
	Dransfeldt, 24, was to make his major league debut in Saturday  
night's game against the Indians. The right-hander was hitting .311 
with two home runs and 10 RBIs in 22 games for the Red Hawks, 
starting 17 games at shortstop and five games at second base.

<HEADLINE> Internet Rape Suspect Skips Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A woman who accused police officers of  
ignoring and insulting her when she reported being raped broke down 
in hysterics when she learned that her attacker has skipped bail 
and is on the loose. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's very upset,'' attorney Marc Picker said of his client  
after Timothy Mobly failed to show for Friday's sentencing hearing. 
``The major player is still out there and she is scared to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mobly, 25, pleaded guilty in March to raping the woman. He and  
another man, Aaron Cross, also pleaded guilty to raping a 
17-year-old high school junior. 
</P>
<P>
	Washoe District Judge Janet Berry ordered Mobly's $20,000 bond  
forfeited and issued a new $5 million bench warrant for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old woman known only as Jennifer W. has sued the  
Sparks police department, three detectives and Chief John Dotson 
for more than $900,000, saying she was humiliated and accused of 
lying when she tried to report the rape in November.

<TEXT>
<P>
	HILLTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A small plane and a glider collided  
Saturday, killing the pilot of the airplane and two men in the 
glider, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one on the ground was injured, though the glider crashed in a  
nearby back yard next to a crowded athletic field in Bucks County 
about 30 miles north of Philadelphia, said Township Deputy Fire 
Chief Shawn Shade. 
</P>
<P>
	Debris from the plane landed in front of a home.  
</P>
<P>
	The single-engine Cessna had been towing another glider, whose  
pilot saw the second glider approaching and dropped his tow in time 
to avoid the collision, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of the first glider returned safely to the nearby  
Philadelphia Glider Club airfield, said Township Police Chief Kerry 
Trauger. The crash site was about a mile from the club. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate indication how high the plane and the  
glider were when they collided.

<HEADLINE> Wichita St. Pitcher Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Wichita State's Ben Christensen, who hit an  
opposing player with a warmup pitch last week, was suspended for 
the rest of the season on Friday by the Missouri Valley Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Brent Kemnitz also was suspended from game day  
participation for the remainder of the regular season and any 
postseason games involving the University of Evansville. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen hit Evansville's Anthony Molina in the head with a  
warmup pitch before the game on April 23. Molina was reported to be 
at least 15 feet from home plate when he was hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension keeps Christensen out for the remainder of the  
1999 regular season, conference tournament and the NCAA tournament. 
He will be allowed to continue as a member of the team and to 
participate in practices and non-game activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemnitz will be allowed to resume his coaching duties during the  
conference postseason tournament, and will be allowed to practice 
with the team and perform other coaching duties during his 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Wichita State issued a brief statement Friday saying the  
university would not appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``After intensive and exhaustive discussions with  
representatives of the Missouri Valley Conference during the past 
week, the University has made this decision not to appeal in an 
attempt to move forward and seek closure,'' athletic director Bill 
Belknap said. 
</P>
<P>
	The MVC ruling did not specifically address the reasons the  
pitching coach was included in the suspension, but Kemnitz 
reportedly teaches his pitchers to brush back on-deck batters who 
stand too close to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Molina sustained a one-inch gash above his left eye, which is  
swollen shut -- and he has expressed fears he may have permanent 
damage to his sight. The beaning also caused three small fractures 
in Molina's cheekbone. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than anything, we are certainly hoping that Anthony  
Molina's recovery is quick and complete,'' Missouri Valley 
Conference commissioner Doug Elgin said in a release. ``We are 
truly sorry for all parties involved that the injury occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belknap apologized on behalf of Wichita State to Molina, his  
family and coach and to the University of Evansville. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sincerely sorry that this unintentional, but  
regrettable, accident occurred,'' he said. ``We send our best 
wishes for full and complete recovery to Anthony Molina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen, who was immediately ejected from the game by home  
plate umpire Gary Mitchell, received an automatic four-game 
suspension per NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the MVC nor Wichita State would comment beyond the brief  
statements. Christensen could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After last Friday's game, Christensen said he meant the pitch to  
be only a warning and that he didn't mean to hit Molina. Kemnitz 
said at the time he teaches brushback pitches but has never told a 
pitcher to hit a batter. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen, a junior right-hander, leads the Shockers, ranked  
seventh in the Collegiate Baseball poll, with a 9-1 record.

<HEADLINE> NRA Defiant During Colo. Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Charlton Heston took a defiant stand against  
gun-control laws and the news media Saturday and said his National 
Rifle Association wasn't the villain in the Columbine High School 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	While a larger-than-expected crowd came to the gun lobby's  
annual meeting, thousands of opponents circled the meeting site, 
some carrying signs that read ``Shame on the NRA'' and ``NRA, 
Pusher of Child Killer Machines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the nation's largest group of gun owners -- at 2.8  
million members -- cut the meeting from three days to one and 
eliminated a gun exhibit, but refused to cancel it altogether 
despite requests from Mayor Wellington Webb and other local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Heston told about 2,500 cheering supporters that gun owners were  
being unfairly blamed. Though Americans have the right to disagree 
with the NRA, ``We will not be silent or be told, `Do not come 
here, you are not welcome in your own land,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days since the rampage, America has been ``fractured into  
two camps'' -- gun rights advocates and gun-control law advocates, 
said the actor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're often cast as the villain. That's not our role in  
American society and we will not be forced to play it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot, we must not let tragedy lay waste to the most rare,  
hard-won right in history,'' he said, referring to the Second 
Amendment's right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA meeting drew a far larger crowd than expected, with  
older men in fishing caps mingling with younger men in suits and 
ties. Loudspeakers let the overflow crowd to hear the speeches in 
the hotel lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	Heston, who was elected last year, drew frequent applause. He  
accused the Clinton administration and the media of using the 
Columbine killings to push an anti-gun agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8,000 demonstrators gathered outside, including Tom  
Mauser, father of Columbine victim Daniel Mauser, who carried a 
photo of his son that said, ``Don't let my son's death be in 
vain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here today because my son would want me to be here. If my  
son was alive, he would be here, too,'' Mauser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters formed a human chain around the Adam's Mark Hotel,  
some shouting ``No more guns!'' while others sang, ``We Shall 
Overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During an earlier anti-gun rally at the state Capitol, police  
arrested at least one gun-rights advocate after he screamed and 
demanded a chance to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	One demonstrator, Linda Questa, told of ``desperately bargaining  
with God'' to spare her son as she waited with other parents near 
Columbine on the day of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the NRA out this city and this state,'' she said. ``The  
men and women who do business in this building (the Capitol) are 
hoping we will forget ... (but) over the next four years we will be 
watching you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Stephen Foster of Denver told the crowd, ``After Columbine  
anything is possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much too easy to blame the NRA for last week,'' he told  
the protesters, who later marched to the convention site. ``It was 
not the NRA that took guns into that school. We have to look to 
ourselves, too.''

<HEADLINE> Why did Pats' Owner Spurn Conn.? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A day after New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft  
spurned a $380 million stadium offer in Connecticut for a deal in 
Massachusetts that will cost him millions, an obvious question 
remained. 
</P>
<P>
	What was Kraft thinking?  
</P>
<P>
	The answer, according to local business leaders and experts,  
involves a mix of loyalty to his home state and fears the 
Connecticut deal could turn into a financial nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's both, no question,'' said Paul Kirk, who led a group of  
businessmen in a last-second push to keep the team in 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Once doubts surfaced about a 2002 deadline for a Hartford  
stadium opening, Kraft faced the possibility of long, costly delays 
on a project he didn't control, Kirk said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Massachusetts' $70 million plan allows Kraft to take out a  
loan he essentially doesn't have to pay back for construction on 
land he owns in his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a matter of betting on a sure thing or taking a risk for  
a bigger jackpot, according to political consultant Michael 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't willing to take the risk,'' Goldman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kraft was not available for comment Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Signs that Kraft's tentative deal with Connecticut was on shaky  
ground emerged over the last weeks. And hours before the deal was 
called off, Connecticut Gov. John Rowland said the state might not 
have the stadium completed by 2002 -- the deadline set by Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College, said the  
recent troubles might have shown Kraft the Connecticut plan wasn't 
as sweet as it looked. 
</P>
<P>
	Delays with cleanup at the Hartford waterfront site proposed for  
the stadium could have been unpredictably long and costly, despite 
Rowland's projection for a 2003 opening, he said. Kraft would have 
missed a projected $100 million in annual revenue for each year 
missed in Hartford, according to Zimbalist. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Kraft would have presided over a lame-duck team  
with diminishing profitability in Foxboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimbalist added that the National Football League was likely to  
pursue a new franchise for Boston, the country's sixth-largest 
media market. That would have eroded an already weakened fan base, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And given NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue's public advocacy of a  
new Massachusetts home for the Patriots, Kirk said he doubted that 
the league would have approved the move to Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Kraft was thinking about long-term benefits, rather  
than short-term gain, Massachusetts House Speaker Thomas Finneran 
said. He compared the hefty Connecticut deal to ``extra caffeine in 
your coffee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end it might not prove to be helpful,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	While Connecticut's plan was running into problems,  
Massachusetts presented a $70 million package for infrastructure 
improvements. Though Kraft would have to pay for a new stadium 
himself, he can take advantage of a two-month-old NFL 
stadium-financing provision called G-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision could give Kraft league financing for up to half  
of the estimated $250 million cost of a new stadium. But the league 
forgives repayment of the entire principle if Kraft doesn't sell 
the Patriots for 10 years after the stadium is finished. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, league rules permit the one-third share of luxury  
seat revenues -- normally given to visiting NFL teams -- to be used 
for stadium construction. In the end, Kraft's bottom line won't be 
significantly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Finneran, who has opposed former stadium plans, said he expects  
the legislature to approve the stadium plan quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft also stands to benefit for what Kirk called the ``psychic  
income'' from his decision to stay in the state, which he explained 
as the goodwill Kraft will reap from fans happy they stayed put. 
</P>
<P>
	Political consultant Charley Manning said Kraft will be  
``revered'' for his decision to reject a possible short-term gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this day and age, it's almost a heroic gesture to leave the  
money on the table,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zimbalist said it should be clear that if Connecticut's deal  
hadn't run into problems, Kraft would have left his home state in a 
flash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion that he was engaging in some sort of active  
self-sacrifice in order to remain in Boston is, in my view, 
preposterous,'' he said. ``Clearly he was ready to run to the 
riches if he was able to.''

<HEADLINE> 11 Dead in Arkansas Boat Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- An amphibious tourist boat sank  
Saturday, drowning 11 people in a lake as panicked passengers 
scrambled for life preservers and nearby residents rushed to their 
boats to pluck victims from the choppy water. 
</P>
<P>
	The open-air, World War II-vintage boat sank quickly on Lake  
Hamilton near this popular tourist town. A cloth canopy may have 
trapped the victims as the wheeled craft went down less than a mile 
offshore, Mayor Bob Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	A survivor, Gary Ledin, said there was little time to react.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't believe how fast that thing sank,'' he said. He was  
on the boat with his wife, Diann, who also survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Three children were among the dead, including a 2-year-old and a  
5-year-old. Nine of 20 people on board survived, including the 
driver. Only one person was hospitalized and remained on life 
support later Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	One sobbing woman who survived the accident was captured on  
amateur video, shown on KTHV-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost my baby, my husband and my daughter-in-law on that  
boat,'' the unidentified woman said. She complained that the deaths 
could have been prevented. ``We need life jackets on people when 
they get on the boats, not up in the rack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wheeled craft, known as a ``duck,'' was required to carry  
life preservers but passengers were not required to wear them, City 
Manager Kent Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard was investigating and authorities had no  
explanation at a news conference for why the boat took on water. 
The boat had not been recovered from the lake by late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong wind made the water rough when the accident occurred on  
the lake lined by hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat is equipped for both land and water, with three axles,  
six wheels and the ability to hold 25 or 26 people, including an 
operator who rides in the front. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically a boat hull on wheels,'' said Coast Guard Lt.  
Bruce Fisher, chief of port operations at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat sank in one or two minutes, said Myers. Ledin said it  
felt more like 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents used their own boats to assist when they saw the craft  
going down. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people in the nearby condos saw what was happening, they  
rushed to their boats and went out to help,'' said Joe Sexson, 
director of emergency services for nearby Hot Springs National 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot Springs is about an hour southwest of Little Rock and is  
popular with boaters and sightseers. After the Oaklawn Park 
thoroughbred racing season ends each April, visitors flock to 
several lakes or to Bathhouse Row, the anchor of the national park 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The amphibious boats have rolled and floated through Hot Springs  
for 40 years, offering their guests scenic views of the century-old 
bathhouses. The ducks, whose tickets cost $9, ferry visitors among 
the city's tourist attractions and to the scenic lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said the duck that sank was owned by White &AMP; Yellow Duck  
Sightseeing Tours and operated by its subsidiary, Land and Lake 
Tours Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicles are generally World War II surplus built for the  
Army to carry troops directly from land into the water, Fisher 
said. They are inspected by the Coast Guard annually, usually in 
late fall or winter when the tourist season is quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Bridges, who owns White &AMP; Yellow, said his boats are well  
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always tried to make our operation as safe as possible  
and go to great lengths to maintain our ducks and equipment to the 
highest standards and to properly train our drivers,'' he said. 
``Unfortunately, sometimes, even when you do your best, accidents 
will happen.''

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Crosses Smaller at Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- As the community struggles to understand  
why Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold opened fire on their classmates, 
it's also struggling to find a fitting tribute to them. 
</P>
<P>
	On a hill overlooking Columbine High School, tall wooden crosses  
had been erected for the killers, alongside those for each of their 
13 victims. But on Friday, 10 days after the attack, relatives of 
one victim destroyed the markers for Harris and Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday afternoon, someone had put thigh-high wooden crosses  
where the 6-foot-tall ones once stood. Flowers were piled up at 
their bases, just like those for the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the small crosses, there were letters from mourners  
asking ``Why?'' Harris and Klebold shot and killed 12 students, a 
teacher and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they should be on the same hill, because what  
happened to these 13 is not the same as those two,'' said Sara 
Zeagler, 22, one of hundreds of people who climbed the muddy hill 
in pouring rain Saturday. ``These crosses wouldn't be here if it 
weren't for those two. So they don't belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the feeling of Brian Rohrbough, whose son, Daniel, 15,  
was killed in the April 20 rampage. Family members cut up the 
crosses, and Rohrbough said most bystanders agreed with the action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any thinking person in this country is going to  
disagree with me,'' Rohrbough said. ``We never ever honor a 
murderer in the same place as the memorial for his victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That made perfect sense to Jody Baker, among the throngs filing  
past the crosses. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they do need to be remembered,'' said Ms. Baker, 31, of  
nearby Highlands Ranch. ``They were kids that died and they 
probably needed help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another mourner, Katherine Pollock, agreed but said she was glad  
the new crosses were smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	``These poor kids -- there was something terribly wrong with  
them,'' said Pollock, 29, of Aspen. ``I think that some people 
needed to show them some respect that they obviously didn't get in 
life. And maybe from wherever they are, they're seeing this and 
thinking, 'Maybe we didn't have to do that.' I don't know, it's 
tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investigators seeking interviews with the killers'  
parents are getting mixed responses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County District Attorney's office interviewed  
Klebold's parents for nearly two hours Friday, but prosecutors said 
Harris' parents have refused to be interviewed unless they get 
immunity from prosecution. Prosecutors did not grant the request.

<HEADLINE> Pizza Chains Battle Over Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The competition between Papa John's and  
Pizza Hut isn't so friendly these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Papa John's filed a lawsuit against its rival on Friday,  
accusing it launching a misleading advertising campaign that 
literally borrows from Papa John's own marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Pizza Hut made similar false-advertising charges  
against Papa John's in a suit that is pending in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest salvo, Papa John's says the offending ad falsely  
implies that the company uses stale dough in its pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pizza Hut ad includes an electronically altered portion of a  
Papa John's commercial in which its chairman says, ``We never use 
dough made the same day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That line in the original Papa John's commercial was intended to  
mean that dough allowed to rise for several days makes a better 
pizza crust. But Friday's complaint charges that Pizza Hut used the 
statement to suggest that Papa John's dough isn't fresh. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad is ``a very aggressive and intentional attempt to  
embarrass myself and the Papa John's brand,'' said company chairman 
John Schnatter. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza Hut said it had not yet seen the lawsuit and couldn't  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the accusation that Papa John's itself has engaged in  
false advertising, Schnatter said his company merely ``poked a 
little fun'' at Pizza Hut.

	Gherini, who lived in Ventura, was patriarch of a family that  
since 1880 had owned thousands of acres of land on Santa Cruz 
Island, 20 miles off the Ventura County coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the island was designated to become part of a  
five-island national park chain. In the early 1990s, the National 
Park Service bought out Gherini's three siblings. But he rejected a 
$4 million offer for his 6,300 acres, contending it was worth $14 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	He sued after the government condemned and seized the land in  
1997, and a federal jury awarded him $12.7 million in February.

</P>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Mark Weiser, the Xerox Corp.  
technologist known as ``the father of ubiquitous computing,'' died 
Tuesday from complications of cancer. He was 46. 
</P>
<P>
	With his staunch belief that computer technology could be folded  
into all aspects of daily life, Weiser was celebrated in the 
high-tech world as a visionary and computer science pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	He often spoke of the day when a person's refrigerator might  
remind a shopper that he needed milk or when office workers would 
be surrounded by ``smart'' printers and copy machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was driven by looking at how computers could simplify our  
lives and improve the quality of our living and the quality of our 
experience,'' said John Seely Brown, the director of the Palo Alto 
Research Center and a Xerox vice president. ``He was really 
interested in the mantra of, `How do you fit computers to people,' 
rather than people to computers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, at a time of huge mainframe and desktop computers,  
Weiser coined the term ``ubiquitous computing'' to describe a 
vision of computers disappearing into the objects used in daily 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, he left Xerox to commercialize some of his ideas. But a  
company he formed failed during a time when Silicon Valley venture 
capitalists were pouring money into Internet startups. Weiser 
returned to the research center as its chief technology officer in 
1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Wolde Harris scored in the 82nd minute  
Saturday night to give the Colorado Rapids a 2-1 victory over the 
New England Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, which hadn't played since April 17, having its last  
home match postponed in recognition of the Columbine High School 
massacre in Littleton, Colo., won its third straight after starting 
the season 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution, whose previous losses had all been in shootouts,  
fell to 2-4, and is winless in all three home matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado took the lead in the seventh minute of the first half  
when Jorge Dely Valdes scored off a through ball by Paul Bravo, 
splitting New England defenders Brian Dunseth and Dan Calichman 
with a 12-yard shot to the far left corner past goalkeeper Walter 
Zenga. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe-Max Moore countered in the 20th minute by one-skipping a  
direct free kick from 30 yards out around the right side of a wall 
of five Colorado defenders and by goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann.

<HEADLINE> Eric Harris' Family Seeks Immunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The parents of one of the gunmen  
involved in the Columbine High School massacre have refused to talk 
with investigators because prosecutors will not give them immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Deputy District Attorney Mark Pautler said an attorney  
representing Wayne and Katherine Harris informed investigators of 
their decision when they tried to set up an interview. His office 
rejected the request Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to interview them as witnesses. We're disappointed  
they won't cooperate. We don't know why they think they needed 
immunity,'' Pautler said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said investigators had arranged to talk with the parents of  
the other gunman, Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	Pautler said anyone with advance knowledge of the attack could  
be charged with a variety of crimes, from failing to report a crime 
to conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any reason to believe they (the Harrises) were  
participants in this offense,'' he said. ``We're disappointed they 
won't cooperate with us or speak to us. Not parenting properly is 
not an offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, about 1,000 people gathered at the state Capitol in  
nearby Denver this morning for a protest demonstration during the 
annual meeting of the National Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the crowd carried signs that read ``Shame on the  
NRA,'' and ``NRA, Pusher of Child Killer Machines,'' among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here because I'm very worried about the future for my  
children. I despair if guns are going to remain as readily 
available as they are now,'' said Frances Aramovich of Denver. She 
was accompanied by her children, Natalia, 4, and Tom, 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control advocates, joined by Denver Mayor Wellington Webb,  
had urged the NRA to cancel the meeting in response to the 
shootings. NRA officials scaled back the gathering from three days 
to one, but refused to scrap the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	On a hill overlooking the school, where mourners erected one  
cross for each of the 13 victims and the two gunmen, relatives of 
one student who died in the rampage destroyed the crosses for 
Harris and Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any thinking person in this country is going to  
disagree with me,'' said Brian Rohrbough, whose son Daniel, 15, was 
killed. ``We never ever honor a murderer in the same place as the 
memorial for his victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbough, 40, said many bystanders supported the family's  
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Jefferson County authorities responded to criticism  
that they ignored a complaint that Harris, 18, threatened to kill a 
classmate and had often talked about making and detonating pipe 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	A sheriff's deputy assigned to Columbine had been keeping an eye  
on Harris and Klebold, 17, after the reported threat, but officials 
said there was little they could do because the parents who 
reported the threats wanted to remain anonymous. And investigators 
found no evidence of lawbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the ability to speak to a victim or positively  
identify a suspect, elements of a crime could not be established,'' 
said sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	About a year before the April 20 assault, Neil Gardner, the  
sheriff's deputy stationed at Columbine, received a ``suspicious 
incident'' report that Harris' Web site discussed detonating pipe 
bombs and committing mass murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner was at Columbine when Harris and Klebold attacked the  
school with bombs and assault weapons. He exchanged fire with one 
of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The March 1998 incident report came from Randy Brown, who  
claimed his 18-year-old son Brooks had been repeatedly threatened 
by Harris, a schoolmate. Brown gave the sheriff's office printouts 
of Harris' Web site warnings, which included threats to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	``God, I can't wait until I can kill you people'' read one of  
the postings. ``I'll just go to some downtown area in some big 
(expletive) city and blow up and shoot everything I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the Browns refused to let their son's name be used  
in the investigation, and they also declined to file a formal 
complaint that would have allowed investigators to directly 
question Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	A threatening e-mail sent to Brooks Brown was deleted, so  
investigators were not able to follow up the lead. Detectives tried 
but could not find Harris' Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns told NBC News that the sheriff's department response  
to their report was ``ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hoping they would go to the school. We were hoping  
they would go to the parents,'' Judy Brown said.

<HEADLINE> Ray Wins Pole at Charlotte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Maybe nothing can keep a Team Menard car  
from winning the pole for the VisionAire 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Ray captured the top starting spot for tonight's race by  
running the fastest lap ever recorded at Lowe's Motor Speedway at 
Charlotte. It marked the third time in the 3-year history of the 
VisionAire 500 that a Team Menard driver won the pole, but this one 
was anything but routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were lucky enough to reach under the hat and find the  
rabbit,'' Ray said after he overcame several potential problems 
before and during Friday night's qualifying run. 
</P>
<P>
	It started in technical inspection before time trials, when Pep  
Boys Indy Racing League inspectors failed Ray's Dallara Aurora 
because of a problem with its ground clearance. According to Ray, 
the machine's ground clearance was too low by one-hundredth of an 
inch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nothing that gave us a technical advantage,'' Ray said,  
``but it didn't comply, so we had to adjust it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL's penalty was to limit Ray to just one qualifying lap  
instead of two like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's problems still weren't finished, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were in such a hurry to get going after the second  
inspection that we forgot to hook up the radio,'' he said. ``I had 
absolutely no idea how fast I was going, but I knew I only had one 
lap to do it. I just tried to squeeze every little bit I could out 
of the race car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That turned out to be enough. Ray recorded a speed of 222.039  
mph, shattering the track record of 220.498 set one year ago by 
Tony Stewart, the driver Ray succeeded at Team Menard. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Sharp and Scott Goodyear, the series points leader after  
two of 11 races, both broke the track record as well in the lone 
round of qualifying. Sharp had a 221.239 and Goodyear a 221.076 on 
a cool evening when rain delayed qualifying and high winds made it 
more difficult on the 1.5-mile, high-banked trioval. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very hard to be completely consistent,'' Goodyear said.  
``You feel like you're being moved around the track a whole lot. It 
feels like it can move you as much as a half car-length to either 
side, and that's certainly not something that would be good in the 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying began an hour late because of delays caused by four  
days of often heavy rains in the region. Thursday's practice 
sessions were wiped out by the storms, and there originally was 
some thought that Friday's lone scheduled round of time trials 
would also become a casualty. 
</P>
<P>
	Since this is the circuit's first stop of the year at a  
high-banked superspeedway, IRL officials considered eliminating 
qualifying in favor of practice time to help the teams adjust to 
the speeds. Track officials, however, employed some unique methods 
to salvage a practice session and still leave enough time for 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Once it became apparent that the water seepage and runoff were  
especially heavy in the fourth turn, the speedway dispatched crews 
to the area to seek a two-pronged solution. Workers drilled 
2-foot-deep holes into the track and used heavy-duty concrete saws 
to cut small grooves that channeled the water off the 24-degree 
banking.

<HEADLINE> Mutiny 2, Fusion 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Musa Shannon scored in his fifth consecutive  
game and Carlos Valderrama had an assist against his former team as 
the Tampa Bay Mutiny beat the Miami Fusion 2-1 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Valderrama, who played for the Mutiny in 1996 and 1997, saw his  
night end early when referee Alex Prus issued a red card after the 
midfielder's slide tackle from behind on Henry Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon opened the scoring in the sixth minute and Valderrama  
set up Jefferson Gottardi's goal that made it 2-0 in the 28th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Diego Serna scored the Miami goal on a header in the 69th  
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The assist for Valderrama, who received a standing ovation  
during pregame introductions in his Mutiny home debut this season, 
was his first since the Colombian standout was reassigned from 
Miami to Tampa Bay by MLS commissioner Doug Logan on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The league action stemmed from a severely strained relationship  
between Valderrama and Fusion coach Ivo Wortmann that eventually 
found the midfielder being benched. 
</P>
<P>
	After starting the season with four losses, Tampa Bay has won  
two straight with Valderrama in the lineup.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Heavyweight Champ McCall Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Former heavyweight boxing champion  
Oliver McCall was released from jail Saturday after serving a 
little more than half of a one-year jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great,'' McCall, 35, said in a telephone interview  
after his release. ``I want to get ready to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCall, who was in jail for resisting arrest and assaulting a  
law enforcement officer, blames repeated problems with the law on 
an addiction to cocaine. A Martinsville judge decided that McCall 
could be released as long as he stays in a drug rehabilitation 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't going to have no problems,'' McCall said Saturday.  
``I'm drug free and I'm going to stay that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCall and his lawyer plan to go to an Ohio training center to  
begin training. 
</P>
<P>
	McCall said promoter Don King is arranging for him to return to  
the ring in Mississippi in June. He said he doesn't yet know who 
he'll face. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighter knocked out Lennox Lewis for the WBC title in  
September 1994, then defended the title against Larry Holmes in 
1995. He then lost his belt to Frank Bruno in a 12-round decision. 
</P>
<P>
	He fought Lewis again on Feb. 8, 1997 for the vacant WBC title.  
It was stopped after four rounds and awarded to Lewis when a 
sobbing McCall refused to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	McCall was arrested in Martinsville last Oct. 14, convicted Dec.  
18 and sentenced to one year in jail and 10 years probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Circuit Judge Charles Stone decided to release  
McCall after King testified that he would help him rededicate his 
life to being a productive citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone expressed reservations about the release, and ordered that  
the fighter submit to random drug testing three times every two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have the best of intentions, when you've been caught and  
you are in jail and you're away from the (drugs),'' Stone said at 
the time. ``... But when you get out there, that all flies out the 
window and all you want to do is get cocaine. I've seen it happen 
again and again.''

	Milosevic To Free Three U.S. POWs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has  
agreed to hand three American prisoners over Sunday to the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, who will escort them to freedom in Croatia. 
Milosevic's action could be a genuine peace move or a clever 
end-run around the White House to exploit congressional doubts 
about the handling of the crisis with Yugoslavia. Jackson will also 
carry a letter from Milosevic to President Clinton outlining steps 
to stop the conflict. Jackson said it includes a stunning offer by 
Milosevic to meet face-to-face with Clinton ``and to take this 
matter to resolution through negotiations.''

War II-vintage boat panicked and scrambled for life preservers as 
it took on water and sank suddenly on Lake Hamilton near this 
popular tourist town, the city manager said. The dead included 
three children, including a young girl. The driver of the boat was

<HEADLINE> Farm Price Reporting Deal Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A patchwork of state legislation requiring  
meatpackers to reveal the prices they pay, coupled with a directive 
from Congress, has brought together the rarest of allies -- the 
processing industry and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides are hard at work on a compromise to the thorny issue  
known as mandatory price reporting. Packers and producers have met 
about 15 times since March and work has moved so well that the 
coalition hopes to deliver draft language for federal legislation 
to Capitol Hill in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe both sides have learned from these discussions and  
gained a better understanding of what we are seeking and how to 
best achieve those goals without harming producers,'' George Swan, 
president of the National Cattlemen's Association, told a House 
Agriculture subcommittee last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are breaking down the barriers of suspicion and  
mistrust,'' said Rep. Richard W. Pombo, R-Calif. ``In the end, just 
by putting this issue behind them, each side will be better off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mandatory price reporting long has been a hot-button issue. Many  
farmers have accused big companies of pushing them out by keeping 
prices secret. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue became even more urgent for farmers as prices paid to  
producers spiraled downward over the last year. After hog prices 
dropped to their lowest levels in 40 years in December, the 
National Pork Producers Council, which had pushed with little 
success for a voluntary reporting system, endorsed mandatory price 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it is time to demand real and meaningful market  
transparency in the livestock marketplace,'' said John McNutt, the 
council's president. 
</P>
<P>
	As the low livestock prices sent an already struggling  
agricultural economy into a tailspin, both Republican and 
Democratic lawmakers began offering proposals for mandatory price 
reporting. The Clinton administration, which has supported the 
issue but never put forth legislation, offered its proposal last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers on both sides predict the issue finally has enough  
support to pass Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	House Agriculture Chairman Larry Combest, R-Texas, and Rep.  
Larry Stenholm, D-Texas, the committee's ranking member, got the 
negotiating process started last month when they called on all 
sides to come together. 
</P>
<P>
	``The logic was simple. Nobody is more qualified to know better  
what will work than the effected parties themselves,'' Combest 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, perhaps most daunting for the packers was the prospect of  
various state laws requiring mandatory price reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	South Dakota passed a price reporting law, effective July 1.  
Similar efforts are under way in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and 
Kansas. Advocates predict the trend will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has moved quickly on this venture in an effort to  
head off some very misguided legislation in a number of state 
legislatures,'' said Ken Bull, vice president of cattle procurement 
for Wichita, Kan.-based Excel Corp., a subsidiary of food giant 
Cargill Inc. ``Many of these state proposals will cause real harm 
to the industry, and to producers in particular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Dakota's proposal, for instance, makes it illegal for  
processors to contract with farmers, Bull said, adding that many 
creditors require contracts in order for borrowers to qualify for 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Willms, vice president for cattle procurement at Greeley,  
Colo.-based Monfort, Inc., a subsidiary of ConAgra, urged Congress 
last week to embrace ``on a national basis'' whatever proposal is 
put forth. 
</P>
<P>
	``To avoid the commercially disruptive situations, cattle  
producers, and I believe pork producers, jointly recommend that 
this legislation pre-empt state reporting requirements,'' Willms 
said.

Saturday, drowning 11 people in a lake as panicked passengers 
scrambled for life preservers and nearby residents rushed to their 
boats to pluck victims from the choppy water. 
</P>
<P>
	The open-air, World War II-vintage boat sank quickly on Lake  
Hamilton near this popular tourist town. A cloth canopy may have 
trapped the victims as the wheeled craft went down less than a mile 
offshore, Mayor Bob Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	A survivor, Gary Ledin, said there was little time to react.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't believe how fast that thing sank,'' he said. He was  
on the boat with his wife, Diann, who also survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Three children were among the dead, including a 2-year-old and a  
5-year-old. Nine of 20 people on board survived, including the 
driver. Only one person was hospitalized and remained on life 
support later Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard was investigating and authorities had no  
explanation at a news conference for why the boat took on water. 
The boat had not been recovered from the lake by late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong wind made the water rough when the accident occurred on  
the lake lined by hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	The wheeled craft, known as a ``duck,'' was required to carry  
life preservers but passengers were not required to wear them, 
Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat is equipped for both land and water, with three axles,  
six wheels and the ability to hold 25 or 26 people, including an 
operator who rides in the front. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically a boat hull on wheels,'' said Coast Guard Lt.  
Bruce Fisher, chief of port operations at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat sank in one or two minutes, said City Manager Kent  
Myers. Ledin said it felt more like 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents used their own boats to assist when they saw the craft  
going down. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people in the nearby condos saw what was happening, they  
rushed to their boats and went out to help,'' said Joe Sexson, 
director of emergency services for nearby Hot Springs National 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot Springs is about an hour southwest of Little Rock and is  
popular with boaters and sightseers. After the Oaklawn Park 
thoroughbred racing season ends each April, visitors flock to 
several lakes or to Bathhouse Row, the anchor of the national park 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The amphibious boats have rolled and floated through Hot Springs  
for 40 years, offering their guests scenic views of the century-old 
bathhouses. The ducks, whose tickets cost $9, ferry visitors among 
the city's tourist attractions and to the scenic lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said the duck that sank was owned by White &AMP; Yellow Duck  
Sightseeing Tours and operated by its subsidiary, Land and Lake 
Tours Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicles are generally World War II surplus built for the  
Army to carry troops directly from land into the water, Fisher 
said. They are inspected by the Coast Guard annually, usually in 
late fall or winter when the tourist season is quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Bridges, who owns White &AMP; Yellow, said his boats are well  
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always tried to make our operation as safe as possible  
and go to great lengths to maintain our ducks and equipment to the 
highest standards and to properly train our drivers,'' he said. 
``Unfortunately, sometimes, even when you do your best, accidents 
will happen.''

<HEADLINE> Duke KO'd in Livingston Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Former Gov. Dave Treen and state Rep. David  
Vitter qualified Saturday for a May 29 runoff to replace Bob 
Livingston in the House. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke ran 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	While Treen and Vitter celebrated, Duke refused to concede and  
backed off earlier statements that this would be the end of his 
political career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said I don't have any plans to run for office,'' he told  
reporters. ``I don't have any plans, but I can tell you this: I 
will never give up the fight for the preservation of our European 
culture and heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three are Republicans in the heavily GOP 1st District in  
suburban New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Complete but unofficial returns showed Treen with 36,547 votes,  
or 25 percent. Vitter received 31,652 votes, or 22 percent. Duke 
had 27,967 votes, or 19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to run a campaign like I ran before -- positive,''  
Treen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter told supporters: ``This is the real victory party,  
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ophthalmologist Monica Monica received 22,855 votes, or 16  
percent. State Rep. Bill Strain, a Democrat, received 16,372 votes, 
or 11 percent. Four other candidates split the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., the chairman of the National Republican  
Congressional Committee, said of Duke's loss: ``We're relieved that 
the voters rejected David Duke. He's out of it, thank goodness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston was in line to become House Speaker after more than  
20 years in Congress. But he abruptly announced his resignation in 
December after confessing to marital infidelities. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently endorsed Treen, a 70-year-old former Republican  
governor and himself a veteran of 7 1/2 years in Congress. But some 
Republicans feared Duke would return to haunt the party in the 1st 
District. The New Orleans suburban district is 85 percent white and 
predominantly Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke enjoyed a surprising, if brief, run of political success 10  
years ago after joining the GOP. Despite his early start, his 
candidacy this time out was quickly overshadowed and largely 
ignored by the other candidates. Polls showed him with less than 10 
percent support. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the election was seen as a test of Duke's oft-repeated  
theory that he ``flies below radar,'' meaning his supporters rarely 
admit their preferences for him in polls. 
</P>
<P>
	When Livingston announced his resignation in December, Duke was  
hawking an autobiography touting his theories that blacks have 
genetically low intelligence and raising the idea of a separate 
black homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced his candidacy the same day and said later this  
would be his last political race unless he won. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine candidates -- seven Republicans and two Democrats -- ran on  
one ballot under Louisiana's unique open primary system. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls had indicated Treen would likely finish on top but would  
fall short of the majority needed for outright victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Strain, an 18-year veteran of the state House, was considered  
the Democrats' only hope of taking the seat, but he kept a 
relatively low profile throughout the campaign and his poll numbers 
were low. 
</P>
<P>
	The also-rans in the race included area businessman Rob Couhig  
and three unknowns: Republicans Patrick Landry and S.J. LoCoco, and 
Democrat Darryl Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen gained momentum last week when House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert said he would receive seniority credit for his years spent 
in Congress before being elected governor in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke narrowly won a spot in the state House from the suburb of  
Metairie in 1989. He went on to shock the nation by winning a spot 
in the 1991 runoff for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	After former Gov. Edwin Edwards beat him in a landslide that  
year, his political fortunes faded, marked by a weak run for 
president, an abandoned second try for governor in 1995 and a 
fourth-place finish in the 1996 U.S. Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his early start, his candidacy this time out was quickly  
overshadowed and largely ignored by the other candidates. Polls 
showed him with less than 10 percent support. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the election was seen as a test of his oft-repeated  
theory that he ``flies below radar,'' meaning his supporters rarely 
admit their preferences for him in polls.

<HEADLINE> NBA Ref Might Have Tax Case Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Tax-evasion charges against an NBA referee  
should be dropped because a grand jury operated improperly, a 
federal judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Judge David Baker issued his recommendation  
Friday, temporarily halting the trial of Blane Reichelt. Jury 
selection was to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two grand juries heard evidence in the case against Reichelt,  
but only the second grand jury voted to indict him. In his report, 
Baker said the second grand jury failed to receive transcripts 
presented to the first grand jury as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grand jury's independence is subject to grave doubt,''  
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and defense attorneys declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Reichelt, an 18-year veteran of the NBA, was one of 12 referees  
who were investigated by the Internal Revenue Service in 
``Operation Slam Dunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials were charged with exchanging first-class airline  
tickets provided by the league for coach tickets and pocketing the 
difference without reporting the extra income on their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Reichelt, of Melbourne, Fla., failed to report $13,680  
in taxable income, the indictment against him said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Patricia Fawsett was expected to rule on  
Baker's recommendation next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the referees were charged in the IRS investigation  
pleaded guilty. They were sentenced to probation or short periods 
of house arrest and ordered to pay the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	One referee, Steve Javie, was acquitted by a jury in  
Philadelphia in January.

<HEADLINE> Ideal Towne Wins Berry's Creek Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Ideal Towne charged down the middle  
of the track to win a battle of late-pacing colts and captured the 
$300,000 Berry's Creek pace at the Meadowlands on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In giving driver Mike Lachance his third win in this race, Ideal  
Towne paced the mile for 3-year-olds in 1:52 and got to the wire 
three-quarters of a length ahead of The Paper Wazoo, who made a 
late move along the rail with Luc Ouellette. 
</P>
<P>
	Homespun Fun finished third, another head back and a nose in  
front of heavy favorite Union Guy, who also made a run from the 
back of the pack, but even further outside Ideal Towne. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideal Towne, who finished second in his elimination for this  
race last week, returned $9.40, $4.80 and $4 in winning for the 
first time in three starts this year. The Illinois-bred son of 
Ideal Society earned $150,000 in doubling his lifetime earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chris Ryder-trained colt earned $143,500 in winning five of  
seven starts last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking from the No. 5 post, Lachance and Ideal Towne took  
advantage of the fact that the speed horses in the race had outside 
posts. That meant they could sit back and let those horses rush out 
to the lead and set fast fractions. 
</P>
<P>
	Homespun Fun, who had the No. 6 post, took the 10-horse field  
through the first quarter in 26.4 seconds and then entry mate 
Salinas Hanover took the lead and reached the half mile in 54.1 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Salinas Hanover, who was driven by Jack Moiseyev, built a  
two-length lead in the stretch, but Lachance had Ideal Towne 
storming down the middle of the track. The colt had been sixth or 
seventh most of the mile and was fifth entering the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little before the half I pulled and I was waiting for the  
stretch to pick up the pieces,'' Lachance said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Campbell and Union Guy, who had the No. 8 post, had posted  
the fastest winning time (1:51.4) in winning his elimination on the 
front end last week. This week, they tried to come from behind and 
didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was following the winner,'' Campbell said. ``He really  
didn't fire as well as I hoped. The last quarter was only 29. There 
was more traffic than you'd like. But the fractions were stiff 
enough that I thought he'd pass more horses than he did.''

<HEADLINE> Lee Leaves Motley Crue for Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tommy Lee is getting another divorce, this  
time from Motley Crue. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old drummer said he's leaving the rock group he  
founded in 1981 with Nikki Sixx and will not be joining them on 
this summer's ``Maximum Rock'' tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will miss them and the fans, but it's time for me to totally  
embrace my family and my new projects,'' Lee said Thursday, the 
same day he and wife Pamela Anderson Lee said they had reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
	Guns 'N Roses drummer Matt Sorum was asked to replace Lee for  
the 40-city summer tour beginning in late June. Band spokeswoman 
Ashley Smith said Friday that Sorum has yet to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee and his wife, the star of TV's ``V.I.P'' and a former  
``Baywatch'' actress, said they have decided to reunite and rebuild 
their family a year after their divorce. Lee was arrested for 
hitting her while on probation for attacking a photographer. He was 
given three years of probation and ordered to stay 100 yards away 
from Ms. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they're living together in Malibu. They have two children,  
3-year-old Brandon and 1-year-old Dylan.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Griffey Ties Slams Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Lost in the shuffle of last year's home run chase  
and overshadowed by Jose Canseco's power surge this season, Ken 
Griffey Jr. still has a lot of drama left in his bat. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, the Seattle Mariners' slugger became the 12th  
American League player and 18th in the major leagues to hit grand 
slams in consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	The last player to get consecutive slams -- Sammy Sosa, in the  
midst of his pursuit of the home-run record with Mark McGwire last 
July 27-28. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey's second slam in two nights came off Toronto left-hander  
Graeme Lloyd's first pitch in the eighth inning, lifting the 
Mariners to an 11-9 victory. It was much more than Griffey was 
aiming for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just looking to stay out of the double play,'' the  
Mariners' All-Star center fielder said. ``That's the biggest thing 
in that situation, staying out of the double play and giving your 
team a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey's big game -- 2-for-5 with five RBIs -- followed his  
two-homer, six-RBI game Thursday night, a 22-6 win over Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	His six RBIs against the Tigers tied his career high and his 11  
RBIs in consecutive games set a Mariners record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry much about that,'' Griffey said. ``The main  
thing is the two wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Griffey didn't come close to the 70 home runs  
McGwire hit last season, or even the 66 Sosa had. But he did hit 56 
for the second consecutive year and he had nine in the first month 
this season, one behind Tampa Bay's Canseco, the major league home 
run leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in his 11th season, he's moved past Yogi Berra into a tie  
for 47th on the all-time homer list with Johnny Mize at 359 -- or 
396 behind Henry Aaron's career mark of 755. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for a player who was mired in a 1-for-18 slump before  
Thursday night's game with Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Chili Davis, now with the New York Yankees, gave Griffey some  
advice in Griffey's rookie season in 1989, something he always 
remembers in those rare times of trouble at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was something like 1-for-16,'' Griffey said. ``Chili came up  
to me and said, `I had a stretch when I was 10-for-90. Don't worry 
about it, kid. You'll be fine.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The usually unemotional Griffey celebrated after Friday night's  
slam. As the ball cleared the Kingdome wall in right center, he 
lifted his arms in the air while rounding first base and broke out 
in a big smile as he reached the Mariners' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just emotion from coming from behind,'' said Griffey,  
who was 1-for-9 in his career against Lloyd before then. ``Anytime 
you come from behind, it gives the team a lift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey's 12th career grand slam gave the Mariners a modest  
three-game winning streak and brought them within one game of .500. 
Until now, it's been another tough season for the Mariners, who 
were a disappointing third in the AL West last year, but they 
overcame 6-1 and 7-3 deficits to win their last two. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a positive,'' Griffey said of the comeback wins. ``That  
this team never gives up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners have struggled without All-Star shortstop Alex  
Rodriguez, who usually bats No. 2 in the lineup in front of 
Griffey. Rodriguez is out for at least two more weeks because of a 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Wilson, Rafael Bouirnigal and Butch Husky were aboard on  
walks by Robert Person before Griffey's latest homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order for us to get back in these ballgames, we have to do  
the little things, which we're starting to do,'' Griffey said.

<HEADLINE> Baffert Pushes Filly in Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Derby or not?  
</P>
<P>
	When the gates opened for today's 125th Kentucky Derby, the  
field of 19 3-year-olds included two fillies -- Excellent Meeting 
and Three Ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Running fillies in the Derby has always been a tough decision  
for owners and trainers, which is why only 36 have competed in the 
first 124 derbies. Just three have won it. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt, it's a tough call,'' said trainer D. Wayne Lukas,  
who sent out the last four fillies who ran in the Derby and won it 
with Winning Colors in 1988. ``It's a totally different scenario 
when they run with the colts. It throws them into uncharted 
waters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainers Bob Baffert and Eddie Plesa decided to take the plunge  
this year, even though their fillies are testing the boys for the 
first time in the 1 1/4-mile race (5:27 p.m. EDT post time) at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert sends out Excellent Meeting, while Plesa saddles Three  
Ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The field was reduced from 20 on Friday when Aljabr, owned by  
Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum's Godolphin Stable, was scratched, 
leaving Worldly Manner as the Dubai-based stable's only Derby 
entry. 
</P>
<P>
	The reluctance to send fillies against colts is based on several  
factors. Fillies tend to be smaller, lighter and generally more 
fragile. Additionally, some are hesitant to race in close quarters 
because of all the banging that goes on. The races are longer, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Excellent Meeting will be able to take a lot of the  
heat, the dirt, the trip,'' said Baffert, who has three chances to 
win an unprecedented third consecutive Derby. ``She's training 
great over the track, she's peaking, and she can easily win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting and General Challenge, both owned by John  
Mabee, will race as an entry and were listed as the third choice in 
early wagering at 6-1; Stephen Got Even, trained by two-time Derby 
winner Nick Zito, was the favorite at 4-1, with Menifee and Vicar 
co-second choices at 5-1. Prime Timber, Baffert's other Derby 
horse, was 12-1 in early wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting is unbeaten in three starts this year, while  
Three Ring is coming off a win the Bonnie Miss at Park on March 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert waited until Friday before declaring his filly in the  
Derby and out of the Oaks, which was won by Silverbulletday, 
trained by Baffert and owned by Mike Pegram. Plesa never wavered. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you've got an owner and trainer on the same page, it  
makes it easy,'' Plesa said. ``We're in the race to win, not make 
some kind of a statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regret was the first filly to win the Derby in 1915; Genuine  
Risk won in 1980 and Winning Colors won in '88. Even the first 
Derby had a filly -- Ascension -- who ran 10th in 1875. 
</P>
<P>
	Two fillies are in a Derby for just the eighth time -- the last  
time it happened was 1984, with Lukas' Life's Magic eighth and 
Althea 19th. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who sends out Cat Thief and Charismatic today in his bid  
for a fourth Derby win, prefers his fillies to go against colts 
before making a Derby decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take Winning Colors,'' Lukas said. ``She won by nine at Santa  
Anita, so I knew she could do it. It lets you know they can handle 
the pressure. Fillies are built differently and the filly races are 
considerably easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last filly to run in the Derby was Siren's Song, who ran  
16th in Lukas' bid for a third consecutive Derby victory. It's 
Baffert's turn to go for a three-peat, and he's glad to have a 
filly along. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was training her for the Derby all along, and was going to  
leave it up to fate and see how she drew,'' said Baffert, referring 
to Wednesday's draft of post positions. ``And when she drew a 
favorable post, I thought something's telling me she needs to 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram, who also owns '98 Derby and Preakness winner Real Quiet,  
never considered Silverbulletday for the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned as a kid that if you're going to pick a fight you  
better have an edge,'' Pegram said. ``There's no edge in a 20-horse 
field.''

	NATO: F-16 Crashes, Pilot Saved  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO said a U.S. F-16 fighter plane  
went down over western Serbia early Sunday. The pilot of the 
aircraft was rescued by allied forces, an alliance spokesman said. 
The unidentified pilot was undergoing a medical examination, Lt. 
Col. Michael Kaemnerer said at NATO military headquarters in the 
Belgian capital. The plane was the second NATO has acknowledged 
losing in action over Yugoslavia since the air campaign started 
March 24.

	Milosevic Agrees to Release POWs  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic  
agreed Saturday to hand over three captured U.S. soldiers to the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson, who urged NATO to reward the gesture by halting 
the bombing of Yugoslavia for one night. Jackson said he would be

Jackson's pleas to give Yugoslavia a ``night of peace from bombs,'' 
U.S. officials said the prisoners' release would have no effect on 
NATO's air campaign.

	Heston Takes Stand Against Gun Laws  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Charlton Heston took a defiant stand against  
gun-control laws Saturday at the National Rifle Association's 
annual meeting in Denver, saying the NRA isn't the villain in the 
Colorado school shooting. While the gun lobby held its annual 
meeting, thousands of opponents circled outside. Officials of the 
nation's largest group of gun owners -- at 2.8 million members -- 
refused to cancel the meeting despite requests from Mayor 
Wellington Webb and other local officials. ``We will not be silent 
or be told, `Do not come here, you are not welcome in your own 
land,''' Heston said.

	Arkansas Boat Accident Kills 11

<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- An amphibious tourist boat sank  
Saturday, drowning 11 people in a lake as panicked passengers 
scrambled for life preservers and nearby residents rushed to their 
boats to pluck victims from the choppy water. The open-air, World 
War II-vintage boat sank quickly on Lake Hamilton near this popular 
tourist town. A cloth canopy may have trapped the victims as the 
wheeled craft went down less than a mile offshore, Mayor Bob Mathis 
said. A survivor, Gary Ledin, said there was little time to react.

	Nuke Security Problems Nothing New  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As concerns deepen that China may have stolen  
prized U.S. nuclear secrets, some Republicans are trying to link 
the espionage case to President Clinton and the controversy over 
his Asian-American fund raising. But so far Republicans keep 
turning up evidence of security flaws dating to the days when they 
controlled the White House. In fact, the bulk of the suspicious 
activity at the labs that is now the focus of intense FBI scrutiny 
started in the early to mid 1980s, long before Clinton emerged on 
the national scene.

	Teen Said to Mix Sheep Eye in Food  
</P>
<P>
	PAINESVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- A 16-year-old student faces expulsion  
for slicing up a sheep's eye during biology class and mixing it in 
rigatoni eaten by two classmates, officials said. The boy, whose 
name was not released, admitted that he sliced up the eye at 
Riverside High School and put it in the food, said Lake County 
Sheriff's Lt. Lonnie Sparkman. The two 17-year-old girls who ate 
the pasta on Monday didn't get sick, authorities said. The boy was 
suspended for 10 days, said school Principal Dennis Holmes. The 
brothers were charged with aggravated menacing and inducing panic, 
said William Crosier, a deputy sheriff.

	Teamsters' Hoffa Reaches Out to GOP

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sworn-in before thousands of cheering workers,  
James P. Hoffa pledged Saturday to press the Teamsters to spread 
more political donations to Republicans and end government 
oversight of the union his father once ran. The Teamsters' PAC gave 
$2 million to Democratic candidates in last year's election races, 
compared to $151,800 to Republicans. Hoffa said he wanted to boost 
PAC contributions, and send more of that money to Republicans if 
they support unions rather than bash them.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Angelos Interested in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Peter Angelos already knew plenty about Cuba  
when he sat down to dinner with two men who wanted the Baltimore 
Orioles to play the Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos, eager to ease the tension between the communist country  
and the United States, immediately embraced the ambitious plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peter expressed sympathy for Fidel Castro. He said, `For  
crying out loud, Kennedy tried to invade the island and tried to 
kill him,''' Saul Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Landau, who has produced four documentaries on Castro, and Scott  
Armstrong, an author and journalist who had visited Cuba over the 
years, made the unusual presentation to the Orioles' owner in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, the Orioles became the first major league  
team to play in Havana since 1959. On March 28, Baltimore beat a 
collection of Cuban all-stars 3-2 in an 11-inning exhibition game. 
The return match is Monday night at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong first pitched the idea of a baseball game between  
Cuban stars and the Orioles to former team owner Edward Bennett 
Williams in the early 1980s. He also discussed the concept with 
then-baseball commissioner Bart Giamatti and union head Donald 
Fehr. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Angelos who followed through.  
</P>
<P>
	``Peter Angelos was the only guy to stand at the plate to take a  
swing at this,'' Armstrong said. ``Edward Bennett Williams laughed 
at me because he had a position on Ronald Reagan's advisory board, 
and that administration would have nothing to do with Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giamatti had a vision -- he was definitely interested -- but he  
died before we could act on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1994 players' strike, Fehr tried to set up a game  
between Cuban players and a collection of major league stars. But 
the plan was tabled after Cuban fighter planes shot down two 
unarmed U.S. civilian planes in February 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos, however, was relentless.  
</P>
<P>
	``The notion that he would go through the expense, the red tape  
and the inconvenience was never a question,'' Armstrong said. ``He 
just thought it was a good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rebuffed in his first bid in 1996, Angelos didn't quit. Staying  
in touch with the State Department and the White House, he got a 
break in January when President Clinton loosened restrictions 
against Cuba. Even then, it took several weeks of negotiations and 
an all-night session in March to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peter was the dominant party in the room,'' Armstrong said.  
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the series suggest that Angelos was looking for  
publicity or angling to give the Orioles an advantage tapping into 
Cuban talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos refused several interview requests by The Associated  
Press. Both his sons, however, insisted that the owner's motivation 
was not self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always had an interest in politics, especially foreign  
policy. That, and his involvement with baseball, made it a natural 
thing,'' said Orioles executive vice president John Angelos. ``It's 
always been a nonpolitical issue with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The connection was baseball, America's national pastime and a  
way of life for the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt that something could be achieved by the people getting  
together and playing a baseball game,'' said Louis Angelos, who 
works in his father's law offices. ``He said, `Why not just go and 
play? Nothing bad can come from it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban dissidents don't see it that way.  
</P>
<P>
	Groups of anti-Castro protesters from Miami and the New York-New  
Jersey metropolitan area plan to travel to Baltimore by bus to 
protest outside the stadium Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Basulto, president of Brothers to the Rescue, a Miami-based  
Cuban democracy group, said the games will only serve to provide 
revenue and positive public relations for the Castro government 
that has caused Cuba's people to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are prolonging that suffering by engaging in this,''  
Basulto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations  
in the commissioner's office, worked side by side with Peter 
Angelos in the negotiations and saw no indication of a hidden 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``His interests were selfless. He was not looking for a  
competitive advantage for the Orioles,'' Alderson said. ``I think 
he was driven by a strong feeling that baseball was the key to the 
cultures of two countries that have been separated a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of Angelos' effort, other major leagues teams might  
one day travel to Havana to play. The Anaheim Angels have already 
filled out the necessary papers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Baltimore Orioles will always be known as the ones who  
started it.

<HEADLINE> Lewis' Horse Wins Another Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Bob Lewis' epitaph will have to be  
rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
	When he and his wife, Beverly, won the Kentucky Derby in 1997  
with Silver Charm, the beer distributor from Southern California 
said he wanted his tombstone to read: ``Loving husband, adoring 
father and winner of the 123rd Kentucky Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Better make that ``two Kentucky Derbys.''  
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic brought the Lewises back to the winner's circle for  
the second time in three years, winning the 125th Kentucky Derby on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lewis held the Derby trophy up with both hands and Beverly  
kept grasping it with her right hand as trainer D. Wayne Lukas and 
jockey Chris Antley joined the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unbelievable! Unbelievable!'' Lewis said. ``To have this for  
the second time in our lives is just tremendous. You look back, and 
Beverly and I have had such unbelievably good fortune in this 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Charismatic wasn't even their best shot for the Derby.  
</P>
<P>
	Seven weeks ago, the Lewis' Exploit was the early favorite.  
Trained by Bob Baffert, Exploit was injured in the San Felipe and 
the Lewis' other hope for the Derby was Charismatic, who was in a 
claiming race on Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	On that day, the son of Summer Squall was up for sale for  
$62,500. There were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic won the claiming race via disqualification.  
</P>
<P>
	Reminded of that February race, Bob Lewis joked, ``You're  
talking about a long time ago!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't that incredible?'' he said. ``You can have a claimer  
today and all of a sudden have a champion tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since February, Charismatic could do no better than second in  
his next three races. 
</P>
<P>
	After Charismatic's fourth-place finish in the Santa Anita  
Derby, Lewis was on the fence about whether to send the colt to the 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were really on the bubble,'' he said. ``We had about  
80-some-thousand in graded stakes (winnings) in until we got into 
the Lexington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A win in the April 18 Lexington Stakes at Keeneland earned  
Charismatic his Derby trip, where he wore down the Lukas-trained 
Cat Thief in the stretch and held off fast-closing Menifee as 
Antley stuck his left index finger into the air yards before the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	The former claimer paid $64.60, the third-largest in Derby  
history behind only the $184.90 by Donerail in 1913 and the $72.40 
for Gallahadion in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a bad day for Lewis, even if it began with a trip to the  
dentist. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he spent the morning in the chair at an emergency dental  
clinic in Lexington, having his bridge repaired after losing a 
tooth at a private party Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to ride home with a great big hole in the front of my  
mouth,'' Lewis said. ``That tooth is very dear to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas called the Lewises ``the first lady of racing and the  
first gentleman of thoroughbred racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Lewis: ``Do you think there's a tombstone large enough to  
say `Winner of the 123rd and 125th Kentucky Derby?'''

<HEADLINE> Columbine Survivors Suffer Guilt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The first night after he fled Columbine  
High School with his life and not an outward scratch, 16-year-old 
Grant Taylor dreamed he was a hero, wounded yet able to pull other 
students to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The second night, he dreamed he was wounded and dying.  
</P>
<P>
	Although happy that he escaped, never even setting eyes on a  
gun, the tall, rangy sophomore said pensively a week later that he 
felt angry, and guilty. ``I kind of wish I was there in the 
library, helping kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They call it survivor guilt.  
</P>
<P>
	Kids who ran away from the gunmen or hid under tables or in  
closets. Kids who saw classmates die or shot and bleeding. Teachers 
unable to help the kids in their care. Frantic parents forced to 
stand behind police lines for agonizing hours while children 
remained trapped in the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Long after the victims are buried and the scars faded, remorse  
can torment those who live through catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
	Guilt has followed grief since April 20, when Eric Harris and  
Dylan Klebold killed 12 fellow students, a teacher and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like it's not fair,'' said Megan Frye, 14, a Columbine  
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, Debra Frye, stood close by her side as the pair  
walked arm-in-arm visiting the makeshift shrine of flowers and 
messages spread over Clement Park, next to the tightly guarded 
school-turned-crime scene. With her daughter shaken and momentarily 
without a school to attend, Debra Frye took off the week from her 
job as a landscape architect. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan hid her tears behind sunglasses, but said she also felt  
fortunate. ``I just feel so lucky to still be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The more the survivors witnessed, the greater the sense that  
they might have done more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guilt usually comes later, when they feel that they might  
have been able to do more to help themselves or to help their 
friends,'' said Jeff Dolgan, chief of psychology at Children's 
Hospital of Denver. ``But what they don't understand is these kinds 
of situations take their autonomy away. They're immobilized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They'll need support and caring listeners, he said. They may  
experience flashbacks, terrifying dreams and odd reactions to 
unrelated events, such as loud noises or setting foot in a new 
school. They may become clingy and dependent. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents, too, may suffer guilt, Dolgan said. ``A parent might  
have been restrained from doing something. Within 10 minutes the 
parents might have got there (to the school during the siege) and 
the police said `You can't save your own babies.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Martinez was grateful that his 16-year-old, Laura, escaped  
unharmed from Columbine where she was a junior, but his gratitude 
is tinged with regret. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel for the other parents like anybody would,'' Martinez  
said. ``You almost feel guilty, about, you know, having your kid 
get out. Because we have a lot of friends in the community. She 
played soccer with a lot of these girls. As a matter of fact, we 
attended three funerals this week, and it's been hard for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worried parents have sought counseling help for youngsters who  
escaped, said Tom Olbrich, a social worker in charge of emergency 
services at The Jefferson Center for Mental Health in Arvada, a 
private, nonprofit agency acting as a clearinghouse for those 
seeking counseling as a result of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman reported that her daughter was feeling a lot of guilt,  
``wondering why she should live when other people died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another girl, who was splattered with blood, replays the scene  
in her mind like a continuous mental video. She felt the hot, 
sticky blood ``and kept feeling like she can't get it off her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a normal kind of response,'' Olbrich said, ``to an  
abnormal kind of situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His own 15-year-old son, Ryan, reports nightmares of snipers at  
the school -- even though he never went to Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	Olbrich said those who feel guilty for making it out alive need  
to be reassured that they can celebrate their survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be under a table means you did a lot to save your own  
life,'' he said. ``Or when they got outside, did they say kind 
words? Did they hug somebody? We have to help them understand. They 
were brave to go to the vigil, brave to go to the funeral.''

<HEADLINE> More Threats Close Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Thousands of students stayed home and some schools closed  
because of rumors and threats of violence, some of them tied to the 
54th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Threats, warnings and rumors of bloodshed have swept communities  
across the country ever since April 20, when 13 people were slain 
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. The two student gunmen 
then killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, classes were canceled for thousands of students from  
Pennsylvania to California after classmates left menacing letters, 
messages on the wall and things that looked like explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors have been circulating among students and on the Internet  
that something bad would happen on the date Hitler shot himself to 
death in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	Students at West Valley High School and five other high schools  
in Shasta County, Calif., found their campuses peppered with white 
supremacist fliers and swastikas Friday. In Los Angeles, educators 
feared bogus threats could obscure real danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking schools to do some rumor control,'' said Shel  
Erlich, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
the nation's second largest, where several students were arrested 
in the past week for making threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Six schools in and around Charlotte, N.C., were evacuated Friday  
after bomb threats. At one high school, police found a device 
described by witnesses as a small propane tank rigged with wires. 
The killers in the Littleton slayings had devised a propane-tank 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes and SAT tests that had been scheduled at four schools in  
Charlotte today were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half the 900 students at Scituate High School and Middle  
School in Scituate, R.I., stayed home after some someone scrawled 
on a wall in the girls' bathroom Monday and Tuesday: ``You die on 
April 30th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials sent letters home to parents assuring them  
their children were not in danger, and a police officer was at the 
school Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Roberts of Scituate said her 12-year-old daughter didn't  
want to go to school Friday because of the threat. ``She was 
reluctant to go, but we told her to trust the police and 
principal,'' Ms. Roberts said as she picked up the girl at school. 
``I was not going to be scared off by a teen-ager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At La Mirada High School, 18 miles southeast of downtown Los  
Angeles, about 1,600 students were absent Friday despite 
reassurances from school officials that Hitler-based threats were 
bogus. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just can't take rumor as a joke anymore,'' said  
principal's assistant Marianne Smith, whose granddaughter attends 
the school. ``In the 14 years I've worked here, I've never seen it 
quieter than it has been today. Mass hysteria created a day of 
education that these students didn't get.''

                      *James J. ``Jack'' Jessee    	
</P>
<P>
	ORMOND BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- James J. ``Jack'' Jessee, chief  
photographer of the Daytona Beach News-Journal for more than 45 
years, died Thursday of cancer. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the News-Journal in 1946 as the newspaper's first  
full-time photographer. He oversaw development of the photography 
and graphic arts departments through his retirement at the end of 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his direction, the News-Journal became one of the first  
newspapers in the Southeast to publish full-color photographs, 
beginning in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessee covered auto races, visiting dignitaries and early rocket  
launches from Cape Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, he and his staff used a carrier pigeon to rush film of  
the Apollo 11 launch to the paper for publication in its evening 
edition. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessee worked for the Johnson City Press-Chronicle while  
attending East Tennessee State University. 
</P>
<P>
	His photography career was interrupted by World War II. He  
joined the Air Force in 1942 and flew 35 missions as a B-17 bomber 
pilot, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross with five Oak Leaf 
Clusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife Ruth, a son and three grandchildren.

</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Amos H. Lynch Jr., who with his father  
published the Columbus Post, a weekly newspaper serving the black 
community, died Wednesday evening in his sleep at age 42. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch Jr. and his father, Amos H. Lynch Sr., had worked together  
closely since the Post was founded in December 1996, but they 
shared newspaper experience that spanned 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch Jr. started out as a newsboy for the Ohio Sentinel, then  
followed his father to the Call and Post, where the elder Lynch 
served as general manager. Also, the two later worked together at 
the Post, a separate newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, he is survived by his parents, three  
stepchildren, a sister and a brother.

</P>
<P>
	SUFFOLK, England (AP) -- Sir Alf Ramsey, who coached England's  
soccer team to its only World Cup title, died this week after a 
long illness. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey, known for his innovative tactics, was considered  
England's most successful international manager. He coached the 
national team to a 4-2 overtime win over West Germany in the 1966 
World Cup final at Wembley. 
</P>
<P>
	He was knighted in 1967 and remained England's manager until  
1974, when he was fired after his team failed to qualify for the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	As a player, Ramsey was regarded as a tenacious defender,  
playing 32 times for England's national team, including three games 
as captain. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-USVI Postmaster Innocent of Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The former postmaster for the U.S. Virgin  
Islands has been cleared of charges that he twice attacked a 
Washington lobbyist while both were in town for a diversity 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Austin Jackson, 48, had been charged with three counts of  
sexual battery and could have faced a maximum 33 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury deliberated less than two hours Friday before acquitting  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old woman, described as a legislative assistant who  
was working for the postal service, said Jackson fondled her one 
night in his room. She told authorities that he apologized days 
later, saying he was drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Jackson, a married man, went to the woman's  
suite the day the group was checking out of the hotel, overpowered 
her and assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's attorney, Edward Shohat of Miami, said Jackson fell in  
love with the woman over time and she willingly had sex with him. 
Afterward, the woman worried about how the relationship would 
affect her job and feared that her fiance would find out. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was placed on administrative leave in October after  
seven months as postmaster in Charlotte Amalie. He was fired May 5 
when prosecutors and an independent Postal Service investigation 
found enough evidence to file criminal charges.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Security Problems Nothing New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As concerns deepen that China may have stolen  
prized U.S. nuclear secrets, some Republicans are trying to link 
the espionage case to President Clinton and the controversy over 
his Asian-American fund raising. But so far Republicans keep 
turning up evidence of security flaws dating to the days when they 
controlled the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the bulk of the suspicious activity at the labs that is  
now the focus of intense FBI scrutiny started in the early to mid 
1980s, long before Clinton emerged on the national scene. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say some serious security breaches haven't  
occurred during the Clinton presidency. Just in the last week, 
evidence has emerged publicly that highly classified nuclear 
weapons computer files were transferred to an unsecured computer as 
late as 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported in Sunday's editions that a secret  
report to top Clinton administration officials last November warned 
that computer systems at the labs were being constantly penetrated 
by outsiders, but that investigators waited until March to search 
the computer of a scientist who had been under investigation for 
nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper quoted officials as saying the scientist in February  
tried to delete evidence that he had improperly transferred more 
than 1,000 files containing nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said the report, given to it by a government official,  
contained specific examples of outsiders having gained access to 
computer systems at U.S. weapons labs as recently as June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But if FBI suspicions prove correct, the nuclear scientist at  
the center of the controversy began to spy early during the Reagan 
administration. And the most serious breach detected so far, the 
loss of design information on the W-88 nuclear warhead, dates to 
the mid-1980s. Also, concerns about lax security at Energy 
Department labs, most notably at the one in Los Alamos, N.M., have 
been around for at least two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions that the  
scientist cooperated with the FBI in 1982 when the agency was 
investigating a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't regard it as a political problem for Clinton, I regard  
it as a national security problem for the nation because the errors 
were made on the watches of both Republicans and Democrats,'' said 
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., named by Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss., to follow the China espionage issue on behalf of the 
Senate GOP leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the criticism directed at Clinton focuses on the  
administration's response once internal concerns about possible 
espionage surfaced in 1995: 
</P>
<P>
	--An Energy Department counterintelligence official alleges  
higher-ups barred him from alerting Congress to the loss of W-88 
technology to China. 
</P>
<P>
	--FBI Director Louis Freeh told the Senate Intelligence Committee  
that the Justice Department in 1996 rejected an FBI bid to obtain a 
search warrant for the computer of Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory scientist suspected of funneling classified 
weapons information to China. Lee denies the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some Republicans have called on White House National Security  
Adviser Sandy Berger to resign, claiming he was slow to grasp the 
seriousness of the espionage problem. Berger politely declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators are working on legislation that would  
transfer counterintelligence tasks at Los Alamos and two other labs 
from the Energy Department to the FBI, although the Energy 
Department's counterintelligence responsibilities already are run 
by an official from the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said he thought ``some are  
trying to politicize national security issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The China espionage issue is politically charged because  
Republicans, for much of Clinton's second term, have been trying to 
show that the White House has been more concerned about raising 
campaign money than protecting national security. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Republicans charged that China secretly funneled money  
to Democratic candidates and sought to leverage the contributions 
into political clout inside the White House. Last year, they 
alleged Clinton softened his policy on the export of satellite 
technology to China in exchange for Beijing's secret political 
largesse. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House steadfastly denies any connection.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a member of the Senate Intelligence  
Committee, renewed his call last week for appointment of an 
independent counsel to investigate China's involvement in illegal 
political contributions. ``Here you have important, startling 
revelations about why we should have an independent counsel,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a floor speech last week, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who led a  
House investigation into the fund-raising controversy, focused on 
the espionage issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get to the bottom of it,'' Burton said. ``And those  
who let this happen, for whatever reason, campaign contributions or 
because they like Chinese or whatever reason, they need to be held 
accountable and brought to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Gates, who headed the CIA under President Bush, said  
any suggestion that Clinton tolerated Chinese espionage because of 
political donations is absurd. ``That's all just a measure of how 
poisonous the atmosphere has gotten in Washington,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said there are plenty of tough questions Clinton must  
answer, such as why security at the labs remained so lax well into 
his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,  
said the most anyone can point to so far are ``inferences'' as to 
the administration's motives on China and security matters. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it's clear that China began intensive spying in the  
United States as long ago as the late 1970s and into the 1980s when 
cultural and scientific exchanges with the United States showed the 
rulers in Beijing how far behind their country had fallen in 
weapons technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their nuclear weapons program was generation-one,'' Shelby  
said. The administration, he said, must rethink its China policy 
and realize that Beijing is not a ``strategic partner'' but a 
``strategic competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of whether the charges aimed at the Clinton  
administration pan out, it appears certain the GOP will pursue 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got dots all over the map and connecting them is the  
tough stuff,'' Specter said. ``But I believe that's what has to be 
done.''

<HEADLINE> Galaxy 1, MetroStars 0, SO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Making his MLS debut, Los Angeles  
coach Sigi Schmid beat his former mentor Saturday night when the 
Galaxy overcame a man disadvantage for the final 16 minutes and 
outlasted the New York-New Jersey MetroStars in a shootout after a 
0-0 draw. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmid, an assistant to MetroStars coach Bora Miluntinovic when  
the latter led the United States in the 1994 World Cup, was at the 
helm of the Galaxy for his first game since being named to his post 
with Los Angeles on April 22. 
</P>
<P>
	He was at the Galaxy's game against San Jose two days later, a  
1-0 victory, but was not behind the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Caligiuri, Mauricio Cienfuegos and Greg Vanney scored to  
give Los Angeles the 3-2 margin of victory in the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars failed to take advantage of the man advantage  
after Galaxy forward Clint Mathis was red-carded for a tackle on 
New York-New Jersey defender Mark Semioli in the 74th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Semioli was shielding ball to let it roll over the touchline  
when Mathis attempted a slide tackle that got nowhere near the ball 
but brought Semioli down hard. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was the second straight for the MetroStars, whose  
scoreless streak was extended to 242 minutes.
