AUTO WORKERS IN CANADA AVERT STRIKE
</HEADLINE>

   DETROIT _ With less than two hours to spare before a threatened
strike, the DaimlerChrysler Corp. reached an agreement with the
Canadian Auto Workers union on a new three-year contract covering
the company's 13,800 workers in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, DaimlerChrysler's factory workers will get
annual raises of 3 percent on top of their cost-of-living
adjustments; a $1,200 (Canadian), or $818 (U.S.), annual holiday
bonus; a $1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus; an $800 (Canadian)
tuition reimbursement for workers' children, and a $2,000
(Canadian) child care benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian union president Basil E. Hargrove announced the
deal at 10:25 p.m. and called it ``an excellent package.'' The
union had threatened to strike at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian union will begin labor talks later this month with
the General Motors Corp. The union had already reached a deal with
the Ford Motor Co. on a new labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United Automobile Workers union on Tuesday gave
Ford Motor a Friday deadline to reach an agreement with the union
on a new labor contract or watch its 101,033 factory workers in the
United States walk out on strike.
</P>
<P>
   The union strike threat gives Ford until 3:30 Friday afternoon
to find common ground with the union. The company expressed hope
that a strike could be avoided. ``We're optimistic,'' said Edward
K. Miller, Ford's manager of corporate news. ``This is a normal
part of the collective bargaining process and there is no reason to
believe we can't reach an agreement by Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   The UAW.union did not return calls seeking comment. Talks
between the union and Ford recessed this afternoon, and are
expected to resume Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Labor contracts between the nation's 400,000 unionized auto
workers and Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler were set to expire Sept.
14, but were extended indefinitely as the union continued
negotiations on new contracts with the companies. DaimlerChrysler
and GM have already reached agreements with the union without
strikes _ or even the threat of strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But the union on Tuesday gave Ford the required 72-hour notice
that it would end the current contract Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler workers already ratified their four-year
contract, and GM workers are scheduled to vote next week on a
similar contract. It is expected to win near-unanimous approval.
Both contracts call for a $1,350 signing bonus and annual raises of
3 percent above inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Ford workers are expected to get the same generous raises, but
workers have been upset by Ford's plans to spin off its Visteon
auto parts subsidiary. The 23,500 union members working at Visteon
have been nervous that their jobs would not be as secure as those
at Ford.  &QL;

ART FARMER, 71, BE-BOP MASTER OF TRUMPET AND FLUEGELHORN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Ariz.)  (mk) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Art Farmer, one of the more important
second-generation be-bop musicians, an improviser who could say a
great deal in a few notes on the trumpet and fluegelhorn and later
on his own hybrid instrument, the ``flumpet,'' died on Monday in
Manhattan. He was 71 and lived in Manhattan and Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac arrest, said his manager and companion,
Lynne Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer was considered a master of ballad playing. His tone was
soft and even and sure, with no vibrato and with canny silences
built into his improvisations.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and when he was 4 his
family moved to Phoenix. He studied piano and violin in grade
school there. As a teen-ager he joined a dance band playing
big-band arrangements, and he often invited members of whatever
swing band happened to pass through town to come to his house and
jam with him and his twin brother, Addison, the bassist, who died
in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, when they were 16, the Farmer brothers moved to Los
Angeles, having promised their mother that they would finish
school. It was a time when great musicians were coming out of the
city's integrated high schools; at Jefferson High Farmer studied
with the well-known music teacher Samuel Browne, who also taught
Frank Morgan, Hampton Hawes and Don Cherry, among many others.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer worked in Los Angeles with Horace Henderson, Johnny Otis
and others, leaving school to join Otis' group on tour. He recorded
a be-bop classic, ``Farmer's Market,'' with Wardell Gray's band.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 Farmer went on tour with Lionel Hampton, and in 1953 he
settled in New York, joining bands led by Gigi Gryce and Horace
Silver. In 1958 he was hired by the saxophonist Gerry Mulligan for
one of his bracing new pianoless groups.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the '50s Farmer formed the Jazztet, a sextet, with
the saxophonist Benny Golson. Together they wrote a deep repertory
of harmonically sophisticated, tightly arranged music, and the
group defined the state of the art for mainstream jazz until the
music's prevailing winds began to grow wilder. The group broke up
in 1962, and Farmer started another group, with the guitarist Jim
Hall. The Jazztet reunited in 1982 and played through most of the
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s Farmer often used the fluegelhorn, which has a
warmer, creamier sound, suiting his lyricism and terseness. Then in
the early '90s he designed a mixture of the two instruments, the
flumpet, which combined projection with warmth.
</P>
<P>
   When work grew sparse in New York, he moved to Vienna in 1968 to
join a radio jazz orchestra. He ended up staying and starting a
family but traveled constantly, playing with local pickup rhythm
sections around the world. For the last few years, he had a
residence in Manhattan and was dividing his time equally between
Vienna and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's discography as a leader is large and as a sideman
larger, encompassing work on the Blue Note, Contemporary, Soul
Note, Enja and Arabesque labels, among others. His most recent
album, from 1997, was ``Silk Road'' (Arabesque).
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ms. Mueller, Farmer is survived by his sister, Mauvolene
Thomas, of Tucson, Ariz., and his son, Georg, of Vienna.

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixes fourth item to say Gary Garrett was released after Tuesday
practice) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ An unsuspecting passerby could have
dropped into Robertson Gym and found nothing resembling an NBA
practice Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That was unmistakably the Los Angeles Lakers running through the
UC Santa Barbara gym for two-plus hours in the morning and again in
the evening. But little else on the first day of training camp was
recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes basketball looked more like a game of charades.
Sometimes like follow-the-leader. Sometimes like a dance with no
music.
</P>
<P>
   It's not supposed to look like kindergarten, but coach Phil
Jackson's method does begin with a remedial course in fundamentals,
and that meant a lot of drills where the basketball never left the
equipment bag.
</P>
<P>
   And where the drills themselves felt like odd rituals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man,'' Kobe Bryant said with a laugh, ``you got to see some of
this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   (Reporters, banned from Jackson's practices, will see nothing,
however, so we'll let Bryant describe the scene.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Pivot work, without even having a basketball. Just run, set a
pick, then spin, pivot, go, then stop, change direction, without a
basketball. You practice layups without a basketball,'' Bryant
explained. ``It's weird.''
</P>
<P>
   But also fun, fresh and effective based on the players'
reactions so far. Aside from ex-Chicago Bull John Salley, none of
them have seen anything like this since junior high school, if
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke it down to the basic forms of basketball footwork,''
Rick Fox said, ``being able to work with your teammate in as simple
a form as even running together. It's been a good first morning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final drill of the session, the 20 players jogged in a
straight line in something Jackson called ``the Indian style,''
according to pupil Bryant. The smallest Laker, Tyronn Lue, was in
front, with the largest, Shaquille O'Neal, in back. Every time the
whistle blew, the big man at the end of the line would have to
sprint to catch the speedier guard at the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny seeing the big guys trying to catch up to those
little guys,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   So they ran together, and shared some laughs in the process. A
unifying exercise? ``Absolutely. Absolutely,'' said Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all drills involved all 20 players, rather than the
usual approach of breaking up into groups of small guards and big
men.
</P>
<P>
   There were drills to teach advancing the ball upcourt, both
dribbling and passing. There were footwork drills. By today, the
Lakers will be honing passing skills by throwing the ball against a
pair of ``Toss Back'' devices. It seems like basic equipment, but
the Lakers never owned them until they arrived here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here knows (the fundamentals), but it's a matter of
fine-tuning it to the point where you're doing it and not even
thinking about it,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, all of this will serve as building blocks in
learning the complex triangle offense, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's about seven different ways in which you get to the
triangle that have to be practiced over and over and over,'' he
said. ``Every teammate has to have a way to get to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not an easy thing to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is more than anything else,'' Jackson said, ``is
guys feel crowded on the court, and they don't feel like they can
put the ball down and do their one-on-one moves, so their
speciality is stuffed or whatever else. They have to learn when and
how.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be several days before the Lakers actually run the
triangle in its totality. In the meantime, there will be a few
bewildered looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are on my face,'' Jackson quipped, ``not
theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer school: Some Lakers will pick up Jackson's system sooner
than others. A.C. Green, who learned the triangle in Dallas, and
Salley have a head start.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of others practiced informally with Jackson's staff
for several days in September. Attending the voluntary sessions
were Fox, Bryant, Derek Fisher, Tyronn Lue and Travis Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Harper retires: The Lakers' trade of veteran Derek Harper to
Detroit might soon cost them a draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Harper has not reported to the Pistons and plans to retire. Once
he files the paperwork to make it official, the Lakers _ per terms
of the trade _ will have to make up for the loss. One possibility
is sending Detroit a future second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Ballooning roster: For the first time in recent history, the
Lakers brought the full complement of players, 20, into camp. The
last three to sign Monday were first-round pick Devean George and
free-agent journeymen Gerald Jordan and Gary Garrett. Garrett was
released after evening practice on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   George received a three-year deal worth at least $2.12 million,
with incentives that could push the total to $2.55 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan joins a long list of players with non-guaranteed deals
who are here simply to provide extra practice bodies. NBA teams can
carry only 12 players, plus up to three on the injured list, into
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for us (to have extra players) to
provide for injuries early in training camp,'' Jackson said. ``The
other reason is we have a couple (roster) spots that are available
that we think should be open to motivate players.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar faces: Among the observers at Tuesday's practice were
ex-head coach Kurt Rambis and longtime assistant Bill Bertka, both
retained as consultants with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Bertka's duties, however, will also include some coaching. He'll
assist Jackson's staff at practices and have a seat behind the
Lakers bench at home games.

YANKEES CRUSH RANGERS, 8-0, IN FIRST GAME OF PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez passed his manager in the Yankee
clubhouse on Tuesday afternoon and grinned, and Joe Torre suspected
Hernandez's expression was meant entirely to reassure him. As in,
``Don't worry, I've got everything under control.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees might have had a discombobulated regular season, but
the playoffs started on Tuesday night and it was business as usual
for Hernandez, Bernie Williams and company, who blistered the Texas
Rangers, 8-0, in Game 1 of the three-of-five-game division series
at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The teams will play the second game here on Thursday night, when
Texas will try to end its streak of seven consecutive post-season
losses to the Yankees, dating to 1996, and 22 consecutive innings
without a run, dating to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez shut out the Rangers on two hits over eight innings _
he is 3-0 with an 0.41 earned run average in the post-season,
including last year _ and Williams made a run-saving sliding catch
before hitting a two-run double, a three-run home run and a
run-scoring single, for six runs batted in, before 57,099 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' lineup is stacked with aggressive, powerful hitters
who have a consistent approach at the plate. Attack. Always attack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Yankees limited the Rangers to one run in the
three-game division series and swept Texas by using the Rangers'
own aggressiveness against them, David Wells and Andy Pettitte
throwing changeups when Texas was looking for fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Hernandez stifled the Rangers exactly the same
way. Hernandez usually relies on his slider, the sweeping breaking
ball that moves away from right-handed hitters, but he altered his
approach on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez doubled in the first inning and after Hernandez
walked Rusty Greer, the hulking Juan Gonzalez strolled to the
plate, always capable of launching a ball into Monument Park.
</P>
<P>
   But with a two-ball, two-strike count on Gonzalez, Hernandez
buried the baseball deep into his palm, flipped it homeward, and
Gonzalez pitched forward on his front leg and swung awkwardly,
missing.
</P>
<P>
   This went on all night _ a Texas hitter leaning awkwardly, the
timing of his swing shattered, the result being a pop-up or easy
fly ball. Hernandez was throwing his fastball about 90 miles and
hour and his changeup 71 to 73 mph and the Rangers were caught in
between. Of the Rangers' first 21 outs, in the first seven innings,
15 came on balls hit in the air, four were on strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hernandez tiptoed through some early danger. After
Gonzalez struck out in the first inning, Hernandez walked Rafael
Palmeiro on five pitches _ it appeared he didn't want to tangle
with the Rangers' slugger and pitched around him _ but he whiffed
Todd Zeile on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez singled with one out in the third inning, stole
second, and Hernandez walked Greer. Gonzalez extended his arms and
somehow lined a changeup to right-center, the ball headed for the
gap between Williams and the right fielder Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was in a full pursuit of the ball within two strides,
eyes locked on the flight of the ball, his mouth widening and then
closing as he took quick and deep breaths. O'Neill had no chance,
Williams had to catch the ball. He dropped to his left thigh,
reached out and speared the ball with his glove about three feet
off the ground, sliding across the grass and leaping to his feet to
throw the ball back to the infield.
</P>
<P>
   The play saved two runs for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro popped Hernandez's next pitch _ a changeup _ to deep
center field, and Hernandez began walking toward the dugout, head
down, quite sure of himself, never bothering to check and see
whether Yankee Stadium would contain Palmeiro's drive. The ball
settled into Williams' glove just before Hernandez stepped over the
first-base line, El Duque respecting this superstition, as always.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers never really bothered Hernandez after that. He would
get ahead in the count, and then Jorge Posada would give the sign
for the changeup _waggling the four fingers of his right hand _ and
tap his glove against the ground, indicating for Hernandez to keep
the changeup low. Hernandez followed his directives precisely, and
Texas' post-season streak of scoreless innings kept growing.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele, the Texas pitcher, had a good curveball, but the
Yankees waited patiently for mistakes, and ultimately, they were
rewarded. Darryl Strawberry was on first base when Sele threw a
fastball over the heart of the plate in the second inning and Ricky
Ledee drove it to left field, the ball slicing as if Ledee had hit
it with an oversized driver.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, Texas' capable left fielder, closed on the ball and
seemed in position to make the catch, but suddenly ducked his head;
he had lost the ball in the glare created by the hundreds of
floodlights that rim the top of Yankee Stadium. Strawberry rounded
third and scored, Ledee had a double and the Yankees had a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, who struck out in his first two at-bats, rolled a
two-out single to left in the fifth inning, and with Jeter at first
and Lee Stevens covering first base, O'Neill skipped a single
through the first-base hole, Jeter running to third.
</P>
<P>
   Sele becomes more vulnerable with each pass through the lineup.
Opponents batted .252 against him on his first 45 pitches this
year, .319 thereafter, and as Williams batted in the sixth, Sele
was approaching 100 pitches. Williams fell behind, no balls and two
strikes. Sele spun a curveball with one ball and two strikes, the
ball bending past the outside corner of the plate, Williams frozen
as Sele lurched toward the Texas dugout, thinking he had an
inning-ending strikeout. Ball 2, according to the home plate umpire
Jim Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Sele tried to throw another curveball on the outside edge, but
it was ball three. Williams fought off another curveball, with a
foul tip. Having thrown Williams six straight curves, Sele changed
his pattern, whipped a fastball; Williams crushed it to center,
both runners scoring. The fans roared for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees finished off the Rangers in the sixth. Ledee walked,
and after there were two outs, Jeter walked. O'Neill slapped a
tricky grounder to third, where Todd Zeile bent over and had the
ball ricochet off his body and away, an error that allowed Ledee to
score. Yankees 4, Texas 0. Mike Venafro, a left-hander, then
challenged Williams, batting right-handed, with a fastball,
Williams going with the pitch and smashing the ball to right
field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez rambled back toward the wall, looking up, in perfect
position to see Williams' home run disappear among jubilant fans to
make it 7-0. &QL;

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of the Federal Communications Commission
on Tuesday sharply questioned how MCI Worldcom's $115 billion
agreement to buy Sprint Corp. could benefit consumers and warned
that the companies would have to meet a high standard to persuade
him to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   William Kennard, the commission chairman, has typically been
circumspect in his public pronouncements about large mergers
destined to come before him. But talking to reporters after
delivering a speech here Tuesday morning, he was
uncharacteristically blunt, raising the prospect that the two
companies are in for a tough time with at least one of the two
federal agencies that must approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``American consumers are enjoying the lowest long-distance rates
in history and the lowest Internet rates in the world for one
reason: competition,'' Kennard told reporters Tuesday morning after
a speech before the Federal Communications Bar Association.
``Competition has produced a price war in the long-distance market.
The merger appears to be a surrender. How can this be good for
consumers? The parties will bear a heavy burden to show how
consumers would be better off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard made his comments moments before the chief executives of
the two companies officially announced the deal at a news
conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
   While any decision by the FCC about the deal would require the
approval of three of the five commissioners, Kennard has managed to
get at least two other votes on every important issue during his
term.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was initially calculated to be worth $108 billion but
jumps to $115 billion once $7 billion in stock options is added.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is approved by a majority of the five-person
commission headed by Kennard and by the Justice Department's
antitrust division, it would concentrate about three-quarters of
the nation's long-distance market in the hands of two companies
instead of three. While it would continue to leave AT&AMP;T the largest
player in long distance, federal regulators, particularly at the
Justice Department's antitrust division, have historically been
skeptical of deals that reduce the competition from three dominant
players to two.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials at the FCC said that Kennard's comments were a
prelude to negotiations with the companies that would lead either
to major divestitures _ pieces of both the long-distance and
Internet-network businesses _ or to significant conditions imposed
on the company, conditions intended to keep the long-distance
market competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified,
said that some analysts and Wall Street generally had been too glib
in assuming an easy ride through the regulatory review of the
proposed acquisition. They said that Kennard's main concerns were
about how the concentration of the two companies' Internet and
long-distance businesses would hit consumers. The chairman and his
aides have spent months proclaiming that one of the hallmarks of
his tenure has been the sharp decline in long-distance telephone
rates, although some consumer advocates have said that high
surcharges and special fees have actually raised prices for
lower-income consumers who make a small number of long-distance
calls.
</P>
<P>
   In part, those who have discounted the regulatory obstacles to
the MCI-Sprint deal have based their views on Kennard's track
record. He has not tried to block a single large deal reviewed by
his agency. But he also said as long ago as last year that the
remarkable consolidation among long-distance providers had prompted
him to take a tougher stance toward any new deals that might
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in New York, the top executives of the two
companies said Tuesday that they were confident that Washington
regulators would ultimately approve the deal, the largest corporate
merger in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understood from day one it's our burden of proof to show
that this is pro-competitive,'' said Bernard Ebbers, MCI Worldcom's
chief executive. ``We obviously would not have entered into this
transaction if we didn't feel very confident that we could show
that this was pro-competitive, and we look forward to the
opportunity to doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The filing by MCI Worldcom and Sprint for regulatory approval
comes at a momentous time. This week, the FCC is expected to
approve another huge merger, SBC's $72 billion acquisition of
Ameritech, a deal that will reduce the number of so-called Baby
Bells from five to four.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is also expected on Friday to hand down its
cable-concentration ownership rules, which will determine whether
AT&AMP;T can complete its $58 billion acquisition of MediaOne without
shedding any significant assets. And last week, Bell Atlantic asked
the commission for permission to become the first regional bell
telephone company to enter the $80 billion long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what concessions Kennard wants to exact from MCI
Worldcom and Sprint is not known. There is widespread expectation
that Sprint will ultimately sell its Internet-services network,
just as MCI did after it was acquired by Worldcom last year. And
some officials said Tuesday that the agency could also order that
some chunks of the two companies long-distance businesses be sold
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Kennard's track record with other mergers, some
officials said, he may also try to have MCI Worldcom and Sprint
move more aggressively to enter local markets to force competition
in areas that have largely been resistant to competitors. In recent
months, MCI Worldcom has been heavily marketing local telephone
service in New York. And in approving SBC's purchase of Ameritech,
the commission set a series of possible financial penalties if the
companies fail to offer new competition in 30 cities outside their
existing regions over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the proposed deal is all but certain to have
other major ancillary consequences for the telecommunications
industry. It has already provided new ammunition to some of the
regional Bell companies who want to enter the long-distance market,
a market made less competitive by the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has denied all previous applications by the regional
Bells to enter the long-distance market because, the agency has
said, the regional Bells have not opened their territories
sufficiently to local competition. Bell Atlantic's application to
enter the long-distance market is widely expected to be approved by
the FCC by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, representatives of some of the regional Bell companies
said that if the FCC were to approve the MCI-Sprint deal, there
would be enormous pressure on the agency to open the long-distance
market to new rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-brainer,'' said Roy Neel, president of the U.S.
Telephone Association, which represents the regional Bell
companies. ``In light of this deal, it's now time to release the
regional operating companies to go head to head with these
monsters.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a matter of practice, the FCC reviews mergers involving
telecommunications companies to assure that they are in ``the
public interest.'' Using this vague standard, they can force the
restructuring of the deal. While in recent years the agency has
never blocked a deal, Kennard's predecessor, Reed Hundt, once
killed negotiations of a large telecommunications deal by simply
saying he thought it inconceivable that the agency would approve
it.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard has taken a more low-key approach, although more than a
year ago he signaled that he would be tougher on new mergers in the
long-distance businesses. His comments, interestingly enough, came
in connection with the FCC's approval of Worldcom's acquisition of
MCI last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this merger is consummated, the industry will again be
poised just a merger away from undue concentration,'' he said on
Sept. 14, 1998. ``I daresay that any subsequent merger _ of this or
similar magnitude _ between long- distance firms in the near future
should be judged quite differently than the merger before us
today.''

HICKS BEGINS QUEST FOR MORE HARDWARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are two trophies in Tom Hicks' favorite dream.
One is a Stanley Cup. The other piece of glittering hardware is a
World Series trophy.
</P>
<P>
   With the Stanley Cup already belonging to his Stars, Hicks'
Texas Rangers began their quest to make the second half of his
dream come true Wednesday night, facing the New York Yankees in the
opening game of their best-of-five American League divisional
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given up on the dream of doing both in the same
year,'' Hicks said as he stood behind the batting cage while the
Rangers took batting practice before the game Wednesday night. ``It
doesn't get much better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' youngest son, William, making his first trip to Yankee
Stadium, stood beside his father, wide-eyed as the elder Hicks
talked about the ballpark before it was renovated in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to watch the Cowboys play a football game when I
was in my 20s,'' Hick said, ``but I'd never seen a baseball game
here until the playoffs last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks has had a golden touch since venturing into sports
ownership three years ago when he purchased the Stars. They've won
two President's Cups for posting the best regular-season record in
the NHL and added the Stanley Cup in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have won two consecutive division titles under his
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The playoff series opened under overcast skies and with cool
temperatures expected to dip into the mid-40s, which wasn't helping
a long list of Rangers players suffering from flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've probably had 15 players affected in various ways,'' team
physician Dr. John Conway said, ``but they can all play.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee fans were chirping at second baseman Mark McLemore for a
quote in yesterday's ``New York Post'' in which McLemore said,
``We're going to win. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The quote came from a ``Star-Telegram'' column from Anaheim over
the weekend, and McLemore was not happy that it was made to appear
that he said it during Monday's workout session at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never come here and say something like that,'' McLemore
said. ``I don't like to stir these people up any more than they
already are.'' nn

COWBOYS' ANTI-BLITZ MEASURES WILL GET ULTIMATE TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys running backs collectively have
missed picking up only one blitz in two seasons, a handy strength
to have, especially this week against blitz-happy Philadelphia at
Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do it all,'' Cowboys running backs coach Clarence Shelmon
said of the Eagles' defense. ``They'll send as many as nine at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   So whether it's Emmitt Smith/Tim Lester in the two-back set, or
either Smith or third-down back Chris Warren in the one-back set,
Dallas will need a letter-perfect game Sunday from its running
backs on blitz pickup if they hope to keep quarterback Troy Aikman
on his feet in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmitt is every bit as good at picking up the blitz as he is
at running the football,'' Shelmon said. ``He's one of the best at
blitz pickup that I've ever seen. He has really good leverage, and
he delivers a good pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia will blitz as much as 45-50 percent of the time,
based on what the Cowboys have seen on videotape of Philly's first
four games under first-year defensive coordinator Jim Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles are 0-4, but they have recorded six sacks and 32
quarterback hurries to go along with their NFL-leading 12
takeaways. Blitzing is a gamble that apparently the winless Birds
aren't afraid to take.
</P>
<P>
   Speedy middle linebacker Jeremiah Trotter and left cornerback
Troy Vincent have one sack apiece. Free safety Brian Dawkins has
three QB hurries. Nickel backer Ike Reese has one sack and two
hurries.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia especially likes to use the zone blitz. The Eagles
will send a safety and linebacker, or they will send both the
cornerback and outside linebacker from the same side to rush the
passer, leaving the outside receiver on that side uncovered coming
off the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from picking up the overload, the Cowboys will need for
their receivers to properly read blitz and for Aikman to quickly
deliver the ball. Short drops will be employed. This, of course,
can result in some big plays, especially with Raghib ``Rocket''
Ismail's speed added to the lineup this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys allowed no sacks last week against Arizona. Aikman
was neither rushed nor even touched by Arizona's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a great job of picking up the blitz,'' coach Chan
Gailey said. ``In fact, we did a better job of picking up the blitz
than we did with our base stuff.''

FINLEY READY TO TAKE CHARGE FOR MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He used to be a quiet, unassuming leader. But Michael
Finley has decided to come out of seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the guy who is going to go out there and get in people's
faces this year and tell them when they're doing the right things
and when they're doing the wrong things,'' Finley said. ``That's
definitely me.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game is going to speak for itself. But as far as being
vocal, I'll be that guy this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, a 6-foot-7 guard, has been the team's leader, averaging
at least 20 points per game the past two seasons. The last Dallas
Mavericks player to accomplish that was Mark Aguirre in 1987-89.
Becoming more of a team leader, Finley said, is ``a role that I've
kind of earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't given to me when I first got here (on Dec. 26, 1996
in the Jason Kidd trade). But through my actions, playing and
attitude, it's just something I think I've earned.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also something the Mavericks need. A.C. Green served as the
team's vocal leader last season, but he was shipped to the Los
Angeles Lakers in a sign-and-trade deal for Sean Rooks.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Don Nelson and other Mavericks players sounded grateful to
hear Finley voice his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to get him to do that every since I got here,
so if he feels that way, that's a real positive,'' Nelson said.
``He's my captain. So it's good to have your captain be your
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad, because I've been trying to get him to do that for
two years,'' forward Cedric Ceballos said. ``He's such a quiet guy,
and he doesn't really want to become vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wants to work hard and have everybody come along with
him. But sometimes you can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``People see that you care, but you've also got to let them know
about what's going on and the great opportunities for them,''
Ceballos said. ``So if you keep blossoming and put yourself in the
position like Michael, everybody's got to follow the guy. He's a
franchise guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who is fourth on the NBA's active Ironman list with 297
consecutive games played, knows he can't transform the Mavericks
into winners overnight or by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that has shown throughout the Dallas Mavericks'
organization for years, before I was even here, that one guy can't
take a team all the way,'' Finley said. ``It's just going to take a
complete team effort, and hopefully everybody in this gym is on the
same page in trying to get our team better.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has increased his own role, Finley knows he will be
under the microscope. Then again, so will the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had high expectations,'' Finley said. ``My main
goal is to win a championship, no matter what team I'm with. But
realistically, I know that _ not being far-fetched _ it's going to
be hard for this team to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations for this team is definitely to improve each
and every game, and each and every practice. I think if we do that,
we can make some noise this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially with Finley as a vocal leader. nn

<P>
   NEW YORK _ That other Noo Yawk baseball team reappeared on
Tuesday night in all its usual October splendor.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the one with its name on the Bronx stadium where it
plays but no names on the back of the uniforms the players wear;
the one that was mostly out of sight and out of mind while the Noo
Yawk team in Queens did its Lazarus impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   That other Noo Yawk team was back in the Bronx where it belongs,
back doing what it did both last year and three years ago before
winning the World Series: tormenting the Texas Rangers, 8-0, in the
opener of their American League division series.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody still doubts that center fielder Bernie Williams is
worth his seven-year $87.5 million contract, he was a bargain on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, his sliding one-hand catch of Juan
Gonzalez's liner saved El Duque Hernandez's 1-0 lead. In the fifth,
his two-run double extended the lead to 3-0. In the sixth, he
stretched it to 6-0 with a three-run homer, his 10th on the
post-season stage. In the eighth, his single made it 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Noo Yawk baseball has never had it so good. Even though they've
been neighbors for nearly 40 years, that other team in the Bronx
and the Queens team have never before been together in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And that other team in the Bronx didn't seem to mind that the
Queens team had upstaged it for the last two weeks, at least David
Cone didn't. He's the Bronx right-hander who pitched a perfect game
this season, but in 1988 he was 20-3 with a 2.22 earnedrun average
for the Queens team the previous time it went to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rooting for the Mets _ as a friend of Johnny Franco,''
Cone said, referring to the Bensohnurst left-hander who now lives
on Staten Island. ``Who can't root for him?''
</P>
<P>
   Cone and Franco were teammates in Queens for three seasons
before Cone was shipped to Toronto, where he was briefly a teammate
of Al Leiter, who Monday night pitched the Queens team into the
playoffs with a 5-0 two-hitter in the wild-card playoff in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice for Al and Johnny to be the center of attention,
especially Johnny,'' Cone said. ``You can count me as one of the
guys who says Johnny doesn't get the credit he deserves. He's had a
remarkable career and he's taken more abuse than he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   As a year-round Noo Yawker, Cone is rooting for what every Noo
Yawker, no matter what their borough, is rooting for _ a Subway
Series between that other team in the Bronx and the Lazarus
impersonators in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   But as the millenium approaches, Subway Series is a misnomer.
Subway Series was the nickname for the World Series half a century
ago when that other team in the Bronx played those ``Boys of
Summer'' teams in Brooklyn or that Noo Yawk team in upper Manhattan
where the Polo Grounds apartments stand now.
</P>
<P>
   Now that was Noo Yawk baseball at its best.
</P>
<P>
   That other team in the Bronx frustrated those ``Boys of Summer''
teams five out of six from 1947 to 1956, and whacked that Manhattan
one out of one in 1951 after ``The Little Miracle of Coogan's
Bluff'' _ Bobby Thomson's home run off Ralph Branca that some
Brooklyn people still won't talk about without weeping.
</P>
<P>
   But as the millenium approaches, if that other team in the Bronx
and the Lazarus impersonators were to get to the World Series later
this month, it wouldn't be a Subway Series as much as an E-Z Pass
Playoff across the Triborough Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to dream on, I think a Subway Series would be
great for the people of New York,'' said Joe Torre, the Bronx
dugout philosopher. ``If we were lucky enough to get there and the
Mets were lucky enough to get there, well, there's an advantage and
a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people that you'd need tickets for; that's the
disadvantage. The advantage would be you sleep in your same bed
every night. That would be O.K., but it would be weird. Of course,
I grew up that way.''
</P>
<P>
   When Torre was a youngster in Brooklyn, he lived through those
seven Subway Series from 1947 through 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with the Yankees and the Dodgers, or the Yankees and
the Giants; it was always a Subway Series,'' he said. ``In my
teen-age years, I thought that was the way it was supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe a Subway Series _ oops, an E-Z Pass Playoff _ will
materialize this October. Maybe.

EFFECT OF SPRINT-MCI MERGER ON KC AREA REMAINS UNCLEAR

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Telecom gurus call it a marriage made in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be months, or even years, before it is clear how the
$129 billion merger of Sprint Corp. and MCI WorldCom Inc. will
affect the heavily Sprint-dependent Kansas City economy.
</P>
<P>
   Until a jammed news conference Tuesday at the Sheraton New York
hotel in midtown Manhattan, both companies had been so quiet about
a possible merger, you could hear a pin drop.
</P>
<P>
   And even as two former rivals stood shoulder to shoulder to
unveil the largest merger in business history, they offered few
concrete details about what Kansas City, and the 18,789 employees
that call the area home, could expect in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The message Tuesday from MCI WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard J.
Ebbers and Sprint Chief Executive William T. Esrey was all about
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger is about growth, growth in services for customers,
financial growth for our investors and, importantly, growth
opportunities for our employees,'' Ebbers said before a crush of
financial journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, Sprint and WorldCom are poised to provide customers
with the broadest possible array of services ever assembled by one
company,'' Esrey added. ``That's the key to this transaction. It's
what customers around the world want _ the ability to one-stop shop
for wireless and wire line, voice, high-speed data and Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but be caught up by the excitement in this
room,'' Esrey said. ``The upside potential for our new company is
nearly limitless.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sheraton's lobby was a testament to what the merger is
about, full of business people talking on wireless phones, ringing
the register for the new communications conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was considerably more subdued Tuesday morning at
Sprint's building at 9300 Metcalf Ave., where Michael Fuller,
president of Sprint's local-telephone division, held a local news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Stone-faced Sprint employees crowded around journalists and
stood four deep along the balcony that overlooks the building's
lobby, trying to catch clues as to what's to become of their jobs
and their respective divisions as the companies meld operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What assurance, if any, do the Sprint employees who run the
long-distance network have that MCI WorldCom won't simply retain
the fiber and the switches and lose the Sprint employees?'' one
employee asked.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller hesitated to offer specifics but repeatedly went back to
the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Mr. Ebbers said today, he fully expects the broader
WorldCom enterprise to continue to grow in its employee head
count,'' Fuller said. ``We anticipate growing on the order of
multiple billions of dollars every year. On that kind of growth
trajectory, we're going to be looking for good people.'' Sprint
divisions
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, which will be called simply WorldCom, is
expected to post revenues of more than $50 billion and will have
140,000 employees worldwide serving more than 40 million customers,
Ebbers said.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal closes, possibly in the second half of 2000, Esrey
is expected to become the chairman of the combined company, with
his office in the Kansas City area. Ebbers will assume the title of
chief executive, with the more active role in the day-to-day
operation of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a strong believer that there is one person who, in the
end, has to call the shots: the CEO,'' Esrey said in a meeting with
two reporters after the news conference. ``That is Bernie Ebbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald LeMay, Sprint president, will be chief operations officer
of WorldCom. The roles of other senior managers have not been
determined, but Ebbers said his existing management team was drawn
from the companies he had acquired in the past.
</P>
<P>
   At the local news conference, Fuller said significant parts of
the combined company still would be run out of Kansas City,
specifically the Sprint PCS wireless operations; the company's
local telephone operations; its equipment subsidiary, Sprint North
Supply; and Sprint publishing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS employs about 15,200 nationally and 3,384 locally.
Sprint's local-telephone companies operates in parts of 19 states.
It employs 26,000 nationally and 4,759 locally.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have speculated that MCI WorldCom, which has
traditionally shown little interest in the kind of rural markets
where Sprint's local-phone systems are concentrated, might sell
some of those properties to help pay for the acquisition.

<P>
   Fuller said he thought that was unlikely, as local customers
were becoming far more valuable, particularly as telephone
companies begin to sell them bundles of services.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for Sprint's long-distance division is less certain.
The division employs about 4,000 locally and generated almost 60
percent of Sprint's revenues in 1998. From the back-office
operations of the company's network to marketing of its services,
the two companies clearly overlap and offer opportunities to seek
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller said MCI's long-distance operation had substantially the
same distribution of services in the same markets around the
country, but that wouldn't necessarily mean a large reduction in
the long-distance work force.
</P>
<P>
   He had few details on how the networks would be melded but said,
``Components of the long-distance business would likely stay
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint employs about 4,100 at its corporate headquarters in the
Kansas City area. And although Fuller stressed that MCI WorldCom
was a decentralized operation, the new company will be based in
Clinton, Miss., with extensive operations at MCI WorldCom's new
campus near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even though construction of Sprint's new office campus in
Overland Park will proceed, many of the company's legal, finance,
regulatory and administrative positions in Kansas City could be
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, with the merger we expect to realize a lot of
synergies, and as you might expect, many of those synergies come in
the administrative and support functions of the company,'' Fuller
said. ``Change is probably inevitable in those areas of the
company....The approach we're going to take is to take the best and
brightest of our respective organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies already project annual cash savings of $1.9
billion in 2001, the first full year of operation. They plan to
combine domestic and international long-distance traffic and avoid
local access charges that were formerly paid to regional Bell
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies think savings from the merger could rise to $3
billion a year by 2004. They also expect to reduce capital
expenditures by $1.3 billion in 2001 as they combine functions such
as purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether layoffs might be one method of making the deal
worthwhile, Ebbers said: ``The history of WorldCom is that, from
one year to the next, there has never been a net decrease in
employees.'' He said WorldCom's practice was to take talent from
the companies it acquired and ``produce the most competitive
management team in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need good employees,'' said Ebbers. ``The challenge is to
get employees, not terminate them.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked later about redundancies between the work of some
Sprint and MCI WorldCom employees, Ebbers said: ``Do we have
redundancies? Yes. I don't know where they are.'' Joint ventures
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and WorldCom are already undertaking several ventures
together before the merger closes.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom will buy Sprint PCS service and sell it under the
WorldCom brand name. Sprint also will buy local capacity from
WorldCom in several cities where its metropolitan area networks
would allow Sprint to reach customers directly, without passing
calls off to the regional Bell companies. Finally, Sprint will also
send its international traffic over WorldCom's network and reduce
its reliance on Global One.
</P>
<P>
   The MCI WorldCom//Sprint alliance will mean the end of Global
One, Sprint's long-troubled international venture with France
Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said one of the partners probably would buy Global One's
assets, adding he hoped it would happen in the next few months.
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom already have said they plan to
sell their respective 10 percent stakes in Sprint and use the
substantial gains they will generate to finance international
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Residential and business consumers won't see much change from
the merger in the short term. Long-distance rates will not fall
much further until the long-distance carriers see further
reductions in local access charges from the regional Bell
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much juice left to squeeze from that lemon,''
Ebbers said.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have worked to develop nationally recognized
brands. And the combined company hopes to use them both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both brands will be extensively used'' in the future, Ebbers
said. ``Both companies have a tremendous amount of equity in these
names, and we'd be foolhardy not to take advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint plans to go forward this year with the introduction of
its Integrated On Demand Network to residential customers in Kansas
City, Seattle and Denver. ION is a bundled service that will offer
local, long-distance and high-speed Internet through a single
connection to the home. It is Sprint's strategy to penetrate local
markets around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see ION as a technology that we're ahead in and fits in
their strategy,'' Fuller said. ``We see ION continuing full speed
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers said that the combined company would attack
local-telephone markets with vigor and that the merger would bring
competition promised by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 much
closer to realization.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates are leery of those claims, having seen
unprecedented consolidation in the telephone industry since the
act's passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not opposed to the merger, but in the short term, this
is not going to benefit business users,'' said Brian Moir, general
counsel of the International Communications Association, which
represents business telephone users.
</P>
<P>
   ``When large companies review their telephone contracts, they
typically send out a (bid) and get three responses, from WorldCom,
AT&AMP;T and Sprint,'' he said. ``When you take one of those three
away, that doesn't make for a more robust contract negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Federation of America is outspokenly opposed to the
deal, as it thinks the merger of the two long-distance giants may
halt the decline in long-distance rates that consumers have enjoyed
over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ressie Rigdon of North Kansas City said she had contacted the
office of U.S. Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican, to oppose
the deal and planned to organize a letter-writing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there some loophole in our antitrust laws that allows MCI
to do this?'' she asked. ``This may be right for MCI. This may be
right for Sprint. But it's not right for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers insisted that previous statements by Federal
Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard were not
anti-merger and that the government would give the merger a
fair-minded hearing, and still protect the public and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden of proof is on our side to show that this is a
pro-competitive merger,'' Ebbers said. ``Obviously we would not put
our companies at risk if we didn't feel extremely confident we
would be able to be convincing in that argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said he was on his horse in the middle of Colorado, in the
middle of nowhere, when he and Ebbers agreed on the basic terms of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie and I talked on an iridium phone, and it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that well,'' Ebbers responded. ``I thought he agreed to a
lower number than we ended up at.''

COWBOYS ADD TWO, GIVE HARPER TRYOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Despite a 3-0 start, the Dallas Cowboys are
hardly standing pat.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who said the team must continue to
get better on the field to reach their ultimate goal, did his part
Tuesday, announcing two roster additions and bringing in former
Cowboys receiver Alvin Harper for a workout.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Robert Chauncey (6-foot, 252 pounds) and offensive
lineman Ben Fricke were signed. To make room, the Cowboys released
running back Sherman Williams and placed offensive lineman Tony
Hutson (torn knee ligaments) on the injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that they already know what Williams can do, the
Cowboys said the addition of Chauncey allows them to take a look at
big back who can be a backup at running back, fullback and play
special teams.
</P>
<P>
   The interesting thing about the Chauncey is that he didn't play
college football. He played pro baseball for five years out of high
school before spending time the past two seasons with the Chargers
and Bears.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to bring back Fricke, who was released by the
Cowboys last week when they picked up Tom Myslinski, was an easy
one. He knows the offense and the Cowboys liked what he did when he
was here before.
</P>
<P>
   The startling news Tuesday was the sight of the retired Harper,
a star on the Cowboys Super Bowl title teams in 1992 and 1993,
trying out for scouts and coaches. Harper had failed stints with
the Buccaneers, Redskins and Saints after leaving the Cowboys
following the 1994 season and has not played in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's a little overweight, the Cowboys said Harper seemed
to be in decent shape and had a good workout. However, they said
signing him was not imminent. The Cowboys already have seven
receivers on the roster and said they viewed the Harper as more of
a ``look-see'' to discover what kind of shape he was in in case a
need developed. GOOD NEWS ON MATHIS
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys got good news regarding cornerback Kevin Mathis, who
was diagnosed with only a sprained medial collateral ligament in
his left knee. Mathis suffered the injury in the first quarter of
last Sunday's victory over the Cardinals. He is listed as doubtful
for Sunday's game against the Eagles. nn

WILLIAMS PUNISHES SELE'S FASTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Right-hander Aaron Sele threw his second-best pitch
to New York's Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Sele defended his decision to those who second-guessed him after
the Texas Rangers' 8-0 loss to the New York Yankees on Tuesday
night in Game 1 of this best-of-five American League Division
Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' switch-hitting center fielder lined Sele's 3-2
fastball into center field for a two-run, fifth-inning double that
gave the defending World Series champions a 3-0 lead, and the
Rangers never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great hitter,'' Sele said, ``and when you make bad
pitches, he makes you pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele threw seven consecutive curveballs before attempting to
bust Williams inside with a cut fastball, but the pitch caught too
much of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thrown him seven curveballs in a row,'' Sele said. ``If
you throw a good fastball in on him, you'd think you'd be able to
get him. I just left it high out over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-run inning began inconspicuously as Sele retired Scott
Brosius and Chuck Knoblauch for the first two outs. Derek Jeter,
though, prolonged it with a seeing-eye ground ball that eluded
second baseman Mark McLemore and rolled into center field for a
two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter advanced to third base on the ensuing single by Paul
O'Neill, and that brought Williams to the plate for the game's
decisive at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Sele's first two pitches put Williams in an 0-2 hole, and Sele
hopped off the mound anticipating a strikeout after Williams took a
1-2 curveball. Plate umpire Jim Joyce, though, viewed the pitch off
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called it a ball,'' Sele said. ``You've got to make a pitch
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams eventually worked the count full, and Sele responded
with a curveball on the first of his two 3-2 deliveries. Williams
barely fouled that pitch to prolong the at-bat and lined the next
delivery into center field.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers center fielder Tom Goodwin, perhaps the American
League's fastest player, did not have a chance of running the line
drive down. The ball hit the base of the wall, and Jeter and
O'Neill crossed the plate uncontested.
</P>
<P>
   Sele struggled with his command throughout his 117-pitch
appearance. He threw only 55 strikes (47 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``I never found a groove,'' Sele said. ``I was erratic with my
pitches all night.''

A STERN LANDLORD SERVES PLAYOFF-EVICTION NOTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This has become the same as a real-estate
transaction. The Rangers rent space in baseball's postseason, but
it's strictly a short-term lease.
</P>
<P>
   And then the landlord comes calling with an eviction notice.
That, of course, would be the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees own this property. Worst yet, the Yankees own the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Call U-Haul. It might have only been Game 1 of the American
League Division Series here last night, but there was absolutely
nothing to suggest anything will be different.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will once again be packing up and leaving October in
a hurry. An impressive, doing-everything-right evening for the
Yankees ended in an 8-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's mind-boggling,'' admitted manager Johnny Oates,
who meant another run-production failure for his club. In October.
Against the Yankees. But Oates' comment also summed up an entire
collapse on this brisk Bronx evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if it's Yankee Stadium or Yellowstone Park, we
can score more runs than this,'' Oates added. Well, maybe. But the
proof is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it's supposed to be that makes these Yankees less than
last season's world championship edition ... well, stop right there
with the jokes. New York was better than ever last night. Better
than they'd been in winning six of seven previous playoff games
against the Rangers dating to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in October, the Rangers established every offensive
futility record in the postseason books _ fewest runs in a series
(one), lowest team batting average (.141), fewest hits (13). That
was supposed to be the Yankees at their best, until, that is, last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Futility is one thing. But before this series is over, the
Rangers could well lead the world in frustration. That what's Game
1 was all about. Being completely outclassed is frustration waiting
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Blame a batting order that couldn't solve Orlando Hernandez _
but what Yankees' starter have the Rangers solved since the 1996
postseason? None is the answer. One run in four games is another
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, however, the Rangers had solid pitching despite
being swept in three games. This time, Aaron Sele struggled for
five innings, and the bullpen collapsed behind him.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were a couple of ugly defensive lapses. Rusty
Greer played hide-and-seek with a line drive to left in the second
inning. He ducked just in time as the ball headed for the wall,
costing a run. That one will look hideous on the ESPN replay shows.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't end there _ in the sixth inning, third baseman
Todd Zeile booted a two-out ground ball that cost a run, but also
the left the inning open for an eventual three-run homer by Bernie
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   What a hero Mr. Williams was. Six RBI and the defensive play of
the game in the third inning. When he chased down a Juan Gonzalez
fly ball in the third, it snatched away two runs from the Rangers.
And also seemed to break the will of a batting order desperate to
break through against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But it's strictly a rental agreement. The landlord is tough. And
this landlord owns the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Something, however, could have been cooking in the top of the
sixth. Down by three runs, there was hope. With a runner at first,
Rafael Palmeiro smoked a line drive that appeared headed for the
right-field corner. It might have meant a run, but at the least,
runners would be at second and third. From out of the Bronx night,
however, first baseman Tino Martinez leaped for the catch, then
tagged first, completing the double play and the double dagger to
any Rangers' comeback hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching, defense and a clutch hitter in Bernie Williams _
that's how the Yankees win playoff games. But it has become a
foreign trifecta for the Rangers when it comes to these October
mismatches against the New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the top of the first may have been the turning
point for the Rangers. And that turning point was straight down.
The Rangers had runners at first and second with one out. But
Hernandez toyed with Gonzalez, throwing breaking balls on the
outside corner, Hernandez stuffed Juan with a strikeout. From
there, he worked around Palmeiro, and the walk loaded the bases.
But Zeile followed by striking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a key right there,'' said Oates. ``As much emphasis
as we put on getting on the board first, plus knowing the troubles
we've had scoring runs against the Yankees, well ...''
</P>
<P>
   The eviction notice has been served.

RANGERS' OFFENSE LOST IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Texas Rangers' offensive postseason agony just
won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   This team scored 945 runs in the regular season. But when it
comes to the playoffs and the New York Yankees, the Rangers are
still flailing away helplessly.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the nightmare they went through last year, the
Rangers opened their latest Division Series against the Yankees by
getting shut out by Orlando Hernandez, 8-0, at Yankee Stadium on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, getting the Rangers to overswing at a baffling
assortment of off-speed pitches, allowed two hits in eight innings,
both by catcher Ivan Rodriguez. The Rangers have gone 22 innings
without scoring against the Yankees in the playoffs. They have only
one run in four playoff games going back to last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough loss, but we're not down yet,'' Rodriguez said.
``We still have four games to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 is Thursday night at Yankee Stadium, and the Rangers must
find a way to score against Andy Pettitte or risk going back to
Texas down two games in the best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating not getting any hits,'' second baseman Mark
McLemore said. ``But we have to keep this in perspective and come
back Thursday. We'll be good again. We're a good-hitting
ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Offense is the Rangers' strength, but other areas failed them as
well Tuesday night. Starting pitcher Aaron Sele allowed four runs
in five-plus innings, and the Rangers misplayed two balls
defensively that led directly to five of the Yankees' runs.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Bernie Williams did most of the damage for the
Yankees with six runs batted in, including a two-run double off
Sele in the fifth and a three-run homer off Mike Venafro in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the Yankees simply outclassed the Rangers in every
phase of he game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great ballclub,'' designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro
said. ``We're not playing any slouch; they've been the best team in
baseball the past three or four years. For us to win, we have to
play well and capitalize on our opportunities. We didn't do that.
It's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were hoping Sele could hold the Yankees early and
give their offense a chance to do some damage. That plan crumbled
in the second inning when left fielder Rusty Greer, with two on and
one out, lost Ricky Ledee's slicing line drive in the lights. The
ball went for a double, allowing Darryl Strawberry to score from
first and give the Yankees a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see it,'' Greer said. ``I was just trying to get
another angle on it. I should have gone back, kept the ball in
front of me and kept the runner from scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' two-run double in the fifth made it 3-0 and any chance
of the Rangers coming back died in the sixth when third baseman
Todd Zeile botched Paul O'Neill's two-out grounder for an error.
That allowed a run to score and Williams followed with his
three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   But the way Hernandez pitched and the Rangers hit, the
second-inning run probably would have been enough anyway. Hernandez
walked six but got out of a couple precarious situations early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had luck on my side tonight,'' Hernandez said. ``But I like
pitching with pressure. I never relax when I pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, he struck out Juan Gonzalez with runners at
first and second and, after Palmeiro walked, did the same to Todd
Zeile with the bases loaded. He got out of the third inning after
Rodriguez singled and Greer walked, by getting Gonzalez and
Palmeiro on fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   That was it. The Rangers managed only four walks after the third
inning as reliever Jeff Nelson completed the shutout with a
scoreless ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find a way to break out of this,'' shortstop
Royce Clayton said. ``Thursday's a big game. We can't afford
another loss.'' nn

HEY, ISN'T THIS THE HORROR SHOW WE'VE SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New Yorkers have named a dance _ the ``El Duque'' _
after Yankees starting pitcher Orlando Hernandez, emulating his
high, snapping leg kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers deserve one, too. We can call it ``The Choke.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary move is to place both hands around the throat and
gag.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat that simple step, over and over again, and you've got it
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Groundhog Day'' came around again for the Rangers on Tuesday
night at Yankee Stadium. Like Bill Murray in the popular movie, the
Rangers wake up on the same day every October and everything's just
as it was the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez shut down the offense with a two-hitter, Bernie
Williams hit a three-run homer and drove in six runs and the
Yankees opened defense of their world championship with an easy 8-0
victory in front of a delighted and relaxed sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers arrived Monday talking about a change in attitude.
They were confident, they said, that they could win this
best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   Then they went out Tuesday night and again played like the
Yankees' best friend Rover: They rolled over and played dead.
</P>
<P>
   Overreaction? Maybe. But how could you watch Tuesday night's
pathetic performance and not have visions of last year's playoff
collapse?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked the talk,'' said a frustrated manager Johnny
Oates. ``It's time to walk the walk. Regardless of who's pitching,
you should bump into a run once in a while by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the Rangers have hit the during the past two Octobers,
that's exactly what it would be.
</P>
<P>
   To lay it all completely on the Rangers' wretched offense, which
could muster just two Pudge Rodriguez hits and none after the third
inning, would be to miss the totality of this team's collapse
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the Yankees needed a play, someone stepped up to make
it. Every time the Rangers needed one, someone was there to blow
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had an opportunity to put a foot on the Yankees'
throat in the first inning when Rodriguez doubled to right-center
and Rusty Greer and Rafael Palmeiro walked to load the bases with
two outs.
</P>
<P>
   They'd talked about how important it was that something good
happen early. Here was their chance. Instead, Hernandez fanned Todd
Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, with runners at first and second, Williams _ him
again _ made a lunging snare of Juan Gonzalez's sinking liner in
right-center.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers never got another hit or advanced another runner
past first base.
</P>
<P>
   Alibis and excuses? Step right up. We can whine out a few if you
need them.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee's two-out, run-scoring double to left in the second
past a lunging Rusty Greer, who turned his head away at the last
second? Why, any second-guesser could see that Rusty lost the
sinking line drive in the lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really saw it,'' Greer said. ``I was trying to get an
angle on it where I could pick it up. If I had it to do over again,
I'd go back on it and just try to keep it in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter's two-out, seven-hopper that trickled into center in
the fifth, just eluding a slow-reacting Mark McLemore? Hey, Mac was
pulled way over toward first.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' two-run double over Tom Goodwin's head two batters
later? Starting pitcher Sele, who deserved a better fate, and
Rodriguez were absolutely certain they'd struck him out on a 1-2
curveball. Home plate umpire Jim Joyce disagreed. The runs counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was away, but it was a close pitch,'' Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile's misplay of Paul O'Neill's two-out grounder in the sixth?
It was a reasonably tricky, sharply hit one-hopper. Anyone could
have botched it, except maybe a Yankee or most major-league third
basemen.
</P>
<P>
   A run scored on the error and Williams then made rookie
left-hander Mike Venafro feel especially welcome to postseason play
with a three-run homer, quelling any thoughts of a Rangers'
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone paying attention or with mental faculties fully
intact were having any.
</P>
<P>
   Even Oates, who said he slept 14 hours Monday night (why bother
getting up when you know you're just living the same day over and
over again?), resorted to desperate measures, using setup relievers
Tim Crabtree and Venafro in the four-run Yankees sixth instead of
saving them for later in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else he tried, that didn't work either.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to bed, Johnny, and don't forget to set your alarm. Game
2 comes along Thursday and if memory serves, there'll be a long
rain delay in Game 3 Saturday night back in Texas before the
Rangers meekly fade into the October night.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, it's not like we can't use the rain. nn

BUSH OUT TO STEAL MCCAIN'S ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Texas Gov. George W. Bush is laying the groundwork
for an all-out assault on Arizona Sen. John McCain's home turf,
opening the way for what could become the state's most expensive
and competitive &QL; 
presidential primary ever.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who just three months ago seemed to be conceding the state
to McCain, plans to return to Arizona on Oct. 18 for his second
visit in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign is also searching for a state director and has
narrowed the list of candidates to a handful, including Mike Hull,
the son of Arizona Gov. Jane Hull.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the clearest sign that Bush hopes to strip McCain of his
political inheritance, Bush is prepared to spend more than $2
million on television ads and organizational efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being very smart to pay more attention to this state
because it's an early primary state and because Governor Bush has a
chance to drive a stake through the McCain campaign,'' said state
Sen. Scott Bundgaard, R-Phoenix, a fund-raiser for Bush in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said they are undaunted by the Bush initiative,
believing McCain's status as an incumbent U.S. senator still gives
McCain home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we've got the grass roots in place, and now we just
have to water it and watch it grow,'' said Jeff Groscost, speaker
of the Arizona House and a paid consultant to McCain. ``It's a lot
more difficult to come into a place and cover it with AstroTurf,
which is what they've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost pointed out that McCain's own fund-raising has
outstripped his expectations. The campaign had once aimed to raise
$16 million but now expects to bring in $20 million for the primary
season.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bundgaard and others, the Bush campaign intends to
expend approximately $2 million on a state that Bush has come to
view as both strategic to his success and winnable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people in the Bush camp assumed that McCain is so
extremely popular here that he would win easily,'' Bundgaard said.
``I think they have since found that not to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent presidential poll conducted by Arizona State
University pollster Bruce Merrill found Bush leading McCain 31
percent to 22 percent, followed by Steve Forbes with 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who won Arizona's 1996 primary by spending nearly $4
million, could further complicate matters by again swamping the
state with cash.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Coleman, Forbes' Arizona campaign director, declined to say
how much the publisher will shell out in his bid for a repeat. He
did say that Forbes ``will do everything it takes to win Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate helping Governor Bush's campaign spend every
dollar they have raised,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   A three-way slugfest, experts say, could be calamitous for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to place tremendous strain on McCain,'' said ASU's
Merrill, who predicts that Bush and McCain will eventually spend $2
million to $3 million each in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tragic, but that's why money has become so important.''
</P>
<P>
   The moves by Bush come just as McCain has emerged as Bush's most
serious rival, inching upward in polls in New Hampshire and gaining
grass-roots support in South Carolina, both key early primary
states.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said he can win those states, then march into Arizona
for a victory and a bounce into the March 7 GOP primaries in
California and New York, where he is rapidly moving up in the polls
against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But by forcing McCain to compete in Arizona, a state that by all
rights should be his for the taking, Bush could quickly sap
McCain's strength and end his hopes for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about media and money and exposure, and there is no
question that it is going to put McCain at a disadvantage,''
Merrill said. ``It will, frankly, wear him down to the point where
he just does not have the money to compete with Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   By returning to the state so soon after his initial foray here
last week, Bush will again spotlight the state's importance.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate will travel to Tucson for a fund-raiser, then move
on to Phoenix, where he will deliver a policy speech and attend
another event in Phoenix's East Valley, according to Gordon James,
a Bush organizer in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   James attributed the new focus on Arizona to Gov. Hull's recent
endorsement of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that strategy came about as a result of Mrs. Hull,''
James said. ``That was part of the deal _ that we would take it
(Arizona) seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's search for a state director has narrowed to fewer
than a handful of contenders, including Mike Hull, who ran his
mother's gubernatorial campaign in 1998, according to James and a
spokesman for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as though we are going to have an actual presence in
the state from now until the primary, which has evolved over the
last two weeks,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's (Bush is) being very aggressive and doing what
needs to be done. He's decided to go full tilt.'' &QL;

WILLIAMS GETS JOB DONE FOR YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even by George Steinbrenner's admission, Bernie
Williams was hours away from becoming the scorn of Yankees fans as
a member of the hated Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   An 11th hour phone call from Williams during the off-season,
Steinbrenner said, allowed the two sides to iron out several
differences and get a seven-year, $87.5 million contract done.
Otherwise, the Yankees were ready to sign Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, he was pretty close. We thought he was going to
Boston. They made a bigger offer than we did,'' Steinbrenner said
Tuesday night after Williams went 3-for-5 with a single, double,
home run and six runs batted in to lead the Yankees to an 8-0
victory and 1-0 lead over the Texas Rangers at Yankee Stadium in
the American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he called and said, `Can I do this? Can I do that? I
don't want to leave New York.' We got it done,'' Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I had so many distractions off the field that I felt
that those three-and-a-half, four hours I spent on the playing
field were the easiest part,'' Williams said. ``Right now I feel
the same way. We're having a lot of fun. So I have no complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who earned every cent of his contract by hitting .342
with 25 home runs and 115 RBI this season, got it done Tuesday
night with his glove as well as his bat. He rescued Yankees starter
Orlando Hernandez from early trouble with a sliding grab to rob
Gonzalez of a possible double.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez laced a fast-sinking liner into right-center field.
Williams sprinted to the gap and made a sliding catch on his right
knee, practically a carbon copy of Ricky Ledee's second-inning
liner that Rusty Greer misplayed in left field allowing the Yankees
to take a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting ready to dive for it, but I heard Bernie
coming,'' Yankees right-fielder Paul O'Neill said. ``I was getting
ready to dive for it. I didn't know he caught it.''
</P>
<P>
   The catch saved one run and possibly two, which would have given
the Rangers a 2-1 lead and possibly a different outlook against
Hernandez, who dodged missiles in the first inning as well.
Hernandez went on to retire the next eight consecutive batters and
coasted to a two-hitter through eight innings behind Williams' bat.
</P>
<P>
   On consecutive at-bats in the fifth, sixth and eighth innings,
Williams recorded a two-run double, a three-run home run _ both
coming batting left-handed _ and a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked up the whole offense and carried us,'' Yankees
designated hitter Darryl Strawberry said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' two-out, two-run double off the base of the
center-field wall in the fifth inning made it 3-0 and signaled the
demise of Rangers starter Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the big blast in the sixth that must have had the
Rangers thinking ``here we go again.'' An error on third baseman
Todd Zeille set up runners on first and second with two out.
Williams victimized Mike Venafro with his 10th career postseason
home run for a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I thought I was going to have a terrible night,''
Williams said. ``Something happened when they said the lineups.
Something inside of me woke up, said it's time to play.'' nn

MAVERICKS ASSISTANT SEES POSITIVE ATMOSPHERE FOR WINNING

<P>
   DALLAS _ The Stars are the defending Stanley Cup champions. The
Dallas Cowboys are 3-0 and the defending NFC East champions. The
Texas Rangers just won the AL West for the third time in the past
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the, uh, Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have missed the playoffs the past nine seasons _
the longest current streak in the NBA. But those at Mavericks
headquarters say they aren't jealous because they haven't been able
to keep pace with the Stars, Cowboys and Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's positive that the Stars have done that, positive
that the Cowboys are looking good, and positive that the Rangers
are successful,'' Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson said. ``I
think all of that stuff is what makes this attractive, not
unattractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson drew a parallel to his younger days in Boston when his
father, Don Nelson, played for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the days of the Celtics when I was growing up, we
followed the Bruins and then the Red Sox and then the Celtics,''
Donnie Nelson said. ``That's what makes Dallas one of the top
sports markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get up to speed and get with those other folks, and
it's going to be a matter of time before we do it. I see that as a
challenge.'' SMITH TO SiOUX FALLS
</P>
<P>
   Leon Smith might wind up playing this season for the Continental
Basketball Association's Sioux Falls Skyforce, Smith's agent said.
</P>
<P>
   The Skyforce drafted Smith on the ninth round (80th overall) of
the Sept. 21 CBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point they hold his CBA rights,'' said Matt
Muehlebach, Smith's agent. ``So I need to contact them from a
bigger picture view.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson said CBA teams often
will make a trade to accommodate a player. So he's holding out hope
that if Smith plays in the CBA, the Skyforce will trade him to a
team closer to Smith's hometown of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks acquired Smith in a draft day trade with the San
Antonio Spurs. On Monday, they finally convinced him it would be
better off if he played this season in the CBA or in the inaugural
International Basketball League. HARPER RETURNING?
</P>
<P>
   Derek Harper hasn't reported to the Detroit Pistons training
camp, fueling speculation that the former Mavericks guard could
finally retire after playing 16 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Mavericks coach/general manager said he would
like Harper to join the Mavericks organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't talked to him, nor were we expecting him to retire
this year when he signed a two-year contract \Rlast year\S,''
Nelson said. ``But we have an interest in hiring him; I just don't
know when. But it probably couldn't be this year, though.'' INJURY
REPORT
</P>
<P>
   John ``Hot Rod'' Williams missed both workout sessions with back
spasms. Shawn Bradley worked out, despite a strained back. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mavericks spent the first half of their morning workout
watching a 20-minute video of the new rules the NBA plans to
incorporate this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ The father-in-law of Mavericks developmental coach Kiki
Vandewedghe died on Sunday.
WHO'S HOT
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Ceballos had a dunk, buried three consecutive jumpers and
converted a steal into a reverse layup in rapid-like fashion. WHO'S
NOT
</P>
<P>
   With one of the scrimmage games on the line, Sean Rooks let Dirk
Nowitzki blow by him for the winning layup, which infuriated
Ceballos. WHOA NELLIE
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Michael Finley fared with water sports when he visited
him this summer in Maui, Hawaii, Nelson said: ``He can't even swim.
The Pacific Ocean is deep. He's got a swimming pool and can't even
swim. He ought to be ashamed of himself.'' nn

L.A. OFFICIALS DECRY HIGH DEATH RATE CROSSING STREET
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Citing a report that Los Angeles County has the
highest rate of pedestrian deaths in the state, the Board of
Supervisors voted Tuesday to urge state and local governments to
provide more protection, especially for children walking to and
from school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be a death sentence to walk in Los Angeles,''
said Supervisor Gloria Molina, who sponsored the motion.
</P>
<P>
   The recent study by the Surface Transportation Policy Project
found Los Angeles County to be the most dangerous place for
pedestrians in California. In 1998 alone, 200 were killed and 5,541
were injured in the county -- more than one-third of pedestrians
killed or injured statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being hit by a car while walking is the second leading cause
of death for kids ages 5 to 12,'' said Gloria Duran, a board member
of the Los Nietos School District in Whittier.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors voted unanimously to support more government
funding for pedestrian safety, to create a task force to examine
the issue, to ask the California Highway Patrol for stepped-up
enforcement near elementary schools in unincorporated areas and to
identify and improve the most dangerous intersections in the
county.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors' motion also urged Gov. Gray Davis to sign the
Safe Routes to School bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Nell Soto,
D-Ontario, which would provide about $20 million annually to local
governments to improve pedestrian safety near schools through
methods including crosswalks, bike lanes, overpasses and pedestrian
paths.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Ohland, the Southern California safety campaign manager
for the nonprofit organization that conducted the study, said some
of the $20 million could be used in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money would definitely be available to improve safety around
schools in the Valley,'' Ohland said. ``About 20 percent of the
traffic deaths are pedestrians' (deaths), but Caltrans spends less
than 1 percent of its money on pedestrian safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors called for creation of a task force of county
and Los Angeles city officials to develop a plan to improve
pedestrian safety.
</P>
<P>
   Their vote came just days after an unidentified driver struck a
family of three Friday night in Panorama City, killing a
grandmother and seriously injuring her daughter and grandson as
they were crossing a street near their house. On Tuesday, police
were still searching for the driver.
</P>
<P>
   John Fisher, assistant general manager of operations for the
city Department of Transportation, said city officials are
interested in working with their counterparts in county government
on improving pedestrian safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a little more money, there are programs and projects
we'd like to undertake, such as projects redesigning streets and
studies near schools,'' he said. ``We are already doing a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher cited 23 programs the city has undertaken in recent
years, including education programs for 400,000 students a year and
``smart crosswalks'' whose signals are activated when pedestrians
are about to enter them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the things we've done, we've brought down the number
of pedestrian accidents by 30 percent in the last nine years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian injury incidents in the city dropped from 3,937 in
1990 to 2,752 in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there may be a greater instance of accidents in Los
Angeles County, the number of accidents, at least in the city, has
gone down dramatically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Molina said the CHP and public works agencies in county
government as well as cities need to be more aggressive in
protecting children and other pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local residents and school officials frequently request
additional traffic controls, such as crosswalks and traffic
signals,'' Molina said. ``However, the (county's) Department of
Public Works routinely denies these requests.''

WE MIGHT FIND OUT IF IRVIN CAN BE A SUBORDINATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Yes, it's a bit premature, considering the
season is merely four weeks old, the Dallas Cowboys are undefeated
and that Michael Irvin leads the team with three touchdown
receptions.
</P>
<P>
   But the positioning needs to begin for this season not to be the
last in Dallas for the Playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Cowboys have not put Irvin back on the trading block. He
is not in coach Chan Gailey's doghouse. And he seems to be having
an enjoyable season.
</P>
<P>
   As a guest on Darren Woodson's radio show Monday night, the
chatty Irvin rarely let the host talk, kind of like days gone by
when Irvin hosted his own show and was the most visible player in
town.
</P>
<P>
   But these aren't the old days.
</P>
<P>
   These days Irvin, the team's all-time leading receiver and the
original ``throw me the damn ball'' guy before the Jets' Keyshawn
Johnson patented the phrase, no longer receives top billing in the
Cowboys' passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent signee Raghib Ismail is the Cowboys' go-to guy. He
leads the team with 13 catches for 288 yards. Irvin has nine
catches for 159 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Irvin, 33 and in the last year of his contract, has
tripled his touchdown total from a season ago. But the truth is in
the numbers. Ismail has more catches and more balls thrown in his
direction.
</P>
<P>
   It's the old double cross, considering the preseason hype of the
speedy Ismail serving as a complement to Irvin as the No. 2
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are, and the coaches will tell you, that Gailey's
offense has no primary receiver. They simply throw the ball to the
open man. It succeeds because of its unpredictability in being able
to count on several different weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The technical explanation for Ismail's early success is that
teams are leaving him with one-on-one coverage and still doubling
Irvin on the backside. In the past, not only did that take Irvin
out of the game, but it took the Cowboys' offense out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery is why defensive coordinators would rather shut down
Irvin, a playmaker as a drive sustainer, and chance a back-breaking
bomb to Ismail?
</P>
<P>
   Ismail's early success is also no coincidence from the Cowboys'
standpoint. Gailey likes, and wants, to get the ball to Ismail as
much as possible. That desire seemingly grows every week.
</P>
<P>
   What's also true about this season is Irvin's streak of eight
seasons as the team's top receiver is about to come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   This is where we get to next season. In all the preseason talk
of Irvin getting a rest and taking a lesser role, never was it
discussed that he take a subordinate role.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the case. How Irvin, who generally plays second
receiver to nobody, processes that and how it impacts his earning
potential on the free-agent market next spring will ultimately
decide his future.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that the Ismail-Irvin combo works well on the
field for the Cowboys. But the question is how it works in the
locker room and on the Cowboys' salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   SMITH AND LETT GROW CLOSER
</P>
<P>
   They say adversity can sometimes create odd relationships.
</P>
<P>
   And so it has with Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith and defensive
tackle Leon Lett.
</P>
<P>
   With Smith being sent home to Dallas during training camp with
back problems and Lett suspended by the NFL until the Green Bay
game Nov. 14 for violating the league's substance-abuse policy, it
was easy for the two players to not feel a part of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who will play Sunday against the Eagles after missing the
first three games, said it was a good thing that they had each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became closer during that time,'' Smith said. ``It was a
blessing for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said they worked out together and hung out together. But
they also had someone to talk to about life, football and life
after football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, we both felt like we are at the turning point in
our careers,'' Smith said. ``Is there a light at the end of the
tunnel or is this the end? Both of us know we can decide our own
destiny and choose how we want it to be. Big Cat helped me, and I
helped Big Cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Lett will be able to help the team out a great deal
when he returns. Lett is lighter and quicker than ever, Smith said,
and he is working out with a personal trainer and playing
basketball on a regular basis with former Mavericks star Mark
Aguirre. nn

YANKEES CRUSH RANGERS, 8-0, TO TAKE FIRST GAME OF PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez passed his manager in the Yankees
clubhouse on Tuesday afternoon and grinned, and Joe Torre suspected
Hernandez's expression was meant entirely to reassure him. As in,
``Don't worry, I've got everything under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, confounding the Rangers with a pitch he didn't learn
until after he joined the Yankees last summer, held Texas to two
hits over eight innings on Tuesday night and the Yankees won
easily, 8-0, in Game 1 of the three-of-five-game division series.
Bernie Williams drove in six runs with a two-run double, three-run
home run and an run-scoring single, sending 57,099 fans home
believing that the Yankees are serious about winning their 25th
championship in this century.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 will be at the Stadium on Thursday night, before the
series shifts to Texas for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Some Rangers have suggested the Yankees aren't as good as they
were last year, but Texas might not be the best gauge. The Rangers
have lost seven consecutive post-season games against the Yankees,
dating to 1996, and haven't scored in their last playoff 22
innings, dating to last year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates, the Texas manager, was tense afterward, squeezing
his words as he spoke of Hernandez and his own team's failures
against the Yankees. ``Taking nothing against El Duque _ he made
some great pitches _ but we can score runs by accident,'' Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is no accident that Texas was scoreless on Tuesday night,
that the Rangers have managed only one run in their last 42 playoff
innings against the Yankees. The Texas lineup is stacked with
aggressive, powerful hitters who have a consistent approach at the
plate. Attack. Always attack. The political consultant James
Carville would fit in nicely with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Yankees limited the Rangers to a run in the
three-game division series and swept Texas by using the Rangers'
own aggressiveness against them, David Wells and Andy Pettitte
throwing changeups when Texas was looking for fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Hernandez stifled the Rangers exactly the same
way, with a changeup _ a pitch he did not throw until the middle of
last summer. In chatting with teammates, he developed a circle
change, a pitch thrown with the ball tucked deeply into the palm,
pushed by the hand rather than the forefinger and middle finger,
the effect a dramatic decrease in velocity.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez usually relies on his slider, the sweeping breaking
ball that moves away from right-handed hitters, but he altered his
tactic, as he worked carefully through the Texas lineup. Ivan
Rodriguez doubled in the first inning and Hernandez walked Rusty
Greer, and the hulking Juan Gonzalez strolled to the plate, always
capable of launching a ball into Monument Park.
</P>
<P>
   But with a two-ball, two-strike count on Gonzalez, Hernandez
buried the baseball deep into his palm, flipped it homeward, and
Gonzalez pitched forward on his front leg and swung awkwardly,
missing; Oates mentioned this at-bat later, in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   This went on all night _ a Texas hitter leaning awkwardly, the
timing of his swing shattered, the result being a pop-up or easy
fly ball. Hernandez was throwing his fastball about 90 miles and
hour and his changeup 71-to-73 mph and the Rangers were caught in
between. Of the 24 outs Hernandez registered, 15 came on balls hit
in the air, four were on strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez survived through some early danger. ``Luck was on my
side,'' Hernandez said later. After Gonzalez struck out in the
first inning, Hernandez walked Rafael Palmeiro on five pitches, but
whiffed Todd Zeile on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was in a full pursuit of the ball within two strides,
eyes locked on the flight of the ball, his mouth widening and then
closing as he took quick and deep breaths. O'Neill had no chance,
Williams had to catch the ball. He dropped to his left thigh,
reached out and speared the ball with his glove about three feet
off the ground, sliding across the grass and leaping to his feet to
throw the ball back to the infield. The play saved two runs for the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro popped Hernandez's next pitch _ a changeup _ to deep
center field, and Hernandez began walking toward the dugout, head
down, quite sure of himself, never bothering to check and see
whether Yankee Stadium would contain Palmeiro's drive. The ball
settled into Williams's glove just before Hernandez stepped over
the first base line, El Duque respecting this superstition, as
always.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers never really bothered Hernandez after that. He would
get ahead in the count, and then the catcher Jorge Posada would
give the sign for the changeup _ waggling the four fingers of his
right hand _ and tap his glove against the ground, indicating
Hernandez to keep the changeup low. Hernandez followed his
directives precisely. ``He was just incredible,'' said Posada, who
had wasted no time in angering Hernandez before this game,
challenging the pitcher to concentrate when the two were in the
trainer's room. ``His control, he was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele, the Texas pitcher, had a good curveball, but the
Yankees waited patiently for mistakes, and ultimately, they were
rewarded. Darryl Strawberry was on first base when Sele threw a
fastball over the heart of the plate in the second inning and Ricky
Ledee drove it to left field, the ball slicing as if Ledee had hit
it with an oversized driver.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer, Texas' capable left fielder, closed on the ball and
seemed in position to make the catch, and suddenly ducked his head;
he had lost the ball in the glare created by the hundreds of
floodlights that rim the top of Yankee Stadium. Strawberry rounded
third and scored, Ledee had a double and the Yankees had a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sele becomes more vulnerable with each pass through the lineup.
Opponents batted .252 against him on his first 45 pitches this
year, .319 thereafter, and as Williams came to bat in the sixth
with two runners on, Sele was approaching 100 pitches. Williams
fell behind no balls and two strikes. Sele spun a curveball with
one ball and two strikes, the ball bending past the outside corner
of the plate, Williams frozen as Sele lurched toward the Texas
dugout, thinking he had an inning-ending strikeout. Ball2,
according to the home-plate umpire Jim Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Sele tried to throw another curveball on the outside edge, but
it was ball three. Williams fought off another curveball, with a
foul tip. Having thrown Williams six straight curves, Sele changed
his pattern, whipped a fastball; Williams crushed it, far and
beyond the outfielders, both runners scoring. The fans roared for
Williams, who put the game out of reach with his home run the next
inning. They roared, for Hernandez.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Nostradamus, who developed a pretty good reputation for
predicting the future, probably would be reduced to quack status if
he tried to predetermine the Astros' course.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This team lives to prove everyone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Prognostications of another sure-fire first-round exit were in
need of re-evaluation Tuesday after the Astros claimed a 6-1
victory over the Atlanta Braves in Game 1 of a best-of-five
National League Division Series at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against Astros starter Shane Reynolds, but any pitching
matchup that features Greg Maddux is a pretty safe bet for the
Braves. That myth was dispelled Tuesday when the Astros frustrated
and rattled Maddux en route to their first Game 1 playoff victory
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie left fielder Daryle Ward cracked a homer off Maddux on
the first pitch of the sixth inning to snap a 1-1 tie, and Ken
Caminiti's three-run homer in the ninth broke open the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored only two runs in seven innings off Maddux, but
that doesn't begin to tell the story of Tuesday's momentum-grabbing
performance. Maddux allowed 10 hits and four walks (two
intentional) but worked out of jams, including two bases-loaded
situations, until Ward gave the Astros the lead for good with his
homer.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Astros refused to pronounce themselves in
control of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in the driver's seat yet,'' Astros outfielder Carl
Everett said. ``To be in the driver's seat, you have to win three
games. Until we do that, we're just a passenger.''
</P>
<P>
   At least they're on the right road this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros wasted well-pitched games in losing Game 1 of the
Division Series each of the past two years. This time, they refused
to be denied, overcoming obstacle after obstacle in a victory that
was more hard-earned than the score might indicate.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros held tight to a one-run lead before sticking a
four-run dagger on the scoreboard against reliever Mike Remlinger
in the ninth. Any hopes the Braves had of coming back faded when
Billy Wagner sprinted from the bullpen to seal the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting this first one was huge,'' said Astros outfielder Bill
Spiers, who was 2-for-4. ``They handed it to us earlier in the
year, and it was important for us to show that we can play with
these guys. We still have to win two more games, but this is the
right way to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who didn't figure into the Astros' plans in spring
training, has been a major force down the stretch. He hit .348 with
five homers and 20 RBIs over his final 20 starts of the regular
season, and he's showing no signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, working on three days of rest, was viewed as the
Astros' third-best option to start Game 1 behind 20-game winners
Mike Hampton and Jose Lima. But it's difficult to imagine either of
Reynolds' mound mates getting the Astros off to a better start than
he did Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to get the ball in the first game gave me a lot of
confidence,'' said Reynolds, who was 2-3 with a 4.08 ERA over his
last seven starts of the regular season. ``I feel like I let the
team down in the second half of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday, it's safe to assume all is forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds held the Braves to a run on seven hits in six innings
before surrendering the mound to the bullpen, which combined for
three perfect innings to preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane pitched a great game, and the bullpen did a heck of a
job,'' Caminiti said. ``Knowing what this team has gone through in
the postseason the last couple of years, it just felt good to get
this win. It was a big one.''
</P>
<P>
   The big one started off with a little play that turned out huge.
Everett led off the second inning with a surprise bunt base hit and
scored on Tony Eusebio's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Braves left fielder Gerald Williams tied the score with a single
in the fifth, but Ward's homer in the sixth put the Astros on top
for good. Ward had just three at-bats against Maddux before
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who is on the mound,'' Ward said. ``He's
concentrating on doing his job, and I'm concentrating on doing
mine. I was just trying to hit the ball. I can't explain it any
better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux spent most of the afternoon in search of an explanation
regarding plate umpire Mike Winters' strike zone. The sound of
Maddux barking his disgust was often audible throughout the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maddux got a little frustrated,'' Caminiti said. ``He's a
competitor. He threw some pitches that he thought were strikes that
were called balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett said: ``He got frustrated because we were hitting him.
He's not used to that. He was complaining about balls and strikes,
but the times he complained, they were balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's sacrifice fly in the ninth gave the Astros a run after
the Braves had intentionally walked Jeff Bagwell, and Caminiti's
blast put the game on ice. It was a sweet moment for Caminiti, who
missed 79 games because of an injury this season and didn't get to
show his stuff nearly enough during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be able to hold my head high for a little while,''
Caminiti said. ``But tomorrow is another day.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be a day with a lot less pressure because of what the
Astros did Tuesday.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ Think about this. A guy wants to give you $700 million to
join your club, and you have to hold a meeting to discuss it?
</P>
<P>
   Two meetings?
</P>
<P>
   Bud Adams put up $25,000 to get Houston into the American
Football League. Today, he's of the opinion Bob McNair should pay
$1 billion to get Houston back into the NFL. Hey, Bud, even
allowing for inflation
</P>
<P>
   It's crazy, that's what it is. But McNair, bless him,
desperately wants to return pro football to Houston, and so there
he was, holed up for a good while in his suite at the Hyatt Regency
on Tuesday while, downstairs, the NFL's expansion committee debated
the merits of McNair's stupendous proposal, which happens to be the
most money ever offered strictly for the ownership of a sports team
in North America. No team anywhere has sold for that much, by the
way.
</P>
<P>
   They debated and debated and debated, ad nauseam. Cripes,
fellas, $700 million. That's more than a pound of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there apparently was no decision made per se,
although it remains hard to imagine how that could be construed as
bad news for Houston. The expansion committee members should sleep
like babies on what they've heard. They should be deliriously happy
to wake up today, pinch themselves, then rush downstairs and shout
it from the rooftops to the full membership: Houston is ready to go
and, therefore, the only way to go.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, for his part, said the finish line ``was getting
closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, whether 24 of the 31 existing owners will buy into the
program remains to be seen. Hidden agendas lurk everywhere. Adams,
for one, remains a skeptic. He understands the consequences of
formally opposing his hometown, hence he's saying privately he's
against expansion because there aren't enough good quarterbacks to
go around.
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there was a time McNair said he wouldn't spend a nickel
more than $400 million for the privilege of becoming a member of
one of the world's most exclusive and expensive fraternities. But
he's a determined fellow and, as the chances of his winning the
right to own the NFL's 32nd franchise increased, he decided to
throw caution _ plus a significant percentage of his personal
fortune _ to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   It seems safe to say that, based on what we've seen to date,
nobody in my profession will feel any need to call McNair ``Bottom
Line Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all he and his partners, up to 24 in number, will be
doing is exchanging cash for equity in what smart people say is a
slam-dunk investment. As big as the NFL has become, it will only
get bigger _ i.e., richer _ as the U.S. economy expands.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the man likes football. When Dexter Manley, the former
Redskin, asked McNair at the Houston Touchdown Club luncheon last
week how passionate he was about the game, Bob replied: ``On a
scale of one to 10, I'm a 10.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was referring just to the sports spectacle, not the
endless back-room wrangling, the unsavory aspect of trying to make
his dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regarding the business part,'' he said, ``I'm about a one.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair has spent $7 million and 18 all-consuming months
attempting to close the deal. Another three hours squandered
Tuesday night was no great loss given what has been expended, but
his impatience with the process has begun to show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to bring this thing to a conclusion,'' he said the
other day. ``We've about talked it to death. We all need to get on
with our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 7:30 p.m., a couple of hours after the meeting
began, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello wandered through the waiting area
outside the room where the 14 owners on the committee, commissioner
Paul Tagliabue and assorted other NFL poo-bahs huddled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making good progress,'' he replied, smiling a
politically correct smile.
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes later, McNair emerged from an open elevator _
causing momentary minicam pandemonium _ and disappeared into the
inner sanctum. At that point, the official wait for a puff of white
smoke began. It wasn't forthcoming, but it should be. Another NFL
spokesman, Joe Browne, indicated a recommendation being made is a
virtual certainty.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m. today, the expansion committee reconvenes. At 8 a.m.,
it takes its decision to the full membership. McNair expects
several more hours of heated conversation before the voting begins,
but he says he's ``cautiously optimistic'' there will be a vote and
also that he will pass muster. In his mind, he has left nary a
``t'' uncrossed nor an ``i'' undotted.
</P>
<P>
   The myriad Los Angeles groups, in turn, barely have begun to
compose a coherent sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you worry. Seven hundred million bucks won't buy what it
used to.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ This is why they brought him back. For days like this.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had been here in each of the past two seasons,
stepping into the early part of October as if it were later in the
month and the threshold of the playoffs was the doorway to a
haunted house.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 against the Braves and again in 1998 against the Padres,
they seemed to walk so gingerly, so quietly, even timidly.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti does nothing quietly. Or timidly.
</P>
<P>
   He is all bulging muscles and pent-up energy, practically
bursting through his skin. He is elbows and knees and bowed neck
running straight forward, almost a fullback at third, and you might
knock him down, but you won't keep him down.
</P>
<P>
   This is why they brought him back. For situations like this.
</P>
<P>
   It was the top of the ninth inning, and an afternoon when the
Astros struggled to manufacture runs was turning into an evening
when you wondered if they would let the end of the rope slip
through their hands again.
</P>
<P>
   Then Caminiti turned on a pitch from Atlanta reliever Mike
Remlinger, and it was like a dam broke in the Astros' dugout and a
short time later inside their clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti's tracer bullet over the wall in deep left-center field
was not the winning hit in the Astros' 6-1 victory Tuesday. But the
three-run homer was the blow that eased all of the tension and just
might turn out to be the jab in the ribs this team needs to stop
worrying about what happened in the past and concentrate on making
things happen in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds had given the Astros the kind of gutty pitching
effort they needed right out of the box at Turner Field, working
six innings and giving up just one run. And rookie Daryle Ward
already had given Reynolds the slimmest of edges that he needed to
hold on with his first-pitch long ball off Greg Maddux to open the
sixth inning. And Doug Henry already had given manager Larry
Dierker a sparkling 1 innings of setup work before handing the ball
over to the Human Blowtorch, Billy Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was a difference between the Astros of the past two
years in the postseason, if there was a palpable feeling of change
in the air, it was there because Caminiti provided it.
</P>
<P>
   This is why they brought him back. To reach base four times in
five plate appearances, with a walk and two singles preceding his
homer. To have himself right in the middle of the action all
through the game, from the moment in the third inning when he was
caught off third in an aborted suicide-squeeze attempt with
Reynolds at the plate to a spot in the fifth when Atlanta manager
Bobby Cox intentionally walked Carl Everett to load the bases with
one out and he suffered through a miserable at-bat and bounced into
a rally-killing double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy with the way either of those plays turned
out,'' Caminiti said. ``But once they're over, that's just it.
They're over. You don't think about it or let it eat at you. You
try to do something the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the spirit Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio virtually
begged general manager Gerry Hunsicker and team owner Drayton
McLane Jr. to bring back when they campaigned hard for Caminiti in
the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig and I both wanted to play with Cammy again,'' Bagwell
said. ``First off, when he's healthy, he's one of the best players
in baseball. Second, he brings a kind of, well, fire.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the heat of a blast furnace, a roaring inferno that has
nothing to do with fancy speeches or locker-room pep talks, but
everything to do with how he plays the game. You remember the
painful images of him going 2-for-14 for the Padres in last year's
World Series sweep, falling to the ground on almost every missed
swing. But you also remember how he kept getting back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the part of Caminiti that we missed for several
years,'' Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the part they missed for 79 games this season while he
nursed an aching calf, and the part that has steadily rounded into
form since early September as he hit better than .300 and drove in
key runs down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference this year is the way Caminiti and Everett and
Ward have been able to give the Astros punch from the left side of
the plate. That had been a hole in their attack.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the ninth, he turned around to the right side and tagged
Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think anything when I first hit it,'' Caminiti
said. ``I was too busy trying to run the bases. It was a line
drive, and I didn't know it was going out. Then I got around first
base, looked up and saw it bouncing back onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `That's cool.'''
</P>
<P>
   So it's 1-0 Astros with an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   This is why they brought him back.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ You win a playoff series like this.
</P>
<P>
   You get more than you might have expected out of starter Shane
Reynolds. You beat the other team's ace. You get a clutch home run
from the phenom, Daryle Ward, and you get what you paid for from
Ken Caminiti _ a 3-for-4 day with a towering, clinching bomb in the
ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   You play an all-around loose, confident, smart game like maybe
you hadn't played in the postseason since the days of Mike Scott's
split-finger dancing in the air and Billy Hatcher sending one deep
inside the left-field foul pole in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   And then you hand the ball over to Kid Heat _ Billy Wagner _ and
sit back and enjoy the confused, tormented looks on the faces of
the final three Atlanta Braves batters.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, you get people like relievers Trever
Miller and Doug Henry to redefine their long seasons in a single,
memorable day. You get more than you ever expected from those you
least expected to see come up clutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was big, big, big,'' said Henry, speaking as much on a
personal level as for what it means to the team. ``It was important
to me that they showed so much faith in what I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, if the Astros go on to take this series from the
National League's team of the decade, they should remember the
performances of Miller and Henry on Tuesday as the spark to it all.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Henry were ``setup men'' in more ways than one,
pitching two clutch and perfect innings in what would be a 6-1
Astros win at Turner Field, and perfectly setting up the pitching
staff for the rest of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, middle relief more than anything else was what
had the Astros coming into this Division Series as underdogs
against the mighty Braves. The Astros knew they probably could
count on 20-game winners Mike Hampton and Jose Lima to go seven or
eight innings. They knew they had a chance in those games if it
ever came down to a close lead in the late innings and it all could
be handed over to the reliable Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   But what they didn't know was how they could handle a game like
Tuesday's, when starter Shane Reynolds went six strong innings and
was protecting a slim 2-1 lead, but then middle relief had to be
counted on until the game went to Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the rest of this series has been set up for the Astros,
after manager Larry Dierker turned to these often-embattled setup
men and Miller and Henry came through with the postseason
performances of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Miller came into the game with a 5.07 ERA but was pitching well
late in the year and even lowered his ERA nearly a full point in
September. Henry, who missed two months of the season after
undergoing elbow surgery, entered as the pen's great unknown. He
had a 2-3 record and a 4.65 ERA, as much capable of blowing a lead
as setting down the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've pitched like they did today off and on all year,''
Wagner said of Miller and Henry. ``Today, they won the game right
there (in the seventh and eighth innings).''
</P>
<P>
   Said Astros slugger Jeff Bagwell: ``What they did was huge.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros win this series, you might even call it a decisive
first blow.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Henry set down six consecutive batters in the seventh
and eighth innings, including a marvelous eight-pitch assault by
Henry in the eighth against the Braves' heavy-hitting Chipper
Jones, Ryan Klesko and Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   By coming up with those great efforts, Miller and Henry set up
the Astros for something they haven't ever had against the Braves:
an edge in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   It might also have set up this series how the Astros had hoped
it would go, considering Lima and Hampton are up next in the
rotation and the odds favor them taking their games into the late
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (Lima and Hampton) do what they've been doing all
year,'' Miller said, ``we'll be in great shape. I'd say we're in
the driver's seat right now, but it's a long way from over.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pen appears to be in this thing for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's and Henry's setup performances gave Dierker the luxury
of not having to pitch the more consistent middle-relief arms of
Jay Powell and Jose Cabrera. It also allowed Wagner to remain
available for today's 3 p.m. game if necessary because he pitched
just one inning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Former starter Chris Holt also did not have to be used out of
the pen, and Scott Elarton, who could be used as a long reliever or
perhaps a starter for Game 4, also remains available.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a great feeling going into (the rest of the
series),'' Bagwell said. ``Our backs aren't against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, lots of arms remain fresh.
</P>

L.A. NFL BID LOOKS BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That NFL expansion momentum that swung to Los Angeles,
away and then back again, may have finally left for good Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL expansion committee met for three hours in a downtown
hotel here, and although they aren't expected to make a formal
recommendation until this morning prior to the full owners'
meeting, Houston seems to have taken control with a huge franchise
offer.
</P>
<P>
   NFL executive vice president of communications Joe Browne said
the expansion committee summoned Houston's Bob McNair to answer
specific questions about his organizational structure and
financing. They had already been wowed by his reported $700million
franchise offer and were getting down to the details.
</P>
<P>
   But Browne said Michael Ovitz spoke to the committee because he
wanted to stress the importance of the 32nd franchise coming to Los
Angeles, a notion that appears overshadowed by McNair's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least Ovitz was allowed to speak to the owners. Ed
Roski Jr. was left waiting in his hotel room, never even being
asked to speak to the owners, as Roski said he had been told he
would be prior to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Only a confident McNair made himself available to the media
afterward, which seemed telling in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about our chances,'' McNair said. ``I'm cautiously
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based upon the information I've seen in terms of the various
proposals, certainly prudence and good judgment would indicate the
situations ought to be for Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz had promised last week when he and partner Ron Burkle
assumed the sales option on the nearly 100 acres at Hollywood Park
that he would return to Los Angeles with the next NFL franchise.
</P>
<P>
   With a bid that was believed to be at least $150 million less
than Houston's, it may take an unexpected move by the Ovitz team
this morning to head off a recommendation for Houston. Ovitz did
not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the owners are not going to rule anything completely
out until they must.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of you who are experienced in negotiations such as this
know that anything can happen right up to when that 9 a.m. meeting
starts,'' Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion committee will meet first an hour earlier, and
Browne said a vote is expected to be taken and a recommendation
made for the next franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be a recommendation made (today),'' Browne
said. ``What happens after that in terms of the other 17 clubs, I'm
not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   It only takes a majority vote of the 14-member expansion
committee to recommend the next franchise, but 24 of the 31 owners
must give final approval.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL was keeping Ovitz and Los Angeles in the expansion
game only to push the Houston bid up, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   McNair and Ovitz had been invited to the meetings to address the
committee. Roski tried to crash the party but could not quite get
in the door. He met with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and committee
co-chairmen Jerry Richardson and Bob Kraft for 1{ hours earlier in
the afternoon and said he was told he would be given an opportunity
to speak to the committee that night.
</P>
<P>
   Roski and partner Eli Broad entered a bid of $500million _
$50million less than Broad's offer in August _ and $25million in
earnest money (the same offer previously made by Ovitz). The
proposal included $100million in bonds to be repaid by tax
increments generated by the renovated stadium and a $150million
loan from the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Roski and Broad had also questioned the wisdom of building a
stadium at Hollywood Park, which reportedly irked Ovitz. Roski was
predicting massive traffic jams in Inglewood if the franchise was
awarded to Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it can be done there, personally,'' Roski said.
</P>
<P>
   Roski denied he and Broad were undermining the entire Los
Angeles effort with criticisms of Hollywood Park and confusing
owners by still trying to present dual area offers.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said Tagliabue would meet again this morning with Roski
prior to the expansion committee meeting because, ``Ed wants to see
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners were not offering any public comment. All owners,
Tagliabue and Ovitz, slipped out a back door to avoid the media
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no back doors, only a number of front doors,'' Browne
said.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion committee had all the final numbers from each
would-be ownership group and was no doubt prepared to vote Tuesday.
But Browne said they didn't want the rest of the owners to have to
learn about their decision second-hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cleaner to do it (today), so you walk right into the room
and not have it fueling around for several hours,'' he said. ``To
go in and be the first ones to tell the other 17 owners, rather
than have the owners read about it in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he can wait one more day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real good about our chances,'' he said. ``Of course, I
felt good about our chances all along. I think we have a very sound
proposal. There are no holes in it. I think it's becoming apparent
to everyone it is solid and we're ready to go. Houston is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he had not seen the Ovitz proposal but was generally
aware of its contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it compares to what we're doing,'' he said.

INJURIES AND EXITS HAVE REWORKED THE NFL LANDSCAPE
</HEADLINE>
 REPORT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four weeks into the 1999 NFL season this much is already
certain: What was in vogue in 1998 has gone out of style like a bad
B-movie in 1999. At the top of the list are running backs,
quarterbacks, and dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis, Jamal Anderson, Garrison Hearst and Barry Sanders
were the top four rushers in 1998, combining for 6,915 yards and 46
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders retired before the 1999 season. Hearst broke his leg
in the 49ers playoff game last January and complications with blood
circulation might keep him out all of this season. Anderson tore up
his knee against the Cowboys in Week 2 and is out for the year.
Davis tore up his knee against the Jets last weekend and is also
done for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is the saddest day in franchise
history,'' Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said after Davis was injured,
but, ``I can think of three Super Bowls (losses) that were sadder
than this.''
</P>
<P>
   The run of injuries and unusual circumstances to Davis and other
great backs from 1998 has opened the door for new talent to emerge
at the running back position in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The league's leading rusher is Washington's Stephen Davis (400
yards, nine TDs), whose infamous claim to fame before this year was
that teammate Michael Westbrook sucker-punched him a few seasons
back.
</P>
<P>
   Second is Carolina's Tim Biakabutuka (366). He has been
injury-prone for much of his four seasons, but in a rotation with
Fred Lane, Biakabutuka has ripped off three touchdown runs longer
than 60 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Errict Rhett, who was run out of Tampa Bay, and who
began this year as a backup to Priest Holmes, is third in rushing
with 350 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' Curtis Martin is the only familiar face among the top
four rushers, with 305 yards on 79 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterbacks who made things happen in 1998 are also out of
style in 1999. John Elway has retired. Chris Chandler has a bad
hamstring. Vinny Testaverde is out for the season. And Steve Young
is out with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new stars, one could say, are out of this world, or
from at least out of the country. Kurt Warner and Jon Kitna had
meager beginnings in NFL Europe. But both have come on to lead
their clubs to surprising starts. Warner, of St. Louis, leads the
league with a 125.0 passer rating. Kitna, of Seattle, has a passer
rating of 93.8.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Johnson couldn't get his job back in Minnesota last season
after an injury. The Vikings traded him to Washington, and all he
has done is throw for 1,191 yards, a league-high nine touchdowns
and no interceptions. Tennessee's Neil O'Donnell and Oakland's Rich
Gannon are other quarterbacks who were run off from their previous
clubs, but have responded this year with 90-plus passer ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the elite at quarterback and running back has had
a direct effect on the change among the elite teams. Denver and
Atlanta, the Super Bowl teams from a year ago, have struggled
without their stars and are a combined 0-8. Meanwhile, perennial
losers Seattle and St. Louis have capitalized on the play of their
quarterbacks and are a combined 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to have to stop taking us for granted and
start preparing and getting ready to play a good team,'' Warner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Parity, in fact, has spread all over the league. Of the six
division winners from last season, only the Cowboys and Jaguars
lead their divisions this season. Four of the division winners from
1998 _ Jets, Broncos, Falcons, and Vikings _ are currently in last
place or share last place in their respective divisions.
</P>
<P>
   So through the first quarter of the last NFL season of the 1990s
presses on, the only certainty is uncertainty. At this point,
Redskins-Titans Super Bowl should not surprise anyone.
</P>
<P>
   THE FIRST QUARTER REPORT THE CONTENDERS Team Record Comment Packers
2-1 Best offense, defense combination Cowboys 3-0 Offense is good
enough to win a Super Bowl Bills 3-1 Bruce Smith and company have
one more Super Bowl run left Jaguars 3-1 Defense finally playing
well Vikings 2-2 Offense will start to play better, and watch out
when it does
THE PRETENDERS Team Record Comment Redskins 3-1 Best offense in
league, but defense will cost some games Rams 3-0 Teams they've
defeated are a combined 2-10 Titans 3-1 Not enough clutch players
on the roster Seahawks 3-1 Will make playoffs because of bad
division, but won't get far Dolphins 2-1 Fish are in trouble as
long as Jimmy has to play aging Marino
</P>
<P>
   FIRST-QUARTER GAINS The NFL players whose stock is climbing
after the first four games of the season: RB Stephen Davis,
Redskins: Beaten up by teammate a few years back, beating up the
league now. QB Kurt Warner, Rams: Former NFL Europe player was
working at YMCA before Rams came calling. RB Tim Biakabutuka,
Panthers: Already has 366 yards rushing. Best previous output was
427 in 1998. DE Greg Ellis, Cowboys: Longest scoring play is 98
yards, or, 29 yards longer than Randy Moss's. RB Edgerrin James,
Colts: So, the Colts knew what they were doing when they picked
James over Ricky Williams
FIRST-QUARTER LOSSES Four of the six division winners from 1998 are
in last place through the first four weeks, including: Division
Team Record-Comment NFC Central Minnesota 2-2 Offense, Moss both
slow out of the gate NFC West Atlanta 0-4 Is loss to Ravens the low
point? AFC East Jets 1-3 So far, it's been a big pain for Parcells
AFC West Broncos 0-4 Has any team ever fallen so far so fast?

EASLEY GETS INTO LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels do not need to be
reminded of their old mistakes, not with all of the embarrassing
new ones they made during the ugly 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   But an old one will haunt nonetheless Friday when Long Beach
City College inducts former Angels second baseman Damion Easley
into its Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, Easley is best remembered for helping Lakewood High
to the 1987 String not found, STYL STYL.INL, PC 38B6
</P>
<P>
   12 LNs CIF 4-A baseball title and then taking the Viking
baseball team to the 1989 Southern California regional championship
title game against Cerritos. Easley hit .320 as the team MVP that
season, leading the team in home runs (8) and stolen bases (10) and
being a second-team all-state selection.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, Easley is an important part of the Tigers' nucleus
of talented players, which they hope will help the team contend for
postseason play. He's had three stout seasons since arriving,
hitting .264 with 22 homers, 72 RBI and 28 steals in 1997 and
earning a 1998 A.L. All-Star berth with a .271 average, 27 homers
and 100 RBI. He finished 1999 with 20 homers, 65 RBI, and a career
low eight errors.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim years? Easley and the Angels are still trying to
figure out exactly what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Easley was a 30th round draft-and-follow pick by the Angels in
the 1988 amateur draft. The club closely watched his progress at
LBCC in 1989, and as soon as his season ended, signed him and put
him on a fast track to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' gain was Dave Snow's loss. Easley had signed a
letter to play for the 49ers, but decided to turn pro when the
Angels offered a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Easley was ecstatic over the opportunity to play professionally
for a team in his backyard. ``I grew up a diehard baseball fan,''
said Easley. ``When I was at Lakewood, it was my dream to play in
the major leagues. I didn't know how I would get there, but it was
a goal. And I was never afraid of hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley made steady progress each step of the minors, hitting in
the .270 to .290 range with speed (20-plus steals each season) and
better-than-average power for a second baseman. In the second half
of 1992, the Angels recalled him from Edmonton and worked him into
the lineup as a replacement for Luis Sojo.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for whatever curse there is on the Angels to
also work on Easley. He was hitting a robust .313 in 1993 when he
was forced out of the lineup with painful shin splints. He went on
the disabled list twice and missed the last two months of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he was bothered by a sore shoulder that led to a DL
stint, and he finished the strike-shortened season hitting .215.
The shoulder and a injury bothered him in 1995, and he hit .216.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally reached my dream of being in the major leagues, and
then it was injury after injury,'' Easley said. ``During that time,
I felt a lot of frustration and self-doubt about what I could
achieve. I knew I had talent, but mentally, I was struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start to question everything. Was I doing this right? Did
I belong here?''
</P>
<P>
   In the majors, yes. With the Angels, maybe not. He was hitting a
meager .156 in 1996 when the Angels traded him to Detroit for
pitcher Greg Gohr, whose Angels career would eventually encompass
one game.
</P>
<P>
   Easley's career took off once he landed in Detroit. He hit .343
for the balance of the season and became the Tigers regular second
baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird,'' Easley said. ``I've been asked what was
different a thousand times, and really, there wasn't anything. I
liked being with the Angels. I learned a lot about hitting from
(coach) Rod Carew. I guess it was just bad timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got away from the Angels, it did feel like a fresh
start. I didn't know a soul (on the Tigers), not a single player or
coach. Maybe that's what I needed, a chance to get away from home
and grow up mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been physical growth, too. At the invitation of Tigers
first baseman Tony Clark, Easley trained with Clark and a weight
trainer during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony once had injury problems like I did, and he said a
trainer helped him get stronger and stay healthier,'' Easley said.
``I felt it couldn't hurt. There wasn't anything drastic about it.
It was a matter of being dedicated to get into the weight room.''
</P>
<P>
   The added strength allowed Easley to start pulling the ball
more, a sensible idea since Tigers Stadium was a power hitting
park. Easley posted the best 1997 power numbers of all major league
second baseman, and became only the fourth Tiger with a 20/20
season (20 homers, 20 steals).
</P>
<P>
   He also worked with a therapist on visualization, a
mental-confidence tool that asks the player envision hitting
against someone like Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mentally put yourself right in the moment and make it as
lifelike as you can you see the pitcher, you feel like you're in
the batter's box, and see yourself hitting the ball hard,'' Easley
said. ``It's a sense of being there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you visualize getting a hit off Clemens, then you're better
prepared when you do face him. It's helped me refine my skills. I
worked hard to be a success with the Angels, but a lot of my
improvement with the Tigers has been through the mental side.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley is honored and humbled to be inducted into the Vikings
Hall of Fame. ``I try not to gloat or ever get too high on what
I've accomplished,'' he said. ``That's usually when you start
falling on your face.''
</P>
<P>
   He credits his coaches for much of his success. Lakewood coach
Spud O'Neill encouraged him to keep playing, saying he had the
talent if he took the time to refine it. And Ken Gaylord, his
Vikings baseball coach who is now the baseball coach at Cerritos,
demanded all of his players learn and perfect the little things in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted us to know how to bunt, how to hit and run, when to
hit and run,'' said Easley. ``I didn't realize how much he taught
me about baseball until I got into the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (LBCC) memory that sticks out wasn't even a victory. We
were playing Cerritos for a state-title berth, and we had to win
one of two games. I had a very sore strained quad; any other game,
I wouldn't have played. But I played every inning of both games,
both losses, and we were really routed in that second game.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as it hurt to lose, I was proud that I left everything
I had on the field.''

HAS BENJAMIN CHANGED HIS TUNE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Charles Scarlett arose at 6 o'clock one morning
last month and was surprised to find his house guest already up and
pacing restlessly, ducking through doorways as a 7-footer must.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit, is that you?
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I couldn't sleep all night,' '' Scarlett recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Benjamin had learned the day before that the Los Angeles
Lakers wanted to sign him, and even though only part of the $1
million in the one-year contract would be guaranteed, the center
who'd played 24 NBA games the past three years was elated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy to have this opportunity to play with the
Lakers,'' he said that morning at Scarlett's Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   Scarlett is a retired Los Angeles Superior Court judge who
befriended Benjamin through common acquaintances in his Clippers
days, and has become his unofficial adopted father. Benoit calls
Charles Scarlett ``Dad'' and Charmaine Scarlett ``Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to work hard (with the Lakers),'' Scarlett
said on the phone this week. ``I don't think he's going to let
anybody down.''
</P>
<P>
   So goes the latest story about Benoit Benjamin and why this time
will be different.
</P>
<P>
   Until you hear from Scarlett, you wonder why the Lakers are
taking even the smallest chance on Benjamin, the chronic screwup
best remembered in Los Angeles for bringing two left shoes to a
Clippers exhibition game in 1986 and for flashing an obscene
gesture at a booing Sports Arena crowd upon his first return to
town with the Seattle SuperSonics following a 1991 trade.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder if 7-foot backup centers are so hard to find that the
Lakers are willing to dredge up a living relic of one of the worst
deals in recent franchise history, the 1993 trade that brought
Benjamin back from Seattle along with guard Doug Christie in
exchange for forward Sam Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Lakers sign Benjamin on Sept.29 because they envision
him surviving the cutdowns from 19 players in training camp to the
12-man regular-season roster, or because Shaquille O'Neal needs a
big man to bang on in practice?
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who remembers Benjamin's five-plus seasons as the
quintessential Clipper and his 28-game stay with the Lakers has to
be skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say this,'' said A.C. Green, the Showtime forward who
returned in the offseason, the only player in camp who was with the
team when Benjamin was a Laker in 1993. ``Benoit has changed. He's
different than he was the last time he was here ... according to
what Benoit's been telling me all morning long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope,'' Green said, ``his perception of the game and his
priorities have changed. We'll find out in training camp, for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in shape mentally and physically,'' Benjamin said. ``This
is a better Benoit now. I just hope and pray they (fans) will give
me a second chance. Everybody deserves a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The bald man wearing uniform No. 00 in Santa Barbara this week
is like the spit take, the banana peel and the one about the
bartender and the horse. A bad joke that never gets old.
</P>
<P>
   It's 14 years since Benoit Benjamin, an only child reared
primarily by his mother and grandmother in small-town Louisiana,
left Creighton as the third pick in the NBA draft and reported to
Clippers training camp wide-eyed, innocent and unprepared for pro
basketball's hard knocks.
</P>
<P>
   He played a few great games. More often he'd lose confidence in
the early minutes and sulk through the night. And he couldn't take
the boos. He said this week that the night he flipped off the fans,
``I was scared to be back in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles became an even scarier place when a Louisiana friend
was slain after witnessing a shooting in a liquor store. Benjamin
avoided the city and the bad memories for five years before
returning to live with the Scarletts while working out with other
NBA players at UCLA this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Has he grown up?
</P>
<P>
   His adopted dad says yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dedicated and hungry now, because of the maturity of
years and the fact he's had some financial reversals over the last
few years,'' said Scarlett, who said Benjamin was ``too trusting''
with the people who handled the millions of dollars he earned.
``And I think one of the things he understands is that he's been
given basically the last opportunity to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't do well, it won't be for lack of effort. I have
never seen anybody that's as focused as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin does look in good shape. He said he's been running for
six months while waiting for an NBA club to call. He said he wants
to win an NBA championship before he goes and thinks this could be
the year.
</P>
<P>
   But if he makes the Lakers, this will mark his ninth NBA stop,
not to mention the part-seasons he spent in Greece and with Yakima
of the Continental Basketball Association. He made the same
promises in all of those places.
</P>
<P>
   So Benoit Benjamin remains a mystery wrapped in an enigma
wrapped in a ``Tonight Show'' monologue. The question is whether
he'll get the ring before the fans get the finger.

NEW HOLLYWOOD PARK OWNERS TELL PLANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The corporate owners of Hollywood Park put a
human face Tuesday on their venture into the California
thoroughbred horse racing business at a meeting with community
leaders, horsemen and the media.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Meeker, chief executive officer of Churchill Downs, the
company which purchased Hollywood Park this past summer, outlined
plans for the track during the lunchtime gathering of 250.
</P>
<P>
   Meeker and other executives promised the company would help
enrich Inglewood and improve racing at the slowly fading track.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects, Hollywood Park is the signature of
Inglewood,'' Meeker said. ``We thought that we could be a major
contributor to the community.... We have a deep and abiding
commitment to the communities we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchill Downs' acquisition of Hollywood Park came less than
one year after Canadian auto-parts magnate Frank Stronach purchased
Santa Anita in Arcadia.
</P>
<P>
   While Stronach has begun to pump several hundred million dollars
into an overall renovation of the Arcadia landmark, Churchill
Downs' immediate plans are a bit more understated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have $15 million to spend over the next couple of years,''
said John Long, chief operating officer for Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   How that money will be spent on capital improvements remains to
be seen, Long said. The track will seek input from owners, horsemen
and patrons before plans are finalized, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park will also invest in Inglewood. The track will
donate $30,000 toward the purchase of Little League uniforms for
1,375 children in surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the company pledged $20,000 to the Inglewood School
District for students at all 13 elementary schools to receive music
training that was curtailed or cut by budget cuts in the 1980s,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, officials promised to hold annual food, clothing and
toy drives for the needy in the community at Thanksgiving and
Christmas.

COULD YOU BE M'S NEW GM? TAKE THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sure, you think you could have generally managed the
Mariners as well as Woody Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Probably true. But the point is to be better than that, isn't
it?
</P>
<P>
   The following multiple-choice test is designed to see if you
have what it takes to be the next Mariners GM, or if you're just
another columnist or radio talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   Answers at the bottom. Get everything right, and you earn an
interview with Mariners president Chuck Armstrong. Get everything
wrong, and you are Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   -- In evaluating the historic tendencies of Mariners pitching:
</P>
<P>
   a) Always look at their records with teams after they leave the
club.
</P>
<P>
   b) Give little credence to the excuse favored by a generation of
hurlers and managers, that the Kingdome was a destroyer of pitching
careers, unless there is evidence provided that the strike zone in
the Guilty Pleasure is different than at the old park.
</P>
<P>
   c) The mathematical solution to how the last two seasons were
squandered can be determined by calculating the ratio of
opportunities given to Bobby Ayala over Derek Lowe, divide by the
number of Cy Young votes this year for ex-Mariners Randy Johnson
and Mike Hampton and subtract the number of players surrendered for
Heathcliff Slocumb, Mike Timlin and Paul Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   d) Realize that no young pitcher in manager Lou Piniella's
tenure has had a sophomore season as good as his debut year, so
don't count on Freddy Garcia, John Halama and Gil Meche being 60
percent of next season's starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   -- To end the whining by Mariners hitters, the fences at the
Guilty Pleasure need to be moved:
</P>
<P>
   a) In 20 feet
</P>
<P>
   b) In 30 feet
</P>
<P>
   c) In to just off the skin of the infield
</P>
<P>
   d) Back 20 feet, just to make them sound more petty and
neurotic.
</P>
<P>
   -- To extend the contract of Ken Griffey Jr., offer him:
</P>
<P>
   a) Nintendo
</P>
<P>
   b) Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   c) His father as manager, his mother as mayor
</P>
<P>
   d) Free agent pitchers Aaron Sele, Mike Jackson and Graeme
Lloyd, free agent first baseman John Olerud, and whatever it takes
to get Kansas City to trade outfielder Johnny Damon.
</P>
<P>
   -- To extend the contract of Alex Rodriguez, offer him:
</P>
<P>
   a) A passionate, short-term relationship with Catherine
Zeta-Jones
</P>
<P>
   b) A ban on doing more dippy radio commercials with Jamie Moyer
</P>
<P>
   c) Boeing
</P>
<P>
   d) A two-year deal at $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- New Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln could help the ballclub most
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) Adopting the nickname ``Hot Rod''
</P>
<P>
   b) Making no further mention of the fact that his entire
qualification for the job is that he is a baseball fan
</P>
<P>
   c) Being as ruthless and unsentimental in directing the
franchise as he is at Nintendo, except when it comes to Edgar
Martinez
</P>
<P>
   d) Buying out all the minority partners and their spouses, so
that ballclub officials don't have to go through 30 e-mails each
morning from the yahoos and their spouses who didn't like last
night's pitching change or stadium bathroom cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
   -- Jay Buhner needs to:
</P>
<P>
   a) Spend an entire offseason in physical therapy hell
</P>
<P>
   b) Ask Griffey if he needs a right fielder in Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   c) Take a pay cut the size of Paraguay's GNP
</P>
<P>
   d) Get a job in the Mariners front office and never be allowed
near a batter's box again.
</P>
<P>
   -- Since Armstrong insists on keeping the pitching-challenged
Piniella, the presumed successor to pitching coach Stan Williams
will not only be the club's fifth in eight years, he must also:
</P>
<P>
   a) Have enjoyed his time as Mike Tyson's PR guy
</P>
<P>
   b) Not be found at a Promise Keepers meeting attended by
Piniella, as was previous office-holder Nardi Contreras
</P>
<P>
   c) Hide Piniella's posters and memorabilia of Norm Charlton
</P>
<P>
   d) Be either Ray Miller, the soon-to-be-fired Baltimore manager
who should have been here for two years had the Mariners made him a
whopper offer in the fall of 1997, or Bryan Price, the club's
well-regarded minor league pitching coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   -- Using the Ex-Mariner Principle of Postseason Elevation, the
1999 baseball champion will be:
</P>
<P>
   a) Arizona, because of Randy Johnson
</P>
<P>
   b) Boston, because of Lowe and Jason Varitek
</P>
<P>
   c) The Yankees, because of Tino Martinez, Jeff Nelson and Allen
Watson
</P>
<P>
   d) Cleveland, because the Indians have more of the best
ex-Mariners than anyone (Omar Vizquel, Mike Jackson, Dave Burba).
</P>
<P>
   The correct answer to all of the above questions is, of course,
d, although partial credit is available for many other choices.
</P>
<P>
   Supplemental essay contest: In 500 words or less, defend the
breaking of a promise to pay stadium cost overruns. Winner gets
high-paying job from Seahawks owner Paul Allen.

WILLIAMS CATCHES FIRE AS TEXAS FOLDS TENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernie Williams glided across center field, his eyes
staring straight into the black night and his mouth opening and
closing while he sprinted after a deep fly ball. Williams grabbed
Juan Gonzalez's blast in right-center and slid across the grass as
he caught it. All the while, Williams looked in control.
</P>
<P>
   The nifty play occurred in the third inning, and it was just the
beginning of Williams dominating the opener of the American League
division series and helping the Yankees destroy the Texas Rangers,
8-0. When the Rangers saw Williams steal a hit from Gonzalez, they
should have known it was going to be another long and frustrating
night.
</P>
<P>
   With Orlando Hernandez stifling the Rangers and Williams rocking
a three-run homer, a two-run double and a run-scoring single, the
Yankees made Tuesday night feel like the 1998 division series or
even the 1996 division series. They did not let the Rangers breathe
again, mostly because Williams did his baseball imitation of
Michael Jordan as the most exciting player on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie is that type of player,'' Darryl Strawberry said.
``He's a complete player. He can do just about anything he wants on
the baseball field. Nobody in here is surprised by what he did.
Bernie has a tendency to step up in the post-season. He's real
quiet, but we know what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Yankees, who signed him to an $87.5million contract
last year. So do the Rangers, who have been pounded by Williams in
the post-season before. Williams stroked three homers against the
Rangers in the playoffs three seasons ago, but he went 0 for 11
last season and then went hitless in his first two at-bats last
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I thought I was going to have a terrible game,''
Williams said. ``I was feeling sleepy and it was kind of cold. All
through batting practice, I was wondering how I was going to get
through it. When they read the lineups and I heard the national
anthem, something happened. I told myself that it was time to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre explained that he was so shaken after his
bench coach, Don Zimmer, was drilled by Chuck Knoblauch's foul
liner in the fifth inning that Williams went up to him and asked,
``Are you with us?'' Torre told Williams that he would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Williams batted, in the bottom of the fifth, he
ripped an 0-2 pitch for a two-run double off Aaron Sele. He
followed that with the three-run blast and then the run-scoring
single. Suddenly, Williams looked to be in complete control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like that lit a fire under him,'' Torre said. ``He was
a different player. That's what happens with Bernie. You never know
what's going to light a fire under him and you can't get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   As Williams strolled into the interview room with an ice pack
covering his left shoulder, he did not look so menacing. He looked
like the studious Williams that the Yankees see in the clubhouse.
But once the game starts, Williams is as electrifying as any Yankee
and as important as any Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   Williams does not like to dwell on being the highest-paid Yankee
ever, but there are definite responsibilities that accompany his
lucrative paycheck. While the Yankees cruised to a World Series
title last year, Williams admitted that he was distracted by the
possibility of becoming a free agent and by some personal issues
that he never disclosed. This season, Williams has no distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the pressure on the field, it's the same,'' Williams
said. ``The easiest part is playing the game. Last year, I had so
many distractions that the three and a half or four hours on the
field were the best part.''

STOOPS HAS TAKEN OKLAHOMA OFFENSE TO NEW HEIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ Steve Spurrier Jr. took more than a passing
moment to decide to join Bob Stoops' new staff at Oklahoma coaching
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He offered me the job in mid-December, and I didn't accept
until Jan. 1,'' Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it was a great opportunity to rid himself of the
behind-the-back whispers of nepotism _ that the only qualification
the young Spurrier had to warrant a position on the staff of a
major power such as Florida was the fact that his father was the
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were certainly strong and to a certain degree
validated,'' Spurrier said candidly.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, something in Stoops' delivery of the job
offer that caused Spurrier hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he had four (receivers) on scholarship, but only
two had played. And they had 20 catches between them,'' remembers
Spurrier, a former Duke receiver who worked with quarterbacks and
receivers at Florida. ``And of those two, one transferred. So I
knew I had to go out and find some people.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. To date, 16 players have at least one catch for the
Sooners, who rank third nationally in passing offense (341.8 yards
per game) heading into Saturday's showdown against Texas at the
Cotton Bowl. And all 16 have recorded career totals in number of
catches. Fifteen _ excluding that lone returning wide receiver,
Jarrail Jackson _ have also recorded career highs in total yardage.
In four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many good receivers we have and completely
surprising when you come into a place where they were
run-oriented,'' said transfer quarterback Josh Heupel.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier's gang includes Jackson, converted quarterback Brandon
Daniels, four redshirt freshmen _ three of whom were recruited as
defensive backs _ and a few running backs and tight ends thrown in
for the good measure of 1,367 yards on 121 receptions and 16
touchdowns. Eight first-year players have combined for 50 of those
catches, for 590 yards and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, quite a change from last year,'' said slotback Daniels,
the Sooners' No. 2 receiver (13 catches, 149 yards) who was the
starting quarterback in last year's game against Texas. ``I think
we have surprised a lot of people that we have guys here who can
catch the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   While many are surprised at the early proficiency of OU's
who-are-those-guys group of receivers, the consensus on the team is
that things can only get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've made some pretty good strides this year,'' said
redshirt freshman Damien Mackey, one of those converted defensive
backs who has 13 receptions for 119 yards. ``We've got a great
coach in Coach Spurrier, but we've still got a long way to go.
There are a lot of things we still don't understand yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Distribution and a plethora of receivers are keys to the offense
the way coordinator Mike Leach likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to utilize everyone's talent rather than just moving
receivers around formationwise,'' said Leach, who ran the same
offense as coordinator at Kentucky. ``If you throw a bunch of
people at 'em who can do a bunch of different things, that makes it
difficult for the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many linebackers and defensive backs (teams)
can put in, but it's hard for them to put in the best corner-route
covering linebacker and then the best option-route covering
linebacker and then the best run linebacker. But it's easy for us
to customize the offense that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've moved quite a few people in and out so far and we're
still finding out what people can do best, but we have a bunch of
young guys who work really hard and have stepped up. Josh has done
a great job of spreading (receptions) around. It's by design, but
there are times when I've had to lean on that more in the past than
I've had to do with Josh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool Hand'' Heupel, a transfer from Snow Junior College, has
been the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of guys we've had make catches has got to worry
defensive backs,'' said freshman wide receiver Antwone Savage, who
played quarterback last year in high school. ``If we've got five
receivers out, any one of them could catch the ball. It keeps DBs
on their toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Though all is relative considering OU's offensive philosophies
under previous regimes, the left-handed Heupel has already set
school records for passing touchdowns in a season (16) and
single-game records for yards (429), touchdowns (5) and total
offense (410).
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, OU's receivers come into the Texas game seeking
atonement for 10 dropped passes in the 34-30 loss to Notre Dame
last week. Stoops said those drops cost the Sooners at least 130
yards _ not factoring potential yards after the catch and the
potential first downs lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think they're a little embarrassed at the way they
played last week,'' Stoops said. ``I've been pleased overall with
the receivers. But we can still run better routes and we can catch
the ball when we get it near us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our receivers are by-and-large young,'' Heupel said. ``But we
can't have them perform like they're young. We have to have them
perform like upperclassmen. And so far, they've been able to do
that.''

 By DANNY ROBBINS  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Talking to reporters Tuesday before the opening game
of his team's Division Series with the New York Yankees, Texas
Rangers manager Johnny Oates struck an optimistic chord.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is a game of cycles, he said. And while the Yankees had
indeed dominated the Rangers in the teams' two previous Division
Series meetings, perhaps the Rangers' time had come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer in the fact that the worm does turn,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When and where remains to be seen. As Tuesday turned into
Wednesday in the Bronx, the only worms turning at Yankee Stadium
were under its hallowed turf.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the bat and glove of Bernie Williams and the gyrations of
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, the Yankees added to the Rangers'
postseason blues, taking Game 1 of the best-of-five series 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the Yankees and Rangers reprised, at least for
three-plus hours Tuesday, the one-sided ugliness of last season's
Division Series, when New York swept a Texas team that managed to
score only one run and hit .141. The Rangers have lost seven
consecutive Division Series games to the Yankees, a streak going
back to Texas' first postseason appearance in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Rangers collected only two hits, both by Ivan
Rodriguez, in the first and third innings.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Rangers' most deflating moment came in the first
inning, when they failed to score despite putting two runners on
base with one out and their top run-producers, Juan Gonzalez and
Rafael Palmero, coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the offense we throw out there, you're going to score
some runs by accident,'' a frustrated Oates said later. ``We had
some good chances early. When those fizzled, we couldn't get
anything going.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre said his team has been fortunate to
get outstanding starting pitching against the Rangers, beginning
with last year's postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so good offensively,'' he said. ``But it's like
(Boston's) Pedro Martinez (pitching) in the All-Star Game. He
dominated. With pitching, you can control the game. And we've been
very fortunate against this club in that we've pitched well as
starters. It's been pitching. Back when I played, in the dark ages,
it was the same way. Good pitching stops good hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, the Yankees' starter, went eight innings, giving up
only the two Rodriguez hits. Jeff Nelson completed the shutout with
a scoreless ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The batting and fielding star for New York was center fielder
Williams. He had three hits and six RBIs, including a two-run
double in the fifth and a three-run homer in the sixth. He also
made a running, one-handed catch of a drive in the gap by Gonzalez
that would have put the Rangers on the board in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Aaron Sele lasted just five-plus innings,
allowing six hits and walking five, and the Rangers' once-vaunted
middle relief was equally mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   The night started on an upbeat note for the Rangers when their
second batter, Rodriguez, doubled off the right-field wall. Rusty
Greer worked Hernandez for a walk, putting two on with one out and
Gonzalez and Palmeiro coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez fell behind 0-2, worked the count even and then struck
out swinging. With first base open, Hernandez pitched carefully to
Palmeiro and walked him on five pitches, bringing Todd Zeile to the
plate with the bases loaded and two out. Hernandez quickly got
ahead of the Texas third baseman and struck him out.
</P>
<P>
   The third inning followed a similar script for Texas. With one
out, Rodriguez singled and stole second. Greer walked. This time,
Gonzalez sent a drive into the gap in right-center, but Williams
was able to reach it and make a marvelous one-handed catch.
Palmeiro's fly to deep center ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sele struggled with his control early. He settled in for a
while, retiring seven Yankees in one stretch, but then gave up
three straight hits with two out in the fifth as the Yankees scored
two runs and took a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After singles by Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill, Sele got the
count to 0-2 against Williams, the Yankees' cleanup hitter, but
couldn't close out the inning. Williams battled back to 3-2 and
then launched a bases-clearing double over the head of Rangers
center fielder Tom Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Sele came out for the sixth, walked Ricky Ledee on five pitches
and was promptly replaced by Tim Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   After Scott Brosius moved Ledee to second with a sacrifice bunt,
Crabtree struck out Jeter for the second out. At that point, Oates
went to lefthander Mike Venafro to face the heart of the Yankees'
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Venafro got O'Neill to ground to third, but Zeile couldn't come
up with the ball _ E5, 4-0. Next up was Williams, who turned on a
2-1 pitch and deposited it in the right-field seats _ 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie is a special talent and a special person,'' Torre said
later. ``He'd play baseball if they only paid him 10 cents. The
night he had was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored their first run in the second on Ledee's
two-out double. Ledee poked a low, hooking line drive to left that
Greer seemed to judge correctly and then lost at the last instant.
As the ball went through to the fence, Darryl Strawberry scored
from first.
</P>
<P>
   The play raised questions about the readiness of Greer, who
suffered a bruised retina when he was hit by a thrown ball during
batting practice Sept. 13. As a result of the injury, which caused
blurred vision, Greer sat out seven games.

THE LESSON OF GAME 1: NO NEED TO BE AFRAID
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Not only did the Mets win their last three games of
the regular season and force a playoff for the playoffs, not only
did they win the playoff and advance to the post-season, not only
did they defeat the upstart Arizona Diamondbacks in the opening
game of their National League Division Series. As if all of those
deeds weren't sufficient to shut up the doubters and the critics
and the vacillators, the Mets on Tuesday night exposed Randy
Johnson as a myth.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the tall, gangly, stringy-haired fellow wearing the
Diamondbacks white uniform with the turquoise letters and numbers
standing on the mound and throwing left-handed was an impostor, the
Mets did things to Johnson that at the least were sacrilegious. For
their dirty deeds, they probably will be banned in Arizona. If
Johnson knows what's good for him, he would endorse the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, hitters in the National and American leagues
have found Johnson a frightening presence. John Kruk was never the
same after his all-star encounter with Johnson. Larry Walker made a
joke of his all-star appearance against Johnson, figuring that was
better than having the left-handed hitters' tormentor pitch to him
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Many left-handers come down with sudden illnesses on days
Johnson is scheduled to pitch against their teams. Not Rafael
Palmeiro. He readily admits he wants no part of Johnson and asks
for days off when he pitches. Johnson simply is deadly against
left-handed hitters, and left-handers don't like the prospect of
being fooled by Johnson's wicked pitches and winding up dead.
</P>
<P>
   In his career, left-handers have hit a wimpish .186 against
Johnson. This season they hit a laughable .103, getting 9 hits and
striking out 40 times in 83 at-bats. In his career, Johnson has
given up 199 home runs. Left-handers have hit only 10 of that
total. This season he allowed 30 home runs. None was sent over the
fences by a left-handed hitter. No left-handed hitter belted a home
run against Johnson last year either.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the last time one did was a full two years ago when, on
Sept. 23, 1997, Jim Edmonds of Anaheim connected for not just one
home run against Dandy Randy but two home runs. He thus became a
member of one of the most elite clubs in baseball, joining Von
Hayes, Jim Eisenreich, Wally Joyner, Mike Greenwell, Mo Vaughn
(twice), Darren Bragg and Darrin Erstad as left-handed hitters who
have slugged home runs against the left-handed Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But all of those facts and statistics were compiled before the
Mets stood up to Johnson on Tuesday night and showed the league
bully they weren't going to take his guff any more.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' lineup featured only two left-handed batters, John
Olerud in his customary third spot and Robin Ventura in the No. 6
slot, a notch below his position against right-handed pitchers. In
previous confrontations with Johnson, Olerud had failed to hit
safely in five at-bats and Ventura had 6 hits in 34 at-bats for a
.176 average. They were perfect examples of why left-handers would
rather go to the movies when Johnson pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But they accompanied their teammates to the oversized hangar
known as Bank One Ballpark in downtown Phoenix and battered Johnson
for three hits in their first four collective at-bats. Their hits
will not appear on Johnson's record in the future because details
such as hits and strikeouts in post-season games are not routinely
included in a player's statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 50,000 people, including 49,584 fans, witnessed
the rare sights and, under oath, would attest to the turn of
events.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud batted for the first time in the first inning after
Edgardo Alfonzo hit a towering home run to center field and rapped
a single to center. Ventura batted later in the inning, with two on
and two out, and struck out.
</P>
<P>
   When it was Olerud's turn again in the third inning, he
electrified his teammates and stunned the crowd into shocked
silence, crushing a home run into the right field stands for two
more runs and a 3-0 lead. Ventura led off the fourth inning by
lashing a line drive to right for a double. Shawon Dunston's bunt
single moved him to third, putting him in position to score the
fourth run on a squeeze bunt by Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura was not finished. Although he struck out in his time at
bat before the double and again after the double, he went to bat
leading off the ninth and lined a single to right, a hit that
marked the beginning of Johnson's end. The single gave the
left-handed platoon 4 hits in 8 at-bats for .a 500 average, which
looks pretty impressive next to figures like .186 and .103.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Johnson left the game in the ninth inning, Ventura
and Olerud had as many hits against him as the Mets' right-hand
batters collected in 23 at-bats. It was a development of the
magnitude of the news story that man bites dog.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson was still in the game, he displayed a bit of flash
himself with a bat in his hands, lining a double to right field
with one out in the seventh inning and the game tied, 4-4. But his
swing was mightier than his mind. When Tony Womack followed by
lofting a routine fly to left field, Johnson took off for third and
was standing there when Rickey Henderson threw the ball to second
for an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, when Alfonzo stroked a grand slam against
Johnson's replacement, Bobby Chouinard, Johnson was on his way to
his sixth successive post-season defeat. None of the previous five,
however, included a home run and all of those other hits by
left-handed hitters.

ALFONZO BASHES GRAND SLAM IN 9TH FOR METS VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Mets applauded themselves all the way around the
bases, rejoicing that their good karma did not end.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson had walked slowly off the mound toward the dugout
moments before in the ninth inning, his head down, a bit diminished
by what the Mets had done to him. He had loaded the bases full of
Mets, well after he had thrown 125 pitches and, even though third
baseman Matt Williams had made a spectacular play to throw Robin
Ventura out at the plate, Johnson must have known the Diamondbacks
were the latest foil for baseball's newest charmed set.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo, who had blasted a home run to score the Mets'
first run in the game, smashed a 3-1 pitch from Johnson's
replacement, Bobby Chouinard, for a two-out grand slam that gave
the Mets a stunning _ is there any other word for what they do now?
_ 8-4 victory over Arizona in Game 1 of their National League
division series.
</P>
<P>
   The shot sent Alfonzo's teammates on a jogging ovation around
the bases and sent Johnson reeling to his sixth straight
post-season loss.
</P>
<P>
   It almost seemed as if baseball wanted to keep the Mets grounded
after their otherwordly surge into the playoffs. Congratulations on
the wild card, and your reward is facing Randy Johnson, a Cy Young
award candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Johnson twice in a five-game series against a team that
the Mets had lost five of seven games to during the regular season,
when they faced Johnson only once?
</P>
<P>
   Mets Manager Bobby Valentine had juggled his lineup in
anticipation of the meeting, leaving just two left-handed hitters
to face Johnson, who terrorizes them with his long-limbed sidearm
release. Lefties had hit just .103 with no home runs against
Johnson, and lefties had 35 strikeouts in 87 at-bats against him.
</P>
<P>
   So Valentine dropped the lefties Darryl Hamilton and Roger
Cedeno from the lineup and modified the regular group that faces
left-handed pitchers. He inserted Benny Agbayani into the fifth
spot _ trying to offer some protection to Mike Piazza as well _ and
dropped the lefty-hitting Robin Ventura to sixth. John Olerud, the
only other lefty hitter, was in his usual three spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our guys are intimidated by anything,''
Valentine said. ``But he definitely is different from anybody else
in the league right now. And his slider, if he's getting it over
when he's behind in the count, creates a devastating situation
because it's real hard to pull the trigger on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's dominance has remained a regular-season
phenomenon. Since beating the Yankees twice in the 1995 playoffs
when he pitched for Seattle, Johnson has been tepid in playoff
games. So, despite the overwhelming numbers, the awesome aura, it
should not have been a complete surprise that the team that went a
miserable two weeks struggling each time at the plate suddenly
began battering the National League leader in earned run average
and strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo, who hit a home run against Cincinnati on Monday,
launched an 0-2 fastball _ the radar gun said it was 98 miles an
hour, but it was up in the zone _ off the left-center-field facade.
Although the Mets did not score again in the first, the ease with
which they hit him _ Olerud and Piazza both singled _ indicated
that Johnson would not be able to mow down this lineup, even though
he struck out two Mets in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets struck again in the third. Rickey Henderson drew
Johnson's first walk and, after Alfonzo struck out, Olerud came to
the plate. His recent slump _part of the Mets' greater frustrations
_ had sent his batting average dipping below .300 (.298) for the
first time in months. Valentine had said before the game that his
left-handers would have to work just to hang in with Johnson. But
on a 2-2 count, Johnson left another ball up and Olerud blasted it
10 rows deep into right field to give the Mets a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was somehow weirdly appropriate that the Mets, who had turned
baseball upside down in the last five days, had the more dominant
pitcher on the mound for a few innings.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Yoshii has no post-season record in the United States,
and he joked after the Mets eliminated Cincinnati that he thought
maybe he could get a hit off Johnson. Fat chance, but Yoshii was
not cowed by his larger-than-life opponent either. Yoshii had a 5-0
record with three no-decisions in his last eight starts; during
that time, his era was 1.61.
</P>
<P>
   But the Diamondbacks were able to hit Yoshii, and Tony Womack
smacked a triple to the left-field wall in the third. He scored on
a sacrifice fly by Jay Bell to narrow the Mets' lead to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets are not operating by the same laws as the rest of
baseball these days. Johnson was supposed to dominate left-handers,
but the Mets' lefties killed him. Ventura led off the fourth with a
double down the right-field line, and then Shawon Dunston _ a
regular in the left-hander lineup _ singled to move Ventura to
third. Rey Ordonez then bunted, allowing Ventura to score on the
squeeze to give the Mets a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona's thunderous lineup kept the game close for Johnson.
Erubiel Durazo, who became a major leaguer on July 25 and has since
taken hold of the Diamondbacks' first base position, slammed a solo
home run in the fourth to make the score 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   By then Johnson seemed to have had enough of this challenge.
Using his explosive pitches, he began to embarrass the Mets,
sending fastball after fastball whizzing past them. He retired the
side in the fifth and sixth innings, striking out Olerud, Piazza
and Ventura during that span.
</P>
<P>
   When Yoshii gave up a two-run homer to Luis Gonzalez in the
sixth inning, the game was tied at 4-4, and he faced just one more
batter before Dennis Cook came in to relieve him.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of spectacular pitching _ including two complete
games _ Yoshii left the game after 5 1/3 outings having allowed
four runs. It was the most runs he'd allowed, and the fewest
innings he'd pitched since Aug. 8.

 &HT;    Alfonzo puts Mets up 1-0
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix _ A week ago, no one believed in the Mets except
themselves and even that was hardly unanimous. Tuesday night, that
fragile belief took firm root.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Edgardo Alfonzo delivered a grand slam, his second
homer of the night, off reliever Bobby Chouinard with two outs in
the ninth, powering the Mets to a head-shaking 8-4 victory over
Arizona in the first game of the League Division series.
</P>
<P>
   Left for dead late last week, the Mets delivered Randy Johnson
his record sixth consecutive postseason loss, a huge first step
against the Diamondbacks' ace pitcher. The game was played before
49,584, the largest paid crowd ever at Bank One Ballpark and some
509 above listed capacity.
</P>
<P>
   New York loaded the bases off Johnson on two singles and a walk,
the last a four-pitch pass to Melvin Mora, a .161 hitter, to load
the bases. Johnson, who struck out 11, was lifted fores to load the
bases for Chouinard relieved Johnson and while third baseman Matt
Williams save him once with a diving stop to throw out Ventura at
the plate, Alfonzo's slam came five pitches later.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did himself no favors when, after hitting a one-out
double in the seventh and moving the go-ahead run into scoring
position, he lost track of the situation and ran on Tony Womack
weak fly-out to left. Rickey Henderson easily doubled Johnson off
second to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez, whose .336 average placed him second in the
National League, erased a two-run New York lead in the sixth with a
titanic home run off Mets starter Masato Yoshii. After Jay Bell
opened the inning with a single, Gonzalez drove a 1-0 fastball an
estimated 452 feet over the wall in right center, tying the game
4-4 after New York had led throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mets pressured Arizona immediately, the
Diamondbacks stayed within reach. A Tony Womack triple and Jay Bell
sacrifice fly in the third dug into New York's three-run lead and
one inning later, rookie Erubiel Durazo's opposite field homer
closed the gap to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets tormented Johnson in the early going, which was counter
to the way New York's season had gone. This was the same Mets team
that played just .550 baseball (22-18) against left-handed
pitching, opposed to .610 (75-48) against righties.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson had faced the Mets only once in his career, he
had dominated them in a May 30 meeting at Shea Stadium (one run and
five hits over eight innings with 10 strikeouts). And while Johnson
wiped out of the bottom half of New York's order, the top four
spots generated four hits and a walk in the first three innings
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously the toughest guy to face for any left-hander,''
said Mets third baseman Robin Ventura. ``I think for most of it,
you just go up there and take your best hacks and try to get the
bat on it.''
</P>
<P>
   That early success translated to a 4-2 lead after four, most of
the damage created by Mets left-handers. Ventura opened the fourth
with a double and later scored on Rey Ordonez's safety squeeze
bunt.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, it was left-handed John Olerud's turn. With Rickey
Henderson on base, Olerud powered a 2-2 fastball over the fence in
right-center, first postseason home run Johnson had ever given up
to a left-handed batter (in 54 1/3 career innings) and the first to
any left-hander since Anaheim's Jim Edmonds hit two off him Sept.
23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   New York second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo, who put the Mets on
their way past Cincinnati with a first-inning homer Monday night,
pulled the trick again. Johnson, who gave up 30 homers this season,
left an 0-2 fastball over the plate and Alfonzo drove over the
center field wall for an instant 1-0 lead.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR THE METS AND DIAMONDBACKS, MONEY TALKED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating) (jt) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX. Ariz. _ In the span of two weeks, the amazing Mets have
criss-crossed the country in pursuit of a dream. They've traveled
South to the red clay of Georgia, East to Pennsylvania, Midwest to
the plains of Ohio. On Tuesday night, amid Arizona's desert and
cactus, the Mets stunned Randy Johnson and the Arizona
Diamondbacks, 8-4, to take a 1-0 lead in the division series, and
they began yet another chapter of an unlikely journey.
</P>
<P>
   The surging Mets _ the National League's team of yesteryear with
their Brooklyn Dodger-New York Giants roots _ play the expansion
Arizona Diamondbacks in a series which, at first glance, seems like
a fairy tale. One franchise, the Mets, is in its 38th season, and
playing its first post-season game in 11 years. The other, Arizona,
is an expansion franchise which rocketed to the playoffs in only
two years.
</P>
<P>
   In days of old such a rapid turnabout would be hailed as a
tribute to the farm system, knowledge of players. The success of
both of these teams is not cultivation, but deep pockets. I offer
this not as anything new, but as something to sober up the
fairytale. The Mets and the Diamondbacks are a couple rich kids
with everything at their disposal whose benefactors decided, in a
fit of exasperation, that they were going to try to buy themselves
a championship.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Mets, tired of playing in the lengthening
shadow of Yankee Stadium, opened the checkbook and signed Mike
Piazza to a seven-year, $91 million contract last season. This
season they let it all hang out: they brought in the redoubtable
Rickey Henderson; the wise old owl Orel Hershiser, solid Robin
Ventura. When it was over the Mets had spent $71 million.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona lost 97 games last season and finished in last place
under first year-manager Buck Showalter, exiled from New York to
Arizona to manage the expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Diamondbacks, operating under the theory that if
the opposition can't score it can't win, bought the best three
pitchers it could get. The headliner was Randy Johnson, the
mercenary troubadour who pitched with Houston last season and
Seattle before that. They also signed outfielder Steven Finley from
San Diego. At the end of the spree, Arizona had spent $66 million.
These two ``fairytale teams'' were built for quick turnarounds.
Arizona got what it paid for.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a lament for the ``good ol'days'' when players were
homegrown and money didn't matter. Money has always mattered. Now
it seems to matter in a way that obliterates honor and
responsibility to the game. There is a long list of things money
can buy: In sports it includes hard hitting outfielders, hard
throwing pitchers and slick fielding infielders. The saving grace
is the unpredictable timing of human foibles and frailties. Randy
Johnson went through a stretch this season when he lost five
straight starts despite near flawless pitching. Why? Because while
Arizona opponents couldn't hit Johnson, the Diamondbacks couldn't
hit opposing pitching. You can tempt fate, but you can't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the Diamondbacks got the worst of both worlds.
The Mets _ Edgardo Alfonzo in particular _ lighted up Arizona
pitching, and the Diamondbacks couldn't hit the Mets when it
counted. The Diamondback organization is also discovering that,
even with the fat payroll, you can't buy enthusiasm either, not
from fans, not from players. You can't make people ``feel''
baseball before they are ready.
</P>
<P>
   Money has turned the Diamondbacks into winners overnight, but _
mystery of mysteries _ fans aren't falling over themselves to get
to the lavish new ball park. There was a shortfall in attendance
this season. The team's season-ticket base dropped by 9,000 from
1998. Thus, Arizona has the distinction of being the only team in
 &UR; any &LR;  sport to draw fewer spectators as a first place finisher than
it did the previous year after finishing last.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the lost revenue, the owner, Jerry Colangelo, had to
secure another $24 million from team investors recently to cover a
cash shortage. The franchise needed more money to cover operational
costs, including the player payroll. Colangelo said the club
expects to lose nearly $15 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has deep roots in baseball but they are not the same
roots. The Southwest is where baseball comes in spring to thaw out
after a long winter off. Fans here have grown accustomed to
enjoying baseball played in first and second gear, watching the
gradual thaw of arms and legs, observing young prospects on the way
up, veterans squeezing one more season out of a tired body. They
look forward to sending their adopted teams off to their respective
seasons. This manner of generation and regeneration is a
longstanding, Southwest tradition unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the high octane, big league spring-to-fall baseball, with
its false sense of urgency, takes some getting used too.
Diamondback fans do not seem to have made up their minds about this
team, though they clearly like the bells and whistles of winning.
Mets fans, many who made the trip West for these first two games,
are drenched in baseball tradition that goes beyond the team's fat

   Not quite a fairytale, but a lesson all the same. Buying
championships has become the vogue but, as Diamondbacks backers are

well they pitch. It's only a matter of time before they'll be
pitching against you.

   NASSAU-DEFICIT-WOES (New York) _ While other comparable counties

workers. By Steven Greenhouse.

<P>
   PERFUME-MEN (New York) _ For a growing group of young American
men, perfume is not just some musky bottle that their wives put in
their Christmas stockings and expect them to wear on special
evenings out; it is a grooming product used as routinely as
toothpaste, and one that makes a significant statement, just like
choosing whether to wear a leather jacket or a tweed blazer. Men's
fragrance sales are experiencing a dynamic growth. By Leslie
Kaufman.

 EATING VEGGIES CUTS RISK OF STROKE, 14-YEAR STUDY FINDS  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A diet rich in fruits and vegetables can cut your risk of stroke
by nearly a third, scientists are reporting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest long-term studies ever done on diet and
disease gives a strong endorsement to broccoli, orange juice and
other healthy stuff that mothers have been pushing for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the famed Harvard University study of health care
professionals, researchers surveyed 76,000 female registered nurses
over a 14-year period and 39,000 male doctors and other medical
workers for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The results are reported Wednesday in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic finding shows that people who ate at least
five servings of fruits and vegetables a day had 31 percent less
risk of a stroke than those who ate fewer than three helpings a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Each additional serving of a fruit or vegetable delivered about
6 percent less stroke danger, although more than six servings
appeared to provide no extra benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Quantities per serving can be surprisingly modest. Experts
recommend 6-ounce servings of fruit juice, for example, which is
less than a cup, while only a handful of raisins or other dried
fruit is enough to constitute a serving.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans on average eat less than the recommended five
servings a day, and about half of the adult population falls into
the least healthy category, consuming less than three helpings
daily.
</P>
<P>
   No single food item proved to be a magic bullet, but the
researchers did find some fruits and vegetables better stroke
fighters than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrots are good for you,'' said lead author Kaumudi
Joshipura, a Harvard dentist and epidemiologist. ``Potatoes don't
really help, and we didn't find much beneficial effect for peas,
beans and legumes.''
</P>
<P>
   The strongest protective effects against stroke were found for
citrus fruits and juice, leafy greens and vegetables in the cabbage
family, including broccoli, cauliflower, collard greens, brussels
sprouts and bok choy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're bright, they're colorful, and they pack a high
nutritional profile,'' said nutritionist Linda Nebeling at the
National Cancer Institute, which has recommended five or more
servings of fruits and vegetables since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of widespread confusion about just what constitutes a
healthy lifestyle, experts see the new study as welcome
confirmation that at least some traditional dietary advice holds up
under scientific scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   About the only unexpected result was that eating much more than
the recommended number of servings seems to deliver little or no
added benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may just be that six servings a day is the right amount,''
Joshipura said, ``but it's hard to say why.''
</P>
<P>
   The study focused on the risk of suffering what is known as an
ischemic stroke, which accounts for about 80 percent of all strokes
in the United States. They are caused by a blood clot or some other
interruption in the flow of blood to the brain. Inadequate blood
flow causes brain cells to die.
</P>
<P>
   Some strokes have little recognizable effect, while others can
quickly cause death. Stroke kills about 150,000 Americans each year
and is the leading cause of adult disability.
</P>
<P>
   Those surveyed began the study free of cardiovascular disease,
cancer and diabetes. Women were ages 34 to 59 and were tracked from
1980 to 1994, while the men were ages 40 to 75 and were surveyed
starting in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have highlighted various ingredients in vegetables
and fruits that could influence the cardiovascular system,
including phytochemicals, anti-oxidants, potassium, folates and
fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence on any one ingredient's role is inconclusive, prompting
the study's authors to emphasize the role of fruits and vegetables
in their natural form. The study also found that people who
consumed dietary supplements still benefited from frequent visits
to the produce shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Lifestyle and diet patterns were based on what the study
subjects reported in detailed questionnaires. Medical records were
later checked for stroke diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers noted that the study subjects, all health care
professionals, tend to be more health savvy than the general public
and also have fewer socioeconomic differences that could skew
results. This made the finding of a strong ``dose-response''
relationship for diet and cardiovascular health ``particularly
notable,'' the study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The authors took pains to adjust for other known risk factors
for stroke, including smoking, exercise, weight and fat intake. In
all cases, the central finding held true independent of the other
factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the fruits and vegetables that give the protective
effect,'' Joshipura said.
</P>
<P>
   Meat consumption, for example, did not substantially change the
result. But that doesn't mean it's healthful for people to eat
whatever they want as long as they also load up on greens.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dean Ornish, a Sausalito, Calif., physician and the nation's
most prominent champion of low-fat, vegetable-rich diets, saw no
reason to change his tune after reviewing the study in JAMA
Tuesday.

 REAL WINNER LEFT HOLDING THE BAGS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two runners from Kenya arrive in the city just
in time for the start of last Sunday's Bridge-to-Bridge charity
run. They dash to the Ferry Building just as the starting gun is
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Korir takes off, tossing his backpack to pal David
Makori Omiti.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, David takes off, too, carrying both
backpacks loaded with clothing, tickets and passports.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, at Pier 35, David discovers why most serious
runners don't carry two loaded backpacks. He chucks the packs to a
bystander and zooms away.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony wins the 12K race in 36 minutes, 34 seconds. In third
place, two seconds back, is David.
</P>
<P>
   A thousand runners drag home and say, ``I just got smoked by
some guy who was carrying his luggage.''
</P>
<P>
   Were Anthony and David reunited with their backpacks? Yes!
Someone brought the packs to the Red Cross tent, and they were
hustled to the runners' hotel just in time for them to make their
return flight to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Hope you two guys recommend us to all your friends.
</P>
<P>
   THE CANNERY is searching for a new administrative assistant, and
management is impressed by the resume of one man who is not afraid
to dream the dream:
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeking to expand my horizons, looking for a great job that
will allow for the following: Living in a grand, beautiful older
home in a nice neighborhood, relocating expenses provided by
employer, having enough money to own a nice, newer vehicle, and
nice furniture and nice home furnishings, eat well, send home money
to my retired parents, enjoy a nice social life, possibly adopt and
care for one or two children in the future, and time to pursue my
interests of writing novels and gourmet cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Done. And this is San Francisco, so we'll throw in a brace of
love slaves who also do light housekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   FESTOON THE Golden Gate Bridge with this banner, says Lotta
Dotz: ``Welcome to San Francisco, Avg. household income 75K,
jackets &AMP; ties required.''
</P>
<P>
   INTERACTIVE MUNI, indeed. A recent item here told of a Muni
driver on a Giants' ballpark express who asked the passengers'
advice on the best route to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nothing,'' says caller Jane. ``I ride the No. 16
express every morning, and we frequently get drivers who don't know
the route. We're getting used to calling out directions.''
</P>
<P>
   How about if the first driver out in the morning on any given
line leaves a trail of breadcrumbs along the route?
</P>
<P>
   THOSE MAMMOTH tire fires will be a lot less drab, says Wes
Haley, once we start discarding the new tires that come in bright
colors _ red, yellow, etc.
</P>
<P>
   We won't be polluting the sky, but painting it.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S THAT TIME of year again when we Bay Area residents put
aside our own trivial concerns and devote our time to
psychoanalyzing and advising 49er quarterback Steve Young, the
Concussion Kid.
</P>
<P>
   We divide into two camps:
</P>
<P>
   Camp A asks _ begs _ Steve to quit football before he takes one
more good hit upside the head and becomes a handsome, curly-haired
rutabaga.
</P>
<P>
   Camp 2 tells Camp A to mind its own business and stop using
corny phrases like ``upside the head'' and tells Steve to play
football as long as he can remember which extremities his cleats go
on.
</P>
<P>
   Steve is our Punxsutawney Phil. He looks at his medical chart,
and if he sees that everything is still connected, he goes back
into the huddle, and we have four more months of football.
</P>
<P>
   What worries me are Young's TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In one, he's in the car with his fiance, having purchased a
potted plant that he leaves on the roof as he drives off. In
another, he's being picked up by a blind date, evidently having
forgotten that he's engaged to the woman he gardens with, at least
in TV commercials. He tells the blind date he's a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In a third commercial, Steve goes on a wilderness camping trip
with some guy he seems to barely know, and he's watching ``I Love
Lucy'' on TV and ordering pizza at the campsite. I realize the rich
are different from you and me, but this is unusual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In still another, Young furtively picks up hamburgers from a
drive-through, acting as if he believes himself to be a CIA
operative.
</P>
<P>
   What this all says about Steve is that he can't leave football
now. It's his island of sanity.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT, `ROSWELL' COULD BE A HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't take long for TV to carry a workable idea to absurd
lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Teens feel alienated? Then you depict them as idealistic but
paranoid figures in a world corrupted by their elders.
</P>
<P>
   Taken to extremes, that idea metamorphoses into ``Roswell,'' a
teen drama premiering Wednesday night on the WB.
</P>
<P>
   Now the teens are alienated in the sincerest sense. They're
space aliens, and humans are their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The premise toys dangerously with guffaws. Sure enough, an
earthling girl who's smitten with an alien boy delivers this
scripted rock Wednesday night: ``It's just so ironic that when
something like this happened to me, it was with an alien.''
</P>
<P>
   Bummer. Falling for an alien must be the nadir of an Earth
girl's day.
</P>
<P>
   The line is a laugher, in any solar system. Of the worst kind,
too, because the rigidly earnest ``Roswell'' is no ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer.'' Nope _ laugh here and you laugh alone.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Roswell'' somehow works in spite of its party-pooper
seriousness. The show's cast could make it the year's sleeper hit.
</P>
<P>
   Doe-eyed Shiri Appleby, a veteran of not much more than Taco
Bell commercials, is teenager Liz Parker, who works after school at
her parents' diner in the world's flying-saucer capital, Roswell,
N.M..
</P>
<P>
   Appleby has the tandem that can translate into stardom _ a
tablespoon of sexuality stirred into a cup of girl-next-door
innocence. Her character, Liz, is a latter-day Juliet who finds
herself attracted to 16-year-old Max Evans (Jason Behr), an alien
Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   Behr was in six episodes of ``Dawson's Creek'' last season,
meaning that he's supposedly stamped prime rib for the TV teen
market. He has his own high-beam brown eyes and a kind of
smoldering vulnerability that might put someone in mind, however
loosely, of Montgomery Clift (a reference that will make sense only
to alien WB viewers).
</P>
<P>
   The deal is that Max, his sister, Isabel (Katherine Heigl), and
their friend Michael Guerin (Brendan Fehr) are descended from the
aliens who crash-landed in Roswell in 1947. They popped out of pods
years after the crash, which explains why they're teenagers in
1999. They have powers, some of them curative. Liz is drawn into
their secret when Max uses his healing power to save her life.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the alien adolescents are on the run from the Fox
network, because their main fear is that they'll be caught and
autopsied. Fox has autopsied Roswell aliens before. With the
November sweeps approaching, aliens must feel like turkeys the week
before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the kids are afraid they'll be caught and sliced up by
inquisitive earthlings. The immediate threat of apprehension is in
the person of the town sheriff (William Sadler), though a broader
government search enters the picture in next week's episode.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters more interesting, there's mysterious evidence
that at least one other living alien, unknown to the teens, may be
in Roswell. And that alien might not be friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Two other important ``Roswell'' notes:
</P>
<P>
   First, and don't forget this, we learn from Max that ``alien''
could be a derogatory, species-centrist term.
</P>
<P>
   Says Max, ``I prefer the term `not of this earth.'''
</P>
<P>
   Second, although everything else about ``Roswell'' oozes with
credibility, the producers must be taken to task for one blatant,
inexcusable inaccuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Liz tells her best friend, Maria (Majandra Delfino), that her
old boyfriend is ``steady and loyal, and he appreciates me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like you're describing a poodle,'' Maria responds.
</P>
<P>
   No, it doesn't. Steady? Loyal? Appreciative? Now we've got alien
poodles, too?

GAME 2 STARTERS KNOW ABOUT REHABILITATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre, meet  &UR; Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The two have more in common than just their roles as starters
tonight in Game 2 of the NL division series. Both suffered rotator
cuff and labrum tears. They took different routes, however, in
their comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   Mets starter Rogers underwent shoulder surgery in 1996.
Stottlemyre built up his shoulder this summer without surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers admires Stottlemyre's determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as long as a pitcher is never scared to go out there,
even if he knows he's not going to have a whole lot of stuff, to go
out there and try, he's going to have a chance to beat you,''
Rogers said. ``I know that's my approach, and I'm sure that's
his.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre said he didn't bypass surgery to prove how tough he
is. But he said he owed it to  &UR; Jerry Colangelo, Diamondbacks
managing general partner who gave him a four-year, $32 million
contract, to try to come back and contribute this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a miracle, and, medically speaking, if you look
at my shoulder, maybe I shouldn't be pitching,'' Stottlemyre said.
``But I am, and I feel good and my arm feels strong and my mind is
sound, and I'm able to go out there every fifth day and compete as
hard as I can compete.'' &QL; 
No media allowed &QL; 
They wear No. 25 on their caps, but the Diamondbacks weren't
letting &UR; David Dellucci in the clubhouse Tuesday. That's because the
injured outfielder is now technically part of the media.
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci is analyzing the Diamondbacks' playoff run for Channel
12. In the playoffs, media are given no clubhouse access before
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys were giving me heat for it,'' Dellucci said before
Tuesday's game. ``They say, `The media aren't allowed in the
clubhouse.' They told me they were going to clean my locker out
(Monday). They ask me for my credentials every time I go in
there.'' &QL; 
Late show &QL; 
At least one die-hard Diamondbacks fan in Florida stayed up late to
watch Tuesday's game: Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter's mother, Lina.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to have my sister over and make a big bowl of
popcorn and second-guess me just like everyone else,'' Showalter
said. &QL; 
Short hops &QL; 
Showalter received good-luck telegrams from Hall of Famer
 &UR; Reggie &UR; Jackson and New York Jets Coach  &UR; Bill Parcells. Showalter
also received a letter from Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin, wishing
him luck.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks first baseman  &UR; Travis Lee, not on the playoff
roster, went to his parents' home in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Byung-Hyun Kim, also left off the playoff roster, went
to Los Angeles to have dental work done. He'll return to Tucson to
work in the instructional league.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dwight Patterson, the man responsible for bringing pro baseball
to the Valley by finding a spring training home in Mesa for the
Chicago Cubs in 1952, threw out the ceremonial first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The national anthem was sung by (drum roll) . . . the fans. &QL;

VALENTINE: I TOLD YOU SO  
 PLAYOFF PLAN PAYS OFF FOR ROGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - New York Manager  &UR; Bobby Valentine said  &UR; Kenny Rogers
had been acquired in late July so he could pitch for the Mets in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind how Rogers' first postseason stint went in New York,
when the Yankees won the 1996 World Series despite his 14.14 ERA in
four postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the Yankees gave Oakland $5 million to take him away.
Never mind he had struggled this season through elbow tendinitis in
the spring, back spasms in May and hamstring tightness in July.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind _ because it worked out. Rogers, today's Game 2
starter, is 5-1 with a 4.03 ERA since the trade. It was like the
perfect dating-service match. Ground-ball pitcher meets greatest
infield ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time around (in the playoffs), I'm better prepared in a
lot of different ways to being out there and competing,'' said
Rogers, who last saw Arizona as an Athletic with eight innings of
two-hit shutout ball four months ago. ``Before when I went out
there, I was at a disadvantage. I didn't know from each day what I
would have when I toed the rubber. Now, I kind of know what to
expect when I get out there.'' &QL; 
Late night in NYC
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the only people from New York not affected by the 11
p.m. (New York time) starts of the games in Arizona are the Mets,
who rested well after arriving in Phoenix at 1:45 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mets fans are livid at home because the Yankees have prime-time
slots both nights. It's not any better for the New York media
contingent of 38.
</P>
<P>
   Most newspapers are holding the final edition until the game
ends, but those go to only a fraction of the city.`` The New York
Po''st will put out a Mets Extra on a 4 a.m. deadline with hopes
200,000 will sell on the streets. &QL; 
Bad odds
</P>
<P>
   According to the books, this series is a no-brainer. Arizona won
seven of nine against New York this season. New York is a .500 club
against left-handers, which Arizona would use in all but Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody on this team thinks we're a .500 team
when we play against a left-hander,'' Mets third baseman  &UR; Robin
Ventura said. ``Those numbers don't mean a lot once we're here.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Orel ( &UR; Hershiser) &UR; kept reminding everybody of the '88 season
that the Dodgers were pretty much dominated by the Mets and they
were able to beat them in the (National League Championship
Series).'' &QL; 
Long time coming
</P>
<P>
   Mets reliever  &UR; John Franco is experiencing postseason ball for
the first time, just like Arizona fans. He just paid more dues.
</P>
<P>
   The boyhood Mets fan from Brooklyn had gone 15 seasons without
playing in the postseason, the longest stretch of any active major
league player. That's even longer than the Mets, who last played
postseason in 1988. &QL; 
Bonilla over Lopez
</P>
<P>
   Valentine chose outfielder  &UR; Bobby Bonilla, who has been limited
to 60 games by injury, over infielder  &UR; Luis Lopez for the final
playoff-roster spot. Despite Bonilla's .160 clip, Valentine wanted
his switch-hitting power and playoff experience. &QL;

NEW STARTER AT GOALIE GETS SHUTOUT IN HOME OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Before they dropped the puck at America West Arena for
the Coyotes' home opener, they ran a video of highlights from the
team's first three seasons in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Spliced into the mix of hits, goals and celebrations were
occasional shots of the Stanley Cup. And the sounds of U2's ``I
Still'' ``Haven't Found What I'm Looking For''.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true the Coyotes still haven't found their hands
hoisting Lord Stanley's Holy Grail _ or even a way to get out of
the first round of the playoffs _ they've found a way to look
pretty good so far in this young season.
</P>
<P>
   Getting another solid team performance and some great individual
efforts, the Coyotes cooked the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, 4-0,
before an energized crowd of 15,780 for their second straight win
and their best start since moving to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after opening the season with a 2-1 win in St. Louis, the
Coyotes can tie a franchise record for the club's best start in
history with a victory Friday night in Chicago, where they open a
three-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only two games, but they were both really good games for
us to say the least,'' center Jeremy Roenick said. ``We were solid
all around again today.''
</P>
<P>
   What wasn't there to like?
</P>
<P>
   Roenick looked like his old, free-wheeling self, scoring a
shifty goal and adding two assists for a three-point game,
something he accomplished just twice last season. Shane Doan, who
endured a mind-boggling slump to start last season, picked up where
he left off from the postseason by pumping in two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Do-everything forward Mike Sullivan set up two goals with
perfect feeds and played unreal defense. Four different defensemen
picked up an assist by either joining the rush or quarterbacking
counter-attacks, a key element to new Coach Bob Francis' system.
And, once again, goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov was defiant in stopping
21 shots for his seventh career shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have any real good chances to score. It was a
pretty boring game for me, actually,'' said Shtalenkov, who for
that very reason, was not recognized as one of the game's customary
three stars.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Ducks came to scoring was when Matt Cullen went
crashing into the net _ his own _ early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix played a great game in all areas, they outplayed us in
all areas,'' Anaheim Coach Craig Hartsburg said. ``Forechecking.
Throwing in. Playing better in the neutral zone. You name it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Drake started the scoring with a rebound goal off a
Roenick shot midway through the first period. Roenick then made it
2-0 with 7:03 remaining in the period when Sullivan set him up with
a great behind-the-back pass in the neutral zone. Roenick then
faked out defenseman Kevin Haller and deked goalie Guy Hebert to
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those goals don't come along too often, so you have to savor
them when you get them,'' Roenick said. ``That was one of the
better ones I've had in the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of Sullivan's fancy assist?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Gretzky just retired,'' Roenick said. ``Somebody had to
fill the role.''
</P>
<P>
   Doan looked like he had a shade of The Great One in him after
scoring back-to-back goals 4:35 apart in the second period. It was
just the second two-goal game for Doan in his five-year career.
Last season, it took him half the season _ 41 games to be exact _
just to score two goals last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I knew it was a long time,'' Doan said, smiling. ``It
was great just to have an opportunity to get that first one out of
the way.'' &QL;

SCANDALS DON'T ROB IRISH OF MYSTIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It shares the traits of other NBC programming: sex,
embezzlement, cheating and a rash of high-priced lawyers. Welcome
to the new era of Notre Dame football.
</P>
<P>
   No program in the country can match the tradition and mystique
of the Fighting Irish. But a university that was once the moral
measuring stick for its peers is now accused of indiscretions that
it has effectively escaped for 11 decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I've realized at Notre Dame is that there are
always going to be some issues to deal with, and some of greater
magnitude than others,'' Irish Coach Bob Davie said. ``I'm not
trying to minimize it, but one of the things you have to take pride
in as a football coach is to only concentrate on the things you can
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're embarrassed about it, but we can't control the
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie dismissed the suggestion that off-the-field distractions
have contributed to Notre Dame's 2-3 record. Arizona State gets a
first-hand look at the program Saturday when the Sun Devils make
their first-ever trip to Notre Dame Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish are expected to receive word soon on NCAA sanctions
related to academic fraud and gifts players received from a
convicted embezzler and are in danger of being found guilty of
their first major violation in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' Davie said, ``all we want is closure.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest charges come on the heels of an embarrassing
age-discrimination suit won by former assistant football coach Joe
Moore. And in August, the Irish found themselves defending
accusations by Michigan Coach Lloyd Carr that they violated a
gentlemen's agreement by committing to play in the preseason Eddie
Robinson Classic. Carr contends that the schools agreed their Sept.
4 game would be the season opener for both.
</P>
<P>
   Although details of Notre Dame's violations became particularly
numerous this year, their genesis can be traced to the 1993 Cotton
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Kim Dunbar, a then-23-year-old bookkeeper and
secretary, met former Irish receiver Derrick Mayes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of started from there,'' Dunbar said in court
documents. ``I started dating him. And once you kind of meet one of
the football players, it sort of gets into them all.''
</P>
<P>
   A sexual relationship with the 19-year-old receiver began, and
Dunbar paid for gifts and many of their outings. She spent $1,836
for first-class airplane tickets to Las Vegas, according to court
documents, as well as a trip to Kalamazoo, Mich., in a stretch
limousine on Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   When the pair's relationship ended in 1995, Dunbar, then 25,
became involved with defensive back Jarvis Edison, who had not yet
begun his sophomore season. They now have a 3-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dunbar was traveling to most Notre Dame away games
and staying in luxury hotels. When asked how she could afford such
perks, she had an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people thought was that I resold Notre Dame football
tickets and got a lot of money that way,'' she said. ``That's what
I made everybody believe. I mean, even my boss believed that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the truth was that Dunbar was embezzling more than $1
million from her employers and spending some of it on players. She
currently is serving a one-year prison sentence and is expected to
be released Oct. 17. Her mother is raising her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NCAA, the Irish aren't responsible for most of
Dunbar's gifts to Mayes because they took place before she became a
member of the since-disbanded Quarterback Club. Once she joined the
group, which costs just $25, she became a representative of the
university, the NCAA said, and thus the school became responsible
for her actions, which included giving gifts to as many as 12
players.
</P>
<P>
   Just when that episode seemed to be behind the Irish, news of
more infractions came to light.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame acknowledged on Sept. 17 that a part-time tutor had
written a paper for a former athlete. In a statement, the Irish
said the athlete is no longer at Notre Dame and that the tutor was
discharged.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA is now trying to determine whether to incorporate the
possibility of academic fraud into its current evaluation and
determination of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenging time for the university,'' Athletic
Director Mike Wadsworth said. ``To speculate beyond that wouldn't
make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's delay in announcing penalties has Notre Dame fearful
about how that may affect recruiting. Athletes can begin signing
letters of intent in February.
</P>
<P>
   To help quell other rumors, Notre Dame extended Davie's contract
in July for another five years. He took over the program in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the turmoil he inherited, Bob came through it with a
lot of maturity,'' Wadsworth said. ``He has been able to focus on
the job at hand and still have success.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Notre Dame is still Notre Dame. Despite losing three
straight, the Fighting Irish have a mystique unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still there,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said. ``They have a
storied tradition. I notice that every week their attendance is
80,012.
</P>
<P>
   ``That says a lot.''

NEW FORWARDS TO HELP END SUNS' `SOFT' IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - During his three years with the Los Angeles
Lakers, forward Corie Blount said he never heard anybody call the
Suns ``soft'' or knew of players questioning his new team's
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really heard any of that until I got here,'' Blount
said. ``When you've got forwards as talented as Tom Gugliotta and
Cliff Robinson, it's hard to call those guys soft. But the coaches
seem to be putting a lot of emphasis on it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been no secret that the Suns weren't going to beat
anybody with muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to change that,'' said forward Rodney Rogers, who,
along with Blount, brings a new look to the Suns' frontline.
</P>
<P>
   With the trade that brought Penny Hardaway to Phoenix, the Suns
gave up forwards Danny Manning and Pat Garrity. They've added
Rogers, Blount and rookie Shawn Marion, who can swing from small
forward to big guard.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a combination of forwards that allows Coach Danny
Ainge a lot of different looks instead of a lot of players with
similar games, as he had last season.
</P>
<P>
   In all the hoopla over the arrival of Hardaway, the additions of
Rogers, Blount, Marion and center-forward Oliver Miller have been
largely overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got is a lot of guys who can really get up and down
the floor, and with Jason (Kidd) and Penny, they're going to get
you the ball,'' Robinson said. ``I think we're a little more
athletic and tougher around the basket. Tom is a tremendous
rebounder, Corie and Rodney are really good rebounders, and I try
to do what I can do to get a few. We've got some different looks
because Rodney's a big body, and I think Oliver is really going to
be a key coming in and pounding guys around the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Suns can still go small and fast with Marion, a sleek,
long-armed 6-foot-7 finisher who might be the only guy fast enough
to outsprint Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge believes the Suns can play big or small and still put a
group of tough-minded and physical players on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been preaching toughness from the time I got here as a
player,'' Ainge said. ``And I believe as a team we've gone from
being about a four on a toughness scale of 10 to at least a seven
or eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``On every team I've been associated with, there have always
been some guys who were tougher than others. You just hope you get
enough of them to make the whole team tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now as a coach, there's only one thing that bothers me. It
isn't going to bother me if somebody questions whether I know the
game or criticizes my substitutions. But the one thing I can't
stand is having somebody say my team doesn't have toughness. I
don't think anybody can say that about this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount, a 6-10, 242-pounder, has made a career out of defense
and rebounding. He'll bring the kind of rebounding on the offensive
boards that the Suns haven't seen since Charles Barkley played in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take (crap) from anybody,'' Blount said, smiling.
``I'm excited about this team. We've got a great group of guys here
and a lot of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, 6-7 and 255, shares that feeling. He struggled through
his last season with the Clippers, and vowed after signing with the
Suns to get in tip-top shape for his new start in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He hired Marvin Brown, a former Duke football player, to help
him with his conditioning. Brown put Rogers on a sprinter's
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He recruited me for football when I was in high school,'' said
Rogers, who ended up choosing basketball at Wake Forest over
football at Duke. ``I got to know him, and I called him up and told
him, `I'm with a new team. I want to get myself together.' So we
went to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said it involved a lot of track work, running interval
sprints from 100 meters up to 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a different person than last year,'' he said.
``It's not the same as playing basketball, but that will come here
in camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said he hasn't determined yet what role Rogers will fill,
but he's sure it will be integral.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a basketball player,'' Ainge said. ``He can pass, shoot,
dribble, defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been playing mostly outside and occasionally going down
low. I'd like him to play mostly inside and occasionally pop
outside. With Rodney and Corie added to Cliff and Googs, we've got
a lot of versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be a lot tougher inside, more physical and a
better rebounding team. We're going to give up a lot less layups
than we have in the past.''

NEDNEY SIGNED BY RAVENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - It didn't take former Cardinals kicker  &UR; Joe
Nedney long to find another NFL job.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney was claimed on waivers by the Baltimore Ravens on
Tuesday, 24 hours after he was released by the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is outstanding,'' Nedney said. ``I'm excited. I'm
ready to go. This is how the league works: Here one day, gone the
next. ``I'm glad to be among the ranks of the employed. It shows me
that I'm worth something.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedney flew to Baltimore on Tuesday night. He was scheduled to
take a physical examination this morning and practice this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens have been looking for a kicker since  &UR; Matt Stover
missed a 38-yard field goal Sunday at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Coach  &UR; Brian Billick was so upset about the miss, he
was seen on TV cursing Stover.
</P>
<P>
   When Billick called his mother from the team bus after the game,
he was chewed out by her for his language. His wife and 10-year-old
daughter later chastised him.
</P>
<P>
   Stover, who was 6 of 9 on field goals and had only one touchback
in 17 kickoffs, will remain on the team because the Ravens have to
pay him a full year's as a vested veteran. Nedney is expected to
handle the kickoff duties and the long field-goal attempts in the
Ravens game Sunday at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney will be reunited with former Cardinals quarterback
 &UR; Stoney
 &UR; Case and Ravens deep snapper  &UR; Frank Wainwright and punter  &UR; Kyle
 &UR; Richardson, both of whom he played with on the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't surprised he was cut by the Cardinals, who had
two place-kickers the first four weeks of the season. They decided
to keep  &UR; Chris Jacke, who handled the place-kicking duties in the
first four games.
</P>
<P>
   Jacke replaced Nedney last December after Nedney suffered a torn
anterior cruciate ligament of his left (kicking) knee while making
at tackle at Kansas City on Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been preparing for something since the start of the
season,'' Nedney said. ``Actually, I'm glad it's over. I can move
on. &QL; 
Making an impression
</P>
<P>
   With  &UR; Rob Moore a long shot to play this weekend because of a
hamstring injury, the Cardinals might turn to their smallest player
for help at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Cody, listed at 5 feet 11 but actually about 5-7, will get a
chance in practice this week to compete for the No. 3 receiving job
with  &UR; Andy McCullough.
</P>
<P>
   Cody impressed the coaches with 59 punt-return yards, 15
kickoff-return yards and 11 receiving yards in last week's loss to
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him with the ball in his hands,'' Cardinals Coach
 &UR; Vince
 &UR; Tobin said. ``He has ability to make people miss. Sometimes we are
hung up more on size than we should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He catches the ball extremely well, and it's not like he's a
rookie. He was the leading receiver in the Canadian Football League
one year (at Hamilton in 1996). I coached up in that league six
years and know there are quality receivers there. To lead that
league, he has to have something.'' &QL; 
Learning process
</P>
<P>
   Just because the Cardinals placed first-round draft pick  &UR; L.J.
Shelton on the active roster Monday doesn't mean he will see action
Sunday against the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, the offensive tackle from Eastern Michigan, has
practiced only four times since ending his eight-week holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how much he knows in practice,'' Shelton said.
``He'll have to know a lot before there's a chance we'll play
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Short shots
</P>
<P>
   If starting cornerback  &UR; Corey Chavous' sore knee continues to
bother him, he could be replaced Sunday by  &UR; Tom Knight.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals announced Tuesday that all tickets for the Nov. 21
game against Dallas have been sold out. &QL;

   TEMPE, ARIZ. - A concussion to starting quarterback Kent Graham
has ended the New York Giants' quarterback controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel announced Tuesday that Kerry Collins, an
off-season free-agent acquisition, will make his first start in
Sunday's game against the Cardinals at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``After listening to the doctors, the most important thing is to
not put Kent at greater risk,'' Fassel said. ``The doctors told me
because of the concussion Kent suffered on Sunday, he'd be more
susceptible to a concussion on Sunday. If Kent was to sustain
another concussion, we'd be looking at a longer period of
inactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel has been under public pressure to bench Graham, an
ex-Cardinal, for Collins, who signed a four-year, $16.9 million
contract in February.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was pulled in last Sunday's 16-15 victory against the
Philadelphia Eagles after throwing three interceptions. On two of
the interceptions, he threw late and into coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said after the game that Graham's concussion might have
affected his decision-making in the game. Graham said the
concussion hadn't bothered him.
</P>
<P>
   The concussion made Fassel's decision easier. In fact, Graham
has been ruled out of the game, and Mike Cherry will be Collins'
backup on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A battery of tests on Kent on Monday showed some significant
alterations,'' team doctor Russell Warren said. ``At this point, he
is still symptomatic and will be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis.
My recommendation to the Giants is that Kent not play this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham started all four games this year for the Giants (2-2). He
has completed 70 of 120 passes (58.3 percent) for 746 yards and
four touchdowns. He has been intercepted four times and sacked six
times.
</P>
<P>
   Collins has completed 9 of 19 passes for 130 yards and been
intercepted once. He has come off the bench in two of the four
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been preparing well, even though I haven't gotten
a lot of reps in practice,'' Collins said. ``I feel confident if I
do have to play, I'll be able to execute this offense. I've started
a bunch of games, and I think I realize what it takes to be
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals faced both players last year. Graham completed
only 8 of 23 passes for 144 yards and was intercepted twice in last
year's 23-19 victory against the Cardinals on Dec. 6 at Sun Devil
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Collins, playing for the New Orleans Saints,
completed 25 of 43 throws for 265 yards and one touchdown in a
19-17 loss to the Cardinals. &QL;

DOAN BURIES A PAIR, CONTINUES HIS STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Shane Doan always has been a streak scorer during his
NHL career, which is to say he has scored at least a goal every
other month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that's right, I'm getting October and November out of
the way early though,'' Doan said, after scoring back-to-back goals
in the second period to lead the Phoenix Coyotes past the Mighty
Ducks of Anaheim 4-0 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, after scoring 17 points as an NHL rookie, the
Coyotes were saying the onus was on the 21-year-old Doan to provide
the organization with a breakthrough year and be the 57-point man
he was in junior hockey.
</P>
<P>
   He played just 33 games in the NHL and was sent to the minors
for the first time in his career and played in 39 games for
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the team again quietly said Doan must have a
breakthrough year. While other areas of his game were solid on the
ice, it took him 17 games to score a point, and 67 before he scored
his first goal. He finished with six goals and 16 assists in 79
games. But he provided hints of scoring ability with four points
and two game-winning goals in the first-round loss to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, a breakthrough was no longer talked about. It was
expected, and he was presented with a new three-year contract. He
seems to have picked up where he left off in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He had an assist in the season-opening 2-1 win in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contract is a big part of it,'' he said. ``You feel a lot
more comfortable and I appreciated it. After the playoff series I
felt confident coming into the exhibition season. This year I was
trying to prepare myself for the regular season like the other
veterans do and that's to build toward it.''
</P>
<P>
   His first goal, at 3:17 of the second, came after he had time in
front of the net to deke a shot and pull Mighty Ducks goalie Guy
Hebert totally out of position, then calmly flip the puck into the
net.
</P>
<P>
   His second, a slapper from the slot that appeared at first to be
deflected by Dallas Drake just 4:32 later, gave the Coyotes a
comfortable 4-0 lead and signaled the end of the evening for
Hebert, who was pulled by Coach Craig Hartsburg in favor of Dominic
Roussel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just about to go for a line change,'' Doan said. ``We
got a turnover and I was up high and Jeremy hit me with a great
pass and I was lucky enough to get good wood on it and it went
in.'' &QL;

ALFONZO'S SLAM SINKS D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - During a conversation before his team's first-ever
playoff game against the New York Mets on Tuesday night,
Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter was asked what he thought about
Houston's victory over Atlanta in the National League's other
first-round game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me answer the question with a question,'' he said. ``Do
you think Atlanta is dead just because they're down, 0-1?''
</P>
<P>
   The same question now must be asked about the Diamondbacks after
their 8-4 loss at sold-out Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Are they dead just because they're down, 0-1, in the
best-of-five series?
</P>
<P>
   Because the Mets beat ace left-hander Randy Johnson in
resounding fashion, the evidence would seem to point toward an
affirmative response.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who had 364 strikeouts, 12 complete games and a 2.48
ERA while fashioning a 17-9 record, was roughed up for seven runs
on eight hits while walking three and striking out 11 in 8 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo provided the big fireworks for
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo, who hit a key home run in the Mets' 5-0 victory at
Cincinnati on Monday night that clinched the NL wild card berth,
hit two Tuesday night, including a ninth-inning grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo's decisive shot came with two outs off right-hander
Bobby Chouinard, who entered the game with one out in the ninth
after Johnson loaded the bases. Johnson had run out of gas after
throwing 138 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Chouinard was on the verge of getting out of
trouble after third baseman Matt Williams made a diving stop of a
grounder by Rickey Henderson and forced Robin Ventura at the plate.
But Alfonzo connected on a 3-1 pitch and sent it near the
Diamondbacks bullpen in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said Johnson told him an inning before being removed
that he was ``getting there (tired).'' But he decided to send the
big man out for the ninth, anyway, and he gave up a base hit to
Ventura, a base hit to Rey Ordonez and a walk to Melvin Mora.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just got a little tired and walked some people and
got behind and gave up a couple base hits and, you know, gave it
all I had out there in the ninth inning,'' said Johnson, who
scattered five hits through eight innings to beat the Mets, 10-1,
at Shea Stadium on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tip my hat to the Mets. They played well last night (in
the wild card game) and they are probably riding a little bit on
that still. And I didn't make my pitches, and if you don't make
your pitches to major league hitters, you get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Diamondbacks' mind-set, Johnson said: ``The team
has never gotten too high on any win or too low on any loss all
year, so I don't imagine that will be the case after (Tuesday's)
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter perhaps could have gone for right-handed closer Matt
Mantei to get his club out of trouble, but he decided on Chouinard,
who had a 5-2 record with one save in 32 games during the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby, we felt like _ or I felt like _ was best-suited for
that situation,'' Showalter said. ``He's done the job for us most
of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo, who hit a solo homer off Johnson with one out in the
first inning, said he was trying to be patient against Chouinard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to walk me,'' Alfonzo said. ``He was just
throwing me fastballs to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   As he had on a handful of occasions during the season, Johnson
struggled in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo's home run, a two-run homer by first baseman John Olerud
and a fourth-inning sacrifice by Ordonez gave the Mets a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud's was the first homer off Johnson by a left-handed hitter
in postseason play and the first homer by any left-handed hitter
off Johnson since the California Angels' Jim Edmonds hit two off
Johnson when he was with Seattle on Sept. 23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona cut the lead to 4-2 in the fourth when rookie first
baseman Erubiel Durazo continued his amazing 1999 climb when he hit
a one-out, opposite-field homer to left off right-hander Masato
Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks got to Yoshii to tie the score at 4 in the
sixth inning. In a nice piece of hitting, second baseman Jay Bell
reached across for an outside pitch and served the ball to right
field for a leadoff single. Luis Gonzalez, who had career highs of
a .336 average, 26 homers and 111 RBIs, hit a 452-foot homer to
right. &QL;

A DREAM NIGHT TURNS REAL UGLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The table was set. National TV. A sellout home crowd
on its feet, in a ballpark draped with bunting. Opportunity awaited
under a canopy of desert stars.
</P>
<P>
   He dreamed of this night.
</P>
<P>
   ``His'' night.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted the ball. He deserved it. For the Diamondbacks'
first-ever playoff game, Buck Showalter called upon his best, the
ace of the staff, their $52 million man. Who better than baseball's
strikeout leader packing 98 mph heat?
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is all about winning,'' the pitcher said. ``It is
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He took the mound Tuesday night, looking confident and as nasty
as he is tall _ 6 feet 10, all arms and legs. His cold, predatory
eyes stared at the plate. The Mets looked back into the
sharp-featured face of a chicken hawk.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't flinch.
</P>
<P>
   Or blink.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks hired him to pitch in big games, and on the eve
of the biggest game in team history, Randy Johnson sounded like a
man who welcomed the pressure and the challenge. A fierce
competitor, he would be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyde to Jekyll,'' he said of his game-day personality change.
</P>
<P>
   He meant Jekyll to Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   You pictured him Tuesday afternoon at home, locked in a basement
laboratory. His wife calls the children together. And tells them,
``Daddy's not himself today.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone said having the Big Unit on your team is like keeping a
werewolf in the refrigerator. They make great watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets weren't frightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of our guys are intimidated by anything,''
Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo wasn't. The second batter Johnson faced _ and
the hero in the Mets' 8-4 victory _ started the scoring, drilling a
solo home run to center field.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud wasn't intimidated either. When Johnson made another
costly mistake in the third inning, leaving a slider up in the
strike zone, Olerud ripped the ball over the right-field fence for
a 3-0 lead. It was the first home run Johnson had given up to a
left-handed hitter in two years.
</P>
<P>
   After four innings, the Mets had six hits and a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   These road warriors who went to Cincinnati on Monday night and
beat the Reds to make the playoffs were aggressive at the plate. In
the sixth, Benny Agbayani hit a line drive that came at Johnson's
head like a New York subway train. Fortunately, Randy ducked.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was angry. Between pitches, he barked at himself.
Between innings, he walked off the field with those long slow
strides, jaw set, eyes downcast.
</P>
<P>
   His baserunning gaffe _ Johnson forgot how many outs the
Diamondbacks had, after hitting a double _ added to his
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Big Unit knows how much he wanted this game, how much
winning it meant to him. Last year he went 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA in
his two months as a hired gun in Houston. But he lost both playoff
starts, not because he didn't pitch well. The Astros booming bats
went silent.
</P>
<P>
   When he left Houston, the Astros tried to put a positive spin on
his departure. Johnson was 35 years old, the club noted. He has a
history of back problems. ``Pitchers are like race horses,'' said
Gerry Hunsicker, the Astros general manager. ``The experienced ones
break down just like the inexperienced ones. But the risk is
greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wanted to finish what he started. His teammates had
brought the team back, with Luis Gonzalez tying the score in the
sixth with a two-run home run.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson didn't make it. The end for him _ and the beginning
of the end for the D-Backs _ came in the ninth when Johnson,
tiring, gave up two singles and a walk to load the bases. Buck
Showalter had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   The manager handed the ball to Bobby Chouinard.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:50 a.m. New York time, Alfonzo deposited it into the
stands, his grand slam home run clearing the bases that No. 51,
watching from the dugout, had filled. &QL;

A TIME FOR DESPERATE MEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In its most simplistic form, a long and grueling
baseball season is all about adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Winning clubs meet it head-on, find a way to deal with it and
overcome it. Losing clubs founder in adversity's grip for stretches
at a time, usually unable to escape its clutches.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Randy Johnson, easily the club's best hope, and the
Diamondbacks have lost Game 1 of the division series to the New
York Mets, Arizona finds itself staring deep into the throat of Mr.
Adversity.
</P>
<P>
   The view, expectedly, is dark and depressing for the
Diamondbacks, no matter how many times they try to talk themselves
into not believing it. There are few rays of light inside this
gorge right now.
</P>
<P>
   With the tide apparently rising, the Diamondbacks find
themselves waist-deep in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Send out the distress signals, because when the Mets can pop
Johnson for seven runs, what's to stop them from pummeling any of
the Diamondbacks' other starters, all of whom pale in comparison to
Johnson and his overpowering fastballs and sliders?
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets, this could be the kind of victory that catapulted
San Diego to its first-round victory against Houston last year,
when the Padres beat Johnson in Game 1 and came back to get him
again in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like if we beat him, we could probably beat him
again,'' San Diego's Tony Gwynn said last weekend. ``He pitched as
well as he could possibly pitch, and we still beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   If this all sounds like a time for desperate measures, it's
because that's exactly what the Diamondbacks are now facing. They
cannot head to the zoo-like atmosphere of Shea Stadium on Friday
night buried in a 2-0 hole. &QL; 
A tough match-up
</P>
<P>
   Todd Stottlemyre, remarkably pitching with a partially torn
rotator cuff and a torn labrum, will take the mound tonight and
hope to reverse the mounting tide against the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Working against Arizona is New York's starting pitcher Kenny
Rogers. He's exactly the kind of pitcher who can give Diamondbacks
hitters fits. He is a finesse pitcher who is very athletic.
</P>
<P>
   If the Diamondbacks were facing a hard-throwing left-hander,
they would match up much better.
</P>
<P>
   The night actually started looking good for Arizona after Luis
Gonzalez slammed a key two-run home run in the sixth to tie the
score at 4. Given a reprieve, Johnson appeared to get into his
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   But when Johnson began to tire late in the game, the
Diamondbacks' Achilles' heel was revealed for all to see. Manager
Buck Showalter called on Bobby Chouinard to come into a tense
situation in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in his first postseason game ever, Chouinard found
himself facing the bases loaded and only one out. After a
miraculous play by third baseman Matt Williams, Chouinard and the
Diamondbacks appeared to have Lady Luck on their side.
</P>
<P>
   But four pitches later, Edgardo Alfonzo was laughing his way
around the bases, following the three other Mets toward home
plate. &QL; 
Running out of options
</P>
<P>
   When it came to crunch time in the late innings and Showalter
needing a right-handed reliever, he was faced with choosing among
Chouinard, Darren Holmes, Gregg Olson and Andy Benes.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Matt Mantei was no real option because he has tended to
be erratic against the first batter he's faced, making a
bases-loaded walk too risky a proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had a horrible night all around, culminating with his
forgetting how many outs there were in the seventh inning when he
was on second base with Jay Bell due up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of remaining near the base on a fly to left, Johnson
jogged to third, believing there were three outs. This on a night
when he did not have his usual dominating stuff on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Is tonight a must-win situation? It's way beyond that stage.
Desperation must set in. &QL;

SPECIAL MOMENT RAISES HOPE  
 `VICTORY SIGN' FALSE FOR D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It was one of those magical plays that the
Diamondbacks, once upon a time, turned into victory.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams made a diving stop, got up and fired
a strike to home plate to keep the New York Mets from breaking a
tie in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way our year has gone, when he made that play, I thought
we were going to get out of that inning and come back and score
some runs,'' said left fielder Luis Gonzalez, who had tied the
score at 4 in the sixth with a two-run homer. ``But that's not the
way it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   If right-hander Bobby Chouinard only had it to do over. If he
could have gotten a strike first and not fallen behind the count.
If he had not had to face one of the hottest hitters on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind in the count, 3-1, to second baseman
Edgardo Alfonzo, Chouinard said he threw a fastball ``right down
the middle'' and Alfonzo deadened the sellout crowd at Bank One
Ballpark with a grand slam that gave New York an 8-4 win and a 1-0
lead in the best-of-five National League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to walk him,'' Chouinard said. ``I didn't want
to complicate things with (left-handed hitter) John Olerud coming
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard, who started the year in Triple-A Tucson, had pitched
well down the stretch, but this was all new. A huge crowd. A
playoff game. Trying to bail Randy Johnson out of a bases-loaded
jam with one out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard fell behind, 2-0, in the count to Rickey Henderson,
the first batter he faced, before Henderson hit a shot to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just killed myself by falling behind,'' Chouinard said. ``I
was over-throwing. In a game like that, it's hard to keep your
emotions in check.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter had both Chouinard and closer Matt Mantei
warming up in the bullpen, while Johnson labored in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases full and no margin for error, Showalter elected
to go with Chouinard over Mantei with a selective Henderson at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby has been one our best pitchers out of the bullpen,''
Showalter said. ``I thought he was best in that situation. He's
done the job for us most of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt (Williams) made a great play. It looked like we had a
shot to get out of it. He was trying to get a ball away and down
and it ran back over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter had right-handers Darren Holmes, Gregg Olson and Andy
Benes in the bullpen. Holmes said Chouinard was the right call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the reasons why we're where we're at,'' Holmes
said. ``Without him, who knows where we'd be right now. He's done a
great job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get down. You can't dwell on it. He's a bullpen guy.
He's mentally tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard said he won't let the loneliest moment he's felt on
the mound linger.

   ``You can't,'' he said. ``It's a short series. We have to win
three out of four. I'd like to get back out there (tonight). We're
not out of it yet. I won't let this defeat me.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter to Gonzalez that he had a double and a 452-foot
home run that brought the Diamondbacks back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take 0 for 4 if we can win the game,'' he said. ``But
we'll be ready to play. We'll put this one behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has played in more postseason games than any other
Diamondback, isn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't be here if they didn't do that (come through
with huge hits) once in a while,'' Williams said. ``And we wouldn't
be here if we didn't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll let it fly (today).'' &QL;

METS HAVE MAGIC MAN IN ALFONZO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The New York Mets don't know whether to touch second
baseman Edgardo Alfonzo or leave him be.
</P>
<P>
   They don't want to mess with this magic groove he is riding, but
they sure wouldn't mind if whatever he's got would rub off on
everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   A night after he kick-started the Mets' victory in Cincinnati
with a first-inning, two-run homer to give them postseason life,
Alfonzo's torrid bat carried them past the Diamondbacks on Tuesday
at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   He crushed a 98 mph Randy Johnson fastball for another
first-inning homer, a solo shot, and then escalated his hero status
in Queens to an unfathomable plane with a two-out, second-deck
grand slam in the ninth. It gave the Mets an 8-4 victory before
49,584 stunned fans in Game 1 of the National League Division
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is when it counts,'' Alfonzo said. ``I've been feeling
really good at home plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo already was entrenched in good graces in the borough for
Monday's heroics that also included an RBI double. That helped put
New York in the postseason for the first time in 11 years. On
Tuesday, he was the star attraction again.
</P>
<P>
   A slick glove man who hit .304 with 27 homers, Alfonzo entered
the night hitless in three tries against Johnson in his career. He
watched two strikes before rocketing a 422-foot blast to
left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to be patient with myself,'' Alfonzo said.
``When I get behind in the count, I don't expect to hit a home run.
I think it was just a good pitch for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, he watched three straight balls from reliever
Bobby Chouinard to set himself up to anticipate a 3-1 fastball. He
jumped all over the offering, almost too much, as it hooked inside
the foul pole for a 397-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard said Arizona's coaches had warned the staff that
Alfonzo was a great fastball hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be outside, but it was right over the
middle,'' Chouinard said. ``As soon as I heard the bat hit the
ball, I just knew it was a matter of fair or foul.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitch was foul. The hit was fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always comes through,'' center fielder Shawon Dunston said.
``He's clutch. That was a beautiful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo was not the only Met who got to Johnson. Left-handed
hitters John Olerud and Robin Ventura went 4 for 8, including two
extra-base hits. Johnson had only yielded one extra-base hit this
season and came into the game with lefties batting just .103
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud creamed a two-run homer in the third for his first career
hit off Johnson, who had not yielded a home run to a left-handed
hitter since Angels outfielder Jim Edmonds hit one in September of
1997.

FANS JAM DOWNTOWN  
 STREETS PACKED, TRAFFIC HEAVY BUT PARKING A BREEZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Imagine a city bigger than Flagstaff, composed
entirely of delirious Diamondbacks devotees, howling hockey fans
and sophisticated theater aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine all of them converging on downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened Tuesday night as the Diamondbacks hosted
their first-ever playoff game, the Coyotes opened their season at
home and ``A'' ``Chorus Line'' began its run at the Orpheum
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Despite earlier fears of an ugly downtown gridlock, traffic
flowed relatively smoothly and parking was plentiful for the nearly
70,000 sports fans and theater patrons who flocked downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Suzette Crider, who had been transporting people in her
horse-drawn carriage since 5 p.m., said she had seen a lot more
foot traffic Tuesday than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Like many, John Konvicka, a salesman, and Janis Langford, an
accountant, both of Scottsdale, came early to avoid traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather be drinking margaritas than sitting in traffic,''
Langford said, as they waited to see ``A Chorus Line''.
</P>
<P>
   Tim and Lori Wilson of Prescott, who arrived two hours before
Coyotes faceoff because of concerns about traffic, found parking to
be a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   But traffic was heavy in places, especially as game time
approached. Tempers flared, horns blared and cars were backed up at
Central Avenue and Jefferson Street an hour before the first pitch
at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us 25 minutes to go 25 miles to get here,'' said Steve
Colombo, of Scottsdale, ``and another 25 minutes to go 25 yards
once we got downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombo, 35, had tickets for both the Coyotes game and the
Diamondbacks game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the (Coyotes) game is half over, or if it gets boring,
I'll head over to the ballpark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loren and Peg Andrews of Sun City West said they left home
earlier than they normally do to attend the show at the Orpheum,
but that they really didn't need to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected it to be a lot worse than it was,'' Peg said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix opened 2,700 parking spaces at the new Civic East Garage
north of the ballpark Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic is always the main problem when there are multiple
events downtown,'' Phoenix police spokesman Jeff Halstead said.
``But we'll also be checking vendors, looking after lost kids _ all
kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police Sgt. Robert Jones, working out of the Downtown
Special Events Command Center on Jefferson Street, said about 48
police officers were on duty downtown Tuesday, about 15 more than
normal. &QL;

THIS LOSS BAD OMEN FOR D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - One game means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you're talking about Tuesday night's game. A
terrible tease of a baseball game that instantly changed the tone
of an entire series.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of an 8-4 loss and an 0-1 postseason deficit come a
few logical conclusions, none of them good for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   After swatting around Randy Johnson, the Mets have no reason to
think they can't do it again, if necessary. An emphatic victory to
start the playoffs _ on the road and after an overnight flight _
will only pad the armor of a battle-tested opponent.
</P>
<P>
   And after winning their fifth consecutive game since teetering
on the edge of elimination, the Mets are starting to suspect
``they'' are the team of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very confident,'' Mets reliever Dennis Cook said. ``If
we keep playing this brand of baseball, I like our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   You know, there's nothing like New Yorkers overflowing with
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what we have here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can create momentum,'' Matt Williams said. ``But we want
to stop that momentum (on Wednesday) in whatever fashion it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their mad stagger just to reach the playoffs, the Mets
entered Game 1 with a distinct advantage. In essence, they had been
playing under postseason duress for the past 13 games. Granted, the
Mets lost most of those contests. But in the end, they got the hang
of it. They swept the Pirates to close the season and stay alive.
And they beat the Reds in Game No. 163, winner takes all. &QL; 
Tests of character &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pressure had become a way of life for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have had an incredible week, conquered a lot of
things,'' Luis Gonzalez said. ``But I think, on (Wednesday), this
team will be right back. We've had tests of character as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pockets of pressure, maybe. But the Diamondbacks haven't played
a really important game since a weekend series in Atlanta to start
September. Nothing close to the encompassing vacuum of playoff
baseball. And certainly not under the spotlight of a bona fide
historic event in Arizona history.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks almost plowed through it all. Matt Williams
with his glove, Jay Bell with his situational hitting, Luis
Gonzalez and Erubiel Durazo with big-time home runs. But in the
end, one team was simply sharper and one team was simply better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody expected this to be easy,'' Manager Buck
Showalter said. ``And now we have to make it tougher on them.''
</P>
<P>
   A shame, really.
</P>
<P>
   For all the warranted criticism over a lack of passion, the
locals in the stands finally made it feel like a budding baseball
town. People lined up before the game to get an autograph from the
owner, Jerry Colangelo. Babe Ruth's daughter was in attendance. The
carnival atmosphere outside the BOB was real, not contrived. Inside
the building, fans actually hung on every pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Mets unfazed by conditions &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Nevertheless, a few words of advice: When the scoreboard tells
you to get loud because ESPN is about to go live and the nation
will be watching, don't. It makes us look like Hooterville, USA.)
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, the Mets were unfazed by any of the external
conditions. Two mistake pitches from Johnson ended up in the seats,
a pair of unwanted souvenirs. They stole a couple of bases,
squeezed home a run. They hit Johnson and a capacity crowd of
nearly 50,000 with a stun gun. And after the hosts rallied to tie
the game, the Mets did it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to know that we can get to him (Johnson),'' Olerud
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets didn't exactly thrive against left-handed pitchers this
season (22-18), and the prospect of facing four lefties in five
games _ Johnson, Omar Daal, Brian Anderson and Johnson again _
seemed to be another intangible in Arizona's favor.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody on our team necessarily thinks that
we're a .500 team when we play against a left-hander,'' the Mets'
Robin Ventura said. ``Those numbers don't mean a whole lot once
you're here.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, they don't mean a thing. All that matters is belief
and results.
</P>
<P>
   (Big) Advantage, Mets. &QL;

A TIME FOR DESPERATE MEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In its most simplistic form, a long and grueling
baseball season is all about adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Winning clubs meet it head-on, find a way to deal with it and
overcome it. Losing clubs flounder in adversity's clutches for
weeks on end, unable to escape its grip.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Randy Johnson, the Diamondbacks' messiah, has been
slain by the New York Mets, the National League West champions find
themselves staring deep into the throat of Mr. Adversity.
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson, the league's most dominating pitcher all season,
looking very beatable in Game 1, Arizona is faced with an uphill
climb that may simply be too daunting a task to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The tide is coming in at the Diamondbacks, who find themselves
waist-deep in serious trouble. The kind that can easily swallow
even the most confident of clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Send out the distress signals, because when the Mets can pop
Johnson for seven runs, what's to stop them from pummeling any of
the Diamondbacks other starters, all of whom pale in comparison to
Johnson? &QL; 
A chink in Johnson's armor
</P>
<P>
   New York second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo, one of the best-kept
secrets in the game the past few years, spit on Johnson's ninth
pitch of the game, an obvious mistake fastball that stayed out over
the heart of the plate, sending it deep into the seats in
left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   It was only one run, but the message was sent to the rest of his
teammates: Johnson could be had on this night. Three more runs
followed in the next three innings as New York loaded up on
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Arizona managed to tie the score in the sixth
inning, the Mets never relinquished the lead or stopped having that
look of a winner on this night.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets, this could be the same type of victory that
catapulted San Diego to its first-round victory against Houston
last year, when the Padres beat Johnson in Game 1 before beating
him again in the decisive fourth game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like if we beat him, we could probably beat him
again,'' San Diego's Tony Gwynn said last weekend. ``He pitched as
well as he could possibly pitch, and we still beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like a time for desperate measures, it's because
that's exactly what the Diamondbacks are now facing. They cannot
head to the zoo-like atmosphere of Shea Stadium Friday night buried
in a 2-0 hole.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson, who ran the Diamondbacks out of an inning in the
seventh when he forgot how many outs there were, began to tire in
the ninth, the Mets seized the chance and exposed a flaw in the
Diamondbacks' bullpen.  &QL; 
Running out of options
</P>
<P>
   Closer Matt Mantei, who has had difficulties walking first
batters, was not an option with the bases full of Mets. Manager
Buck Showalter's choices consisted of right-handed setup relievers
Andy Benes, Bobby Chouinard, Darren Holmes and Gregg Olson.
Showalter called on Chouinard, who had never before appeared in a
postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard managed to escape danger against Rickey Henderson, but
only because of a miraculous play by third baseman Matt Williams.
Two pitches later, Chouinard was tracking Alfonzo's second home
run, this one a towering blast deep into the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Diamondbacks pin their hopes on Todd Stottlemyre, who
remarkably is pitching with a partially torn rotator cuff and a
torn labrum. He also has a 2-5 postseason record that includes a
6.59 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks will need everything Stottlemyre can muster
from his frayed right shoulder. Making matters worse for the
Diamondbacks is the opposing pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers, a finesse left-hander, is exactly the kind of
pitcher who gives Arizona's hitters fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won games before after losses,'' reliever Greg Swindell
said. ``(Tonight's) a big game. If we go down 0-2, that's
different.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a big game. This is a win-or-else-it's-really-over
type of game for the Diamondbacks. As it stands, the belief that
this series may already be over is taking hold in many corners.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation time has arrived. That's what happens when your ace
gets beat _ and beat good. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ Search teams clad in white plastic coveralls probed the
charred and mangled commuter rail car this morning that officials
fear contains many more bodies of people killed Tuesday in one of
Britain's worst-ever rail disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The first-class car was near the lead of a train carrying
commuters into London during morning rush hour suggesting that it
may have been carrying dozens of passengers. The car, which was
covered by a cocoon of tarpaulins Wednesday morning, was crushed in
the collision and engulfed in a diesel fuel-fed fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators tried to stabilize the car overnight and wait for
morning before examining its interior. Inside the damage was so
complete that officials expressed concern that they may be unable
to discern the human remains. ``There is nothing inside but ash and
debris,'' said Tony Thompson, the superintendent of the British
Transport Police, during an afternoon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from the disastrous collision increased to 27
Wednesday morning, police said. About 160 people were injured, and
more than 42 remained in area hospitals Wednesday. Fourteen of
those are in critical condition, primarily from burns.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily damaged car _ belonging to Great Western Trains _
had sitting spaces for 48 people and standing room for many more.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the number of people still reported missing, Andy
Trotter, a deputy police commissioner at the scene, said ``the
number of fatalities will rise considerably.'' No more passengers
are expected to be found alive in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy cranes were being assembled to allow rescue crews to lift
the train cars so investigators can look for more bodies
underneath. ``This is going to be a long and laborious task,''
Trotter said.
</P>
<P>
   While the cause of the crash has not been determined,
investigators are expected to focus on driver error or signal
failure, newspapers reported Wednesday. The inquiry is expected to
look first at whether the driver of the outbound train ran a red
light near the station.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed tests also were being performed on signaling equipment.
Investigators have recovered a data recorder _ called a ``black
box'' _ from one train and are still searching for the other. Both
engineers were presumably killed on impact.
</P>
<P>
   Among the flowers left on a rail bridge overlooking the scene of
the disaster was a bouquet bearing a card dedicated to one of the
engineers. It began ``For Dear Brian,'' and was signed, ``God bless
you, Gerald and Maureen.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, it read: ``Today is the saddest day of my life when my
brother was taken away from us . . . My only wish is that he never
suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   The engineer's last name has not yet been released by the rail
company because his body has not been officially identified.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, toured
St Mary's Hospital in Paddington Wednesday to meet victims of the
rail crash and thank the emergency services for their work. During
the 45-minute private tour Blair praised the ``truly heroic''
doctors and nurses who treated injured passengers, said a spokesman
for No 10. Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
   The trains collided two miles from busy Paddington Station at
8:11 a.m. (local time) Tuesday sending smoke and flames into the
sky over a west London neighborhood. The accident occurred on the
same rail line as 1997 crash that killed seven, and prompted
concerns about the safety of the city's aging rail system. A
passenger rail company, Great Western Trains, was fined $2.47
million for safety violations in that crash. Great Western operated
one of the trains involved in Tuesday's disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Train drivers threatened Wednesday to consider going on strike
unless rail companies respond positively within seven days to
demands for a package of improved safety measures.
</P>

   ``We will not tolerate any more unsafe working practices and we
will not tolerate our members, or the public, being put at risk,''
said Mick Rix, a leader or the drivers' union. ``Failure to respond
within seven days will bring the train companies into dispute with
this union.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is demanding the installation nationwide of a
fail-safe automatic train protection system as well as in-cab
radios. The sophisticated, but expensive, automatic train
protection system is fitted on only a few British lines. Its
network-wide installation could cost as much as $1.6 billion and
has been ruled out because of its cost.

</P>
<P>
   Stephen Stotson of the Transport Police told CNN that he
believed the two crowded trains were traveling at a relatively slow
speed when they collided.
</P>
<P>
   The rail cars were flung from the tracks, their metal roofs
sheared off by the impact. Doctors said many of the injured were
severely burned; some suffered scorched lungs after they inhaled
the super-heated air. Hospitals in the surrounding area were
overwhelmed with casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one big bang and then there was black smoke and
flames,'' said Marianne O'Neill, who was roused from bed at her
house, 200 yards from the accident. ``It was a dreadful thing,''
said O'Neill, who owns a pub nearby. ``It was an eerie thing. All
day long there were so many people around but there was also a
silence about the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Great Western said as many as 500 people might have been on
board its train, minutes away from Paddington. Thames Trains' cars
may have carried 150 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Paddington, one of London's busiest stations and the terminus
for the city's primary train to Heathrow Airport, is expected to
remain closed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A crane and special lights were brought in Tuesday to help the
recovery teams. Authorities also were planning to tear down two
small buildings near the wreckage to gain better access.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur video shot minutes after the accident shown on news
broadcasts here showed passengers, some in business suits, emerging
from the windows and doors of a rail car resting in its side. Some
even crawled back into the car to help other passengers as flames
roared nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Some described their feelings as they frantically tried to
escape. ''I was thinking, 'God, please don't let me die,''' Stuart
Allen told The Associated Press. ''You've got flames. You've got
smoke. You've got a big bang. You've just got to think the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger David Taylor described ``an almighty bang.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up, and I could see the front of the coach was on
fire,'' Taylor said. ``There were balls of flames coming down both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Touquet, an emergency room doctor at St. Mary's Hospital
told Sky News that it was one of the worst episodes of his career.
``The smell of burning flesh has an absolute acidity about it, and
when you see passengers coming in from a World War II-type of film
with white bandages over their face, with just two eyes looking
out, one realizes just how horrific it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Rosenheim, 44, an American traveling on the Great Western
train, felt fortunate just to be alive. While Rosenheim said he
would get on a train again. ''It is very depressing to think in the
light of this terrible tragedy that it can still happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's accident was Britain's worst rail crash since December
1988, when three trains collided outside London's Clapham Junction,
killing 35 people.

   POLICE-PROFILING (Oakland, Calif.) _ Some angry local elected
officials said it was ``racist'' for California Gov. Gray Davis to
veto a controversial bill that would have required police officers
to track the race of motorists they stop. Racial profiling has been
a hot national issue this year with several states and the U.S.
Congress considering bills to track it. By MATTHEW YI.

high-tech industry. By MATT BEER.

   COMPANY-RESEARCH (Colonie, N.Y.) _ For years Intermagnetics
General Co. was run more like a university than a business. There

Louisiana style. ``I don't want people to lose the tradition and

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: Edmund Morris, author of the controversial new biography of
Ronald Reagan, previously won a Pulitzer Prize for a biography of
the early life of Theodore Roosevelt. I thought Morris was working
on a sequel to that. Do you know the status?
</P>
<P>
   A: Morris says he hopes the Roosevelt sequel, ``Theodore Rex,''
will be out on Sept. 14, 2001, the centenary of his accession to
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some months ago, the American Airlines pilots' union was
fined $10 million for its ``sick-in'' campaign against the airline.
Was it ever paid?
</P>
<P>
   A: The fine, assessed by U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall in
April against the Allied Pilots Association, actually was $45.5
million. The union is appealing, said a spokeswoman for AMR Corp.,
American's parent company. Kendall has said interest will accrue
until the $45.5 million is paid.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots began calling in sick Feb 6 to demand guarantees they
wouldn't lose out on promotions and flights to the lower-paid
pilots of Reno Air, which American bought. The job action led to
6,600 canceled flights, with the fine resulting when the pilots
disobeyed Kendall's return-to-work order.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the circumstances of the death of country music
performer BoxCar Willie? Also, how did he get his start?
</P>
<P>
   A: The entertainer died April 12 in Branson, Mo., after a long
battle with leukemia. He had been diagnosed with the disease three
years ago, and after a brief remission it returned last year. Until
his health began to fail, BoxCar Willie _ born Lecil Travis Martin
in Sterrett, Texas, on Sept. 1, 1931_ performed as many as six
shows a week at the BoxCar Willie Theatre in Branson.
</P>
<P>
   BoxCar Willie was an invented hobo character whose creation
propelled Martin to fame. His singing career never got off the
ground while he was performing under the name Marty Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'60s, Martin wrote a song called ``BoxCar Willie,''
based on a hobo he saw on a train while he was stuck in traffic.
The hobo reminded Martin of a buddy named Willie Wilson, he said,
so the character was born. He adopted the name as his performance
character and dressed like a hobo on stage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he replaced a sick George Jones at a Nashville club. As
BoxCar Willie, Martin was spotted by a Scottish booking agent who
took him on a tour of England. Further tours in England established
his popularity there. In the early '80s he was a regular on
television's ``Hee Haw,'' while cranking out a number of albums as
well as playing a hobo in ``Sweet Dreams,'' a film about Patsy
Cline.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People say that Georgia's Stone Mountain is the largest stone
monolith in the world. How does it compare to the one in Australia?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ayers Rock, in central Australia's Uluru National Park, is
bigger, but Stone Mountain is the largest piece of exposed granite
in the world. Ayers Rock rises more than 1,130 feet above the
surrounding desert plain. The oval sandstone rock measures 2.2
miles long by 1 1/2 miles wide.
</P>
<P>
   World Book Encyclopedia describes Stone Mountain as ``the
largest smooth-sided rock dome in North America,'' measuring about
2 miles long by 1 mile wide. At its highest point, the granite mass
rises more than 700 feet above the surrounding terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The recent loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter because of
confusion between English and metric measurements prompts my
question: What has happened to efforts to initiate the use of the
metric system in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Public acceptance continues to be slow, but the federal
government hasn't backed away from supporting a conversion to
metric.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed by Congress in 1975 established a policy of
voluntary conversion to the metric system of weights and measures
for U.S. trade and commerce, and an amended bill passed in 1988
made metric the ``preferred'' system. In addition, the bill called
for agencies of the federal government to use metric for purchases,
grants, and other business-related activities. And many U.S.-made
products that compete in the global market are in metric.
</P>
<P>
   At some point _ especially if other countries stop buying
non-metric goods _ that competition may force the United States to
change. After all, according to the U.S. Metric Association, 99
percent of the rest of the world uses metric.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported several weeks ago that the remains of an
ancient person, thought to date to 3,500 years ago, were found in
Canada. Testing was to be done at a lab, but I never saw or heard
anything else about it. Can you update me?
</P>
<P>
   A: The well-preserved remains, whose discovery was announced
Aug. 24, aren't nearly as old as originally was speculated. Initial
reports about the remains, found in a glacier in a remote corner of
northwestern British Columbia, said only that scientists and tribal
leaders had discovered ``an ancient man'' on Aug. 14 in
Tatshenshini-Alsek Park.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at first had thought the remains could be up to
10,000 years old. But clothes on the mummified adult male, now
called Kwaday Dan Sinchi _ ``Long Ago Person Found'' in the
language of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations tribe of the
region _ have been determined to be considerably more recent.
Carbon-dating tests conducted on the apparel indicate that the man
met his fate sometime between 1415 and 1445.
</P>
<P>
   The body is being stored at the Royal British Columbia Museum in
Victoria while scientists develop a research plan. The research
will be under joint provincial and aboriginal supervision. After
that, the body will be returned to the Champagne-Aishihik for
burial.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I frequently read and hear about Social Security trust funds.
What are they, how are they funded, and how are they invested?
</P>
<P>
   A: The trust funds are financial accounts in the U.S. Treasury
funded by Social Security and Medicare taxes, premiums and other
income. The only purposes for which these trust funds can be used
are to pay Social Security and Medicare benefits and program
administrative costs, said Patti Patterson of the Social Security
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the assets of the Social Security program must be
invested in interest-bearing government securities or in securities
whose principal and interest is guaranteed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The trust funds hold a mix of short-term and long-term
government bonds. The funds can hold both regular Treasury
securities and ``special obligation'' securities issued only to
federal trust funds. In practice, the securities in the Social
Security trust funds are of the ``special obligation'' type,
according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   These funds earn interest set at the average market yield on
long-term Treasury securities. Interest from investments in 1998
amounted to $49.3 billion, representing an effective annual
interest rate of 7.2 percent, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the first person to receive monthly Social Security
benefits?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ida May Fuller of Ludlow, Vt., starting Jan. 31, 1940. Three
years earlier, Ernest Ackerman of Cleveland received the first
benefit payment, a lump-sum, one-time payout of 17 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Members of my household are curious about Robert Novak of
CNN's ``Crossfire.'' Do you know anything about his educational and
professional background? Also, what is his address?
</P>
<P>
   A: Novak, who was born Feb. 26, 1931, in Joliet, Ill., took his
first news jobs as a reporter for the Joliet Herald-News and the
Champaign-Urbana (Ill.) Courier while attending the University of
Illinois between 1948 and 1952. He has a bachelor's of arts degree
from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of Army duty (1952-54), Novak joined the staff
of the Associated Press in Omaha, Neb., and after that was assigned
to Indianapolis. In 1957, the AP transferred him to Washington,
where he helped cover Congress. He joined the Washington bureau of
The Wall Street Journal in 1958 and became the newspaper's chief
congressional correspondent in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Novak teamed with Rowland Evans to write ``Inside
Report,'' a syndicated political column, which evolved into a
newsletter, ``The Evans-Novak Political Report.'' Novak has been a
comentator for Corinthian Broadcasting in Washington, as well as a
commentator on CNN. He hosts ``Crossfire'' with Mary Matalin and
Bill Press. Novak also has written four books.
</P>
<P>
   Mail can be sent to him in care of CNN, 820 First St. NE,
Washington, DC 20002.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the official residence of the vice
president of the United States. What can you tell us about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 33-room mansion is on the grounds of the U.S. Naval
Observatory, on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington. Formerly known
as the Admiral's House, the residence served as the home of the
observatory superintendent until 1928, and of the chief of naval
operations until 1974. Adm. Elmo Zumwalt was the last naval
resident. Although the president has had an official Washington
residence since 1800, not until July 1974 did Congress give the
vice president a permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Washington architect Leon E. Dessez and completed in
1893, the house is a Queen Anne-style, three-story, brick and wood
frame structure barely visible from the road. The first floor
consists of an entrance hall, dining room, living room, library and
administrative offices. Four bedrooms, plus a master bedroom suite,
are on the second and third floors, along with a family room,
kitchenette and office. The main kitchen, laundry, and quarters for
the staff and Secret Service are in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The house is on 12 acres, landscaped in the style of an English
park. The Navy still owns and maintains the house and supplies
staff, including six enlistees who serve as stewards.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many children does Sen. John McCain have? I've seen it
reported as both five and seven.
</P>
<P>
   A: McCain (R-Ariz.) married his first wife, Carol, in 1965, and
adopted her two sons, Douglas and Andrew. They had a daughter,
Sidney Ann. The couple divorced in 1980. Later that same year,
McCain married Cindy Hensley. They have four children, Meghan,
Jack, Jim and Bridget.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain the basics of the Higher Education Act of
1965? Who initiated it?

<P>
   A: The act was sponsored by Rep. Edith Green, a Democrat from
Oregon, It embodied numerous requests of President Lyndon Johnson
and was enacted with broad bipartisan support in Congress. It was
passed Oct. 20, 1965, by a 313-63 House vote and Senate voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary in several aspects, particularly in its student
aid provisions, the act initially was an eight-part, $840 million
bill. With it, Congress approved federal scholarships for
undergraduate students for the first time in U.S. history. Another
new aid program under the act was insurance on loans, with federal
subsidies on interest payments. Also included were new programs of
graduate study for public school teachers, prospective teachers and
other school personnel, including social workers and guidance
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Other sections of the act authorized funds for community service
programs focusing on urban problems, to be conducted by colleges
and universities; grants to improve college libraries and train
librarians; a program to raise the academic quality of developing
institutions; and equipment grants to improve classroom instruction
in the sciences, humanities, art and education.

<P>
   Q: I understand that a U.S. helicopter went down in Colombia
recently with five American soldiers aboard, but I haven't seen
much about it. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported by many news outlets, it was a U.S. Army
DeHavilland RC-7 reconnaissance plane that crashed July 23 while
flying on an anti-drug mission in a rebel-occupied area of southern
Colombia near the Ecuador border. Five U.S. soldiers _ including a
woman pilot _ and two Colombian air force officers were killed when
the aircraft hit a 9,000-foot peak while circling above a major
drug-producing area.
</P>
<P>
   The American soldiers, who were based at Fort Bliss, at El Paso,
Texas, were said to be the first U.S. military personnel killed
while fighting illegal drugs in Colombia. Since 1997, three
American pilots flying drug-interdiction missions for a private
U.S. military contractor also have been killed, according to a
report in Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   As Newsweek also reported, while American officials sought to
downplay the RC-7 mission as a routine anti-narcotics patrol, the
aircraft was packed with sophisticated intelligence equipment that
would be useful in tracking guerrilla movements. ``This had to do
with surveillance,'' the magazine quoted a source familiar with the
flight's mission as saying. ``We're not supposed to be monitoring
guerrillas, but that's what they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I used to enjoy watching Spencer Christian, the weatherman on
``Good Morning America,'' but he's no longer there. Where is he
now, and how can fans write to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: As previously reported, he parted ways with ABC on Jan. 1
after his contract was not renewed. The jovial, wisecracking
Christian now works at KGO-TV in San Francisco. Write to him in
care of the station, 900 Front St., San Francisco, CA 94111.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the K stand for in Y2K?
</P>
<P>
   A: This question comes up often. It represents kilo (thousand),
as in kilometer (1,000 meters) or kilogram (1,000 grams). So in
Y2K, Y is Year and 2K is two thousand (designating, obviously, the
year 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that President Jimmy Carter awarded the nation's
highest civilian medal to Roger Baldwin, founder of the American
Civil Liberties Union. The letter further stated that Baldwin was a
member of the Communist Party. Can you verify if any of this is
true?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta confirmed that on
Jan. 16, 1981, Carter awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to
Baldwin, who founded the ACLU in 1920. Baldwin, who was born in
1884, died on Aug. 26, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Some early critics indeed did accuse the ACLU of defending only
Communists, but the organization responded by pointing out that for
the same reason it defended them, it also defended Nazis and
members of the Ku Klux Klan. It explained that it defended not
their doctrines, but their right to make them known as guaranteed
by the Bill of Rights. Current Biography (1940), in its section on
Baldwin, quoted this as the ACLU's statement of purpose: ``We stand
on general principle that all matters of public concern should be
freely discussed without interference.''
</P>
<P>
   So far as Baldwin personally being a member of the Communist
Party, there's no evidence, although he was known to be ``extremely
active'' in the American left in the 1920s and '30s, as The New
York Times reported at his death. The Times obituary went on to
say: ``A member of no party, he was nonetheless amenable to helping
the Communists, Socialists and Leftists. By 1940, however, he had
experienced a change of heart about the Communists . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently took part in a Catholic wedding. The priest told
me I could not receive Communion during the mass because I am not
Catholic, although I take Communion at my own church. Can you
explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The book ``Believers and Beliefs,'' subtitled ``A Practical
Guide to Religious Etiquette for Business and Social Occasions,''
by Atlanta Journal-Constitution religion writer Gayle Colquitt
White, explains: ``The Catholic church restricts consumption of the
elements of the eucharist to those who are considered in a state of
grace, having confessed any sins and living within the law of the
church. This means only baptized Catholics and members of Eastern
Orthodox churches who have met certain conditions are supposed to
partake. . . . Non-Catholics should sit quietly in their pews, or
if they wish to be blessed by the priest, move forward with arms
crossed across the chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between an earthquake and an
aftershock? And can an aftershock be stronger than the original
earthquake?
</P>
<P>
   A: The difference is in degree. Let's first define what an
earthquake is: a shaking of the ground caused by the sudden
breaking and shifting of large sections of the Earth's rocky outer
shell. Aftershocks are ``smaller earthquakes following the largest
one in a series, concentrated in a restricted crustal volume,'' as
defined by the U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   So no, by definition an aftershock cannot be stronger than the
original quake. But the damage, coming on top of what the first one
has done, can be quite severe. And frequently more than one
aftershock occurs, further increasing the devastation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in Bruce Tinsley, creator of the Mallard
Fillmore political cartoons. What can you tell us about him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Born in Louisville, Ky., Tinsley created the Mallard Fillmore
duck in July 1990 as a logo for an entertainment section in The
Daily Progress in Charlottesville, Va. He was an editorial
cartoonist and graphic artist there.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley said he first drew a big, blue hippo for the logo, but
was warned that overweight people might be offended. He next
submitted a caricature of an artiste with a big nose, like the late
comedian Jimmy Durante had, but that didn't fly, either. He finally
settled on a duck named closely after Millard Fillmore (1800-74),
the Whig who was 13th president of the United States. ``The duck
won by default,'' Tinsley said. ``It didn't offend anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mallard Fillmore comic strip first appeared weekly in The
Washington Times in September 1991, and has been syndicated
nationally ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The strip has been called the conservative answer to Doonesbury,
created by Garry Trudeau. Tinsley says the cartoon's basic
political message is that the media are overloaded with liberals
who impart a liberal slant to news coverage, and that big
government is a threat to individual liberty. That viewpoint, he
admits, reflects his own beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Former Vice President Dan Quayle has ended his bid for the
Republican presidential nomination. An article said he had raised
about $4 million. Does he have to return it to contributors, or
does he keep it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like all presidential and congressional candidates, he cannot
convert the money for his own personal use, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union. Before 1993, it would have been possible
to do so, but the law was changed in that year to make the practice
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Quayle or any other candidate must refund
the money to contributors, Sepp added. They can do so if they wish,
or they can donate it to another political party organization, or
conceivably they could donate it to a charity. A number of members
of Congress made such charitable donations after the law was
changed in 1993, Sepp said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the Reform Party so much in the news, is it true that
Jesse Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota with less than 50
percent of the vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Ventura, the first Reform Party candidate to be elected
to statewide office, captured 37 percent of more than 2 million
ballots cast. Republican Norm Coleman, the mayor of St. Paul,
received 34 percent of the vote. State Attorney General Hubert H.
Humphrey 3rd, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nominee, garnered
28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the status of Ted Turner's $1 billion gift to the
United Nations? How has the money been distributed so far, if any
has?
</P>
<P>
   A: The United Nations Foundation has awarded more than $108
million, according to foundation spokesman David Harwood. Of that,
24 percent ($26.4 million) was designated for children's health, 25
percent ($27 million) for the environment, 35 percent ($37.7
million) for women and population, and 16 percent ($17.8 million)
for ``select U.N. causes.'' An emergency $1 million grant also was
made in April to support relief efforts in the Kosovo region.
</P>
<P>
   The television mogul's $1 billion gift is in the form of
Time-Warner stock, capped at 18 million shares, to be funded in 10
annual installments to the United Nations Foundation and other
charities estabished to support U.N. causes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The movie ``Double Jeopardy'' is based on the concept that a
person can't be found guilty of the same crime more than once. Is
there really such a term in legal practice?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is such a thing. As defined by Black's Law Dictionary,
double jeopardy is a Fifth Amendment guarantee, enforceable against
states through the 14th Amendment, protecting against a second
prosecution for the same offense after acquittal or conviction, and
against multiple punishments for the same offense.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's basic premise is different in a significant way.
As the story unfolds, Nick Parsons, the handsome, successful
husband (played by Bruce Greenwood) is missing from a sailboat.
Just as the Coast Guard arrives, his wife, Libby (Ashley Judd)
picks up a bloody knife. She's swiftly convicted of murder. But he
wasn't actually killed; his apparent death was faked so he could
collect insurance money.
</P>
<P>
   The faulty premise is that filmgoers are told that someone
falsely convicted of murder can get away with actually killing the
same person, since the constitutional protection against double
jeopardy prohibits being tried twice for the same crime. Of course,
the real murder in this particular scenario would be a wholly
separate felony, committed at a different time and place, same
victim or not.
</P>
<P>
   But that's Hollywood, and it hasn't kept ``Double Jeopardy''
from becoming a hit.

THIS WILL BE NO GAME OF CANDID CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>

 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Red Sox won't need to arm their
counterintelligence forces with infrared glasses and drop them into
Jacobs Field by parachute in the middle of the night. Espionage and
intrigue will not be factors in their Division Series against the
Indians. The notorious I Spy camera in center field will remain
covered in white canvas, as it has been for the past two weeks, per
request of the American League at the behest of the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove has another suggestion
for solving the case once and for all and preventing further
accusations of high treason: ``I'd just as soon get rid of the
s.o.b.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the camera, which he considers a nuisance,
not to the Boston personnel who during their last visit, Sept.
12-15, accused the Indians of employing it to pick up the opposing
catcher's signals, beaming the video to the home dugout, then
having the information on the upcoming pitch relayed to the batter
by that most sophisticated of clandestine weaponry _ a human
whistle. Hargrove probably considers the Boston whistleblowers
nuisances, too, but he's too busy laughing off the entire incident
as pure paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they thought we were actually doing it,'' he said, ``I
would hope they'd think we're smarter than to pass it on through
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, we've never stolen anything, and one thing
people will say about me is that I won't lie. Given a choice
between lying and not saying anything, I'll go with `no comment.'
''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Indians general manager John Hart had for his Red
Sox counterpart, Dan Duquette, when he was advised of the
allegations. ``I didn't bother to call Dan,'' said Hart, ``because
the whole thing was so ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two GMs are good friends, and when their families get
together this winter for their annual ski vacation at Attitash or
Duquette's new retreat in Maine, Hart will have a question for his
host: ``How did we do it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just consider the logistics,'' said Hart. ``First of all, look
in our dugout. We have a camera that shows the batter's area, same
as they have in the visitors' dugout. No hidden cameras. No hidden
mikes. Otherwise, the picture we get is the same one everyone else
in the park gets (on a center-field video screen) _ the network
feed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Indians had access to the precious view from center,
Hart wondered, what would they do with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, let's say I'm in the dugout runway getting the signal,''
said the GM. ``Then I have to relay it to a guy at the top of the
steps. Then he has to relay it to the guy in the on-deck circle.
Then he has to relay it to the batter. In a matter of
microseconds.''
</P>
<P>
   That's assuming they could find any conspirators to begin with.
Such good scouts are the Indians that according to one club source,
they have refused requests to relay pitch signals from second base
to the batter, which is considered unethical but is still practiced
by some players.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, the Red Sox will be happy. The Indians are
setting their visitors' minds at rest, even though it's obvious
they believe the Sox are just whistling ``Dixie.''

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: Edmund Morris, author of the controversial new biography of
Ronald Reagan, previously won a Pulitzer Prize for a biography of
the early life of Theodore Roosevelt. I thought Morris was working
on a sequel to that. Do you know the status?
</P>
<P>
   A: Morris says he hopes the Roosevelt sequel, ``Theodore Rex,''
will be out on Sept. 14, 2001, the centenary of his accession to
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some months ago, the American Airlines pilots' union was
fined $10 million for its ``sick-in'' campaign against the airline.
Was it ever paid?
</P>
<P>
   A: The fine, assessed by U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall in
April against the Allied Pilots Association, actually was $45.5
million. The union is appealing, said a spokeswoman for AMR Corp.,
American's parent company. Kendall has said interest will accrue
until the $45.5 million is paid.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots began calling in sick Feb 6 to demand guarantees they
wouldn't lose out on promotions and flights to the lower-paid
pilots of Reno Air, which American bought. The job action led to
6,600 canceled flights, with the fine resulting when the pilots
disobeyed Kendall's return-to-work order.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the circumstances of the death of country music
performer BoxCar Willie? Also, how did he get his start?
</P>
<P>
   A: The entertainer died April 12 in Branson, Mo., after a long
battle with leukemia. He had been diagnosed with the disease three
years ago, and after a brief remission it returned last year. Until
his health began to fail, BoxCar Willie _ born Lecil Travis Martin
in Sterrett, Texas, on Sept. 1, 1931_ performed as many as six
shows a week at the BoxCar Willie Theatre in Branson.
</P>
<P>
   BoxCar Willie was an invented hobo character whose creation
propelled Martin to fame. His singing career never got off the
ground while he was performing under the name Marty Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'60s, Martin wrote a song called ``BoxCar Willie,''
based on a hobo he saw on a train while he was stuck in traffic.
The hobo reminded Martin of a buddy named Willie Wilson, he said,
so the character was born. He adopted the name as his performance
character and dressed like a hobo on stage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he replaced a sick George Jones at a Nashville club. As
BoxCar Willie, Martin was spotted by a Scottish booking agent who
took him on a tour of England. Further tours in England established
his popularity there. In the early '80s he was a regular on
television's ``Hee Haw,'' while cranking out a number of albums as
well as playing a hobo in ``Sweet Dreams,'' a film about Patsy
Cline.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People say that Georgia's Stone Mountain is the largest stone
monolith in the world. How does it compare to the one in Australia?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ayers Rock, in central Australia's Uluru National Park, is
bigger, but Stone Mountain is the largest piece of exposed granite
in the world. Ayers Rock rises more than 1,130 feet above the
surrounding desert plain. The oval sandstone rock measures 2.2
miles long by 1 1/2 miles wide.
</P>
<P>
   World Book Encyclopedia describes Stone Mountain as ``the
largest smooth-sided rock dome in North America,'' measuring about
2 miles long by 1 mile wide. At its highest point, the granite mass
rises more than 700 feet above the surrounding terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The recent loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter because of
confusion between English and metric measurements prompts my
question: What has happened to efforts to initiate the use of the
metric system in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Public acceptance continues to be slow, but the federal
government hasn't backed away from supporting a conversion to
metric.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed by Congress in 1975 established a policy of
voluntary conversion to the metric system of weights and measures
for U.S. trade and commerce, and an amended bill passed in 1988
made metric the ``preferred'' system. In addition, the bill called
for agencies of the federal government to use metric for purchases,
grants, and other business-related activities. And many U.S.-made
products that compete in the global market are in metric.
</P>
<P>
   At some point _ especially if other countries stop buying
non-metric goods _ that competition may force the United States to
change. After all, according to the U.S. Metric Association, 99
percent of the rest of the world uses metric.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported several weeks ago that the remains of an
ancient person, thought to date to 3,500 years ago, were found in
Canada. Testing was to be done at a lab, but I never saw or heard
anything else about it. Can you update me?
</P>
<P>
   A: The well-preserved remains, whose discovery was announced
Aug. 24, aren't nearly as old as originally was speculated. Initial
reports about the remains, found in a glacier in a remote corner of
northwestern British Columbia, said only that scientists and tribal
leaders had discovered ``an ancient man'' on Aug. 14 in
Tatshenshini-Alsek Park.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at first had thought the remains could be up to
10,000 years old. But clothes on the mummified adult male, now
called Kwaday Dan Sinchi _ ``Long Ago Person Found'' in the
language of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations tribe of the
region _ have been determined to be considerably more recent.
Carbon-dating tests conducted on the apparel indicate that the man
met his fate sometime between 1415 and 1445.
</P>
<P>
   The body is being stored at the Royal British Columbia Museum in
Victoria while scientists develop a research plan. The research
will be under joint provincial and aboriginal supervision. After
that, the body will be returned to the Champagne-Aishihik for
burial.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I frequently read and hear about Social Security trust funds.
What are they, how are they funded, and how are they invested?
</P>
<P>
   A: The trust funds are financial accounts in the U.S. Treasury
funded by Social Security and Medicare taxes, premiums and other
income. The only purposes for which these trust funds can be used
are to pay Social Security and Medicare benefits and program
administrative costs, said Patti Patterson of the Social Security
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the assets of the Social Security program must be
invested in interest-bearing government securities or in securities
whose principal and interest is guaranteed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The trust funds hold a mix of short-term and long-term
government bonds. The funds can hold both regular Treasury
securities and ``special obligation'' securities issued only to
federal trust funds. In practice, the securities in the Social
Security trust funds are of the ``special obligation'' type,
according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   These funds earn interest set at the average market yield on
long-term Treasury securities. Interest from investments in 1998
amounted to $49.3 billion, representing an effective annual
interest rate of 7.2 percent, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the first person to receive monthly Social Security
benefits?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ida May Fuller of Ludlow, Vt., starting Jan. 31, 1940. Three
years earlier, Ernest Ackerman of Cleveland received the first
benefit payment, a lump-sum, one-time payout of 17 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Members of my household are curious about Robert Novak of
CNN's ``Crossfire.'' Do you know anything about his educational and
professional background? Also, what is his address?
</P>
<P>
   A: Novak, who was born Feb. 26, 1931, in Joliet, Ill., took his
first news jobs as a reporter for the Joliet Herald-News and the
Champaign-Urbana (Ill.) Courier while attending the University of
Illinois between 1948 and 1952. He has a bachelor's of arts degree
from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of Army duty (1952-54), Novak joined the staff
of the Associated Press in Omaha, Neb., and after that was assigned
to Indianapolis. In 1957, the AP transferred him to Washington,
where he helped cover Congress. He joined the Washington bureau of
The Wall Street Journal in 1958 and became the newspaper's chief
congressional correspondent in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Novak teamed with Rowland Evans to write ``Inside
Report,'' a syndicated political column, which evolved into a
newsletter, ``The Evans-Novak Political Report.'' Novak has been a
comentator for Corinthian Broadcasting in Washington, as well as a
commentator on CNN. He hosts ``Crossfire'' with Mary Matalin and
Bill Press. Novak also has written four books.
</P>
<P>
   Mail can be sent to him in care of CNN, 820 First St. NE,
Washington, DC 20002.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the official residence of the vice
president of the United States. What can you tell us about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 33-room mansion is on the grounds of the U.S. Naval
Observatory, on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington. Formerly known
as the Admiral's House, the residence served as the home of the
observatory superintendent until 1928, and of the chief of naval
operations until 1974. Adm. Elmo Zumwalt was the last naval
resident. Although the president has had an official Washington
residence since 1800, not until July 1974 did Congress give the
vice president a permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Washington architect Leon E. Dessez and completed in
1893, the house is a Queen Anne-style, three-story, brick and wood
frame structure barely visible from the road. The first floor
consists of an entrance hall, dining room, living room, library and
administrative offices. Four bedrooms, plus a master bedroom suite,
are on the second and third floors, along with a family room,
kitchenette and office. The main kitchen, laundry, and quarters for
the staff and Secret Service are in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The house is on 12 acres, landscaped in the style of an English
park. The Navy still owns and maintains the house and supplies
staff, including six enlistees who serve as stewards.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many children does Sen. John McCain have? I've seen it
reported as both five and seven.
</P>
<P>
   A: McCain (R-Ariz.) married his first wife, Carol, in 1965, and
adopted her two sons, Douglas and Andrew. They had a daughter,
Sidney Ann. The couple divorced in 1980. Later that same year,
McCain married Cindy Hensley. They have four children, Meghan,
Jack, Jim and Bridget.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain the basics of the Higher Education Act of
1965? Who initiated it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The act was sponsored by Rep. Edith Green, a Democrat from
Oregon, It embodied numerous requests of President Lyndon Johnson
and was enacted with broad bipartisan support in Congress. It was
passed Oct. 20, 1965, by a 313-63 House vote and Senate voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary in several aspects, particularly in its student
aid provisions, the act initially was an eight-part, $840 million
bill. With it, Congress approved federal scholarships for
undergraduate students for the first time in U.S. history. Another
new aid program under the act was insurance on loans, with federal
subsidies on interest payments. Also included were new programs of
graduate study for public school teachers, prospective teachers and
other school personnel, including social workers and guidance
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Other sections of the act authorized funds for community service
programs focusing on urban problems, to be conducted by colleges
and universities; grants to improve college libraries and train
librarians; a program to raise the academic quality of developing
institutions; and equipment grants to improve classroom instruction
in the sciences, humanities, art and education.

<P>
   Q: I understand that a U.S. helicopter went down in Colombia
recently with five American soldiers aboard, but I haven't seen
much about it. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported by many news outlets, it was a U.S. Army
DeHavilland RC-7 reconnaissance plane that crashed July 23 while
flying on an anti-drug mission in a rebel-occupied area of southern
Colombia near the Ecuador border. Five U.S. soldiers _ including a
woman pilot _ and two Colombian air force officers were killed when
the aircraft hit a 9,000-foot peak while circling above a major
drug-producing area.
</P>
<P>
   The American soldiers, who were based at Fort Bliss, at El Paso,
Texas, were said to be the first U.S. military personnel killed
while fighting illegal drugs in Colombia. Since 1997, three
American pilots flying drug-interdiction missions for a private
U.S. military contractor also have been killed, according to a
report in Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   As Newsweek also reported, while American officials sought to
downplay the RC-7 mission as a routine anti-narcotics patrol, the
aircraft was packed with sophisticated intelligence equipment that
would be useful in tracking guerrilla movements. ``This had to do
with surveillance,'' the magazine quoted a source familiar with the
flight's mission as saying. ``We're not supposed to be monitoring
guerrillas, but that's what they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I used to enjoy watching Spencer Christian, the weatherman on
``Good Morning America,'' but he's no longer there. Where is he
now, and how can fans write to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: As previously reported, he parted ways with ABC on Jan. 1
after his contract was not renewed. The jovial, wisecracking
Christian now works at KGO-TV in San Francisco. Write to him in
care of the station, 900 Front St., San Francisco, CA 94111.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the K stand for in Y2K?
</P>
<P>
   A: This question comes up often. It represents kilo (thousand),
as in kilometer (1,000 meters) or kilogram (1,000 grams). So in
Y2K, Y is Year and 2K is two thousand (designating, obviously, the
year 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that President Jimmy Carter awarded the nation's
highest civilian medal to Roger Baldwin, founder of the American
Civil Liberties Union. The letter further stated that Baldwin was a
member of the Communist Party. Can you verify if any of this is
true?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta confirmed that on
Jan. 16, 1981, Carter awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to
Baldwin, who founded the ACLU in 1920. Baldwin, who was born in
1884, died on Aug. 26, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Some early critics indeed did accuse the ACLU of defending only
Communists, but the organization responded by pointing out that for
the same reason it defended them, it also defended Nazis and
members of the Ku Klux Klan. It explained that it defended not
their doctrines, but their right to make them known as guaranteed
by the Bill of Rights. Current Biography (1940), in its section on
Baldwin, quoted this as the ACLU's statement of purpose: ``We stand
on general principle that all matters of public concern should be
freely discussed without interference.''
</P>
<P>
   So far as Baldwin personally being a member of the Communist
Party, there's no evidence, although he was known to be ``extremely
active'' in the American left in the 1920s and '30s, as The New
York Times reported at his death. The Times obituary went on to
say: ``A member of no party, he was nonetheless amenable to helping
the Communists, Socialists and Leftists. By 1940, however, he had
experienced a change of heart about the Communists . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently took part in a Catholic wedding. The priest told
me I could not receive Communion during the mass because I am not
Catholic, although I take Communion at my own church. Can you
explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The book ``Believers and Beliefs,'' subtitled ``A Practical
Guide to Religious Etiquette for Business and Social Occasions,''
by Atlanta Journal-Constitution religion writer Gayle Colquitt
White, explains: ``The Catholic church restricts consumption of the
elements of the eucharist to those who are considered in a state of
grace, having confessed any sins and living within the law of the
church. This means only baptized Catholics and members of Eastern
Orthodox churches who have met certain conditions are supposed to
partake. . . . Non-Catholics should sit quietly in their pews, or
if they wish to be blessed by the priest, move forward with arms
crossed across the chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between an earthquake and an
aftershock? And can an aftershock be stronger than the original
earthquake?
</P>
<P>
   A: The difference is in degree. Let's first define what an
earthquake is: a shaking of the ground caused by the sudden
breaking and shifting of large sections of the Earth's rocky outer
shell. Aftershocks are ``smaller earthquakes following the largest
one in a series, concentrated in a restricted crustal volume,'' as
defined by the U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   So no, by definition an aftershock cannot be stronger than the
original quake. But the damage, coming on top of what the first one
has done, can be quite severe. And frequently more than one
aftershock occurs, further increasing the devastation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in Bruce Tinsley, creator of the Mallard
Fillmore political cartoons. What can you tell us about him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Born in Louisville, Ky., Tinsley created the Mallard Fillmore
duck in July 1990 as a logo for an entertainment section in The
Daily Progress in Charlottesville, Va. He was an editorial
cartoonist and graphic artist there.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley said he first drew a big, blue hippo for the logo, but
was warned that overweight people might be offended. He next
submitted a caricature of an artiste with a big nose, like the late
comedian Jimmy Durante had, but that didn't fly, either. He finally
settled on a duck named closely after Millard Fillmore (1800-74),
the Whig who was 13th president of the United States. ``The duck
won by default,'' Tinsley said. ``It didn't offend anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mallard Fillmore comic strip first appeared weekly in The
Washington Times in September 1991, and has been syndicated
nationally ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The strip has been called the conservative answer to Doonesbury,
created by Garry Trudeau. Tinsley says the cartoon's basic
political message is that the media are overloaded with liberals
who impart a liberal slant to news coverage, and that big
government is a threat to individual liberty. That viewpoint, he
admits, reflects his own beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Former Vice President Dan Quayle has ended his bid for the
Republican presidential nomination. An article said he had raised
about $4 million. Does he have to return it to contributors, or
does he keep it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like all presidential and congressional candidates, he cannot
convert the money for his own personal use, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union. Before 1993, it would have been possible
to do so, but the law was changed in that year to make the practice
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Quayle or any other candidate must refund
the money to contributors, Sepp added. They can do so if they wish,
or they can donate it to another political party organization, or
conceivably they could donate it to a charity. A number of members
of Congress made such charitable donations after the law was
changed in 1993, Sepp said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the Reform Party so much in the news, is it true that
Jesse Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota with less than 50
percent of the vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Ventura, the first Reform Party candidate to be elected
to statewide office, captured 37 percent of more than 2 million
ballots cast. Republican Norm Coleman, the mayor of St. Paul,
received 34 percent of the vote. State Attorney General Hubert H.
Humphrey 3rd, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nominee, garnered
28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the status of Ted Turner's $1 billion gift to the
United Nations? How has the money been distributed so far, if any
has?
</P>
<P>
   A: The United Nations Foundation has awarded more than $108
million, according to foundation spokesman David Harwood. Of that,
24 percent ($26.4 million) was designated for children's health, 25
percent ($27 million) for the environment, 35 percent ($37.7
million) for women and population, and 16 percent ($17.8 million)
for ``select U.N. causes.'' An emergency $1 million grant also was
made in April to support relief efforts in the Kosovo region.
</P>
<P>
   The television mogul's $1 billion gift is in the form of
Time-Warner stock, capped at 18 million shares, to be funded in 10
annual installments to the United Nations Foundation and other
charities estabished to support U.N. causes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The movie ``Double Jeopardy'' is based on the concept that a
person can't be found guilty of the same crime more than once. Is
there really such a term in legal practice?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is such a thing. As defined by Black's Law Dictionary,
double jeopardy is a Fifth Amendment guarantee, enforceable against
states through the 14th Amendment, protecting against a second
prosecution for the same offense after acquittal or conviction, and
against multiple punishments for the same offense.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's basic premise is different in a significant way.
As the story unfolds, Nick Parsons, the handsome, successful
husband (played by Bruce Greenwood) is missing from a sailboat.
Just as the Coast Guard arrives, his wife, Libby (Ashley Judd)
picks up a bloody knife. She's swiftly convicted of murder. But he
wasn't actually killed; his apparent death was faked so he could
collect insurance money.
</P>
<P>
   The faulty premise is that filmgoers are told that someone
falsely convicted of murder can get away with actually killing the
same person, since the constitutional protection against double
jeopardy prohibits being tried twice for the same crime. Of course,
the real murder in this particular scenario would be a wholly
separate felony, committed at a different time and place, same
victim or not.
</P>
<P>
   But that's Hollywood, and it hasn't kept ``Double Jeopardy''
from becoming a hit.
</P>

   SEX-DISEASE _ Despite public health's best efforts, sexually
transmitted diseases remain a problem in the United States. A new
report from The Guttmacher Institute suggests that's in large part
because 17 percent of people who test positive for an STD are not
in a monogamous relationship, but they think they are and so don't
think they're at risk for a sexual disease. (McKenna, Atlanta

mind that Hidden Valley has no less than 52 varieties of apples. As
fierce as Mobley's allegiance is to Galas, other customers are
equally as enthusiastic and loyal to their varieties, be they
Melrose, Fuji, Cortland, Braeburn, Granny Smith or Golden
Delicious. Still, subtle taste shifts do occur, nudged along by the

   APPLES-SIDE _ The late-summer drought hit some orchards hard,

   SEX-DISEASE _ Despite public health's best efforts, sexually
transmitted diseases remain a problem in the United States. A new
report from The Guttmacher Institute suggests that's in large part
because 17 percent of people who test positive for an STD are not
in a monogamous relationship, but they think they are and so don't
think they're at risk for a sexual disease. (McKenna, Atlanta

HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL IN THE FALL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's all around you. At the newsstand, the diner, the office
copier. Folks stand around, smell the autumn air, and offer . . .
</P>
<P>
   (itals)I know I said this last time, but I'm really beginning to
think this might be the year.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   If you've just logged on to www.redsox.com, it's happening
again, ladies and gentlemen. Otherwise rational people suddenly
think the Sox are going to win the World Series for the first time
since 1918.
</P>
<P>
   In this there is energy, innocence, and a disregard for the
past. It's the old ``people forget pain'' syndrome. It is said that
if women could recreate childbirth, they'd never have more babies.
Same for marathon runners and Red Sox fans. If you could remember
how it felt last time, you wouldn't do it again, but you can't
really remember the pain, so you go back and get your hopes up for
the Red Sox. Again.
</P>
<P>
   My neighbor said he had a dream that the Sox would win. Another
friend, sounding like an alcoholic who thinks he can handle just
two glasses of wine with dinner, said he's convinced Pedro Martinez
is going to make all the difference. And Tuesday's office mail
included ``Apocalypse and Baseball,'' a prophetic poem outlining
how the Red Sox will be champs. Any day now I'm expecting Joe
Mooney's ``Leaves On Grass'' and ``A Week on the Concord and
Merrimack Rivers with Joe Castiglione.''
</P>
<P>
   I love these people. Citizens of Red Sox Nation should have
``kick me'' signs on their backs. They are the jilted lovers who
keep going back, no matter how many times they replay the tape of
Bill Buckner, no matter how many times they listen to ``Won't Get
Fooled Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Red Sox are playing in October, there is irrational
hope. Like annual losers on Wall Street, Red Sox fans see the
upcoming playoffs and think, (itals)This time it's
different.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   This is what is best about New England _ the continuousness, the
connection to the past. Nothing ever changes. For some of us,
there's weird comfort in that.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why the Red Sox, more than any trendy sports team of
any decade (Bruins in the 70s, Celtics in the 80s, Patriots now)
are the only sports institution that truly matters around here.
They can be hideous, but they never go out of style and their
storyline is forever.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are in Cleveland Wednesday night for Game 1 of a
best-of-five with the Tribe. Boston has the best pitcher in
baseball (Pedro), plus American League batting champ Nomar
Garciaparra and a gritty band of overachievers. The Sox have been
astonishingly resilient, and managed to improve over last season
despite the subtraction of Mo Vaughn and injury to closer Tom
Gordon. In Jimy Williams they have a manager who got more out of
less than any man in baseball in 1999. And they have a raft of
tough, veteran ex-National League pitchers who know how to win.
</P>
<P>
   They can beat Cleveland, but only if Pedro wins. But could they
win a second series, against the winner of Yankees-Rangers, and
then a World Series against the survivor of the
Mets-Braves-Diamondbacks-Astros bakeoff?
</P>
<P>
   Highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But it's possible. The 1999 Red Sox are certainly as good as the
1988 Dodgers who beat the A's or the 1990 Reds who swept Oakland.
The best team does not always win a postseason series and a stopper
of Pedro's magnitude can hide many weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   But know that the 1999 Sox are long shots, just as they were in
'86, '88, '90, '95, and last autumn. If you think this is the year,
try to remember that you probably felt the same for the Morgan
Magic Sox of 1988, or the Kevin Kennedy Sox of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice that the Red Sox have made so many playoff appearances
in recent years and the Sox like to brag that this is their first
back-to-back postseason parlay since 1915-16, but some perspective
is in order. When the Sox were winning back-to-back championships
eight decades ago, they were finishing first in an eight-team
league. In those days, only two of 16 big league teams went to the
playoffs. Now we've got eight of 30 going to the postseason. The
'96 Sox owned only the fourth-best record in the American League,
which would not have gotten them anywhere in the days when second
wasn't good enough for Ted Williams and Co.
</P>
<P>
   October has been cruel to Boston baseball fans. The Sox lug a
monstrous postseason slump into The Jake. Starting with the Buckner
grounder in '86, your Red Sox have lost a startling 16 of their
last 17 postseason games, a record that is unlikely to be
duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   But if Pedro continues to dominate and Bret Saberhagen is on his
game, and Ramon Martinez reverts to his old form, and they get some
timely hits, and the bullpen does the job, and the Tribe slumps,
and Clemens chokes, and Jupiter aligns with Mars . . .
</P>
<P>
   (itals)This could be the year.(unitals)

COLON HAS BEEN A MODEL FOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Bartolo Colon idolizes his fellow Dominican native,
Pedro Martinez. But the homage is getting ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night in the opener of the best-of-five Division
Series, the Indians righthander will oppose the Red Sox' Cy Young
cinch for the fifth time. In their first four meetings, Colon has
pitched well. Martinez has pitched better _ no surprise, since
virtually every one of the Boston righthander's rivals can offer a
similar lament.
</P>
<P>
   Colon is 0-2 with a 2.57 ERA when he's opposed Martinez, who
answers with a record of 3-0 and a 1.64 ERA in those encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Colon, who went 18-5 this season, realizes that this would be a
great time to alter that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy that I got this opportunity,'' he said Tuesday
through his interpreter, catcher Sandy Alomar, ``and I will do the
best I can to come out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he'll have to stop bowing toward Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the All-Star Game, I had the opportunity to talk to him,''
said Colon, who will be followed to the mound by Charles Nagy in
Game 2 Thursday. ``Whenever we get together for a game or before
the game, whenever we see each other, we have conversations about
pitching. He's a great person. He can help me a lot with my
pitching and with life, and he's a good person to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colon looks up to me and respects me a lot,'' said the humble
role model. ``Even though he is not on my team, I try to teach him
the right things and tell him how to do it because so far, he's
been good to me. So I would like him to learn the same way, and he
seems to be doing it because he makes it tough for me every time I
face him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians manager Mike Hargrove hopes Colon can make it a tad
tougher on Martinez this time. While there is no question that
Martinez is the ace of the Red Sox, Colon, 24, is at best a
reasonable facsimile for Cleveland. During the first half of the
season, he was 7-3, but his ERA was an unsightly 5.35. In the
second half, he revved up to 11-2, 2.60.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bartolo has been awfully good for us the second half of the
year,'' said Hargrove. ``He's been very consistent with what he has
thrown and has kept us in the games he started. So right now
Bartolo is as close as we come to a No. 1. I can't sit here today
and tell you he is a No. 1 because I think that has to be
established and Bartolo is in the process of doing that. But it's
still work unfinished.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove would settle for a step forward.

<P>
   Pity Maria Bartiromo, the comely CNBC business anchor who gets
more attention for her looks than her reporting skills. She's been
dubbed ``The Money Honey'' by the New York Post and hit on by
comedian Richard Lewis as he called into a show she was hosting.
</P>
<P>
   There's even The Maria Bartiromo Market Hairdex, a Web site
devoted to monitoring the correlation between Bartiromo's cowlicks
and stock trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me,'' Bartiromo says. ``I know it's all in
good fun. Viewers know I'm about rapid-fire reports from the New
York Stock Exchange floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartiromo, 31, is clearly not just another pretty talking head.
She studied economics at New York University and can dilate at
length on the economic factors driving the current buff market. And
when it comes to breaking news, Bartiromo can be as aggressive as
any arbitrager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my viewers what all the major trading floors are doing
in their morning meetings,'' she says. ``My trick is to get the
information a lot earlier than most reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment banks such as Merrill Lynch and Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;

   ``It's so refreshing to see a beautiful girl doing finance,''
says Diane Von Furstenberg. ``When I was on her show, she was so

</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Bartiromo's next move heated up in mid-June
amid rumors that she was being considered to replace Lou Dobbs, the
popular anchor of CNN's ``Moneyline News Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartiromo ultimately signed a new contract with CNBC, but
sources say the big three broadcast networks are keeping a close
eye on her.
</P>
<P>
   While the contract relieves Bartiromo of anchoring duties on
CNBC's flagship ``Business Center,'' the new deal gives her a solo
anchoring slot on ``Street Signs'' from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., as well
as a new evening program, which she says will be filmed live at ``a
major financial institution, probably the New York Stock
Exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of the new show as Wall Street Week for the coffee
generation, says Bartiromo's boss, CNBC business news chief Bruno
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking on Louis Rukeyser,'' Bartiromo says of the PBS
host. ``I'm targeting his audience. We're going to interview all
the top strategists and ceo's and try to make it fresher than
what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ceo's are incredibly exciting. I've been fortunate to hear
firsthand how the semiconductor business is doing from Intel
chairman Andy Grove. My job is sort of an instant entree into the
executive suite.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to investing her own portfolio, Bartiromo
claims she hasn't traded on her access to captains of industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't invest in any company listed on the New York Stock
Exchange,'' she says. ``People say I'm crazy, but I find it to be a
bit of a gray area. I skirt the issue by doing longterm mutual
funds as a way to participate in the bull market and still do the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Bartiromo married Individual Investor Group's Jonathan
Steinberg, the 34-year-old son of financier Saul Steinberg, in
front of 250 guests , including Barbara Walters and Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met through friends,'' Bartiromo says of her husband. ``We
are both driven and passionate about the financial world. My
mother-in-law, Gayfryd Steinberg,'' she adds, ``warned me not to
talk about my personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartiromo, however, is always happy to talk finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be aware of what their 401k is investing in,''
she says. ``The investor is armed with so much information, it's
crazy not to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to believe this stuff is over your head,''
she adds. ``A woman, particularly a woman, needs to know. It's not
brain surgery.'' &QL;

<P>
   Pity Maria Bartiromo, the comely CNBC business anchor who gets
more attention for her looks than her reporting skills. She's been
dubbed ``The Money Honey'' by the New York Post and hit on by
comedian Richard Lewis as he called into a show she was hosting.
</P>
<P>
   There's even The Maria Bartiromo Market Hairdex, a Web site
devoted to monitoring the correlation between Bartiromo's cowlicks
and stock trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me,'' Bartiromo says. ``I know it's all in
good fun. Viewers know I'm about rapid-fire reports from the New
York Stock Exchange floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartiromo, 31, is clearly not just another pretty talking head.
She studied economics at New York University and can dilate at
length on the economic factors driving the current buff market. And
when it comes to breaking news, Bartiromo can be as aggressive as
any arbitrager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my viewers what all the major trading floors are doing
in their morning meetings,'' she says. ``My trick is to get the
information a lot earlier than most reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment banks such as Merrill Lynch and Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette use their morning meetings to decide what stocks to
recommend to their clients, which in some cases include large
institutional investors, so word of their picks can really get a
stock moving.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Calvin Klein, the dean of clean American sportswear,
says it's time to get dirty.
</P>
<P>
   The designer is making ``dirty denim'' his major global fashion
statement for his spring 2000 CK Calvin Klein Jeans line.
</P>
<P>
   In what is believed to be the first coordinated product
initiative of this scope, dirty denim jeans are expected to be
carried in over 2,000 doors that have the CK Jeans brand worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Klein's entire CK Jeans advertising campaign next
season will promote jeans that are beaten, bruised and tinted to
look as though they'd been worn for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted something that was really relaxed and comfortable and
something that had an attitude that could look great on everyone,''
Klein said. ``Dark denim tends to be stiff. This is softer, worn in
and it has a really personal look. It's going to be a very strong
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein noted that most of the models arriving at his studio have
come in wearing jeans that look like they've been through something
more taxing than a glide down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone comes in wearing jeans that they look like they
own,'' he said. ``This look has a familiar quality to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein's powerful denim dictum comes at a time when the fabric is
enjoying an unprecedented renaissance in the highest rungs of
fashion. Denim looks dominated the runways here during New York
Fashion Week as designers from Marc Jacobs to Oscar de la Renta put
their spin on jeanswear for spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Klein plans to sling his message about dirty denim
in multiple ways. The spring CK Jeans print and outdoor campaign,
shot by Steven Klein in a Manhattan studio, features 10
up-and-coming musicians from a variety of genres, all wearing dirty
denim.
</P>
<P>
   The spots pick up on Klein's CK campaign theme for fall, which
focuses on musicians and young actors, including Foxy Brown, Liz
Phair and Leona Naess. It is believed the company spends about $30
million a year advertising CK Jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor images are slated to break in January. Print ads will
hit in February books. To promote dirty denim at the retail level,
stores will be decorated with images from the ad campaign and other
point-of-purchase materials.
</P>
<P>
   There are even special hangtags on the jeans that expound the
product's virtues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty denim looks and feels like it walked a thousand miles,
then crawled a few more. Lived a lifetime on horseback. Fell off a
motorcycle and got back up again,'' it reads. ``But this denim was
never worn by anyone. It's been scientifically blasted, twisted,
dyed and whipped by advanced machinery until it is perfectly,
uniquely worn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty denim is stonewashed, abraded and sandpapered by hand.
The yarn is ring-spun and the denim tinted for a naturally uneven
look. Whiskers are added for an aged appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda J. Wachner, chairman and chief executive officer of
Warnaco Group, which produces CK jeanswear under license, said
Klein's concept has been a hit for all divisions: women's, juniors,
men's and kid's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love dirty denim, especially since it's clean,'' Wachner
said. ``It's Calvin's idea and we think it's a great concept. We
loved it when we saw it. We think it's right on.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachner declined to pinpoint how much of its spring 2000 sales
were generated by dirty denim. However, she confirmed that all CK
Jeans accounts will carry the product in all doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to have a big increase in denim in the
first half,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts are forecasting the CK Calvin Klein Jeans
business to reach $600 million at wholesale this year. The business
rang up about $500 million last year, Wachner said.
</P>
<P>
   Dirty jeans are not dirt cheap. Owing to the amount of
hand-finishing necessary, the jeans will retail for $78, compared
to $48 to $52 for more basic styles.
</P>
<P>
   The first shipments of dirty denim are slated to bow in stores
as soon as mid-November as part of early spring shipments of
basics.
</P>
<P>
   Observers described Klein's initiative as bold and on target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the year of denim,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice
president and fashion director at Bloomingdale's. ``Denim rules and
Calvin is right on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Faye Landes, an analyst at Thomas Rosell Partners, agreed dirty
denim seems like a natural evolution for the CK jeans brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the brand has always been identified as popular
fashion while being a little bit on the cutting edge, so the new
line seems to be on the same wavelength,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Klein emphasized that dirty denim is only part of his
statement and shoppers will be given many other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a collection. The denim has to be surrounded by
other products,'' he said. ``Once you've got the consumer in the
department and she's interested in the jeans, if you've got great
looking knits, sweaters and outerwear that fit in with the
lifestyle, there's so much business to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Klein himself wear dirty denim?
</P>
<P>
   The designer confessed he does not yet have a pair, but he's
anxious to get some.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was on the shoot,'' he said, ``I wanted them _ and so
did the musicians.'' &QL;

   Pity Maria Bartiromo, the comely CNBC business anchor who gets
more attention for her looks than her reporting skills. She's been
dubbed ``The Money Honey'' by the New York Post and hit on by
comedian Richard Lewis as he called into a show she was hosting.
</P>
<P>
   There's even The Maria Bartiromo Market Hairdex, a Web site
devoted to monitoring the correlation between Bartiromo's cowlicks
and stock trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me,'' Bartiromo says. ``I know it's all in
good fun. Viewers know I'm about rapid-fire reports from the New
York Stock Exchange floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartiromo, 31, is clearly not just another pretty talking head.
She studied economics at New York University and can dilate at
length on the economic factors driving the current buff market. And
when it comes to breaking news, Bartiromo can be as aggressive as
any arbitrager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my viewers what all the major trading floors are doing
in their morning meetings,'' she says. ``My trick is to get the
information a lot earlier than most reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment banks such as Merrill Lynch and Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette use their morning meetings to decide what stocks to
recommend to their clients, which in some cases include large
institutional investors, so word of their picks can really get a
stock moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls from the trading desks saying, `Maria, you're
killing me,''' she says. ``It's a little bit of a balance to
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She thinks so fast,'' says discount brokerage queen Muriel
Siebert. ``That's a real talent. She's become a very powerful force
because she's got her name in front of breaking news items all the
time. This thing has really turned her into a star.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartiromo, who was the first person to broadcast live from the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange, is arguably the daytime face
of CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so refreshing to see a beautiful girl doing finance,''
says Diane Von Furstenberg. ``When I was on her show, she was so
nice and gracious. I think she has a big career ahead of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Bartiromo's next move heated up in mid-June
amid rumors that she was being considered to replace Lou Dobbs, the
popular anchor of CNN's ``Moneyline News Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartiromo ultimately signed a new contract with CNBC, but
sources say the big three broadcast networks are keeping a close
eye on her.
</P>
<P>
   While the contract relieves Bartiromo of anchoring duties on
CNBC's flagship ``Business Center,'' the new deal gives her a solo
anchoring slot on ``Street Signs'' from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., as well
as a new evening program, which she says will be filmed live at ``a
major financial institution, probably the New York Stock
Exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of the new show as Wall Street Week for the coffee
generation, says Bartiromo's boss, CNBC business news chief Bruno
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking on Louis Rukeyser,'' Bartiromo says of the PBS
host. ``I'm targeting his audience. We're going to interview all
the top strategists and ceo's and try to make it fresher than
what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ceo's are incredibly exciting. I've been fortunate to hear
firsthand how the semiconductor business is doing from Intel
chairman Andy Grove. My job is sort of an instant entree into the
executive suite.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to investing her own portfolio, Bartiromo
claims she hasn't traded on her access to captains of industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't invest in any company listed on the New York Stock
Exchange,'' she says. ``People say I'm crazy, but I find it to be a
bit of a gray area. I skirt the issue by doing longterm mutual
funds as a way to participate in the bull market and still do the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Bartiromo married Individual Investor Group's Jonathan
Steinberg, the 34-year-old son of financier Saul Steinberg, in
front of 250 guests , including Barbara Walters and Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met through friends,'' Bartiromo says of her husband. ``We
are both driven and passionate about the financial world. My
mother-in-law, Gayfryd Steinberg,'' she adds, ``warned me not to
talk about my personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartiromo, however, is always happy to talk finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be aware of what their 401k is investing in,''
she says. ``The investor is armed with so much information, it's
crazy not to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to believe this stuff is over your head,''
she adds. ``A woman, particularly a woman, needs to know. It's not
brain surgery.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Calvin Klein, the dean of clean American sportswear,
says it's time to get dirty.
</P>
<P>
   The designer is making ``dirty denim'' his major global fashion
statement for his spring 2000 CK Calvin Klein Jeans line.
</P>
<P>
   In what is believed to be the first coordinated product
initiative of this scope, dirty denim jeans are expected to be
carried in over 2,000 doors that have the CK Jeans brand worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Klein's entire CK Jeans advertising campaign next
season will promote jeans that are beaten, bruised and tinted to
look as though they'd been worn for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted something that was really relaxed and comfortable and
something that had an attitude that could look great on everyone,''
Klein said. ``Dark denim tends to be stiff. This is softer, worn in
and it has a really personal look. It's going to be a very strong
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein noted that most of the models arriving at his studio have
come in wearing jeans that look like they've been through something
more taxing than a glide down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone comes in wearing jeans that they look like they
own,'' he said. ``This look has a familiar quality to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein's powerful denim dictum comes at a time when the fabric is
enjoying an unprecedented renaissance in the highest rungs of
fashion. Denim looks dominated the runways here during New York
Fashion Week as designers from Marc Jacobs to Oscar de la Renta put
their spin on jeanswear for spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Klein plans to sling his message about dirty denim
in multiple ways. The spring CK Jeans print and outdoor campaign,
shot by Steven Klein in a Manhattan studio, features 10
up-and-coming musicians from a variety of genres, all wearing dirty
denim.
</P>
<P>
   The spots pick up on Klein's CK campaign theme for fall, which
focuses on musicians and young actors, including Foxy Brown, Liz
Phair and Leona Naess. It is believed the company spends about $30
million a year advertising CK Jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor images are slated to break in January. Print ads will
hit in February books. To promote dirty denim at the retail level,
stores will be decorated with images from the ad campaign and other
point-of-purchase materials.
</P>
<P>
   There are even special hangtags on the jeans that expound the
product's virtues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty denim looks and feels like it walked a thousand miles,
then crawled a few more. Lived a lifetime on horseback. Fell off a
motorcycle and got back up again,'' it reads. ``But this denim was
never worn by anyone. It's been scientifically blasted, twisted,
dyed and whipped by advanced machinery until it is perfectly,
uniquely worn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty denim is stonewashed, abraded and sandpapered by hand.
The yarn is ring-spun and the denim tinted for a naturally uneven
look. Whiskers are added for an aged appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda J. Wachner, chairman and chief executive officer of
Warnaco Group, which produces CK jeanswear under license, said
Klein's concept has been a hit for all divisions: women's, juniors,
men's and kid's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love dirty denim, especially since it's clean,'' Wachner
said. ``It's Calvin's idea and we think it's a great concept. We
loved it when we saw it. We think it's right on.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachner declined to pinpoint how much of its spring 2000 sales
were generated by dirty denim. However, she confirmed that all CK
Jeans accounts will carry the product in all doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to have a big increase in denim in the
first half,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts are forecasting the CK Calvin Klein Jeans
business to reach $600 million at wholesale this year. The business
rang up about $500 million last year, Wachner said.
</P>
<P>
   Dirty jeans are not dirt cheap. Owing to the amount of
hand-finishing necessary, the jeans will retail for $78, compared
to $48 to $52 for more basic styles.
</P>
<P>
   The first shipments of dirty denim are slated to bow in stores
as soon as mid-November as part of early spring shipments of
basics.
</P>
<P>
   Observers described Klein's initiative as bold and on target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the year of denim,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice
president and fashion director at Bloomingdale's. ``Denim rules and
Calvin is right on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Faye Landes, an analyst at Thomas Rosell Partners, agreed dirty
denim seems like a natural evolution for the CK jeans brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the brand has always been identified as popular
fashion while being a little bit on the cutting edge, so the new
line seems to be on the same wavelength,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Klein emphasized that dirty denim is only part of his
statement and shoppers will be given many other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a collection. The denim has to be surrounded by
other products,'' he said. ``Once you've got the consumer in the
department and she's interested in the jeans, if you've got great
looking knits, sweaters and outerwear that fit in with the
lifestyle, there's so much business to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Klein himself wear dirty denim?
</P>
<P>
   The designer confessed he does not yet have a pair, but he's
anxious to get some.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was on the shoot,'' he said, ``I wanted them _ and so
did the musicians.'' &QL;

INDIANS' STATS HARD TO BELIEVE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The numbers on the stat sheet appear to be part of
someone's creative writing project. They are not really the
Cleveland Indians, they are Jacobs Field's Men of Fiction.
</P>
<P>
   They were all here Tuesday, preparing for Wednesday's Division
Series opener against the Red Sox. You saw them. You talked to
them. You shook their hands. You remained skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Is this team real?
</P>
<P>
   They have a young player named Richie Sexson. He has 31 home
runs and 116 RBIs. He will be on the bench when the Red Sox play
these fictional Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if you're not able to play him every day,'' manager
Mike Hargrove said of Sexson, ``the alternative is pretty doggone
good.'' He used the word alternative in a singular context. He
should have said alternatives. He is using both David Justice and
Harold Baines rather than Sexson right now.
</P>
<P>
   We are talking about a team that is the seventh in history to
score more than 1,000 runs. There are five players who have scored
more than 100 runs and five who have driven in 100-plus. Manny
Ramirez drove in 165 runs and people here still debate if he is the
team MVP. A couple of seasons ago, the storybook Indians traded
Sean Casey to the Reds and Casey became that team's best hitter.
Last offseason, they traded Brian Giles to the Pirates for a
lefthanded reliever named Ricky Rincon. Giles hit 39 home runs,
Rincon was a regular-season bust. There aren't many complaints
about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are mesmerizing. The more you look the more you
begin to believe the Indians can't be stopped. But if you are
rooting against them, one thing is on your side _ history.
</P>
<P>
   You can leave Jacobs Field, head south, and, about 230 miles
later, you will find yourself in Cincinnati at the site where
another powerful offense was easily thwarted. The 1990 Reds crushed
the A's of Mark McGwire, Rickey Henderson, and Jose Canseco in the
World Series. At the time, Reds outfielder Eric Davis was told the
nation did not expect the Reds _ who won 91 regular-season games _
to disarm one of the most powerful offenses of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation doesn't concern me,'' Davis said at the time. ``The
nation ain't in this clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, the A's were silenced by the Dodgers and Orel
Hershiser in five games. McGwire and Canseco were a combined 2 for
36. And in '95, the Indians went into the playoffs with the
American League's best offense in 45 years. They went on to bat
.179 in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was four years ago,'' Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel said
Tuesday. ``That was a long time ago.'' It was before Vizquel was a
.333 hitter; before Ramirez was a cleanup hitter; before Roberto
Alomar stood next to Vizquel on defense; and before guys with 116
RBIs were relegated to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the '90 A's,'' Harold Baines said, ``but this is the
best offense I've ever been a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the playoffs have proven one thing, it is that terrific
defensive teams will almost always turn flamboyant offenses into
whispering ones. After the Indians were beaten by the Braves in the
'95 World Series, Tom Glavine said that he threw his changeup
constantly in the clinching Game 6 because the Indians didn't know
how to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is a frightening Indians stat from this season.
Forget about the fact that they have never beaten Pedro Martinez.
Against Tom Gordon, John Wasdin, Rod Beck, Derek Lowe, and Rheal
Cormier, the Indians are a combined 4 for 71. They are 1 for 30
against Lowe. They are 1 for 11 against Beck. Cormier has puzzled
them into a 1-for-19 funk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we have two or three guys having great years,''
Vizquel countered, explaining why this lineup is nearly
slump-proof. ``We have nine guys having great years.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to discredit the strength of the Indians, but there may be a
good explanation for that. The collective AL earned run average is
4.86 (the NL is 4.56). The team plays in the brutal Central
Division, which it won for the fifth consecutive season. In '95,
the Indians won the division by 30 games. This season, the margin
was 21 1/2. No team in the Central had its starters finish with an
ERA less than 5; the Indians led the division at 5.08.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove and Jimy Williams were asked, constantly, what the
difference is between these teams now and a year ago. They talked
about maturity, focus, and desire. But the biggest differences are
Roberto Alomar for the Indians and superior pitching for the Sox.
Boston led the league in starters' ERA (4.04) and was second in
relief pitching (3.93; the Yankees were first).
</P>
<P>
   Are the Indians, with all their offensive opulence, real? Or
will they, like other offensive teams, be haunted by history? It is
a fact that no AL team since 1950 had scored 1,000 or more runs. It
is also a fact that that team, the Red Sox, finished third and won
nothing.

DUQUETTE PLAYED CARDS RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They all got it wrong. Mo Vaughn, Roger Clemens, Jose
Canseco. The angry voices on talk radio and the sarcastic wiseguys
in the newspapers. Jealous peers and exasperated agents. The gamut
of those who aimed their slings and arrows at the general manager
of the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, Dan Duquette said, has never been Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the story for the fans of New England is the Red Sox
team,'' he says. ``That's what they're interested in. They're
interested in Dan Duquette to the extent he gives them a good ball
club.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the morning after the Red Sox clinched their second
consecutive trip to the playoffs, and in his Chicago hotel suite,
Duquette is having a worse hair day than usual, the left side of
his head at war with the right.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he cares. Duquette tells Kevin Shea, the team's
publicist, that try as he might, he hasn't been able to wash out
the beer and champagne he had been doused with the night before
from a cadre of players who pretended they were storming past him
for Jimy Williams, only to double back to give him a celebratory
soaking.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting phenomenon,'' he says. ``If we have a good
team, I'm well-received in the community. If the team isn't so
good, then I'm not as warmly received.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs again, this time without mirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more about the Red Sox'' _ he bites off those words for
emphasis _ ``and the organization. We're just passing through. We
have a great opportunity to be a part of the Red Sox organization,
to be a part of the leadership, but at the end of the day it's more
about the team than it is about Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent I can help these fans fulfill their lifelong
goals and dreams, they're interested in what I do. If I make good
choices, they'll support the team, they'll support me. They may not
like my choices, but if they're effective, they'll support the
team. For the fans of New England, it's more about the team than it
is about the general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette may never inspire love, though he was happy to report
that in the newsletter of his alma mater, Amherst College, he was
recently listed as the Lord Jeffs' ``Athlete of the Week.'' The Red
Sox had just swept the Yankees in New York, the Amherst teams had
not yet begun their seasons, and his old coaches back in Amherst
thought they'd give Duquette an honor he'd never gotten while he
was an athlete there. It delighted him no end.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Dan Duquette can have a laugh at his own expense.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Sox clinched last Wednesday night in Comiskey Park,
he sat alone in the press box. There was no one to give him an
embrace and, until he made his way down to the clubhouse, only
reporters to shake his hand. Ask him whom he called that night to
share the moment, and he gives you a quizzical look. He didn't call
anyone, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Red Sox advancing to the playoffs for the third
time in five full seasons under his watch, Duquette has become less
a lightning rod of controversy than a beacon of hope for fans who
sense that the team is in the right hands.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture driven by personality, Duquette, who has been
painted with a brush as prickly as his stubborn hair _ aloof, cold,
passionless _ offers an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``My style is very results-oriented,'' he says. ``When you have
this much at stake, day in and day out, things aren't always going
to go the way individual people would like them to go. You try to
balance the interests of the organization. At the end of the day, I
represent the interests of the organization. I try to do that in a
committed way, and a fair way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair to the players and to the fans. The fans deserve a good
return for what they invest in the ball club, economically and
emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The season is ripe for gloating, of course. No Sox team had been
to the playoffs in consecutive seasons in 83 years, and this after
a winter in which Duquette was barbecued for letting Vaughn leave
as a free agent (even CEO John Harrington said recently he cringed
at the beating Duquette took) and for signing Jose Offerman to what
his critics felt was an exorbitant contract (four years, $26
million).
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn encountered only disaster in Disneyland. He fell down the
dugout steps in his first game for the Angels, and the team never
recovered, ultimately dissolving into an orgy of finger-pointing
and back stabbing that resulted in the resignations of manager
Terry Collins and, one month later, general manager Bill Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, meanwhile, went 4 for 4 in his first game for the Sox,
then endured a midseason slump and brief benching to become the
dependable leadoff man Boston lacked last season, while playing an
acceptable second base.
</P>
<P>
   Has it occurred to people, Duquette was asked, that he just
might know what he's doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one player bigger than the team,'' he says. ``If
you have a team of players in a winning culture, you should be able
to put a good team on the field year in and year out. We've been
able to show effectively we can put a good team on the field year
in and year out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it. What it came down to (with Vaughn) was money.
The organization was willing to pay Mo Vaughn a handsome salary but
we weren't willing to pay the premium he received to play in
California. And the reason we weren't willing to pay that premium
is if you put all that money in a hitter, you don't have a lot of
leeway to staff the rest of your ball club, especially your
pitching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   There was money, then, to risk on Ramon Martinez, who has made a
remarkable recovery from shoulder surgery. Money for Mark Portugal,
the veteran who began the season in the starting rotation before
his unceremonious release in the final days. Money to gamble on Rod
Beck, who was coming off major elbow surgery but helped fill the
void left by the injury to Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a much better position financially to contend,''
Duquette says, ``without giving $80 million to a first baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, then, there was vindication in the play of Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It validated the deal,'' Duquette says. ``His performance
validated our financial commitment to him. I'll never understand
that one (the criticism).
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy Williams wasn't well-received when he came to town,
either. I hope our fans aren't using initial receptions as a
measuring stick to what type of contribution these people can make
to our ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago last winter, Duquette was ripped for inflating the
pitching market by signing Pedro Martinez to a six-year, $75
million deal. Duquette made little effort to contain his sarcasm on
that subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got banged pretty good by the other teams who wanted to sign
him for their teams,'' he says. ``That's where I got criticism _
the Yankees and Cleveland. You don't think they'd like to have him
on their teams now? They wanted to have him on their teams then. Do
you think they'd accept his contract?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't know what the market was, but I knew how good
this pitcher was. I knew how unique his talents and skills are. I
knew that he was driven and dependable. The only thing I didn't
know about him was if he knew how to be a star, and he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's matured. He's intelligent. He likes to be on stage when
people are watching. He relates to fans because of his personality.
He relates to fans because of his size.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that someday Duquette might be recognized for
making the best two trades of the '90s. Twice he traded for
Martinez, once with the Expos, then with the Red Sox. But he also
has proven to have a knack for the late-season pickup with a
pennant race at hand. Last season, he brought back Mike Stanley as
a much-needed righthanded bat, and picked up a lefthander, Greg
Swindell, for the bullpen. This season, he landed a closer in Beck,
a lefthanded starter in Kent Mercker, and righthanded power in
Butch Huskey.
</P>
<P>
   His best late-summer deal came with the Red Sox out of
contention, in 1997, when he unloaded closer Heathcliff Slocumb,
the Human Angioplasty, for Derek Lowe and Jason Varitek, who have
emerged as two of the team's top young stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't quite sure we knew what we had in Lowe and
Varitek,'' Duquette says. ``We knew what we had in Slocumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made some good deals late in the year. The trick to
those deals is to get players who can help you right away without
giving up your star players. So the key is knowing who your star
players are, keeping them out of the equation, eliminating them
from consideration. If other teams won't make a deal, go on to the
next team.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of this season's team did not come as a complete
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked our pitching staff,'' he says. ``I liked our core of
veteran players _ (Troy) O'Leary, (Nomar) Garciaparra, Stanley,
Offerman. Those are good players. I liked the potential of Varitek.
The big question was our offensive production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we got good contributions from Stanley and
(Brian) Daubach, Offerman and O'Leary. (Trot) Nixon and Varitek
developed, and along the way we picked up Huskey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy Williams did a great job putting (Tim) Wakefield in the
bullpen when Gordon was hurt. That stabilized the team and allowed
more time for Derek Lowe to come along in his role.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, Duquette said, should be Manager of the Year. That
doesn't mean, however, that he's ready to talk about giving
Williams a long-term deal. The manager, who was given a contract
extension at the end of spring training, is signed through next
season. But Duquette said there has been no talk of another
extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already signed up,'' Duquette says. ``We're happy with
him. He's doing a nice job. We think he should be Manager of the
Year. But (an extension) is an offseason discussion. That's not
even on the radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   What is on Duquette's radar screen is a World Series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in this job when the Boston Red Sox win a World
Series,'' he says. ``The fans here embrace a winning team with a
passion like no other market. That's what makes it fun to have a
winning team in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But to be Red Sox general manager, the dream of a lifetime for
the native of Dalton, doesn't mean he wants it to be a lifetime
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forever? No,'' he says. ``There are other jobs, other
challenges I'd like to pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   He was typically vague about what those might be: ``Inside the
industry? Maybe. Outside, too.''
</P>
<P>
   How about running for office?
</P>
<P>
   This time when he laughed, he enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just other challenges,'' says the Duke. ``They're
not really pertinent today.''
</P>
<P>
   Those challenges have to await another champagne bath. The one
that comes with winning a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll do it soon,'' he says. ``We've got a
chance.''

 &HT;    In Longview, 24 hands, 107 hours and one HardbodyBy Patrick
Beach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ It's silver. It has a 2.4-liter engine, a
five-speed manual transmission, cloth seats, A/C (for the first
time), AM-FM cassette and, when you throw in delivery fees and
such, a sticker price of $13,246.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new Nissan Frontier 4x2 XE, and recently two dozen people
were assembling at Joe Mallard Nissan here, resolving to hold on to
it longer than anybody else _ however long it takes.
</P>
<P>
   You saw a movie like this once? If you're in or around Austin,
you likely did. S.R. Bindler's documentary, ``Hands on a Hard
Body,'' opened at the Dobie Theater on the Drag about the time the
Earth's crust cooled and has been streaming through the projectors
there ever since. We very much get the film, or so we think. We go
laugh at the rednecks with their East Texas accents so impenetrable
the film could benefit from subtitles, and we watch them fight to
win an inexpensive truck.
</P>
<P>
   Listen. This is not about a truck.
</P>
<P>
   I. Prelude (not the Honda)
</P>
<P>
   The vegetable of the day at the Cotton Patch, in honor of the
contest, is ``extended cabbage.'' The 24 contestants are here,
across the street from the dealership, having had their names drawn
out of 2,000 entries. Now they sit (``now'' being the night before
the contest) and pay attention as the night-before meeting
commences. They include a cop from Houston who competed last year,
the winner of the very first contest, a red-haired 18-year-old who
knows all the words to all the country songs, the mother of a
9-year-old boy with cerebral palsy, the daughter of a past winner,
a snow cone magnate, a schoolteacher and a lanky stranger from
Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Mallard, the son of the dealership's owner and the guy who
runs the show, goes over the rules: no squatting, leaning or
cupping your hands. A six-minute break every hour, a 15-minute
break every six hours. Drug tests for the three finalists and
another one for the winner and the runner-up. Winner gets a new
truck; runner-up gets a used truck _ except it was stolen from the
lot the night before, so the runner-up will get some truck. Third
place gets a trip. If you're not there by 6:45 a.m. tomorrow,
alternates get drawn. J.D. Drew, who won the contest in the movie
and whose daughter, Melanie Lively, is a contestant, is an
alternate.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mallard, a big, booming, Foghorn Leghorn of a guy working
on at least one Skoal Bandit at all times, tells them they're a
part of something deeply historic and newsworthy. The Houston
paper's here. A crew from the British television show ``Yankee
Panky'' is en route. Mallard widens his eyes and holds two squat
fingers up, preparing to batter home the gravity of the situation:
</P>
<P>
   ``David Letterman's contacted us twice about this,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Calhoun, who won last year's contest in a record-busting
94 hours, offers advice: ``Don't eat nothin' greasy.''
</P>
<P>
   This does not dissuade about two-thirds of the group from
ordering chicken-fried steak. In Longview, if you don't eat nothin'
greasy, you don't eat nothin'.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of them is at the dealership well before the 6:45 a.m.
deadline the next day. Every one of them wears a gray Joe Mallard
Nissan Hands on a Hardbody T-shirt and gloves on their hands to
protect the truck's finish. The last-minute meeting breaks up, and
they dash outside under the portable tent where the prize waits.
</P>
<P>
   A local radio station (one that mostly plays the new kind of
country music, the kind that doesn't sound like country music)
blasts away from its remote truck in the corner of the lot. Travis
Tritt sings and spells ``T-R-O-U-B-L-E.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren ``Hands On'' Hearne, a Texas Alcoholic Beverage
Commission officer originally from Houston, has been acting like
Ali before the ``Thrilla in Manila,'' talking big, making everybody
laugh, pledging he will go the distance, which he predicts will be
105.7 hours. He says he's gonna shut up when the thing starts,
putting the other contestants off balance with his sudden silence
and determined visage.
</P>
<P>
   Hands on. Air horn blast. Tuesday, Sept. 21, 1999, 7 a.m.,
weather unusually cool and windy.
</P>
<P>
   Let the games begin.
</P>
<P>
   Let the chatter begin.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd, a guy in a black cowboy hat draws attention. It's
Benny Perkins, the charismatic, hyperbole-prone star of ``Hands
On'' who, in the film, compares the contest to combat. He says he
could hardly sleep last night he was so excited, and he's not even
in the contest. He admires the resolve of those who've competed
before and are here again, and he pities those who don't know what
kind of pain and dementia they're about to endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You slowly lose your mind,'' Perkins says. ``Slowly. You can
feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew didn't make it past alternate status, but he's taken
the week off work anyway to support daughter Melanie Lively. The
sentimental favorite is Mary Edwards, a dining room hostess whose
son, Casey, has cerebral palsy. She has his picture pinned to her
shirt. She needs the truck to carry the boy's wheelchair to
doctor's appointments in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The routine sets in. Hourly breaks, rubdowns, dashes to the
bathroom, Brooks &AMP; Dunn covering John Waite's '80s schmaltz pop hit
``Missing You'' (who green-lighted that?) on the radio about every
eight minutes. Nobody's going anywhere. At the 11-hour break,
Hearne lies prone eating something out of aluminum foil:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ginseng, baby! Straight from Siberia. Our secret weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   It looks a lot like chicken.
</P>
<P>
   The first casualty, 20-year-old Joe Patrick Morris, drops at
4:27 Wednesday morning. He staggers over to a chaise longue, covers
up with a sleeping bag and passes out for five hours, sleeping
through air horns and temperatures that slip below 50. When he
wakes, he pulls a Marlboro out of a hard pack, lights up and
declares he will enter again next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Edwards, Casey's mother, is the fourth to give out, lifting
her hand off the truck about 11:25 Wednesday night as the
contestants watched a video of the movie. (They got rid of four
that way last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Jan Maynard _ the dealership's cheerleader and mother hen _
drops big news on the survivors. Letterman's still interested, but
he'd demanded an exclusive, and now Rosie O'Donnell has called. So
Maynard says perhaps it's time for Mr. Letterman to _ how to put
this delicately? _ unburden his colon or let someone else use the
bathroom. The group votes for the latter, and somebody from the
Rosie show is en route. The stakes go higher. The winner will get
the ultimate: a trip to New York for an appearance on Rosie's show
the Monday after the contest.
</P>
<P>
   This is serious. This is huge. This is not about a truck.
</P>
<P>
   II. Friday night lights
</P>
<P>
   The breaks are deadly, especially the 15-minute ones. After
80-some hours, if you're handling a consistent level of pain, it
becomes your companion and you forget ever being without it. Then
you lie down and your body remembers and your mind refuses to again
embrace the pain. Mothers who've competed say it's worse than labor
and childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the mental side, which is like your own private
freak show. The third dimension gets very arbitrary _ a row of
trucks stretches for miles, your legs seem to be 3 inches long. The
year J.D. Drew won, he spent six hours entertaining a delusion that
a jumbo jet had landed across the street from the dealership and
people were, in the commercial airline parlance, deplaning.
</P>
<P>
   The judges _ there are always two judges _ hover over
contestants about to slip, and sometimes suggest, very gently, that
it's OK, it's time to give in, that they fought nobly and well.
It's uncomfortably similar to watching someone die, and you say the
same things. Contestants collapse, cry and are led away. Then they
always, always come back after a few hours' sleep _ there's an
explicable connection to the event and the people. It is like
combat, and also love, and just as impossible to describe if you
haven't lived it. This is the mistake we have made about ``Hands on
a Hard Body.'' It's not a comedy. It's a drama.
</P>
<P>
   The players in this year's drama have boiled down to four. Brian
Root, the bearded beanpole from Mobile, Ala., who drove to Longview
and spent a week just to enter his name, is hanging tough. It's
been, uh, an experience. ``I've discovered doors to my psyche I
didn't know existed,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't look bad at all, but he's got an unusual level of
support. His brother David does rubdowns, encourages Brian to go on
quick jogs during 15-minute breaks or do jumping jacks on a
trampoline. Then there's this other guy people are calling the
Guru. He's always running to the Albertson's for supplies, which
include red bananas, pine nuts, melons, avocados and papayas. Other
contestants see nothing wrong with bacon and eggs. The health
freaks get plain spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Hearne, the funny loud guy, went out under some
controversy at 5:07 a.m. Friday, taking his big package of Depends
undergarments (''NOW! 80% Better Leakage Protection'') with him. He
was going a little crazy, saying a fix was in. He returns to
apologize and root for Cathy Frazier, the flinty woman who won the
very first contest in '92, and who held the record time until last
year. No way is this about a truck for her. She's still got her
other truck. It's about being the first person to win twice.
Others, including Benny Perkins, have tried and failed.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Walker, he of Charlie's Sno-Cones &AMP; Seasonal Tanning, is
closing in on his time last year but looks fuzzy by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A Comanche moon ascends in a bloodshot sky. There are perfectly
good high school football games going on, but this is the biggest
show in town and hundreds are crammed around the tent, pulling for
their favorites, attaching encouraging signs to the rope perimeter.
High school girls sport selections from the
You-Are-Not-Leaving-This-House-Dressed-Like-That collection; boys
wear Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch hats and those gigantic jeans that have
become ubiquitous, breaching even the Pine Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Random free-associative thought: Charles Lindbergh flies alone
from New York to Paris in 33 hours and wins the world; Chris
Whitlock hangs on to a Nissan for almost 90 hours and wins a trip
to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He comes back later, after getting a rehydrating IV drip. They
always come back.
</P>
<P>
   So now there are three _ Brian Root, still hanging tough, very
deliberately changing hands every so often, not talking much,
conserving his energy, munching fruits and nuts on breaks. He cried
for a while, and his limbs seemed to seize up, but he's worked
through it. Word goes around the peanut gallery that Brian's done
things like this before. He's done seven or eight triathlons ``over
the years'' and has a resting pulse rate in the 40s. And there are
oblique references to other contests involving pain, insanity and
endurance, but neither he nor his brother David nor the
fruit-procuring guru _ Paul Rathe by name _ will specify.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Frazier's hanging in. She stands where she always has, on
the passenger side over the hood, where she can stare down her
opponent _ plainly Brian by now.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangerettes from Kilgore College come to cheer on Charlie
Walker about 10 p.m., doing a variation on the ``Hokey Pokey''
(``You put your right hand on ...,'' you get the idea), and the
infusion of spirit buoys his corpus for a time, but he's teetering.
</P>
<P>
   A light rain begins to fall and, to accommodate the exposed
crowd _ still out in force _ the truck is moved under the overhang
of the dealership building. And this is where Charlie Walker makes
his stand as friends holler at him until they lose their voices.
Facing the truck head on, both hands on the hood, with maybe two
dozen stalwart observers looking on, Charlie Walker falls backward
just short of 4:30 a.m. Saturday _ nine hours to the minute longer
than he went last year.
</P>
<P>
   And it goes on a lot longer. At 7 a.m., Patsy Cline sings ``I
Fall to Pieces'' on the radio, but it's unclear to whom she's
singing. The rain stops, the sun rises, the truck goes back under
the tent, the rain returns, so does the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks,'' says Jan Maynard, surveying the people, equipment
and debris, ``like Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's betting against Cathy or Brian, who stand as they have
from the beginning, directly across from one another _ Cathy
staring down her foe, Brian watching the crowd, sometimes chatting
with a judge or fan or his brother or the Guru, who now totes a
digital timer to monitor the progress of breaks.
</P>
<P>
   They enter 100 hours at 10 a.m. Saturday. In the movie, J.D.
Drew wins in 78.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Frazier, holding on, not so much wanting to win as wanting
not to lose: ``Them hours don't mean nothin' to me anymore. I just
want to solve it. It's gonna go my way. What do they call it when a
computer goes off? Crashed. I crashed. I didn't even remember what
all these people were doing here. I thought I was dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   During a break a couple of bikers in black T-shirts and
bandannas approach. One of them gives Cathy a bunch of cut flowers
in a newspaper cone.
</P>
<P>
   Great drama at the 5 p.m. break. Cathy decides to go inside the
bathroom well into the six-minute break. The one-minute warning
horn blares. Everybody thinks, stick a fork in this one, it's done.
But she struggles out, makes it across the lot and puts a hand on
the truck with two seconds to spare. Cheers, applause.
</P>
<P>
   Paul the Guru can't believe the endurance of these two. He says
he's been shot in the neck and buried in a landslide, but nothing
compares to the pain he felt when he did one of these contests for
68 hours. Anybody who does this twice, he says, is insane. The guru
gig is cushier.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy to Brian: ``Do your legs hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   Brian, affecting nonchalance: ``Yeah, a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy, pointing: ``Well, it's gonna get a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary-Chapin Carpenter sings ``I Feel Lucky,'' but Cathy Frazier
soon doesn't look or sound lucky. Actual quote: ``Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah....''
</P>
<P>
   She sits down for the 6 p.m. break, cries, shakes her head and
does not answer the horn six minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, after 107 hours and at least that many broadcasts of
``Missing You,'' is Brian Root, the skinny guy from Alabama, who
gets a little choked up. Even big old Jay Mallard gets choked up.
</P>
<P>
   What nobody knows is that Brian, his brother and Paul the Guru
have been at this for years _ they ride in circuit, go all over
looking for such contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suffice to say this wasn't the first time,'' Paul Rathe says
later. ``The key to winning is management.''
</P>
<P>
   III. Epilogue: The kindness of strangers
</P>
<P>
   Mary Edwards went home and told Casey she didn't win him the
truck to take him to school and the doctor, and she cried and cried
and said, ``Momma tried.''
</P>
<P>
   She'd entered the drawing every day for almost a month to get a
shot. Then she made it and failed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a stranger found her and handed her an envelope with a
letter inside from a famous movie star _ she won't say who, or
whether it's a male or female, a Texan, or, for instance, Matthew
McConaughey. The famous movie star requested anonymity, and Mary
Edwards is honoring that, not even telling her own mother who it
is. The letter said the famous movie star had heard about her
plight and wanted to buy her a van. And the next day, the famous
movie star called Mary Edwards' unlisted number, just to prove it
was all real.
</P>
<P>
   Casey is lobbying for a ``Blue's Clues'' paint job, but Mary
will take what she can get.
</P>
<P>
   For Mary Edwards, it was about a truck.

HARGROVE KEEPS IT TOGETHER THROUGH TRAGEDY, TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ First they rushed to Tim Crews's house, near where
the hideous dockside accident had occurred. Then they raced to the
hospital, to the room where Crews lay dying. They visited the room
where Bobby Ojeda was clinging to life. They did not need to stop
at the morgue; Steve Olin was already in there, dead.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they wandered through the central Florida night,
driving and talking, driving and talking, general manager John Hart
and manager Mike Hargrove. Trying to absorb the devastating toll of
the boat crash that had killed two Cleveland Indians pitchers and
seriously injured a third. Trying to determine how they would deal
with the media, how they would console the families, how they would
help their surviving players cope. Trying to figure out how in the
world they would cope themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It was 6:30 or 7 a.m. by the time they arrived back at the
team's Winter Haven spring training headquarters; they weren't sure
of the time, but the sun was up.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that time got away from them all during that 1993
season, which had been envisioned as the Indians' breakthrough
year. There was numbness instead of purpose; the specter of two
dead teammates was more powerful than the lure of a pennant, and
the Indians matched their record of the previous year, 76-86,
staggering home sixth in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardest, perhaps, on Hargrove. It was he who had to try
to persuade the players that each day's game was important in a
locker room haunted by the echoes of sudden, inexplicable death. He
was forced to become a counselor more than a manager, even as he
tried to find a place where his own grief wouldn't hurt so much.
</P>
<P>
   Not until June did he stop Hart on the field one day in batting
practice and tell him, ``You know, I feel like we're just starting
out. I've sort of been drifting up until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow he kept the team together.
</P>
<P>
   Hart was amazed at how his manager was able to endure and help
his players do the same ``as far as the meaningful things about the
situation were concerned _ consoling, focusing on what's important,
who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Jim Thome remembers, ``He was a father figure, and
we needed that. He was a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, 49, smiles thinly, bittersweetly, at the description
six years later, fresh off his fifth consecutive division title,
primed to step over the Red Sox on the way to his third World
Series, hoping that this powerhouse team will be his first world
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like a rock,'' he says. ``I felt like a pebble
at times.''
</P>
<P>
   But he believes that he came out stronger on the other side of
the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a chance to find out who Mike Hargrove is,'' he says.
``We all have an image of ourselves. I found out I'm the Mike
Hargrove I thought I was, the Mike Hargrove I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to let it go at that; he feels uncomfortable extolling
himself and acknowledges that his frequent forays into
self-deprecation ``are maybe a defense mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is pressed on the matter: Just who is this Mike Hargrove
he discovered?
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy of character,'' he says after a pause. ``A guy with
compassion but who _ I don't want to say tough because I don't
think that's the right word _ but who could see things through.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare to face the Red Sox at Jacobs Field in the
opener of their best-of-five Division Series, it is easy to forget
just how far these Indians and their manager have come. They are a
bona fide juggernaut, a lineup overflowing with offense, the first
team since the 1950 Red Sox to score more than 1,000 runs, and the
impression one gets is that Hargrove just opens the spigots, sits
back, and watches Kenny Lofton and Omar Vizquel and Roberto Alomar
and Manny Ramirez and Thome and Richie Sexson and the recently
acquired Harold Baines blast away. This year they clinched the
Central crown on Sept. 8; they annually seem to have the division
in their pocket before the frost is gone. A classic case of
pushbutton managing if ever there was one.
</P>
<P>
   It is in fact revisionist history in the extreme. When Hart
hired Hargrove, not long removed from a distinguished 12-year
playing career as a first baseman who hit .290, for his first major
league managing job in the middle of the 1991 season, Cleveland was
considered a baseball wasteland, with a tradition rich in
ineptitude and a vast godforsaken ballpark, Cleveland Stadium,
where fugitives could hide out for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bad team,'' recalls catcher Sandy Alomar. ``It was
different for Mike then. He would use a lot more lineups, trying to
find the right combination. But even then, he was a player's
manager.''
</P>
<P>
   That label has become attached to him like a middle name, but it
is too simplistic. Hargrove has achieved both longevity and success
because he has shown he is every kind of player's manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had Mike as a manager since I've been in the big
leagues,'' says Thome. ``He's been the same when we've lost 100
games and when we've won 100 games. Mike's nature is real
easygoing. He's a normal guy, but at the same time, he can be rough
when he needs to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart has employed only one manager during his tenure. Hargrove
has proven to be worth keeping around through the various Indian
incarnations, from their woebegone days through their watershed
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came in, we had a different agenda,'' says Hart. ``We
were growing a team. Mike was patient, not reinventing the wheel.
He was very good at teaching the fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no longer an issue with the plums reaped by Hart's shrewd
talent judgment and outgoing owner Richard Jacobs's bottomless bank
vault. Often a new cast requires a new director, but Hart
determined otherwise with this adaptable caretaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got better,'' he says, ``I evaluated the situation and
said, `This is the guy I want for the next level.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There is more to life at this level than filling out the lineup
card in indelible ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``To manage a team like this is not easy,'' says Sandy Alomar.
``We've got a lot of star players.''
</P>
<P>
   To which his brother Roberto adds, ``He knows we have a lot of
guys who know how to play the game. He lets us play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But a constellation of talent doesn't guarantee success.
Backstage bickering has been the ruin of many a team whose skills
were dynamic but whose chemistry was dynamite. It is here that
Hargrove truly excels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an even-keeled man,'' says Hart. ``He can settle down a
diverse, enigmatic clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the near inevitability of Indian summers stretching
into Indian summer, the tendency is to overlook the man at the top.
Perhaps this is Hargrove's major contribution. He is not obsessed
with forcing his imprint upon his players. He is content to manage
the Cleveland Indians, not Mike Hargrove's Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not brain surgery,'' he says. ``I suppose in some
respects, I don't want to be taken for granted. Anybody's ego is
big enough that you do care. But my job as manager is to put the
players on the team in the best position to do their job. People
don't come to the park to watch me manage.''
</P>
<P>
   No. They come to see a team he knows how to manage, through
tragedy and triumph.

 &HT;    In Longview, 24 hands, 107 hours and one HardbodyBy Patrick
Beach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ It's silver. It has a 2.4-liter engine, a
five-speed manual transmission, cloth seats, A/C (for the first
time), AM-FM cassette and, when you throw in delivery fees and
such, a sticker price of $13,246.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new Nissan Frontier 4x2 XE, and recently two dozen people
were assembling at Joe Mallard Nissan here, resolving to hold on to
it longer than anybody else _ however long it takes.
</P>
<P>
   You saw a movie like this once? If you're in or around Austin,
you likely did. S.R. Bindler's documentary, ``Hands on a Hard
Body,'' opened at the Dobie Theater on the Drag about the time the
Earth's crust cooled and has been streaming through the projectors
there ever since. We very much get the film, or so we think. We go
laugh at the rednecks with their East Texas accents so impenetrable
the film could benefit from subtitles, and we watch them fight to
win an inexpensive truck.
</P>
<P>
   Listen. This is not about a truck.
</P>
<P>
   I. Prelude (not the Honda)
</P>
<P>
   The vegetable of the day at the Cotton Patch, in honor of the
contest, is ``extended cabbage.'' The 24 contestants are here,
across the street from the dealership, having had their names drawn
out of 2,000 entries. Now they sit (``now'' being the night before
the contest) and pay attention as the night-before meeting
commences. They include a cop from Houston who competed last year,
the winner of the very first contest, a red-haired 18-year-old who
knows all the words to all the country songs, the mother of a
9-year-old boy with cerebral palsy, the daughter of a past winner,
a snow cone magnate, a schoolteacher and a lanky stranger from
Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Mallard, the son of the dealership's owner and the guy who
runs the show, goes over the rules: no squatting, leaning or
cupping your hands. A six-minute break every hour, a 15-minute
break every six hours. Drug tests for the three finalists and
another one for the winner and the runner-up. Winner gets a new
truck; runner-up gets a used truck _ except it was stolen from the
lot the night before, so the runner-up will get some truck. Third
place gets a trip. If you're not there by 6:45 a.m. tomorrow,
alternates get drawn. J.D. Drew, who won the contest in the movie
and whose daughter, Melanie Lively, is a contestant, is an
alternate.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mallard, a big, booming, Foghorn Leghorn of a guy working
on at least one Skoal Bandit at all times, tells them they're a
part of something deeply historic and newsworthy. The Houston
paper's here. A crew from the British television show ``Yankee
Panky'' is en route. Mallard widens his eyes and holds two squat
fingers up, preparing to batter home the gravity of the situation:
</P>
<P>
   ``David Letterman's contacted us twice about this,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Calhoun, who won last year's contest in a record-busting
94 hours, offers advice: ``Don't eat nothin' greasy.''
</P>
<P>
   This does not dissuade about two-thirds of the group from
ordering chicken-fried steak. In Longview, if you don't eat nothin'
greasy, you don't eat nothin'.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of them is at the dealership well before the 6:45 a.m.
deadline the next day. Every one of them wears a gray Joe Mallard
Nissan Hands on a Hardbody T-shirt and gloves on their hands to
protect the truck's finish. The last-minute meeting breaks up, and
they dash outside under the portable tent where the prize waits.
</P>
<P>
   A local radio station (one that mostly plays the new kind of
country music, the kind that doesn't sound like country music)
blasts away from its remote truck in the corner of the lot. Travis
Tritt sings and spells ``T-R-O-U-B-L-E.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren ``Hands On'' Hearne, a Texas Alcoholic Beverage
Commission officer originally from Houston, has been acting like
Ali before the ``Thrilla in Manila,'' talking big, making everybody
laugh, pledging he will go the distance, which he predicts will be
105.7 hours. He says he's gonna shut up when the thing starts,
putting the other contestants off balance with his sudden silence
and determined visage.
</P>
<P>
   Hands on. Air horn blast. Tuesday, Sept. 21, 1999, 7 a.m.,
weather unusually cool and windy.
</P>
<P>
   Let the games begin.
</P>
<P>
   Let the chatter begin.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd, a guy in a black cowboy hat draws attention. It's
Benny Perkins, the charismatic, hyperbole-prone star of ``Hands
On'' who, in the film, compares the contest to combat. He says he
could hardly sleep last night he was so excited, and he's not even
in the contest. He admires the resolve of those who've competed
before and are here again, and he pities those who don't know what
kind of pain and dementia they're about to endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You slowly lose your mind,'' Perkins says. ``Slowly. You can
feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew didn't make it past alternate status, but he's taken
the week off work anyway to support daughter Melanie Lively. The
sentimental favorite is Mary Edwards, a dining room hostess whose
son, Casey, has cerebral palsy. She has his picture pinned to her
shirt. She needs the truck to carry the boy's wheelchair to
doctor's appointments in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The routine sets in. Hourly breaks, rubdowns, dashes to the
bathroom, Brooks &AMP; Dunn covering John Waite's '80s schmaltz pop hit
``Missing You'' (who green-lighted that?) on the radio about every
eight minutes. Nobody's going anywhere. At the 11-hour break,
Hearne lies prone eating something out of aluminum foil:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ginseng, baby! Straight from Siberia. Our secret weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   It looks a lot like chicken.
</P>
<P>
   The first casualty, 20-year-old Joe Patrick Morris, drops at
4:27 Wednesday morning. He staggers over to a chaise longue, covers
up with a sleeping bag and passes out for five hours, sleeping
through air horns and temperatures that slip below 50. When he
wakes, he pulls a Marlboro out of a hard pack, lights up and
declares he will enter again next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Edwards, Casey's mother, is the fourth to give out, lifting
her hand off the truck about 11:25 Wednesday night as the
contestants watched a video of the movie. (They got rid of four
that way last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Jan Maynard _ the dealership's cheerleader and mother hen _
drops big news on the survivors. Letterman's still interested, but
he'd demanded an exclusive, and now Rosie O'Donnell has called. So
Maynard says perhaps it's time for Mr. Letterman to _ how to put
this delicately? _ unburden his colon or let someone else use the
bathroom. The group votes for the latter, and somebody from the
Rosie show is en route. The stakes go higher. The winner will get
the ultimate: a trip to New York for an appearance on Rosie's show
the Monday after the contest.
</P>
<P>
   This is serious. This is huge. This is not about a truck.
</P>
<P>
   II. Friday night lights
</P>
<P>
   The breaks are deadly, especially the 15-minute ones. After
80-some hours, if you're handling a consistent level of pain, it
becomes your companion and you forget ever being without it. Then
you lie down and your body remembers and your mind refuses to again
embrace the pain. Mothers who've competed say it's worse than labor
and childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the mental side, which is like your own private
freak show. The third dimension gets very arbitrary _ a row of
trucks stretches for miles, your legs seem to be 3 inches long. The
year J.D. Drew won, he spent six hours entertaining a delusion that
a jumbo jet had landed across the street from the dealership and
people were, in the commercial airline parlance, deplaning.
</P>
<P>
   The judges _ there are always two judges _ hover over
contestants about to slip, and sometimes suggest, very gently, that
it's OK, it's time to give in, that they fought nobly and well.
It's uncomfortably similar to watching someone die, and you say the
same things. Contestants collapse, cry and are led away. Then they
always, always come back after a few hours' sleep _ there's an
explicable connection to the event and the people. It is like
combat, and also love, and just as impossible to describe if you
haven't lived it. This is the mistake we have made about ``Hands on
a Hard Body.'' It's not a comedy. It's a drama.
</P>
<P>
   The players in this year's drama have boiled down to four. Brian
Root, the bearded beanpole from Mobile, Ala., who drove to Longview
and spent a week just to enter his name, is hanging tough. It's
been, uh, an experience. ``I've discovered doors to my psyche I
didn't know existed,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't look bad at all, but he's got an unusual level of
support. His brother David does rubdowns, encourages Brian to go on
quick jogs during 15-minute breaks or do jumping jacks on a
trampoline. Then there's this other guy people are calling the
Guru. He's always running to the Albertson's for supplies, which
include red bananas, pine nuts, melons, avocados and papayas. Other
contestants see nothing wrong with bacon and eggs. The health
freaks get plain spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Hearne, the funny loud guy, went out under some
controversy at 5:07 a.m. Friday, taking his big package of Depends
undergarments (''NOW! 80% Better Leakage Protection'') with him. He
was going a little crazy, saying a fix was in. He returns to
apologize and root for Cathy Frazier, the flinty woman who won the
very first contest in '92, and who held the record time until last
year. No way is this about a truck for her. She's still got her
other truck. It's about being the first person to win twice.
Others, including Benny Perkins, have tried and failed.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Walker, he of Charlie's Sno-Cones &AMP; Seasonal Tanning, is
closing in on his time last year but looks fuzzy by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A Comanche moon ascends in a bloodshot sky. There are perfectly
good high school football games going on, but this is the biggest
show in town and hundreds are crammed around the tent, pulling for
their favorites, attaching encouraging signs to the rope perimeter.
High school girls sport selections from the
You-Are-Not-Leaving-This-House-Dressed-Like-That collection; boys
wear Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch hats and those gigantic jeans that have
become ubiquitous, breaching even the Pine Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Random free-associative thought: Charles Lindbergh flies alone
from New York to Paris in 33 hours and wins the world; Chris
Whitlock hangs on to a Nissan for almost 90 hours and wins a trip
to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He comes back later, after getting a rehydrating IV drip. They
always come back.
</P>
<P>
   So now there are three _ Brian Root, still hanging tough, very
deliberately changing hands every so often, not talking much,
conserving his energy, munching fruits and nuts on breaks. He cried
for a while, and his limbs seemed to seize up, but he's worked
through it. Word goes around the peanut gallery that Brian's done
things like this before. He's done seven or eight triathlons ``over
the years'' and has a resting pulse rate in the 40s. And there are
oblique references to other contests involving pain, insanity and
endurance, but neither he nor his brother David nor the
fruit-procuring guru _ Paul Rathe by name _ will specify.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Frazier's hanging in. She stands where she always has, on
the passenger side over the hood, where she can stare down her
opponent _ plainly Brian by now.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangerettes from Kilgore College come to cheer on Charlie
Walker about 10 p.m., doing a variation on the ``Hokey Pokey''
(``You put your right hand on ...,'' you get the idea), and the
infusion of spirit buoys his corpus for a time, but he's teetering.
</P>
<P>
   A light rain begins to fall and, to accommodate the exposed
crowd _ still out in force _ the truck is moved under the overhang
of the dealership building. And this is where Charlie Walker makes
his stand as friends holler at him until they lose their voices.
Facing the truck head on, both hands on the hood, with maybe two
dozen stalwart observers looking on, Charlie Walker falls backward
just short of 4:30 a.m. Saturday _ nine hours to the minute longer
than he went last year.
</P>
<P>
   And it goes on a lot longer. At 7 a.m., Patsy Cline sings ``I
Fall to Pieces'' on the radio, but it's unclear to whom she's
singing. The rain stops, the sun rises, the truck goes back under
the tent, the rain returns, so does the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks,'' says Jan Maynard, surveying the people, equipment
and debris, ``like Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's betting against Cathy or Brian, who stand as they have
from the beginning, directly across from one another _ Cathy
staring down her foe, Brian watching the crowd, sometimes chatting
with a judge or fan or his brother or the Guru, who now totes a
digital timer to monitor the progress of breaks.
</P>
<P>
   They enter 100 hours at 10 a.m. Saturday. In the movie, J.D.
Drew wins in 78.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Frazier, holding on, not so much wanting to win as wanting
not to lose: ``Them hours don't mean nothin' to me anymore. I just
want to solve it. It's gonna go my way. What do they call it when a
computer goes off? Crashed. I crashed. I didn't even remember what
all these people were doing here. I thought I was dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   During a break a couple of bikers in black T-shirts and
bandannas approach. One of them gives Cathy a bunch of cut flowers
in a newspaper cone.
</P>
<P>
   Great drama at the 5 p.m. break. Cathy decides to go inside the
bathroom well into the six-minute break. The one-minute warning
horn blares. Everybody thinks, stick a fork in this one, it's done.
But she struggles out, makes it across the lot and puts a hand on
the truck with two seconds to spare. Cheers, applause.
</P>
<P>
   Paul the Guru can't believe the endurance of these two. He says
he's been shot in the neck and buried in a landslide, but nothing
compares to the pain he felt when he did one of these contests for
68 hours. Anybody who does this twice, he says, is insane. The guru
gig is cushier.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy to Brian: ``Do your legs hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   Brian, affecting nonchalance: ``Yeah, a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy, pointing: ``Well, it's gonna get a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary-Chapin Carpenter sings ``I Feel Lucky,'' but Cathy Frazier
soon doesn't look or sound lucky. Actual quote: ``Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah....''
</P>
<P>
   She sits down for the 6 p.m. break, cries, shakes her head and
does not answer the horn six minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, after 107 hours and at least that many broadcasts of
``Missing You,'' is Brian Root, the skinny guy from Alabama, who
gets a little choked up. Even big old Jay Mallard gets choked up.
</P>
<P>
   What nobody knows is that Brian, his brother and Paul the Guru
have been at this for years _ they ride in circuit, go all over
looking for such contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suffice to say this wasn't the first time,'' Paul Rathe says
later. ``The key to winning is management.''
</P>
<P>
   III. Epilogue: The kindness of strangers
</P>
<P>
   Mary Edwards went home and told Casey she didn't win him the
truck to take him to school and the doctor, and she cried and cried
and said, ``Momma tried.''
</P>
<P>
   She'd entered the drawing every day for almost a month to get a
shot. Then she made it and failed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a stranger found her and handed her an envelope with a
letter inside from a famous movie star _ she won't say who, or
whether it's a male or female, a Texan, or, for instance, Matthew
McConaughey. The famous movie star requested anonymity, and Mary
Edwards is honoring that, not even telling her own mother who it
is. The letter said the famous movie star had heard about her
plight and wanted to buy her a van. And the next day, the famous
movie star called Mary Edwards' unlisted number, just to prove it
was all real.
</P>
<P>
   Casey is lobbying for a ``Blue's Clues'' paint job, but Mary
will take what she can get.
</P>
<P>
   For Mary Edwards, it was about a truck.

WILLIAMS TAKES LOW ROAD, BUT SOX ON COURSE FOR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Grady Little, John Cumberland, and Jimy Williams walked
to the entrance of Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland one day
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Grady Little and John Cumberland walked through the entrance of
Network Associates Coliseum. They noticed something was missing.
The boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Jimy?'' asked Cumberland.
</P>
<P>
   Darned if they could find him. They looked in front of them and
beside them and around the nearby corridors of the concrete
mausoleum. No Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they wandered back outside. Ah-ha. Two kids _ 13 or 14
years old, Little guessed _ were playing catch. One 55-year-old was
intently instructing them in the proper way to throw the ball _ two
fingers across the seams.
</P>
<P>
   Little shook his head. ``Let's go,'' he told Cumberland. ``God
knows how long he'll be out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, the Red Sox manager joined his two
coaches in the visitors' clubhouse. Sorry about the delay, but,
well, he just couldn't help himself. Once a teacher, always a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, a Red Sox team that supposedly has
no business playing in October is playing in October. For the
second year in a row, Williams is receiving accolades for somehow
getting them to Cleveland as the American League wild card for the
best-of-five Division Series. The credit is reluctant on both ends,
to be sure. Boston has never embraced the often inscrutable manager
during his three-year term. And Williams cringes at the mere
mention of the topic Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he can spare a couple of minutes for personal analysis
on the eve of the playoffs, he replies, ``Or less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too keen on talking about myself,'' he says. ``I'd
rather have you talk about us as a group. Our success is a
reflection of how everybody feeds off each other. Our coaching
staff is pretty special. And our trainers and clubhouse personnel
and players. Us as a group. That I'd feel comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't mention the cab driver who dropped him off at the
ballpark hours before game time, but he'd undoubtedly salute him,
too. There is no caste system in Jimy Williams's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's consistent and level and as fair a man as you'd want to
see,'' says Little, whose association with Williams dates to the
mid-'80s when both were in the Toronto system and continued through
the glorious early '90s as coaches with the invincible Atlanta
Braves. ``There's no difference to Jimy Williams between a player
on this team making $10 milllion and a player making $200,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that he has far more of the latter. Williams has
jerryrigged a contender out of a nucleus numbering exactly two true
stars _ pitcher Pedro Martinez and shortstop Nomar Garciaparra _
and supplementary parts consisting of youngsters, retreads, and
role players. The team's unlikely success, he insists, is all their
fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feed off my players,'' he says. ``They inspire me by how
they play, how they pitch, what they bring to the park every day. I
don't like to talk at my players or to my players. I like to talk
with my players. A lot of times, I'll say, `Hey, I was thinking
this. What do you think? I need your help.' I value their input.
It's a two-way conversation, but one thing's for certain: When we
leave the clubhouse, we're going to be together.''
</P>
<P>
   The harmony is not a facade for the benefit of public opinion.
Possible explosions never reach the ignition stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the overall atmosphere he creates,'' says pitching coach
Joe Kerrigan. ``He talks to the players one-on-one if something has
to be discussed. Even if it's a negative, he's going to turn it
into a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the negative seeps through the clubhouse doors,
anyway, such as the Saturday in late August when Martinez was tardy
for a start, arriving at the ballpark well after the two-hour
pregame deadline. Per his rules, Williams did not allow Martinez to
open the game. He used him in relief and Martinez got the win, but
the temperamental pitcher was clearly infuriated. Yet Williams
quietly endured his ace's displeasure, defusing a combustible
situation by refusing to allow it to escalate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's honest,'' says hitting coach Jim Rice. ``Pedro's late?
Then it's `Pedro, you're not starting.' I stand by him. It's the
same for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   All Williams asks in return is that his players share his
reverence for their line of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a special game to me,'' he says. ``I try to treat
it with respect. In everything we do, we try to show respect for
the game. That means showing respect for each other, even the
opponents. You try to play the game the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   He assumes as much on the part of his players unless they prove
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's successful to us starts with his belief in us _ his
belief in us enough to let us go out and play,'' says Jason
Varitek, who showed his gratitude when Williams made him the
everyday catcher after Scott Hatteberg was injured by turning into
a 20-homer slugger and masterful handler of pitchers. ``He's very
positive. Everything that comes out of his mouth is positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams takes a pointillist's view of the big picture. Each
game is a separate, sacred entity. That's the message he transfers
to his players: Just take care of today. Don't get distracted by
hindsight or foresight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very focused man,'' says veteran third baseman John
Valentin. ``All he asks is that you concentrate on the game you are
playing that specific day, that specific time. He doesn't talk
about going on to the next game or the next series. He prepares
only for that game. That makes it simple for him and simple for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Simplicity, in fact, is the essence of his survival.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was no defense; he was guilty. When Jimy Williams was
hired to replace the fired Kevin Kennedy as Red Sox manager on Nov.
19, 1996, he had to admit that he was not Jim Leyland, Whitey
Herzog, Jim Fregosi, Jeff Torborg, Larry Bowa, or any of the other
high-visibility candidates general manager Dan Duquette reportedly
had courted for the job _ and the list undoubtedly would have
included Connie Mack and John McGraw if Duquette could have located
their phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette acknowledges the pursuit of more recognizable names,
``but it didn't come together,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Jimy Williams? During his one previous major league managing
stop, with the Blue Jays from 1986-89, he had compiled winning
records in each of his three full seasons but was best remembered _
or vilified _ for coughing up a 3 1/2-game AL East lead over the
Detroit Tigers in the last week of the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've grown since then,'' he says. ``I keep my ears
open, my eyes open, an open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It was debatable whether he would ever get a chance to show what
the new, improved Jimy Williams could do running a ball club. From
1990-96, he served as third base coach for his onetime Toronto
mentor, Atlanta manager Bobby Cox, on a team that won five division
titles, went to four World Series, and captured a world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only thought about managing when (the media) would bring it
up,'' says Williams. ``I just wanted to be the best coach I could.
Hey, I was going to the ballpark very day, putting on a major
league uniform. What could be better?''
</P>
<P>
   The chance Duquette gave him, even if he wasn't on the GM's A
list. Despite appearances, Duquette wasn't simply desperate to fill
in a job title on the club directory. During his time as a Montreal
executive, the Expos had trained with the Braves at West Palm
Beach, Fla. And he noticed a certain Atlanta coach who daily seemed
to be spending extra hours on the field, helping whoever was
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the chance to observe him as an outsider,'' says
Duquette. ``He was always out working with the younger ballplayers
_ pitchers on bunting, infielders on fundamentals. He's an
excellent teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   That made not the slightest impression when Williams was
introduced to a Boston media firing squad. He was forever branded
by the image he portrayed. It was as if he had ridden into the big
city on one of the horses he rode as one of seven children of a
farmer in Arroyo Grande, Calif., kicking dust from his spurs and
chomping a blade of grass.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Williams has a college degree in agribusiness from
Fresno State. Yet the rube routine has served him well. His often
unfathomable answers to questions regarding players' performances
and managerial strategy keep his interrogators too busy trying to
translate them to stir up a ruckus about the team. Williams is
polite and gracious and as reticent as he can get away wth being.
His is a limited lexicon, by design. His team ``competes,'' win or
lose. His players are ``competitors.'' A certain exalted few are
``warriors.'' Just try to make something incendiary of that arsenal
of verbiage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handles the media better than anyone I've ever seen,'' says
pitcher Bret Saberhagen, ``because he rarely gives a straight
answer. He'll say something that's totally off the subject. He
won't keep talking until you guys get what you want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Williams worry in the least about what he hears _ or
reads or sees _ about himself. Rice, a longtime Boston star whose
relationship with the media wasn't arm's length as much as armed
combat, has seen excessive concern about vox populi devour many a
manager; he believes it was the undoing of one of his favorites,
Don Zimmer. He can't envision Williams falling victim to the
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy's more like a grandfather,'' says Rice. ``He's more
laid-back. One thing I've seen _ he believes that if he can't say
something nice about someone, he won't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In a town whose approach to baseball is both sophisticated and
savage, Williams has the perfect temperament to deal with the
scorching airwaves and doomsday newsprint. It's not necessarily
that he's impervious to it; he seems oblivious to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, because I live in Boston, I should listen to talk
shows?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He claims to ignore newspapers, too, but he can't be unaware of
the prevailing sentiment that he's not the flavor of the month in a
city that craves celebrity leaders. It's just that he doesn't care.
He genuinely doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the guys who cover the team regularly, `If it's time to
rip me, go ahead and rip me,' '' he says. ``It doesn't bother me.
There's a human element involved: `OK, Jimy, it's time to make
another decision. So make it and live with it.' That's what makes
baseball so special, the controversy. That's OK. It's good for the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   And as a long as it's directed at him, it's not bothering his
players. Quite a bumpkin, that Jimy Williams.

VARITEK HAS BEEN A STEAL FOR THE RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jason Varitek refuses to undervalue himself.
</P>
<P>
   When the Minnesota Twins selected him in the first round of the
1993 draft, 21st overall, then informed him they had two other
picks who were priorities and that they'd get around to dealing
with him when and if they had some spare time, Varitek saved them
the trouble and returned to Georgia Tech for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   When the Seattle Mariners made him their top choice, No. 14
overall, the following year, then offered him a contract he felt
wasn't befitting the 1993 College Player of the Year and a
three-time All-American, Varitek held out. And held out. And held
out. Finally, he agreed to the Mariners' proposal _ 10 months later
in April 1995, in essence having sacrificed a year of pro ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of principle,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jason Varitek refuses to overvalue himself.
</P>
<P>
   The man anointed by one publication as the greatest college
catcher in history entered the minor leagues at the relatively
lofty Double A level with one nagging misgiving. He didn't feel he
knew how to catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really struggled with my receiving,'' he says. ``As a
result, it affected my throwing. I worked with a guy (Seattle
roving minor league catching instructor Roger Hansen). He broke me
down. It was basically like a house. I had to find a foundation
that worked for me. My foundation was all wrong. I was really
spread out, sometimes sank when the pitch would come to me. I'd
collapse, make it tougher to throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Add the fact that Varitek, a switch hitter, could only seem to
make solid contact with air from the left side of the plate, and it
explains why he was available at the trade deadline July 31, 1997,
when Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, frothing to unload
nitroglycerine closer Heathcliff Slocumb, shipped the righthander
to Seattle for Varitek and pitcher Derek Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   By then, The Greatest Catcher In College Baseball History had
acquired a new label. Disappointment. And he felt it was well
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a battle,'' says Varitek. ``Failure is a tough thing to
deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Duquette wasn't ready to subscribe to that theory. ``I think
his lack of pro experience limited his production early,'' said the
GM. ``I also think he would've benefited from some time at the
introductory level. There was also a perception around baseball
that his stance on his contracts diminished his value as a catcher.
But he was a top talent coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another consideration that made Varitek attractive.
Desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we needed a catcher,'' says Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out he found one beyond his giddiest fantasies. After a
year of platooning with Scott Hatteberg, playing essentially only
against lefthanders, Varitek, 27, inherited the full-time job by
default May 18 when Hatteberg was sidelined by elbow surgery. Since
then, he has been a revelation with an exclamation point. He has
masterfully handled a patchwork pitching staff and provided latent
punch _ 20 homers, 17 of them lefthanded, and 76 RBIs while batting
.269 _ as one of the indispensable ingredients in the Red Sox'
arduous march to their second straight American League wild-card
playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the second-best catcher in the American League (behind
only the Rangers' redoubtable Pudge Rodriguez),'' says pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan. ``He's the best catcher I've ever been around
on a daily basis. He's all about trying to make people better. He
cares first about taking care of the pitching staff rather than
hitting. He's conscientious. His throwing skills are right behind
Pudge. He's always in the game. He gets to the park early, he's
caught maybe 30 games in a row, and he's in the back room lifting
weights. He catches in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to the reborn Varitek than durability.
Technically, Kerrigan finds him virtually faultless.
</P>
<P>
   ``His targets have settled down,'' says the coach. ``He gives a
good presentation of the pitch. He receives the ball nice and quiet
so the umpire can get a good look. He's not jumping all around.
That's a lost art today. Some of these guys, it looks like they're
trying for a double play, they're in such a hurry to get the ball
back to the pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kerrigan has found the ideal caretaker for his staff,
because the catcher places as much of a premium on catching as the
coach does.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to,'' Varitek says. ``You can't win a game, 1-0, if
you give up the run. And when we lost Mo (Vaughn) in the offseason,
we knew we'd have to find other ways to win.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Varitek also has done his unexpected part,
providing some of the thunder that departed to Anaheim with Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to describe Jason and the way he's matured is to
compare him to Todd Hundley,'' says former Met and current Red Sox
righthander Bret Saberhagen, a teammate of both catchers. ``Todd
didn't put up big offensive numbers for the first couple of years
because he was trying to learn the hitters, concentrating on
catching. It's the same with Jason _ he's starting to come into his
own offensively because he knows the hitters, more so than when he
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for catchers, offense is considered strictly a bonus.
``Pitching coaches are selfish,'' says Kerrigan. ``We don't care if
a guy hits (expletive) .100 if he can catch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox discovered almost by accident that Varitek is worth
much more than that at the plate. ``He has a knack for getting
clutch hits,'' says Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek wasn't sure he had a clue for getting any kind of hits
when he took over the job full-time. ``This is obviously beyond my
expectations,'' he says, ``because I had expected to play only
against lefthanders. I was fortunate that they believed in me,
didn't go out and get somebody else. Let's face it, there were a
lot of questions about whether I could hit lefty.''
</P>
<P>
   But hitting coach Jim Rice maintained an open mind on the
matter, despite Varitek's dismal track record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know how a guy's going to do until he gets the
chance,'' says Rice. ``We got a chance to see him offensively from
both sides of the plate. He showed good power to both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   That, too, was a byproduct of Varitek's slavish work ethic. He
wore out the batting cage learning from Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the real work is done,'' says Rice, ``more than
on the field (in batting practice). And in the cage, he'd hit line
drives. I don't care if you're a power hitter or what. That's what
you like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of his struggles, success has become a habit
for Varitek at virtually every level. His suburban Orlando team
reached the Little League World Series final. Georgia Tech was the
College World Series runner-up during his four-year stay after he'd
rejected his first pro offer, when the Houston Astros selected him
in the 23d round out of Lake Brantley High School in Longwood,
Fla., ``because I had good parents who impressed upon me the value
of a college education.'' And now the Red Sox are back in the
postseason, which they'd likely have missed without Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he believes it was the flirtation with failure that may have
been his most valuable instrument for accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything is always easy for you,'' says Varitek, ``then
when you're not doing as well as you can, sometimes things can get
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Not when you start at rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's come a long way,'' says Lowe. ``When he first got
drafted, he had a problem on pitches with movement. He'd have a
tendency to take them out of the strike zone. But he didn't just
accept the way he was catching. He wanted to get better. He knew he
could get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Varitek, his own toughest critic, would have to acknowledge
that he has done just that. And there's no chance he'll be
underappreciated in Boston.

THIS ACE CAN BEAT ANYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox fans thought 1986 was as good as it got for a
Boston starting pitcher. In '86, Roger Clemens started the season
14-0. He was MVP of the All-Star Game and finished 24-4 with a 2.48
ERA, 238 strikeouts, and only 67 walks in 254 innings. He won the
Cy Young Award, the MVP, and the seventh game of the American
League Championship Series. He took the Sox to the seventh game of
the World Series and his Series ERA was 3.18.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes Pedro Martinez. In 1999, Pedro went 23-4 with a
2.07 ERA, 313 strikeouts, and 37 walks in 213 1/3 innings. He was
MVP of the All-Star Game, will certainly win the AL Cy Young Award,
has a shot at MVP, and Wednesday night takes the Red Sox into the
postseason when he starts against the Indians at Cleveland's Jacobs
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the infamous ground ball between Bill Buckner's
legs (a game started, but not finished by Clemens), the Red Sox
have lost 16 of 17 postseason games. The lone victory in this
hideous streak came in Game 1 of last year's Division Series, when
Pedro beat the Indians, 11-3, with seven innings of six-hit,
no-walk, eight-strikeout pitching.
</P>
<P>
   He is on a truly incredible roll. In his last seven starts,
Pedro went 6-0 with an 0.82 ERA, including 96 strikeouts and only
28 hits in 55 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Seattle's Jay Buhner, a grizzled vet who is 0 for 8
lifetime against Martinez, all strikeouts: ``There's no one like
him. He's in a class by himself. A lot of guys have one great out
pitch. He's got three out-pitches _ the best fastball, the best
curve, and the best changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   The legend of Pedro was solidified in New York on Friday night,
Sept. 10, when he fanned 17 Yankees, including eight of the last
nine, in a one-hit, 3-1 victory. It is considered by many the
greatest game ever pitched against the Bronx Bombers, and it sent a
message that the Red Sox will be difficult to beat in the playoffs,
particularly in a five-game series when Pedro can pitch (and win)
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens of Red Sox Nation need not be reminded that Pedro
pitched only once in the four-game series loss in '98. The Sox
dropped Game 2 in Cleveland and Game 3 at Fenway, then manager Jimy
Williams was faced with the prospect of pitching Pedro in Game 4,
or holding him for a Game 5 clincher.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was upset when it was announced that Pete Schourek
would get the ball for Game 4. The Sox resisted the urge to use
Pedro on three days' rest and went out in four games despite a nice
effort from Schourek (two hits, no runs in 5 1/3 innings). Boston
lost, 2-1. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan has since admitted that they
considered using Pedro until he threw in-between starts and had
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   What if the same scenario arises this year? If the Sox trail in
games, 2-1, after Saturday, would Pedro get the ball in Game 4?
Management says it's doubtful, pointing out that Pedro has not
pitched on three days' rest this season.
</P>
<P>
   What would Martinez want?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I'd want to pitch that game,'' he said. ``I want to
pitch every day if I can. I'm gonna take my two painkillers, three
or four if I have to, and be in there. Every day. I want to be a
part of it. If not, I'm gonna be a big cheerleader and they'll have
to tie me to the pole again.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ron Guidry and Sandy Koufax before him, Martinez is capable
of throwing the ball almost 100 miles per hour even thought he
weighs only 174 pounds. Pitching coaches attribute this to
mechanics while physicists chalk it up to torque and leverage.
Pedro has other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of both god-given ability and also hard
work,'' he said. ``I worked my butt off. You would never imagine
the things I do, the things I used to do. In the Dominican, I used
to run at 10:30 at night in the dark. I wasn't allowed to run in
the day. The coach said, `You are too skinny to run. You need to
build on weight.' So I ran in the dark field and there was a guard
with a shotgun. I had to give him 20 bucks to let me run and be
aware that I was there and not an intruder. Otherwise, in the dark
of night you see somebody running and you shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``too skinny'' tag dogged him when he pitched for the
Dodgers. They used him as a reliever for parts of two seasons, then
dealt him to Montreal for the immortal Delino DeShields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who said that I was too skinny,'' he said. ``I
heard Tommy Lasorda, Dr. (Frank) Jobe, one of the top scouts. I
have no grudges about it. The one that should have grudges is them
because they were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were wrong and the Expos are sorry they couldn't
afford to keep Pedro. According to know-it-all Bill James,
Martinez's 1999 season was the best of the decade. With Roger
Clemens (1997), he is one of only two American League pitchers to
win the mythical pitcher's triple crown (leading the league in
wins, ERA, and strikeouts) since Hal Newhouser turned the trick in
1945. Martinez averaged 13.20 strikeouts per nine innings, best in
history. He averaged only one walk per 8.46 strikeouts. Pedro's ERA
was 2.07, compared to an American League average of 4.86. It is the
greatest disparity between a pitcher's ERA and the league average.
And he did it in a league with a designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes this so amazing,'' Williams said. ``When you
look at what he's doing in relation to the rest of the league, and
in this era of the home run. I'm not sure people appreciate what
they are seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why he is also an MVP candidate. The Cy Young race is a
joke and should be unanimous. And Pedro may have won the MVP when
he stuck it to the Yankees on that stellar night in September. He
would become the 10th pitcher to win both awards in the same
season. The last two were Clemens in '86 and Dennis Eckersley with
the A's in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great accomplishment, but it's not something I'm
ambitious of,'' said Martinez. ``I think I've done enough for
myself. What I want right now _ really, really want bad _ is a
World Series ring, just to complete my cap on the big leagues as an
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he doesn't believe in the Curse of the Bambino and feels
the Red Sox are close to the long-awaited championship season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon,'' said Pedro. ``I can't tell you how soon, but it's
gonna happen. I can tell by the way these players are developing
and the way Boston is getting closer and closer every year.''
</P>
<P>
   He hates the cold weather, but knows that the hitters hate it
more. Imagine trying to hit Pedro's 97-mile-per-hour heater if it's
45 degrees in Cleveland or Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big fan of cold weather, but through the years, cold
is not bad to me. My numbers are pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   He matches up well with Wednesday's opponent, fellow Dominican,
Bartolo Colon. In four head-to-head matchups against the Cleveland
ace, Martinez is 3-0 with a 1.64 ERA, 42 strikeouts, and four
walks.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lot of pressre for one man. Pedro makes the Red Sox the
team no one wants to face in a five-game series. Conversely, if he
loses _ and that is possible, especially against the thumping
Indians lineup _ the Red Sox and their fans will feel that the
series is over. But if he wins, the Sox go into the next three
games feeling they need only to steal one victory, then hand the
ball to Pedro for the clincher.
</P>
<P>
   This must be what it felt like to root for the St. Louis
Cardinals when they had Bob Gibson in the 1960s.

RAMIREZ HAS BEEN THE DRIVING FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Over the weekend, he was Sandy Alomar, No. 15.
Tomorrow he might be Jim Thome, No. 25. Unless he's in a Roberto
Alomar, No. 12, mood. Or perhaps he'll decide that it's Omar
Vizquel, No. 13, time.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez has another habit besides driving in runs at a
more prolific pace than any major leaguer since the Depression.
Without notice, he'll summon a clubhouse kid, hand him a $20 bill,
and dispatch him to one of the souvenir stands at Jacobs Field to
purchase a red T-shirt bearing the name and number of one of his
Cleveland Indians teammates. Then he'll amputate the sleeves, the
better to reveal the mountaintops he calls biceps, and wear his
replica of preference around the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manny wears anybody's shirt but his own,'' says Sandy Alomar,
shaking his head. ``There doesn't seem to be any pattern to it, but
I've been injured so I haven't been around him the whole year.
Someone like Vizquel might know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you why he does it,'' says Vizquel, wearing a grin
that reveals he has no clue why Ramirez does it and doesn't really
care. ``He's crazy. He must be (expletive) up in the head. I think
he's making fun of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel well knows that the opposite is true. Ramirez is almost
reverential in his regard for his supporting cast, a term he would
never use to describe them. He says he chooses a shirt of the day
``for luck,'' but it just as easily could be his way of trying to
go incognito.
</P>
<P>
   If so, he's as much in a dream world as his season has been.
</P>
<P>
   Though he considers the limelight the equivalent of stranding a
runner at third, Ramirez, 26, can't possibly escape it after a
season in which he shredded entire chapters of baseball's record
book. His 165 runs batted in not only broke Hal Trosky's
63-year-old club record by three, they also represented the largest
major league output since Lou Gehrig's 165 in 1934. Only eight
players in the 20th century drove in more, and Ramirez ends the
millennium in the company of Ruth and Gehrig and Foxx and Greenberg
and DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Humility prevents the Indians right fielder from considering his
place in that pantheon. He's much more comfortable invoking the
names of the Alomars and Vizquel and Thome and Kenny Lofton and
Richie Sexson and Harold Baines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be able to drive in runs without the guys getting
on in front of me,'' he says. ``Sometimes I'll get the runner in
from third, sometimes not. If I don't, I've got the guys behind me
to pick me up. I'm not the man here. I prefer not to be the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Another futile fantasy. While it's true that five Indians,
including Ramirez, have scored 100 runs; five Indians, including
Ramirez, have driven in 100 runs; and Cleveland is the first team
since the 1950 Red Sox to have sent 1,000 men across the plate,
these Midwest maulers take their cue from their cleanup hitter.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if they all want to wear Manny Ramirez T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quiet storm,'' Lofton calls him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clutchmaster,'' Sandy Alomar salutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pure poison, American League pitchers chorus after they've
ducked for cover.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to put Ramirez's season in perspective, because
the Indians don't happen to have any 65-year-olds in their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a guy that, for example, drives in 120 runs,'' says
fellow 100-RBI man Thome. ``You have to have a tremendous year to
do that. To do what Manny has is mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Even 49-year-old manager Mike Hargrove, whose parents were kids
when Gehrig and Trosky were ringing up RBIs like cash registers, is
at a loss to come up with a frame of reference. ``I don't know if
there's anything to compare it to,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the historic horizons he has reached while
complementing his run production with 44 homers and a .335 average,
Ramirez obviously has exceeded expectations. But he didn't just
fall to earth.
</P>
<P>
   He's been considered star material since his high school days in
New York, where he'd emigrated from Santo Domingo in the Dominican
Republic, and also where he'd spend many of his boyhood days making
the five-minute trip from his house to Yankee Stadium to watch Don
Mattingly and his colleagues at work.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland general manager John Hart remembers taking a trip to
Manhattan with scouting director Mickey White the week before the
June 1991 draft to watch a couple of prospects _ pitcher Allen
Watson and Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   On the flight home, White told Hart, ``I saw my No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Which one?'' asked Hart.
</P>
<P>
   `I grew up in Pittsburgh,'' White answered in parable form. ``I
saw Roberto Clemente. I always said that if I got a chance to draft
Roberto Clemente, I would. Manny Ramirez is my Roberto Clemente.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in the majors for good by the time he was 22, and the
following year, he started racking up 30-homer, 100-RBI totals on a
veteran team that was in the process of claiming the American
League Central Division as its sovereign territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the great good fortune to break in with a championship
club,'' says Hart. ``The first year, he hit No. 8. Then he was No.
7. Then he was No. 6. Then _ boom _ he was cleanup.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year became a portent when Ramirez cleaned up to the tune
of 45 homers and 145 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year he's built on that,'' says veteran hitting coach
Charlie Manuel. ``There isn't a pitch he can't handle. The many
things he worked on with his hitting started to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez concurs. ``I'm always trying to work on something,'' he
says. ``Running the bases, playing the outfield, and hitting _
always hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ramirez's name never was associated with hard labor during
his early years. He was considered prodigiously talented and
equally lackadaisical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, he was learning to play baseball in the big
leagues,'' says Sandy Alomar. ``It's like being president and
running the White House at 22. He always worked hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus that he didn't was a gross misconception, insist
his teammates. Ramirez's alleged carelessness masked the attitude
that has accounted for this season for the ages _ his carefreeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think about numbers or records or having men on
base,'' he says. ``I just go out and play. If I thought about it,
it probably wouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised he even knew he was going for a record,'' says
Sandy Alomar. ``He doesn't worry about anything. He doesn't put any
pressure on himself. The whole world could be collapsing around him
and he'd say, `Oh well, we're all going to die.' World Series,
bases loaded _ to him, it's like playing in the backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is one difference Lofton has noticed. ``When a guy's
in scoring position,'' says the center fielder, who bats leadoff
ahead of Vizquel and Roberto Alomar as Ramirez's setup men, ``his
face lights up.''
</P>
<P>
   Such expressions are undetectable to the general public. Polite
to an extreme, Ramirez makes diffidence look like egomania. Lofton
believes language could be a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manny's English is there,'' he says. ``But he's afraid he
might say the wrong word.''
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly reclusive with the media, though his
visibility has increased along with his RBI figures. ``I've talked
to him about that,'' says Roberto Alomar. ``I tell him, `You've got
to talk to the media.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez maintains he has nothing against attention, and after
breaking Trosky's record last week, he even indulged his delirious
admirers with a curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me proud because of the fans,'' he says. ``The way
they react, I'm very proud of the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   There he goes again, boomeranging compliments, still trying to
blend in with the crowd. And failing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dave Jauss, the Red Sox first-base coach, is a city
guy. He rides the T to Fenway Park, lives in Boston year-round,
takes his kids to school, knows his way around the neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   When Dave Jauss puts his ear to Red Sox Nation, this is what he
hears:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many times in the month of September, how
everybody, from the sisters at Mount Alvernia to the pizza delivery
boy to the cashier at Kiki's Quick Mart in Brighton Center, has
said, `Whatever you do this year, don't worry. We've had the
funnest time all summer. This is a great club.'
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't the people reading the statistics every day, or
people who go to every game. This is from everyday walking around
Brighton and Watertown. They've just had a great summer watching
this club. It's quite a compliment to the type of players we had
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams is sitting in the visiting manager's office in
Chicago's Comiskey Park. It is the day after the Red Sox put
themselves in the playoffs for the second straight season. He is
listening to someone tell him that this is a team impossible not to
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people in Boston, New England, like this team,''
he agrees. ``I think it's exemplified by the way they turned out to
watch 'em. It's a compliment to our fans. Maybe they're trying to
reward these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes beyond an appreciation of winning. Red Sox fans always
support a winner. Something more is at work here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans relate to hard-working, blue-collar type of players,''
says Mike Stanley. ``Even our superstars, they don't act like
superstars.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is this: After a decade of divas _ the high-maintenance
soap operas involving talented and tempestuous types like Roger
Clemens and Mo Vaughn _ Sox fans were ready to embrace a group of
players not embarrassed to have a little dirt under their
fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of guys who could just as easily stand out there in hard
hats as they do in batting helmets. Who might not have the pedigree
of some of their better-heeled rivals _ though Pedro Martinez and
Nomar Garciaparra would be royalty in any baseball crowd _ but who
like nothing more than showing up in the same neighborhoods,
privilege be damned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good,'' Garciaparra says defiantly, the night the Sox
clinched their wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   That they are, first and foremost. But they are endearing,
because whatever greatness has been allotted in the Boston
clubhouse, it has come in portions smaller than those meted out in
the Bronx or Cleveland, Atlanta or Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But they have a manager who walks around with six baseballs
stuck in his back pockets, fungo bat at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find people off the street who might work as hard and
put in as many hours as Jimy,'' Jauss says. ``But it's his
personality. Jimy is a very calm, straightforward guy who is easy
to get along with. His personality isn't anything you can write
down or another person can use. But he sets the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   A catcher, Jason Varitek, who absorbs more body blows than a
Mike Tyson sparring partner and cheerfully comes back for more. ``I
call him fearless,'' Williams says.
</P>
<P>
   A shortstop, Garciaparra, who on a daily basis takes dozens of
ground balls, committing to rote plays that are spectacular when
they take place in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up playing with Nolan (Ryan) and (Don) Mattingly,''
Stanley says of the Texas Hall of Famer and former Yankee captain
known as Donnie Baseball. ``Two of the greatest, two of the
hardest-working guys I've ever seen. Think of the impression they
made on young players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar is the same way, and he's still a young guy himself. But
think of the impact he makes.
</P>
<P>
   A left fielder, Troy O'Leary, who not only dedicates himself to
learning the vagaries of the Green Monster but becomes a better
hitter, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes from playing every day and working beforehand and
taking pride in it,'' says Jauss, who works with the outfielder.
``The routine plays are always an out for O'Leary. That's very
important for all clubs, but especially our club.''
</P>
<P>
   A pitcher, Bret Saberhagen, who could be leading the life of a
millionaire yachtsman on Long Island but instead chooses the daily
torture of preparing his surgically reconstructed right shoulder to
tolerate more punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a warrior,'' Williams says. ``He continues to go to
battle. What was he out for, 25 days, and he came back and pitched
that way? He could fit right into that MASH unit.''
</P>
<P>
   A first baseman, Brian Daubach, who nearly decided he had about
as much chance for a promotion as anybody else stuck in a dead-end
job, but refused to quit pushing until a door almost miraculously
opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe fans can relate to me a little bit,'' says Daubach, the
son of an Illinois mail carrier whose baseball shoes have collected
dust in places as far-flung as Virginia and Venezuela, ``because
there are a lot of people in Boston who work hard, and they haven't
had everything given to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach smiled shyly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they just feel sorry for me,'' he says, but he knows
better. ``These fans have been great to me, supporting us the whole
year.''
</P>
<P>
   According to general manager Dan Duquette, It is no accident
that these Red Sox embody virtues as old here as a Cotton Mather
sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team reflects the personality of its manager,'' says
Duquette. ``Jimy created that kind of environment and recruits
those kinds of players to work in that environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what type of player he likes and the type of player
that can be integrated quickly into our operation. I think he likes
directed players, professional players who have defensive skills
that can support our pitching staff, players that have a certain
edge, a mental toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   Guys like Rod Beck, the closer who takes a plane coast-to-coast,
hops a cab at Logan that drops him off at the clubhouse door, puts
on a new uniform, introduces himself to his catcher, and
manufactures a save in his first night with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, of course, deflects that kind of credit, because
pluggers don't take bows until the task at hand has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do some little things,'' he says. ``Just this one game.
Let's go play this one game. Try to make it simple. Don't look at
it from the standpoint of the whole season, but one game. Then use
your skills and execute and help the team win this game. That's how
we focus it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we take a lot of pride in doing our best to execute
properly. They understand what their job is for that day. It might
change tomorrow, but today this is my responsibility and I'll try
to contribute that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield comes to the ballpark as a starter, wakes up a
closer, returns as a long man, comes what he believes is full
circle back to starting, and is in the bullpen again for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Happy about it? Of course not. Just as Stanley would like to
play more, or Reggie Jefferson, or the buried Jeff Frye. But do
they go public with their complaints? Rarely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have personalities in here who bitch publicly,''
Stanley says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after a rained-out game in Chicago, called before most
players had arrived at the ballpark, Wakefield suggests the team
gather at a local watering hole to watch the Oakland game, knowing
that an A's loss means the Sox are in the playoffs. Most guys found
out about it from a message on their hotel answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight guys showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``A night out in a city with great restaurants, great
entertainment places, and yet 28 guys came together for a common
goal,'' Stanley says. ``That tells you something about the
character of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   This, remember, is the same club that once lived by the slogan,
``25 cabs for 25 guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was this. The night the Red Sox clinched their
playoff spot, they did so in the first game of a doubleheader.
There was bubbly on hand, plastic sheeting to protect street
clothes, a lineup card for the second game made up almost wholly of
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Party time?
</P>
<P>
   Stanley shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all there on the bench, for the first pitch of the
second game,'' he says. ``And when we lost that second game, we
were quiet afterward, out of respect for those guys who played.
Yeah, we had reason to celebrate, but how often do you see anybody
celebrate after a loss?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse hard work with overachieving, Stanley says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's overachieving?'' he asks. ``Troy is coming into his own.
Nomar is just being Nomar. 'Tek got a chance to play every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's overachieving? We don't have any 30-home run or 130-,
140-RBI guys. But everybody's just going out and doing their
part.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of approach hasn't gone unnoticed in the
neighborhoods, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boston,'' Jauss says, ``you usually have to win something
big to be embraced. This team has been embraced.''

VATICAN MAKES IT CLEAR: VIEWS ON SEX UNCHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Vatican has reiterated its strong opposition to artificial
contraception and abortion, blasting UN programs that take an
``individualistic and permissive approach'' to sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``A permissive attitude to sexuality ruins the family, weakens
the responsibility of parents, goes against the good of children
and has a highly destabilizing effect on society as a whole,''
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls released the statement to refute reports that the
Vatican had shifted its position on family planning issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to some organs of the press, the director of the
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Dr. Nafis Sadik, expressed
the opinion on the occasion of the presentation of the 1999 World
Population Report in London on Sept. 22 that the Holy See no longer
opposes the techniques and policies of `family planning' propogated
by the UN agency,'' Navarro-Valls said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holy See has not, in fact, changed its well known
position,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls said the Vatican has accepted documents with the
words ``contraception,'' ``family planning,'' ``reproductive
rights,'' ``female-controlled methods,'' ``the widest possible
range of family planning services,'' ``new options,''
``underutilized methods'' and other terms referring to family
planning and the regulation of fertility.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``the Holy See's satisfaction over the consensus
reached in documents in which they are used cannot be interpreted
as a change in its noted position regarding `family planning'
services that do not respect the liberty of the couple, human
dignity and the human rights of those concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls said the Vatican does not support ``procreation at
any cost,'' and does ``recognize that sexuality is an important
aspect of personal identity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not difficult to understand that sexuality finds its
proper and deepest expression in a context of reciprocity,'' he
said. ``However, some programs promoted by the United Nations
inspire a vision of sexuality that does not give due consideration
to the dimension of reciprocity that is the expression of mutual
love and the making of a decision in the context of a stable
conjugal relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead,'' he said, ``they denote an individualistic and
permissive sexual comportment that corrodes an appropriate
comprehension of human dignity and the moral responsibility of
every person.''

   --An Evangelical Lutheran congregation in California has hired a
gay minister to be its pastor, opening itself up to possible
disciplinary action from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America.
</P>
<P>
   The University Lutheran Chapel of Berkeley, Calif. voted
unanimously to call the Reverend Jeff Johnson to the pulpit. The
chapel is both a parish ministry and the Lutheran campus ministry
for the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been pastor of First United Lutheran Church in San
Francisco since his 1990 ordination. When he graduated from the
Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary in Berkeley, Johnson was
regarded ineligible for placement in an Evangelical Lutheran
congregation because of church policy requiring a pledge of
celibacy from gay and lesbian pastors.
</P>
<P>
   When First United challenged the policy and named Johnson pastor
it was expelled from the national church.
</P>
<P>
   University Lutheran Chapel said it was fully aware of the
denomination's policy when it voted to hire Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our actions make it obvious that we disagree with this
policy,'' said Kathleen Gee, president of the chapel's council,
said in a statement. ``However, the chapel remains strongly
committed to serving as the campus ministry for UC-Berkeley and
supports the mission of the ELCA. We called Jeff Johnson because of
his gifts as a minister.''

 &HT;    SUBWAY UNDER THE NILE MAKES EFFICIENT TRAVEL BELOW CONGESTED
CAIRO
 &HT;    With Photos.

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In this noisy, polluted and congested capital,
there is a place where the weary can seek peace and order _ the
subway.
</P>
<P>
   Underground, there are no donkey carts, blaring horns or
smog-belching buses. Instead, video monitors entertain riders as
they wait for punctual, air-conditioned trains.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the first two train cars are reserved for women _ a nod
to Muslim conservatism. Riders, some women in head scarves, some
men in the traditional smock-like Galibiya and sandals, file neatly
through turnstiles onto the platform.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Cairo's Metro snaked it's way under the Nile River,
enhancing a project worthy of the history around it. The new route
connects Giza and Cairo, a metropolitan area of 15 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it, in Egypt, the fourth pyramid,'' said rider Imad
Galal. ``It's a very daring project.''
</P>
<P>
   Galal, a 29-year-old vice president of a building materials
company, has a Fiat Uno but uses the subway because it cuts his
commuting time in half.
</P>
<P>
   The $7 billion Metro is the only subway in Africa or the Middle
East. The first line opened in 1987 and it has expanded to now
cover about 35 miles and 46 stations.
</P>
<P>
   The subway handles more than 1.7 million riders a day, providing
some relief to a dense metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Cairo are notorious for the donkey carts, hobbled
buses and freestyle driving manners. Stoplights are optional,
traffic police fight for attention and lane lines are completely
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Safety is largely maintained through a cacophony of honking and
the fact that traffic moves very slowly. The usual
unair-conditioned taxi or bus ride of 10 miles can take an hour in
stifling heat, leaving the rider with a face-full of sweaty grime.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in the Metro. On the new line below the river, silver
trains _ Japanese-made with French parts _ offer air-conditioned
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure the Metro keeps its Egyptian flavor, stations are
tiled in local motifs. One shows pharaonic musicians and another is
decorated with a large ear and nose, for a famous ear, nose and
throat doctor who once worked in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Cairo Museum, a station named after slain Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat includes encased Egyptian artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Most Egyptians use the train to commute. Special discounts for
students or government workers reduce the fares to pennies. But,
the train could also be useful for tourists seeking to get to the
Cairo Museum or Cairo's old Muslim and Christian quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, plans call for a line to the Cairo airport, now a
hot hour's drive from downtown.
</P>
<P>
   In the Metro headquarters, pinched between two highways always
packed with cars, there's a mixture of high- and low-technology.
</P>
<P>
   Computer panels monitor the trains' progress, but officials
still work in non-descript, linoleum-tiled offices with clunky
one-line telephones.
</P>
<P>
   And the bureaucracy is typically cumbersome. A reporter seeking
to take pictures of the subway can wait for hours and will
eventually be escorted by eight security officers.
</P>
<P>
   But, Mabrouk Abdel'azim, chief of operations for the new line
under the Nile, said the system itself has few delays. The only
problem, he said, is that when there are snags, riders do not file
away to taxis or buses as quickly as they might in Paris or New
York. They simply wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, they insist on using the Metro,'' Abdel'azim said.
``They know it is the best system.''

 &HT;    Apple growing season in Miami Valley met with mixed results
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Americans rate apples on crispness first,
juiciness second and flavor third, according to authors Frank
Browning and Sharon Silva in An Apple Harvest (Ten Speed Press,
$19.95, due in bookstores this month).
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 growing season, local apple growers were rewarded
with at least two out of three, and perhaps three out of three, of
the important characteristics, depending on how much precious
moisture they received.
</P>
<P>
   The late-summer drought hit some orchards hard, local growers
say, reducing the size of the apple crop in two ways: smaller
apples and fewer apples per tree. But those orchards that enjoyed a
refreshing bath at a few opportune times when scattered showers
danced through the Miami Valley, or which had access to water
through irrigation, enjoyed a banner year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're picking 3-inch (diameter) Jonathans and 4-inch Cortlands
off of our irrigated orchards, and that's pretty good size,'' said
Bob Ullrich, general manager of Hidden Valley Fruit Farms in Warren
County.
</P>
<P>
   But apples from non-irrigated orchards are smaller, and overall
yield is down, Ullrich said.
</P>
<P>
   But the drought giveth as it taketh away: The flavor of the 1999
apples are ripe and sweet. The late-summer heat pushed the sugar
content of the fruit high, while the lack of moisture drained a bit
of the juiciness out of some apples, concentrating the sweet
flavors. Locally, a bushel of apples is selling for between $20 and
$28.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the Granny Smiths are sweet,'' said Darke County orchard
owner Winston Brumbaugh, referring to the firm, greenish-gold and
usually very tart apple.
</P>
<P>
   That sweetness, Brumbaugh said, ``just makes the apple cider
that much better.'' And there are plenty of smaller apples
available to make cider.
</P>
<P>
   Both growers expressed concern about the drought's impact on
orchards, which need to replenish themselves to prepare for the
severe Ohio winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more afraid of what could happen next year,'' Brumbaugh
said. ``I've never gone through a drought quite like this before.''

 &HT;    Loyal to the core
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Hilda Mobley was a woman on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   Striding purposefully into Hidden Valley Fruit Farms on Ohio 48
in Warren County late on a hot September afternoon, Mobley knew
what she wanted _ Gala apples _ and she would accept no
substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Hidden Valley has no less than 52 varieties of
apples, or that she'd have to wait a while for the farm market
folks to track down the apples and fill her order. Mobley is loyal
to her variety and proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   She even remembers the first time she bit into a Gala apple. It
was at a fruit stand on Wilmington Pike a decade ago, and the woman
who offered the sample of the then-brand-new variety told her,
``Once you taste these, you'll never go back to any other kind of
apple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And she was right,'' said Mobley, a former Kettering resident
who now lives in Butler County. ``Even my kids are now hooked on
Galas.''
</P>
<P>
   As fierce as Mobley's allegiance is to Galas, other customers
are equally as enthusiastic and loyal to their varieties, be they
Melrose, Fuji, Cortland, Braeburn, Granny Smith or Golden
Delicious. We in the Miami Valley are kind of funny that way.
Growing up in Beavercreek in the 1960s, if it wasn't a Jonathan
apple, it wasn't allowed into our home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, subtle taste shifts do occur, nudged along by the
occasional revolution. New Zealand apple growers shook up the
American apple industry in the 1970s when they pioneered the firm,
mouth-puckering Granny Smith apple. Since then, other varieties
have been developed, including Gala, Jonagold and Gingergold, along
with two of the most recent arrivals, Mutsu (from Japan) and
Honeycrisp (American).
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple tastes are always changing. The younger generation
doesn't want Red Delicious anymore,'' said Winston Brumbaugh, who
grows 26 varieties on 20 acres of orchards outside Arcanum in Darke
County and helps supply apples to Fulton Fruit Farms in Miami
County.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden Valley planted Honeycrisp trees within the past five
years, along with other relatively new varieties such as Braeburn
and Fuji, ``and now we're getting more customer requests for
them,'' said Bob Ullrich, Hidden Valley's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich points to a sales flier from a Michigan nursery that
lists an ``Inventory of Varieties Budded for 2000.'' It offers 76
apple varieties of buds (46 available in trees) on seven types of
root stock.
</P>
<P>
   Apple growers attend seminars and conventions to hear about new
varieties on the horizon to make sure they've got what customers
will want a couple years from now, Ullrich said.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, Ullrich apparently made the right call on a
variety called Gala. At least, Hilda Mobley thinks so.

<P>
   Let's devote today's real estate to a pair of responses to last
month's columns.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Last column, we questioned the marketing strategy of the folks
touting a wine called Le Vin du Coeur. The rose-style wine from the
Provence region of France contains double the usual amount of the
naturally occurring compounds from the skin and seeds of grapes
that some research suggests make red wine in moderation good for
the heart. The souped-up wine is the brainchild of Michael Roux, a
spirits marketer ``who made Absolut Vodka and Bombay Sapphire
household names,'' according Alicia Di Folco, a New York City
beverage marketer who represents the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Di Folco responded to the column with the following:

 &HT;    WIMPY AFRICAN ANTS SHUN MEAN NEIGHBORS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Strange behavior by a species of ant that lives in
trees on the savannas of east Africa has been explained: The
insects are dedicated isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists have known for years that the ants, one of four
distinct species that live in thorned acacia trees, have the
bizarre practice of systematically and severely pruning the trees
they inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   But until now the motive was known only to the ants.
</P>
<P>
   The behavior does not benefit the tree. In fact, the ants are so
diligent
</P>
<P>
   in the business of cutting off and discarding new growth that
the trees not only become stunted, but sterile as well.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in the current issue of Nature, biologists at the
University of California at Davis, the University of Oregon and the
Mpala Research Center in Nanyuki, Kenya, say they have figured out
what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   The ants are attempting to keep the limbs of the trees they
inhabit from growing out and touching those of surrounding trees.
The other trees are occupied by more ferocious ants that, if given
the chance, will come over and evict the pruners.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers created access between neighboring trees. Then,
using statistical techniques, they determined that in subsequent
encounters with invaders, pruning ants had up to an 80 percent
chance of being defeated and evicted from their host tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're isolationists,'' Maureen Stanton, a professor of
ecology at UC-Davis, said of the pruning ants. ``They modify the
environment in such a way to minimize encounters with dominant
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The species that prunes its trees into sterility, is known as
``Crematogaster nigriceps.''
</P>
<P>
   All four species of ant make nests inside hollow, nut-like nodes
that form at the base of the trees' numerous thorns. The stinging
ants swarm by the thousands over browsing antelopes and goats and
help protect the tree, said Stanton. A goat that gets a snootfull
of ants will avoid their acacia tree for up to a month, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an arrangement, in which distinct species such as an ant
and a tree both benefit from an association, is known to biologists
as mutualism. The ant has a place to house workers and nest young
and the tree has a defender from browsing animals. In the case of
C. nigriceps, the mutualistic relationship has been
</P>
<P>
   distorted because of the ant's vulnerability to its dominant
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But the web of life is even more complex than that, because the
pruner ants are dependent in an ironic way on the very neighbors
they fear. If left to themselves on the savanna, they eventually
would render all the acacia trees sterile and destroy their own
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cheaters,'' said Stanton.

ART EXHIBIT HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL HUE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ It wasn't the most compelling artistic
event in the 133-year life of the Canfield Casino. According to
local legend, that occurred around 1930, when a gloriously
inebriated Bing Crosby got busted for a performance art exercise in
public urination off the front steps.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the event the other night was notable enough. In this
Albany suburb, population 23,000, any gathering of 800 people not
involving race horses rates as an occasion. In this case, the
occasion was a fund-raiser to repair Spit and Spat. Those are local
nicknames for the two Carrara marble statues that reign over the
fountain in the northeast corner of Saratoga Springs' gracious
Congress Park.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, somebody took a steel rod and smacked up those
two statues of Tritons, Greek sea gods, that adorn the fountain.
Some 16-year-old kids are charged with felonies, but the statues
need about $20,000 of restoration work. The city also wants a
surveillance system to protect all the statuary in the 33-acre
park.
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Majority Leader Joe Bruno represents Saratoga
Springs. As a powerful lawmaker, he showed up with a blown-up check
for 20 grand to cover the repair work. Fund-raiser ticket sales and
a silent auction brought in enough for a camera system.
</P>
<P>
   Donors seemed to have a great time partying amid the casino's
19th-century elegance. What was interesting, though _ considering
this gigantic flap over the ``Sensation'' exhibit at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art and the firm conviction of so many in the arts
community that ordinary folks just don't care enough about art _ is
that this whole affair was rooted in the premise that art is indeed
important and deserving of broad public support.
</P>
<P>
   Understand this: The Brooklyn battle isn't really about art.
It's about the First Amendment. And even though he milked this mess
shamelessly as he eyes a run for the U.S. Senate, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani finally has begun talking rationally about his
decision to withhold city funds to support display space for an
artwork seen by many Catholics as an affront to their faith.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the ``Sensation'' show is a collage by Chris Ofili,
a British artist of Nigerian origin. It's an image of the Virgin
Mary as an African fertility goddess, complete with lacquered
clumps of elephant manure and 120 photos of female genitalia
clipped from porno magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Ofili claims to be a believing Catholic. He claims to have
harbored no intent to offend with this work. Take him at his word,
and it doesn't really matter. The problem is that any artist's
intent is irrelevant. We're all supposed to make of art what we
will. Many see this work as flagrant sacrilege _ none more so than
Giuliani, who denounced it as sick and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   The issue here, however, is not the mayor as art critic. Any
community looking to politicians for artistic guidance is a
community in direct and dire cultural jeopardy. No, the real issue
here is more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment protects religious freedom just as it
protects free artistic expression. Ofili's collage raises this
touchy legal question: What's the duty of the custodian of public
funds when that money ends up subsidizing what many people can
reasonably interpret as an artistic attack on their faith?
</P>
<P>
   On national television over the weekend, the mayor finally
stopped bellowing and started explaining himself. Yes, he said,
government must permit free artistic expression. But it also must
maintain neutrality toward religion. It can't sponsor religion _
through school prayer, for example _ and it can't finance attacks
on anybody's religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   In short, what we see in Brooklyn is a classic case of First
Amendment rights in conflict. That's why a federal judge is now in
the picture. And should be.

   TEACH: The opening of charter schools has put the KC School
District in a bigger staffing quandary than usual. There's always
the problem of kids who move over the summer and who don't tell the
district until they show up for the first day of school in a new
place. But this year, the district had to guess how many kids would
defect to charters. It guessed wrong, leaving the district short of
teachers in many cases. As many as 40 or 50 students reportedly are
crowded into some district classrooms. Van Horn and Southeast high
schools have been particularly hard hit by students who didn't want
to attend Westport High after it converted to a charter. Trying for

   FAR: The state probation and parole's handling of Michael L.
Farris will be the subject of a hearing today in Jefferson City.
Farris cut off his electronic monitor and state probation officials
took nearly a month to get a request of an arrest warrant. While
Farris was on the loose, he allegedly killed a 76-year-old Kansas
City woman. State Sen. Ronnie DePasco will hold the hearing. The
story also will detail electronic monitors. A judge in New Mexico
got the idea for them from a comic book. They've been around for 20
years and have worked well. Studies show that few commit crimes
while wearing them. However, officials say if defendants cut them
off, authorities must move immediately to arrest the offenders.

   CHIP: Since new state programs started in the past year, more
than 100,000 Missouri and Kansas children who previously lacked
health insurance have gotten coverage, and officials are
campaigning in creative ways to enroll thousands more. There's
another big signup day on Wednesday. It's all part of the nation's
largest single expansion of health insurance for children in 30
years. But enrollment in St. Louis lags far behind Kansas City.
Some Kansas families refuse to enroll because they don't want the
taint of welfare. And enrollment doesn't guarantee that children
actually have access to health care. Lack of dentists is a sore
spot in both states. Photos. Donna McGuire. 45.

COURT RULING SILINCING PREGAME PRAYER ROUSING PASSIONS IN RURAL
TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEPHENVILLE, Texas _ At many rural Texas high schools, a prayer
before a weekend football game has been as much a part of the
autumn ritual as exuberant cheerleaders, die-hard boosters and
homecoming queens.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
silences school-sponsored prayer at the games. The court action,
some local officials and pastors say, runs contrary to the deeply
held religious beliefs shared by many people in these Bible-belt
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools openly defy the ruling, others use imaginative
maneuvers to get around it, and all bemoan the interference of
government in their Friday night rites. School board members find
themselves trying to protect their districts from costly lawsuits
while struggling to respond to constituents' demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's constantly on my mind,'' said Sid Miller, a member of the
Stephenville school board, which this season stopped the
long-standing practice of a pregame invocation. Before one recent
game, school officials literally pulled the plug on students trying
to rig a loudspeaker to amplify their prayers. Students had
succeeded at an earlier game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My phone constantly rings,'' Miller said of constituents
complaining about the court-ordered ban. ``It's a big issue in our
community and a lot of people are upset by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few large urban districts continue the practice, so the court
decision hardly mattered to them. But many suburban high schools
and most rural ones saw a tradition as entrenched as Friday night
lights suddenly jettisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Not all are capitulating.
</P>
<P>
   A random survey shows that high schools in Archer City, Albany,
Brady, Breckenridge, Celina, Crawford, Klondike, Monahans, Mexia,
Ozona and Wall are among those defying the federal court ruling and
allowing pregame prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Some have gone to elaborate lengths to skirt the ruling, which
came in February, but which took effect when high school football
season began. The 5th Circuit, based in New Orleans, handles
appeals from Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to be another Republic of Texas group,'' said
Clifton L. Stephens, superintendent of the Monahans-Wickett-Pyotte
schools. ``We're not trying to be rebellious. We're just a little
West Texas town and we think prayer is appropriate. It's important
to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of rubbing the federal government's face
in it,'' Stephens said, adding that, should anyone be offended or
complain, the district ``will go to `Plan B,' '' which he said
hasn't been formulated.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been no complaints about the prayer, which is
student-led and nonsectarian and contains no proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the first three games, we got applause from both sides of
the field,'' Stephens said.
</P>
<P>
   Some school administrators said they find themselves at odds
with their elected board and the community it represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the last meeting, my board voted in school-sponsored prayer
at games, 6-1, over my recommendation,'' said Scott A. King,
superintendent in Klondike, a 240-student Northeast Texas district,
which fields a six-man football team. ``I think it's illegal and
shows a lack of respect for somebody's religion. But that doesn't
bother a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to protect the community and the board. Now I look
like some kind of atheist.''
</P>
<P>
   Other districts, such as Rockwall and Sonora, have substituted a
``moment of silence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's close to a prayer, but it isn't a prayer, per se, because
that would offend Jewish people or Muslims, although we don't have
any of those in our community,'' said Bill Harlan, Sonora's
superintendent. ``It's sad that a court in Louisiana can tell us
what we can't do in Sonora, Texas. It does bother me what some
liberal court justice can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But who knows? It's on appeal. I know Gov. Bush and other
Southern governors have petitioned to have struck it down.''
</P>
<P>
   In Coleman, authorities allow students and parents to assemble
at a flagpole near an end zone for prayers before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over the public address system,'' Superintendent
Anthony ``Skip'' Casey said. ``We didn't want to quit praying.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``moment of silence'' in the West Texas town of Andrews
isn't so quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The void is filled by radios tuned to a local AM station, KACT,
which at that precise moment broadcasts a prayer that has been
taped earlier by students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much an end-run around the law _ it's within the
law,'' City Councilman Robert Zap told the Lubbock
Avalanche-Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting districts are not without their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   Houston lawyer Kelly Coghlan has sent an advice packet to every
school district in Texas, suggesting that a pregame
``solemnization'' _ a statement of reflection _ would not violate
the 5th Circuit ruling. The Dallas-based Liberty Legal Institute,
the Texas Justice Foundation and the Rutherford Institute are
offering similar counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas Association of School Boards said districts
``really need to comply with the law,'' said Barbara Williams, an
association spokeswoman. ``A moment of silence, if it is not
religiously motivated, will pass muster.''
</P>
<P>
   Some districts have implemented their own creative approaches in
an attempt to satisfy both the courts and the community.
</P>
<P>
   Prayer happens at Hamilton High School home games, but it isn't
illegal, insisted Superintendent Gene Sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamilton school board has taken what Sheets calls a
``neutral stance,'' leaving it up to students whether to pray. The
students can use the public-address system, but must state that the
prayer is not endorsed by the district, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at nearby Lorena and the Panhandle's White Deer said
they also leave prayer up to students.
</P>
<P>
   In Alto, 31 miles north of Lufkin, ``school-sponsored'' prayer
has been replaced by ``community-led'' prayer, Superintendent Lloyd
Worley said. Before home games, fans say the Lord's Prayer in
unison, Worley said.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Fe, the district near Galveston from which the 5th
Circuit ruling stemmed, officials decided to allow a ``message
solemnization,'' with no prayer or reference to a deity.
</P>
<P>
   But the student elected to give the message, Marian Ward,
complained that the rule violated her freedom of speech. She
secured a temporary restraining order, then said a prayer at a home
game.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-day order has expired and U.S. District Judge Sim Lake of
Houston is expected to decide this week whether to renew it, said
Superintendent Richard Ownby.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 24, a 17-year-old senior at Northwest High in Justin
slipped into the press box before a game against Mineral Wells and
broadcast a prayer. District officials indicated that the student
was disciplined, but declined to disclose the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Some administrators say allowing a religious invocation sends a
message to students that scofflaws are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to say it was all right for the school district
to break laws, but you students couldn't break rules,'' Casey said,
explaining why his Coleman district won't allow use of the
public-address system for prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Christians who insist on the right to pregame prayer might be
surprised to find they've opened the door to prayer from such
faiths as Islam or Buddhism, said Bill Tillman, a former professor
of ethics at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and now a
coordinator of theological education at the Baptist General
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think we Baptists as a whole fail to see the cultural
changes going on, the extraordinary influx of other religious
traditions,'' Tillman said.
</P>
<P>
   The religious scholar said he finds pregame prayers potentially
offensive to non-Christians and questions the appropriateness of
the venue.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jim Warmerdam of Stephenville's Grove Street Baptist
Church said he doesn't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are offended when the name of Jesus is mentioned,
well there's a lot of people offended when his name isn't
mentioned,'' Warmerdam said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating that one or two people can dictate to a whole
community or an entire nation how they would like their lives led.
Christian people are tired of being swept back into their churches,
not free to openly acknowledge the God that has given us our
freedoms. It seems hypocritical that they can have a prayer
breakfast in the White House, but we can't have a prayer before a
football game.''
</P>
<P>
   In Stephenville, several residents said they would risk arrest
for the right to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can sit there and tell my child she can't pray,'' said
Mike Dees, a Stephenville retailer. ``That's her constitutional
right. If she wants to go down onto the football field and pray,
I'll be right behind her and willing to go to jail for it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the school district's attorneys met with a group of
Stephenville ministers and asked if the rhetoric and confrontation
could be toned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do the best we can to defuse the situation,''
said Richard Don Coan, one of the lawyers who said the district is
engaged in a difficult balancing act.

   PERFUME-MEN (New York) _ For a growing group of young American
men, perfume is not just some musky bottle that their wives put in
their Christmas stockings and expect them to wear on special
evenings out; it is a grooming product used as routinely as

RUNNING AMOK WITH AOL? TRY THIS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I guess anyone who has been online for more
than a month or so has an America Online horror story. I won't bore
you much. They knocked me off for several weeks and continued to
charge me. Disgruntled users should do what I did. Fire AOL. Don't
even try to call their help desk. Call your bank. Dispute any
current charges, and don't accept any new ones. You'll get
attention real fast. _ Righteously Indignant
</P>
<P>
   Dear Righteously: Half of America must be ticked off at AOL,
judging by the ton of e-mail clogging up my mailbox after I told
some guy to just tough it out until he got through to a rep so he
could actually quit. I've got no beef with AOL, but I haven't tried
to unsubscribe lately, either. Plus, I'm so full of Saint Johnswort
right now, I'm starting to think this old world of ours is a pretty
wonderful place where all we have to do is love one another. Tell
you what: I'll let you guys do the ranting for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: If you want to cancel AOL or another ISP, just
call your credit card company and tell them to refuse future
billing _ it's amazing how fast you will be canceled when you stop
paying. _ Chop 'Em Off
</P>
<P>
   Dear Chop: I wonder if that would work for my utility bills. I
don't think I really used all the electricity they said I did.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Several years ago, I was having the same
problem with Compuserve. I hastened the solution by ``cutting them
off at the credit card.'' That got their attention. There were a
few threatening letters and e-mails, but they finally stopped. No
matter how tough and insensitive some of these leatherheads are,
they have a tender spot somewhere. Keep probing until you find it.
_ Free at Last
</P>
<P>
   Dear Free: Aren't any of you guys worried about this stuff
showing up on your permanent records? I almost got turned down by
the mortgage company because I had disputed a J.C. Penney bill for
some jockey shorts. Anyone who knows me knows it's boxers or
nothing. Lord knows what the AOL goons would have put in my
financial folder.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I have found a phone number that AOL does not
give out freely that will help your reader cancel his service
without any problems: (888) 265-8008. _ Number's Up
</P>
<P>
   Dear Num: I actually tried this number on a Sunday afternoon and
got through to a real human being within 30 seconds. I was too
awe-struck to do anything but hang up, though. I should have at
least asked if his refrigerator was running. Better call it fast,
though, now that it's not a big secret anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: A suggestion: Write the attorney general of
Virginia. That is the state where AOL's headquarters is. The
address is: Office of the Attorney General, Anti-Trust and Consumer
Litigation Division, 900 E. Main, Richmond, VA 23219. _ Litigious
</P>
<P>
   Dear Litigious: Can't we all just be friends? I guess not. I
talked to a couple of suits at the AG's office last week while I
was making some other personal long-distance calls at work. Even
though AOL is in Virginia, they suggest writing your own state's
attorney general, then sending a copy of that to Virginia. Call 'em
at (804) 786-6551 if you have more questions. Use the phone at the
office.
</P>

TWO NEW EXAMPLES OF MOUSE EVOLUTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer mouse has come a long way, baby, since Douglas
Englebart's very first model, invented in 1963 as a simple wooden
shell on wheels. When it was finally patented in 1970, it was given
the catchy name of ``X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, mice are the primary way folks interact with their PCs,
thanks to graphical interfaces and Web browsers. They're bristling
with new features, and you certainly won't suffer any wood
splinters from the smooth plastics and ergonomic shapes currently
used.
</P>
<P>
   And the mouse continues to evolve. A stroll down the
pointing-devices aisle at your local computer store will turn up
dozens of different styles and designs.
</P>
<P>
   I've been playing with two of the more advanced models from the
biggest players in the mouse category _ Microsoft and Logitech.
Both are excellent mice, but I sure wish either company would
combine the best attributes of both into one. It'd be a killer.
</P>
<P>
   _ IntelliPoint Explorer, $75, Microsoft: Anyone who has used a
computer for any length of time knows what eventually happens to
its mouse. No matter how clean you keep your workspace, dust, hair
and bits of grit are picked up by the mouse's ball and deposited
inside its housing.
</P>
<P>
   This junk gets onto the rollers that sense which way the ball is
moving _ and those rollers ultimately transmit location information
to the PC, which controls your cursor. If the rollers can't roll
smoothly, you get sluggish performance, or your mouse appears to
hit ``dead spots'' where the cursor won't even move.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's slick new IntelliPoint Explorer mouse fixes this
problem by doing away with the ball and replacing it with a bright
light and a tiny camera. The light points at the work surface, and
the camera snaps 1,500 ``pictures'' a second, reporting the changes
as movement back to the PC. That's a much faster report rate than
you get with a traditional mouse, resulting in smoother onscreen
movement. It also plugs into either a PS/2 or a Universal Serial
Bus port _ use the latter, if you can, for the best responsiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's no ball, you don't need a mouse pad. You can use
this mouse on almost any surface, from the top of a desk to the top
of your thigh.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, this is not the first use of optical technology in
mice. Sun Microsystems for years made an optical mouse, but it
required a mirror-like mouse pad.
</P>
<P>
   The IntelliPoint Explorer, despite its klunky name, has a cool
design. It's a silvery gray on top and a translucent red on the
bottom. A bit of this translucent plastic curves up at the back of
the mouse, showing a red glow when the computer's on.
</P>
<P>
   It has two buttons in the usual place and a scrolling wheel
centered between them that, when pushed, serves as a third button.
There are two more buttons on the left side, where your thumb would
be, which are preset as forward and back browser-page controls. You
can, of course, reprogram all five buttons.
</P>
<P>
   I enjoyed using this mouse, particularly when playing
fast-action games, because it moved so smoothly, both on the
desktop _ where I'd removed my mouse pad _ and onscreen. My only
complaint about the design is that the thumb buttons are placed too
high on the side _ they should be lower, where the thumb naturally
falls when holding the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   This model is a bit pricey, but Microsoft also has a $55 version
that puts the light-and-camera feature _ which it calls IntelliEye
_ into its standard mouse body. Now, if only it was cordless ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Cordless MouseMan Wheel, $60, Logitech: Once you've used a
cordless mouse, it's hard to go back, and Logitech has long made
the best cordless mice around. Even after playing with Microsoft's
impressive new product, I'm probably going to return to this one.
</P>
<P>
   The Cordless MouseMan Wheel has the same rounded, satisfying
feel as the curvy Logitech MouseMan Wheel. Like the Microsoft
mouse, it's a silvery gray. It's got some heft to it, and will easy
fill a large hand. People with small hands might not find it as
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It's got rubberized sides for a solid grip, and a thumb button
properly placed near the bottom of the mouse's left side. The wheel
centered between the right and left mouse buttons also can be
programmed as a button. It doesn't quite roll as smoothly as the
Microsoft wheel, however.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this mouse is best known for what it lacks _ a cord.
It uses radio waves to send its position signals to a small base
station _ about the size of a cigarette pack _ that plugs into a
computer's PS/2 port.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse uses a pair of triple-A batteries, which last about 4
to 6 months before they need to be replaced. You can tell when the
batteries are low _ the mouse occasionally loses contact with the
base station, which is easily fixed by pressing a button labeled
Connect on the base.
</P>
<P>
   Not having to keep a cord out of the way is a joy, particularly
in fast-action gaming. But, because of the limitations of the radio
frequencies used, the reporting rate to the computer is slower.
It's not something you notice in day-to-day Windows usage, but it
becomes quickly apparent in a hectic Quake III Arena firefight.
</P>
<P>
   Both mice come with useful software for configuring the various
buttons and other features. I prefer the Logitech MouseWare
program, which is easier to use and has more options.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this mouse doesn't use the USB port, but again,
the speed-up you'd get with that option is likely to be negated by
the radio connection. It would be nice to see some technology that
inexpensively speeds this up. Then, if Logitech just converted to
an optical system to replace the ball in its cordless mouse, I'd be
in pointing-device heaven.
</P>

PUTTING OLD HOME VIDEOS ON CD-ROM CAN BE DONE, BUT IT SURE WON'T BE
CHEAP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clil~us)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I just got a writeable CD-ROM drive. Now I'd like to take
some old home videos and put them on CD-ROM. What do I need to do
this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unless your computer already has what's necessary, you're
going to have to make another hardware investment, and probably
pick up some new software as well.
</P>
<P>
   You will need a video card that can accept video images, or an
add-on video capture card. Most of these come with at least
rudimentary versions of video editing software. If you want to get
fancy, you'll probably have to buy the full version.
</P>
<P>
   Some computers come with a special port that is excellent for
capturing video, called FireWire or iLink. With this, you can
bypass the video card and take the images in directly, but your
camera must have one of these ports as well.
</P>
<P>
   Among the video cards that include video-in capabilities are
3dfx's new Voodoo3 3500 TV; ATI Technologies' All-in-Wonder 128;
and Matrox's G200 TV. All of these are available in both AGP and
PCI versions, except for the Voodoo3, which comes in AGP only.
</P>
<P>
   There are several products out there that will augment an
existing graphics card if you don't want to replace your current
model. For example, Iomega makes a device called the Buz that
connects to a PC or a Mac. (Note that Iomega recently said it would
quit distributing the PC version via retail, but you may still be
able to find some in stores.)
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need software if the package that comes with your
hardware isn't adequate. Try Ulead's Video Studio 3.0, MGI
Software's VideoWave II or, if you're really serious (and
affluent), Adobe Premiere 5.0.
</P>
<P>
   How much moolah are we talking about here? The video cards with
capture capabilities will run in the $200-$300 price range; add-on
boards will be a little less. The software will start in the $100
price range, and go up to well over $600.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a strange problem with Outlook Express 5. When I type
a line of text, it looks fine. It's in a normal font. When I type
the next line, it's much smaller. Then, when I type the third line,
it's back to normal. What can I do to stop this from happening?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a known bug in Outlook Express, and it's easily
fixable.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the Tools menu, then click on Options. Go to the Read
tab, and then click on Fonts. Choose the Medium setting, and click
OK.
</P>
<P>
   You can find more information on this bug at the Microsoft
Knowledge Base at support.microsoft.com/support/c.asp. Enter
Outlook Express as the product you want to search on, and use the
keywords ``font changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sometimes when I get an e-mail on America Online and it's
supposed to have an attachment, it comes through all garbled, with
a note that it's a MIME file. What is this, and how can I view the
attachment?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a function of the way AOL's e-mail works. MIME, or
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, is a way of converting a
file into a format _ a process called encoding _ that can be sent
via the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, AOL's e-mail software doesn't always handle the
decoding of these attachments properly. Instead of getting the file
as it is intended _ say, as a JPG picture, a word processing
document or a program _ it comes through with a .MIM extension.
</P>

   SAROV, Russia _ The United States and Russia have quietly
resolved a long-simmering dispute over the illegal sale of
sophisticated IBM computers to Russia's leading nuclear weapons
lab, American officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the process both sides have helped open to cyberspace what
was once one of the most secret installations of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the 16 computers, now fully licensed and operational,
will be on display as part of the ``open computing center'' that
the American Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is to inaugurate at
the lab that developed Russia's hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The center is a joint project of the Energy Department and
Minatom, the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, to which Washington
contributed $2.3 million. It is intended to help find jobs outside
the weapons industry for thousands of scientists, engineers and
technicians at this remote nuclear city and its premier lab.
</P>
<P>
   In quiet talks for more than two years Washington had insisted
that the computers, which IBM sold to Russia in 1996 without the
required export license, either be returned or openly dedicated to
nonweapons work. Russia initially refused, but earlier this year,
negotiators agreed that the computers would be incorporated into
the computer center, which is expected to create 80 technology jobs
in its first year and as many as 650 in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The center is one of five projects planned here under the
Nuclear Cities Initiative, which Richardson began last year. It is
aimed at converting Russia's 10 closed nuclear cities to peaceful
work. But Congress severely cut the administration's request
earlier this week, granting the ambitious undertaking only $7
million of the $30 million sought.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson defended the initiative in an interview, saying he
hoped to use money from other weapons conversion programs to help
scientists here and at Snezhinsk and Zheleznogorsk, two other
nuclear cities, to convert to peaceful work. ``We are all concerned
that scientists might be forced by economic necessity to seek
employment in rogue states or among terrorists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarov, some 250 miles southeast of Moscow, is the Russian
equivalent of Los Alamos National Laboratory, where America's
nuclear bombs were designed. But in addition to designing bombs,
this complex, roughly the size of Washington, D.C., still
engineers, fabricates and assembles nuclear weapons warheads and
components.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Soviet Union's effort to mimic the Manhattan
Project, Stalin established a nuclear complex here in 1946 and
closed the city. It takes its name from a monastery held sacred by
the Russian Orthodox for its link to one of the most revered
Russian saints, Seraphim of Sarov.
</P>
<P>
   The walled monastery became the site of the first Soviet nuclear
program under Stalin. The remote city was renamed Arzamas-16, which
appeared on no Soviet maps and was accessible to few. Not until
1990 did the Soviets acknowledge its existence. Russia restored the
city's historic name in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rady Ilkayev, director of the Russian lab and a prominent
physicist, talked Thursday about the institute's 30,000 employees,
and their struggle to survive the downsizing of the nuclear weapons
industry in this now impoverished city of 80,000. Ilkayev said the
institute's staff had shrunk almost in half, to 18,000 employees
from 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the institute once controlled virtually all of the
city's vital infrastructure, he said that 40 percent of Sarov's
transport, 90 percent of its medical infrastructure and 70 percent
of its sports arenas had now been transferred to the city
government.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen percent of the lab's employees now work in the civilian
sector, but Ilkayev said he hoped to increase that proportion to 29
percent by 2002. He said this could be achieved partly by expanding
the institute's diamond-cutting business, its oil and gas
enterprises, and its production of hydraulic drives and medical
isotopes.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the United States provides some 86 percent of the $8
million that the institute receives each year in aid from foreign
governments and labs, Ilkayev called the United States his main
partner. He said that American support had helped ``prevent
critical leakage'' of key scientists with nuclear weapons
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that his institute would need $40 million over
three years to restructure the lab. With Russian bank interest
rates exceeding 50 percent, raising that amount of investment
capital domestically is impossible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had evaded American export laws by buying the IBM
computers in 1996 through Moscow-based middlemen. IBM installed
them here. Though a federal grand jury investigated the transfer,
no charges were brought against IBM.

COURT RULING SILENCING PREGAME PRAYER ROUSING PASSIONS IN RURAL
TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEPHENVILLE, Texas _ At many rural Texas high schools, a prayer
before a weekend football game has been as much a part of the
autumn ritual as exuberant cheerleaders, die-hard boosters and
homecoming queens.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
silences school-sponsored prayer at the games. The court action,
some local officials and pastors say, runs contrary to the deeply
held religious beliefs shared by many people in these Bible-belt
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools openly defy the ruling, others use imaginative
maneuvers to get around it, and all bemoan the interference of
government in their Friday night rites. School board members find
themselves trying to protect their districts from costly lawsuits
while struggling to respond to constituents' demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's constantly on my mind,'' said Sid Miller, a member of the
Stephenville school board, which this season stopped the
long-standing practice of a pregame invocation. Before one recent
game, school officials literally pulled the plug on students trying
to rig a loudspeaker to amplify their prayers. Students had
succeeded at an earlier game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My phone constantly rings,'' Miller said of constituents
complaining about the court-ordered ban. ``It's a big issue in our
community and a lot of people are upset by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few large urban districts continue the practice, so the court
decision hardly mattered to them. But many suburban high schools
and most rural ones saw a tradition as entrenched as Friday night
lights suddenly jettisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Not all are capitulating.
</P>
<P>
   A random survey shows that high schools in Archer City, Albany,
Brady, Breckenridge, Celina, Crawford, Klondike, Monahans, Mexia,
Ozona and Wall are among those defying the federal court ruling and
allowing pregame prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Some have gone to elaborate lengths to skirt the ruling, which
came in February, but which took effect when high school football
season began. The 5th Circuit, based in New Orleans, handles
appeals from Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to be another Republic of Texas group,'' said
Clifton L. Stephens, superintendent of the Monahans-Wickett-Pyotte
schools. ``We're not trying to be rebellious. We're just a little
West Texas town and we think prayer is appropriate. It's important
to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of rubbing the federal government's face
in it,'' Stephens said, adding that, should anyone be offended or
complain, the district ``will go to `Plan B,' '' which he said
hasn't been formulated.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been no complaints about the prayer, which is
student-led and nonsectarian and contains no proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the first three games, we got applause from both sides of
the field,'' Stephens said.
</P>
<P>
   Some school administrators said they find themselves at odds
with their elected board and the community it represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the last meeting, my board voted in school-sponsored prayer
at games, 6-1, over my recommendation,'' said Scott A. King,
superintendent in Klondike, a 240-student Northeast Texas district,
which fields a six-man football team. ``I think it's illegal and
shows a lack of respect for somebody's religion. But that doesn't
bother a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to protect the community and the board. Now I look
like some kind of atheist.''
</P>
<P>
   Other districts, such as Rockwall and Sonora, have substituted a
``moment of silence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's close to a prayer, but it isn't a prayer, per se, because
that would offend Jewish people or Muslims, although we don't have
any of those in our community,'' said Bill Harlan, Sonora's
superintendent. ``It's sad that a court in Louisiana can tell us
what we can't do in Sonora, Texas. It does bother me what some
liberal court justice can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But who knows? It's on appeal. I know Gov. Bush and other
Southern governors have petitioned to have struck it down.''
</P>
<P>
   In Coleman, authorities allow students and parents to assemble
at a flagpole near an end zone for prayers before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over the public address system,'' Superintendent
Anthony ``Skip'' Casey said. ``We didn't want to quit praying.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``moment of silence'' in the West Texas town of Andrews
isn't so quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The void is filled by radios tuned to a local AM station, KACT,
which at that precise moment broadcasts a prayer that has been
taped earlier by students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much an end-run around the law _ it's within the
law,'' City Councilman Robert Zap told the Lubbock
Avalanche-Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting districts are not without their supporters.

TAKING A CALL FROM ET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My desktop com a hot busy procing mok,l t cardses foal ng for an
ET _ not an ET that is phoning home, but one that is calling to us.
</P>
<P>
   My computer isn't doing this alone, of course. Searching for ET
requires a lot of things I don't have, the first one being a
multi-million dollar radio telescope. Even if I had my own
telescope, my computer lacks the power to analyze all of the radio
signals coming in from space, filter out the background noise, and
scan for the sounds that might be characteristic of intelligence.
In fact, there is no computer on the earth today that is powerful
enough to accomplish this task.
</P>
<P>
   That's why my computer has joined the ranks of more than a
million other machines in the international Search For
Extraterrestrial Intelligence At Home (SETI(at symbol)Home)
project, which is being coordinated by the University of California
at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(at symbol)Home is one of several projects under way right
now that is harnessing the power of multiple computers for a single
purpose. Another is Distributed.NET, which is using spare CPU time
on several thousand computers to crack encryption keys. Both these
projects distribute a special-purpose screen saver that runs on
Windows and Macintosh-based PCs. When you aren't using your desktop
computer, the screen saver comes on and starts crunching
mathematical problems. When you start using your computer again,
the program politely saves its work and gets out of your way.
(Versions of the SETI(at symbol)Home program are also available for
more than a dozen versions of UNIX.)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the key to coordinating these distributed
projects. The first time you start up the SETI(at symbol)Home
program, the software makes a connection over the Internet to a
computer in California and downloads a ``work unit'' _ that is, a
set of measurements from a particular part of the sky. The work
unit is about 350 kilobytes of data, so it downloads in less than
three minutes over a dial-up telephone line. That's not a lot of
data, but it takes about 40 hours of CPU time on a 550 Mhz Pentium
III computer to crunch it. When my computer is done with the data
processing it makes another call on the Internet to Berkeley,
uploads its results, and downloads a new work unit. So far my
desktop has completed 10 work units.
</P>
<P>
   I run a second copy of SETI(at symbol)Home on my laptop
computer. Now, between my trips, the laptop spends its days
searching the stars. It's about a third as fast as my desktop, but
it has still completed more than 10 work units all on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it costs money for me to leave my computers on all
the time. My laptop's power supply draws 82 watts, which translates
to between 5 and 10 cents per day in higher electricity costs. But
that's money that I'm happy to pay to support this scientific
project. Indeed, this nickel-a-day donation is key to the success
of the Berkeley project. Even if Intel or Compaq had donated a
million desktop computers to the SETI project (an unlikely
proposition at best), it is hard to imagine that the Berkeley team
could have risen to money to pay for the electricity, cooling, and
laboratory space those machines would have needed.
</P>
<P>
   To further mobilize the community, the SETI(at symbol)Home
researchers have put together a comprehensive Web site that allows
participants like me to see how their contributions to the effort
stack up against the project as a whole. The Web site reports the
number of work units you have completed, the total time you have
spent crunching data for the project, and the average amount of
time spent per work unit. The Web site further appeals to the
competitive streak that most humans have by allowing individuals to
join together in teams. Schools, clubs, and companies all have
fielded SETI teams. Not surprisingly, the top-ranked teams are at
Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics, where engineers run the
software on some of the world's fastest workstations. Not only is
this great for science, but it's also a not-so-subtle form of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have said SETI(at symbol)Home is a model for
how many science projects requiring massive amounts of computation
will work in the future. Others have taken the idea further, saying
we'll be able to make a few extra dollars by renting out our
computers to corporations, electronically selling cycles to the
highest bidders. I don't think this is likely.
</P>
<P>
   The first barrier is security. Everyone who runs SETI(at
symbol)Home on their computers has put a tremendous amount of trust
in the program's authors. We trust that the astronomical screen
saver isn't doing anything nefarious, like searching for
credit-card numbers or spinning calculations for nuclear weapons.
Likewise, the SETI(at symbol)Home coordinators trust that misguided
pranksters won't modify their programs and make them report false
sightings of ET. It might only take a few such cases to poison the
community spirit that has led more than a million people all over
the world to download and run the SETI software.
</P>
<P>
   A second potential threat is competition. As more of these
parallel computation projects spring up, there will be more and
more competition between them. Clearly, if there are hundreds of
projects like this on the Internet, they all won't be able to get a
million participants.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these fears of mine, SETI(at symbol)Home is off to a
wonderful start. And it would be auspicious indeed if the only way
that we could hear ET's call is by working together as a human
race, without national or language barriers separating us.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Don't abandon logic when illogical problems crop up
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of my friends expect computers to be different
from the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   They expect computers to follow logical laws. Computers are not
_ uh _ computerlike. Instead, they are catlike.
</P>
<P>
   When something is wrong with a computer _ at work or at home _
most of us look for an answer. But computers are not as reliable as
the sun and the moon or even the guy who sprays your home for bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that computers are magic. The programs that perform
your tasks are no more than a bunch of numbers. The computer chip
is no more than a hunk of silicon, treated with chemicals (they
call it doping the chip). So all this magic is performed by a
glasslike substance that is being fed a series of zeros and ones.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder computers can be contrary, refusing to perform some
routine task or freezing up like a pond in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   If you were dealing with a machine of logic, you'd figure that
the notion would be to find the problem and fix it. Not so. Not
when it comes to one-time glitches.
</P>
<P>
   But the most difficult thing for a computer novice to do is
nothing. Most of us can create real problems by trying to fix what
is essentially a one-time occurrence. Sure, if your computer
continues to exhibit the problem, then it needs examining. But the
best thing most of us can do with these one-time problems is to
just restart the computer if necessary and keep going.
</P>
<P>
   With real problems, it's a different story. But some of the
methods of diagnosing the problem involve the same sort of
common-sense attitude. Today we'll take a look at some of the ways
to gain some sort of control over your computer when it decides to
take a vacation from reality.
</P>
<P>
   The first suspect _ when you have a problem _ relies on the fact
that computers can hate change worse than the stodgiest middle-aged
person.
</P>
<P>
   So when a problem pops up, think back and mentally review any
change you've made _ adding software, changing the settings in
Windows, downloading a file, adding a new computer accessory _
between the time the computer worked correctly and the time the
problem popped up.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to uninstall (I hate the way computerese has
changed the language, but that's a topic for another day) the
offending program, or remove the new device to find out if it is
the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble with tracing the cause of a problem is that
_ just as in life _ sometimes a lot of changes happen at once. So
you have to eliminate each potential suspect until you find the one
causing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In about half the computer problems you face, you'll fix the
problem that way. You find the trouble spot and then either install
it again to find _ magically it seems _ that all is well, or
contact the manufacturer for help.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes you'll do all that and your computer will still
refuse to talk to you, just like a cranky child. For many of you,
that's the time to seek outside help. But the more adventurous can
take the next step _ reinstalling Windows.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never done that, you may have all sorts of fears that
you'll be starting over and have to reinstall each program that you
own.
</P>
<P>
   But when you reinstall Windows without removing the old copy,
all your settings, all your programs, stay the same. (Be sure you
use a regular copy of Windows, not one of those CDs that come with
some computers that return them to the same condition that they
were in when you unpacked the box.)
</P>
<P>
   What I'm trying to say today is that, even if your computer
isn't logical, you still should be. Leave one-time problems alone
and _ when big problems come along _ check out the most logical
suspects first.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Civil War Experience offers expert tutoring
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ War interests me only in terms of the way it can draw
out the best and worst of its individual participants; the only
``good'' war I know of is the made-up and idealistic one I once
heard a young woman refer to as ``World War Eleven.''
</P>
<P>
   That was essentially a battle between the good to fairly good
folks and the shady to downright evil people, and the good guys
won. None of the other wars in my ken have that degree of nobility.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil War, or the War Between the States, if you
insist, was our own contribution to the record of human savagery, a
bloody domestic dispute whose repercussions may never go away. Not
being a Southerner by birth or heritage, its conduct has never been
of great interest.
</P>
<P>
   I am, however, surrounded by friends who dwell on every detail
of every battle, who will argue for hours over which battle might
have had a different outcome had this blockhead or that ignoramus
only sent his troops hither instead of yon.
</P>
<P>
   To them I recommend a CD-ROM from Southpeak Interactive and the
History Channel called The Civil War Experience. It is a lavishly
produced teaching instrument which, while probably too elementary
for the died-in-the-wool amateur historian, should be more than
enough to get any student through this regrettable portion of our
history with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Civil War Experience is expertly produced. It follows the
current trend of providing only a small manual, but navigation is
so intuitive that I haven't even looked at the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   It provides the student with a basic grasp of the political
events that led up to the war, the condition of the nation and its
people at the time, and the personalities involved in the outbreak
of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   For the strategic enthusiast, each major battle is presented
with the major troop movements animated on a battle map, with a
detailed spoken and written description. All the odd little corners
of the conflict, such as the ethnic regiments and the Zouaves,
along with the daily lives of Union and Confederate soldiers, their
equipment and logistics, is presented.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of photographs to illustrate every element
and a very well-organized time line of the war, although it is
approached directly only by time and not by event. This is
mitigated, however, by a search function that will sift through the
entire CD-ROM for keywords.
</P>
<P>
   The only major segment of the program that might be questioned
is the ``Eyewitness'' portion, in which someone with a suitable
accent reads a paragraph about an event written by someone who
participated in it. Since the writer obviously isn't doing the
reading, it could just as well have been presented by text alone,
saving space for more information.
</P>
<P>
   A search for the word ``cannon,'' for instance, produces five
major hits, each of which has several subtexts.
</P>
<P>
   The program also provides plenty of good links to the Web _ the
search function can be aimed at either the CD or the Web _
including a year's membership in a Civil War subscription site.
</P>
<P>
   The bells and whistles are just fine, too, with a lot of rebel
yelling and musket firing at the right points, and ``original''
music largely consisting of medleys from popular tunes of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for the kids and the bored, a couple of simple games that
have almost nothing to do with the Civil War.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    A modern touch for Williamsburg
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Colonial Williamsburg, an aristocratic slice of the
past preserved for future generations, is getting modern on us. The
southeastern Virginia tourist attraction is letting people plan
their vacations from its Web site, colonialwilliamsburg.org.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Plan Your Visit'' section lets people choose from
pre-planned tour options or create their own. Visitors can also
look at hotel and restaurant information for the Colonial
Williamsburg area, including seasonal rates and pictures of the
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   A map feature lets you move a cursor over an area and then watch
an image of the site pop up.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site still has its old features, including directions,
advice on where to sleep, eat and shop, and ticket and handicapped
access information.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Williamsburg is run by the Colonial Williamsburg
Foundation, a nonprofit group. Williamsburg is about 150 miles
southeast of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   PAGER ANNOUNCES SCHOOL BUS ARRIVAL
</P>
<P>
   What if you could have a few minutes of advance notice that the
school bus was coming? Depending on the punctuality of the school
bus driver, those minutes could be a blessing. That's the logic
behind www.buspal.com, a paging service that notifies parents, for
a monthly fee, a few minutes before the school bus approaches the
stop.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can get the service by paying $80 for a pager, $50 to
set up the service and cover in-home training, and $40 per year. Or
parents can pay $20 for a 30-day trial.
</P>
<P>
   BOLT.COM TARGETS TEENS
</P>
<P>
   There once was a time, not so long ago, where one of the few
places a teen-ager could make power statements such as ``Hall &AMP;
Oates Rules'' was a notebook cover, a blackboard or the back of a
school bus seat.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's the Internet. And Web sites like bolt.com, designed
to appeal to the teen crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bolt.com tries to be a Yahoo for kids. Visitors to Yahoo can
check stock market message boards and comparison shop for plane
travel. Things at bolt.com are a bit more demographic-specific. A
recent topic in the Style and Looks category is ``Streakmo's got
bad acne. Here's help.''
</P>
<P>
   The site tries to tap into some of that teen spending money.
Site advertisers include Apple Computer, Rolling Stone magazine,
Levis, Butterfinger and the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   MADEMOISELLE THINKS INTERNET WILL CLICK
</P>
<P>
   Mademoiselle has developed a magazine supplement for all the
women out there who love the Internet but never had a publication
designed to nurture that love. Click Here debuts in the October
issue. The first cover features musician Alanis Morissette. It
tries to counter perceptions that most women are not as interested
in technology as men. How does it do that? For starters, it quotes
Alyssa Milano of TV's ``Charmed'' as saying, ``My Apple Powerbook
has 333MHz and 64 MB of RAM.'' The first issue includes a feature
about gadgets, how to decide what kind of computer you need and an
introductory piece on online shopping. A section on favorite Web
sites includes these recommendations: Best cooking site?
www.mymenus.com; Best health info? www.intelihealth.com,
www.navigator.tufts.edu and www.phys.com; Best laughs?
www.theonion.com; Best love and sex advice?
www.womenswire.com/emale; Best online magazine? www.salonmag.com.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    `Command &AMP; Conquer' sequel magazine's focus
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Among the new computer games eagerly awaited by people
everywhere (especially those who like a good fight) is the sequel
of ``Command &AMP; Conquer,'' ``Tiberian Sun.'' Learn about this game
in a hands-on report in the October issue of Computer Gaming World.
The magazine sent two of its writers to a Las Vegas trade show,
where they got to play ``Tiberian Sun.'' Their article discusses
everything from strategy to new weaponry. There are also lots of
color screen shots.
</P>
<P>
   Are there no private corners left? Apparently not many,
according to the October issue of Yahoo Internet Life. It features
a cover story on the growing use of little digital cameras called
Web cams on the Internet. People are using them to photograph
themselves in real time and post that video on the Web. The amazing
thing is that people are surrendering their privacy willingly,
inviting complete strangers to view everything from the banal to
the intimate. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Who says you can't teach an old Mac new tricks? Mac developer
Connectix has perfected its software that emulates Windows 98 on
Apple computers. The latest version, called Virtual PC 3.0, has
just been released. This new version supports the new Universal
Serial Bus peripheral standard, runs faster and recognizes
AppleScript, the programming language. Virtual PC sells for around
$180.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some comic relief from the ongoing marketing crush
of the coming holiday season? Then check out the site of Gobler
Toys. This bizarre site, a spoof on modern toy marketing, features
such things as a battery-powered ``smell amplifier.'' Or how about
Weiner Works, a device that lets you make your own hot dogs from
meat scraps. To quote a reviewer in Yahoo Internet Life, ``you'll
find something vaguely disturbing here.'' The site is at
www.goblertoys.com.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Scanner made with convenience in mind
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you do a lot of research and often need to
copy a few lines to use later, the Siemens Pocket Reader was
designed with you in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Pocket Reader is a hand-held scanner weighing only 3 ounces
that can read text from magazines, books, legal documents,
newspapers, letters and so on and save the text for downloading to
a computer later.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Siemens AG Austria, sent a sample to the
Dayton Daily News for testing, and it performed fairly well. But
minor inaccuracies in reading characters make it more useful for
note-taking than for gathering precise data.
</P>
<P>
   The Pocket Reader measures 6 1/4 by 1 1/2 by 1 inches and fits
into a pocket almost as neatly as a fountain pen. It runs on a pair
of AAA batteries.
</P>
<P>
   To use the reader, you hold it upright and drag it from left to
right across a line of type. Built-in character recognition
software reads the text and displays it in a readout window along
the shaft of the reader.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket Reader can hold up to 40,000 characters, the equivalent
of about 20 pages of text, according to Siemens. It scans text that
is 8 to 16 points in size, so it captures most common text but not
large headlines.
</P>
<P>
   It also captures white type on a black background but may have
trouble with some colors of type on colored backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The system for getting information out of the Pocket Reader into
a computer is outstanding. The gadget comes with a cord that plugs
into a serial port on a desk or laptop computer. Plug the cord into
a jack on the Pocket Reader, and text automatically transfers into
a simple text document.
</P>
<P>
   You can save the text document and use word processing software
to clean up any minor errors. You then can get a printout or send
the text in an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket Reader is available online at www.PocketReader.com for
$169.95. It comes with batteries, a CD containing a tutorial and a
program for downloading from the reader to a computer, and the
connector to link the device to a computer serial port.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Y2K problems lurk in software
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple is a bit smug about the year 2000, for good
reason. Even computers running the oldest version of its operating
system are Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   That means Macs can process dates after the beginning of the new
year. How far ahead they can read dates varies, though, depending
on what operating system your Mac is running.
</P>
<P>
   The operating system is the software that comes inside your Mac,
controlling everything from the way the screen looks to how
software runs. The original Mac systems can read dates through Feb.
6, 2040. The newer systems can read dates through the year 29940.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has been trumpeting the Y2K compliance of its machines
since the Super Bowl, when it ran ads noting this fact. The company
has also assembled online a formidable database about what machines
and components it has tested to date. You'll find this site at
www.apple.com/about/year2000.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, all of this doesn't mean Mac users are home free when it
comes to Y2K. Apple doesn't control software developed for its
computers, and not all of it has been upgraded to handle the turn
of the century.
</P>
<P>
   This is true especially of old programs that, although
discontinued, are still in use. I'm afraid the time has finally
come to junk that favorite, although badly dated, shareware
calendar program.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem is using files originally formatted in
PC applications. These files can't take advantage of the Macs'
built-in Y2K savvy.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly what these files might do to your Mac.
There are no guarantees. Not all will have problems but, if some
do, it sure won't be pretty.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just PC files that could mess with your Mac's brain.
There are plenty of shareware and custom scripts written for big
programs such as Word, Excel and FileMaker that may not have been
designed to handle 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If you depend on any such scripts or shareware, be sure to
double-check them to ensure they're Y2K-compliant. Unfortunately,
that's no easy task _ especially if you receive this stuff from a
friend of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The message here is not to panic but to be alert. Seek out
patches online for your favorite shareware and scripts. If you can
afford to, dump the stuff you can't upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A rose is a rose is a rose.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Gertrude Stein.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever tried to remember a famous quotation _ in
someplace far, far away from Bartlett's Familiar Quotations _
you've experienced the jumble that life can make of our memories.
Sometimes you may need the quotation for a speech or a report; at
others, you are simply haunted by a fragment of a memory and want
to trace the source.
</P>
<P>
   The Web can help, as you might guess. But if you are searching
for a searchable version of Bartlett's, you'll have to buy the book
or a CD. For years, Columbia University kept a 1901 version of the
famous book of quotations online and, if you search for Bartlett's
online, you'll still find many links to this site. The site still
exists at www.columbia.edu/acis
</P>
<P>
   /bartleby/bartlett/, but nowadays it will take you to another
searchable reference source, BartlebyVerse: American &AMP; English
Poetry: 1250-1920.
</P>
<P>
   The value of a searchable quotation site is obvious. Most of us
don't remember enough of the poem or quote to use an index by
author. Unlike a printed version of a list of quotations, you don't
have to fumble through an index to find the source.
</P>
<P>
   An even better site for quotations is at a Web page called Quote
Search at www24.pair
</P>
<P>
   .com/mgm/quotes/search
</P>
<P>
   .html. Just as you can at the Columbia site, you can search by
key words. But at Quote Search you can select _ from several
sources _ where you search.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you can search a newsgroup specializing in quotes,
or sources for quotes by women, or 20th Century Quotations, or even
quotes from columnist Dave Barry. That's just a few of the possible
sources from this page. One of the flaws here is that you cannot
ask the search engine to check all the sources, you have to search
them one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   If the thought of such a cumbersome search depresses you, you're
in luck. There's a site called Non-Famous Pessimist Quotes
Guaranteed to Dim Your Day at www.geocities.com
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)saulm/quote.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling: ``Death is never prevented ... just
postponed; the nice thing about having nothing is you don't have to
worry about losing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Feel better?
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at another searchable Web site now. It's
called Dictionary of Quotations: Inspirational, Famous and Humorous
Quotes at quotations
</P>
<P>
   .sm.to/. As with the other searchable quote sites, you can
simply type in a key word and look for your quote that way. But you
can also search several other ways, including by author or subject
or just check out the newest quotes.
</P>
<P>
   This site is not enormously deep, but it does a fair job on
really famous quotes and authors. It's easy to use, and if your
search isn't an obscure one, you may have some luck here.
</P>
<P>
   One parting thought. You are not limited to searching
``quotation sites'' ... the most obscure quotes probably will be
easier to find using a regular search engine. So don't ignore the
tried and true search engines such as Yahoo and AltaVista when you
are trying to find your quote.

exists at www.columbia.edu/acis
</P>
<P>
   /bartleby/bartlett/, but nowadays it will take you to another
searchable reference source, BartlebyVerse: American &AMP; English
Poetry: 1250-1920.
</P>
<P>
   The value of a searchable quotation site is obvious. Most of us
don't remember enough of the poem or quote to use an index by
author. Unlike a printed version of a list of quotations, you don't
have to fumble through an index to find the source.
</P>
<P>
   An even better site for quotations is at a Web page called Quote
Search at www24.pair
</P>
<P>
   .com/mgm/quotes/search
</P>
<P>
   .html. Just as you can at the Columbia site, you can search by
key words. But at Quote Search you can select _ from several
sources _ where you search.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you can search a newsgroup specializing in quotes,
or sources for quotes by women, or 20th Century Quotations, or even
quotes from columnist Dave Barry. That's just a few of the possible
sources from this page. One of the flaws here is that you cannot
ask the search engine to check all the sources, you have to search
them one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   If the thought of such a cumbersome search depresses you, you're
in luck. There's a site called Non-Famous Pessimist Quotes
Guaranteed to Dim Your Day at www.geocities.com
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)saulm/quote.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling: ``Death is never prevented ... just
postponed; the nice thing about having nothing is you don't have to
worry about losing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Feel better?
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at another searchable Web site now. It's
called Dictionary of Quotations: Inspirational, Famous and Humorous
Quotes at quotations
</P>
<P>
   .sm.to/. As with the other searchable quote sites, you can
simply type in a key word and look for your quote that way. But you
can also search several other ways, including by author or subject
or just check out the newest quotes.
</P>
<P>
   This site is not enormously deep, but it does a fair job on
really famous quotes and authors. It's easy to use, and if your
search isn't an obscure one, you may have some luck here.
</P>
<P>
   One parting thought. You are not limited to searching
``quotation sites'' ... the most obscure quotes probably will be
easier to find using a regular search engine. So don't ignore the
tried and true search engines such as Yahoo and AltaVista when you
are trying to find your quote.

LISTEN.COM SERVES UP MUSIC ON THE NET
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On most days, the noise inside Listen.com's
offices reflects the current state of downloadable music on the
Internet: a cacophony of unfamiliar rock, hip-hop, soul, jazz and
classical music.
</P>
<P>
   But that's fine with the boss, chief executive Robert Reid. To
his ear, that swirl of noise represents the reason he launched
Listen.com, a San Francisco Internet startup that is trying to
become the Yahoo or the TV Guide of downloadable music.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for Internet music spread across different Internet
sites and servers without such a directory ``is like foraging for
nuts and berries by the side of the river,'' said Reid, an author,
former venture capitalist and garage musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find what you find. It can be interesting because you run
into neat things you might not have expected, but it's not a very
efficient consumer experience,'' he said. ``Our objective is to be
the place where you're going to go and navigate this incredibly
rich and exciting domain.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen.com, which went live in June, has its own researchers
scan the Internet for songs and CDs available for download for free
or for a fee in audio formats like Liquid Audio or the more popular
MP3.
</P>
<P>
   Listen.com's staff of 30 reviewers then listens to the songs,
writes short, snappy reviews and compares the music and artists to
others of their genre. Music fans, for example, may never have
heard of Wheels of Autumn but will know the Orange County band
``sounds like the Grateful Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Because most of the music now available on the Internet is
performed by independent artists and garage bands that are not
well-known, Reid believes there is a demand for a site that can
guide consumers to songs they might enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Listen.com only catalogs music posted legally by the record
labels or the artists themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The reviewers already have cataloged about 75,000 songs by about
20,000 artists. There are links to about 300 sites with legal
downloadable music, and Listen.com has marketing partnerships with
other online music companies like Audio Explosion, EMusic.com and
Riffage.com, sites that mainly are trying to sell the work of
smaller independent labels and lesser-known musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We listen to everything,'' said Nick Tangborn, Listen.com's
editor in chief and a former music-industry journalist and
self-described ``know-it-all record store clerk and really bad
keyboard player.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is one of dozens of new Internet music companies
that sprang out of nowhere in the past year as the music and
technology industries began seeing profits, and not just pirates,
in downloadable music. For example, MP3.com is trying to create an
Internet portal for songs, software and news about the popular
format for compressing, storing and transmitting audio files.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Reid, 33, believes that Listen.com stands out because it is
the only one trying to create an Internet-wide digital music
directory for average consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Listen.com has attracted an intriguing list of
high-profile investors _ Internet and technology pioneers whose
names and bank accounts lend credibility to Reid's contention that
Listen.com will rise above the MP3 noise.
</P>
<P>
   Today (October 4), for example, Listen.com will announce that it
has completed a second, $25 million round of financing led by the
Barksdale Group, a venture capital fund started by former Netscape
Communications Corp. chief executive Jim Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   The other new investors are Sony Music Entertainment, a unit of
worldwide entertainment giant Sony Corp., and Access Technology
Partners, an investment arm of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   They join Listen.com's original investors, who include Cnet
founder and CEO Halsey Minor, Gateway CEO Ted Waitt and Imagine
Media CEO Chris Anderson. The first round, which included the firms
August Capital and Austin Ventures, raised more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge believer in downloadable music,'' Minor said.
``Rob's a good entrepreneur. What you look for is the right person
with the right vision going after the right opportunity. That's why
I was so inclined to invest in his company.''
</P>
<P>
   The digital downloading of music is only in its nascent stage,
and the $40 billion-a-year recording industry has just begun to
explore ways to exploit it. But the Internet research firm of
Forrester Research Inc. estimates that digital downloading could
generate $1.1 billion a year by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's chaos out there, a lot of junk,'' said Mark Hardie, a
senior analyst for entertainment strategies for Forrester. ``Right
now, MP3 is a flea market of music.''
</P>
<P>
   So the idea of creating a directory to make sense of the chaos
is ``a sound strategy,'' Hardie said. ``I don't have a great
opinion of the flea market that is MP3, but I do believe Listen.com
is at least going at it the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, a growing number of well-known musicians
began joining that digital flea market. Tracks by artists like
Alanis Morissette, Sarah McLachlan, Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, Red Hot
Chili Peppers, Barry White, Limp Bizkit and Tori Amos now can be
found for free or for a fee on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Listen.com adds about 100 new mainstream artists a week online
in its ``Big Shots'' section, Tangborn said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, a Harvard Business School graduate, studied what the big
shots of the early Internet age did as he researched his book
``Architects of the Web.'' Published in 1997, the book chronicled
the creation and evolution of the Web, with interviews of
Netscape's Marc Andreessen, Marimba's Kim Polese and Yahoo's Jerry
Yang.
</P>
<P>
   Reid then spent two years with 21st Century Internet Venture
Partners, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, who owns 800 old-style vinyl records, wanted to start a
company of his own. And in mid-1998, he began noticing the
grassroots growth of MP3-formatted songs being posted and traded
via the Internet, mainly by college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``When downloadable music began to happen, it really caught my
eye because it seemed like something that could be revolutionary
and empowering,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Reid said he got a phone call from Minor, with
whom he had met regularly in his role as a venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me just out of the blue and said, `What's going on?'
'' Reid said. ``And at that very moment, I was thinking about this
company (Listen.com). And he said, `Well, I'm thinking of starting
an MP3 company. Let's have breakfast tomorrow.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Listen.com's first company Christmas party, two days after
incorporation, had just one guest: Reid himself. But it now has
about 85 employees and plans to reach 100 workers by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the company moved from temporary quarters near 3Com
Park to a converted two-story brick warehouse on Utah Street in the
city's Potrero Hill neighborhood. The building's name sounds like
it came out of an breezy Conan O'Brien comedy skit: Nuevo Media.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews on the Web site also have a breezy tone. About
England's metal band Sheep on Drugs, the site says ``dance tracks
are like a long drive along the L.A. freeways at 4 a.m., moving
forward at high velocity through spaces skinned of any emotion,
leaving a cybernetic, inhuman distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen.com visitors who register to become free members also
have the chance to speak their minds. One member called Doctor
Gonzo wrote that ``after only an hour of listening, my IQ jumped 20
points, my hair loss stopped, my stomach became ripped and chicks
now dig me. And the music is good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid believes that average consumers eventually will dig digital
downloading, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectation is there is some sort of sweet spot in the
market with the consumer who wants to access what they're looking
for, get it quickly and move on with their lives,'' Reid said.

TECH NOVICES GET CRASH COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By STAN BUNGER AND JAN BOYD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Strange but true: There actually are people who
don't know how to retrieve e-mail or enter their day's schedule on
a Palm digital organizer. Why, some don't even have cellular
phones!
</P>
<P>
   We know, it seems impossible, but outside the tech-steeped
precincts of the Silicon Valley, plenty of folks just haven't
crossed the chasm and joined the Digital Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Five of them wound up in Menlo Park, Calif., the other day,
guests of AT&AMP;T. They were winners in a nationwide essay contest,
scoring a ``Communications Makeover'' under the tutelage of AT&AMP;T
Labs experts. The mission: to turn five avowed tech-newbies into
power users.
</P>
<P>
   The five were awarded new laptop computers, handheld organizers
and cellular phones, as well as two days' worth of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T helpfully had alerted the media, and no fewer than four
television camera crews crowded into the conference room, eager to
capture video of this rarest of species in action. While the five
students learned how to create and send an e-mail message, the
camera operators pressed in for close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's Ritch Blasi, who filled the role of instructor, said,
``You sort of have to walk before you run, and that's what we're
teaching them here. We're teaching them how to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning to walk probably was easier though none of the students
actually sustained any skinned knees. The camera crews had no
trouble capturing grimaces and furrowed brows, and more than once,
tech-support people had to be summoned to the room to figure out
why things weren't working.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jesmer, who lives near Snohomish, Wash., and wants to be
able to keep track of her 11 grandchildren via e-mail, smiled
broadly as she sent and received the first e-mail messages of her
life. She's plenty happy with what she learned, but she says her
husband remains unconvinced about computers. ``He claims they're
not going to last,'' Jesmer said. ``He doesn't even know how to
turn them on.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW VIEWS ON NEWS: ``I feel like I'm at a gun-lobby meeting;
this is such an insular culture,'' said a nonjournalist at a forum
sponsored by the nonprofit New Directions for News.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day conference titled New Tools, New Journalism
recently brought together in Santa Clara, Calif., about three dozen
newspaper editors, newspaper Web site managers, a couple of
independent Web site developers and a lone television producer.
</P>
<P>
   The first couple of days were spent listening to speakers and
exploring the concept of ``New Journalism,'' meaning journalism
delivered via the Web. But by the third morning, listening and
general discussion gave way to a heated debate over the future of
news on the Internet. Here's the argument: Is news delivered over
the Web by nontraditional news sources as credible as news
delivered by well-established newspapers?
</P>
<P>
   One side, mostly nonjournalists, argued that news delivered by
Yahoo, Excite or even, in the future, Starbucks or Home Depot will
be considered just as credible as news delivered by The Chronicle
or any other newspaper. They argued that studies show increasing
distrust of the media, and a growing disconnect between the
audience and news gatherers.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments for the other side: truth, justice, the American way,
moral superiority and a profound belief that people eventually will
figure out that professional journalists hold to a higher standard
of ethics than their Web counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   SEARS ROAD WARRIOR: You would have to count Craig Hemsworth as a
member of the Road Warriors elite. He lugs a laptop computer with
him wherever he goes, uploads and downloads data from home and
works for a multibillion-dollar corporation.
</P>
<P>
   But Hemsworth is an appliance repairman, one of about 10,000
Sears maintenance technicians nationwide who carry ruggedized
portable computers complete with wireless communications
capability.
</P>
<P>
   Hemsworth works out of the Sears regional service center in
Concord, Calif. While he sleeps each night, his next day's worth of
service calls is downloaded to his computer. At the same time, the
machine uploads a list of parts used in the previous day's work. By
the time Hemsworth reports for work, a bin has been filled with
replacements for those parts, so he can replenish his service van.
</P>
<P>
   At each service call, Hemsworth fires up the laptop, establishes
a wireless connection with the Sears network and types in details
of the work he performs. The system automatically updates parts
inventories, customer information and even Hemsworth's actual
position. The wireless exchange of data replaces the old way: lots
of phone calls to dispatch centers and parts desks.
</P>
<P>
   All this clearly makes Hemsworth an information technology
worker, though he doesn't look the part.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent more than 30 years with Sears, taking a break at
one point for a tour of duty in Vietnam. He admits that he once
balked at the idea of becoming a computer jockey. Now, he's sold,
and his wireless laptop often becomes a conversation piece when his
route takes him to tech-savvy households. ``I have a lot of my
customers that say the same thing: `Boy, you've become very high
tech in this field,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FORBIDDEN FRUIT: Shooting at Apple is always at bit problematic.
Apple has a bit of a media-persecution complex, and television
cameras probably are more welcome in CIA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The newest rule is: no shooting in offices _ not just because of
confidential material, but because there are ``legal issues''
involved in the filming of any pictures posted on the walls. So,
New Media News viewers will not be seeing our interviewee's poster
collection, which consisted of bands like Hole and Garbage, and, oh
yeah, that top-secret confidential picture of a Porsche.

'TIS THE SEASON FOR E-TAILERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By TOM STEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Surfing the Web last holiday season, Thomas
Blauvelt decided to treat himself to a Christmas present: an
autographed copy of Tom Wolfe's latest novel, ``A Man in Full,''
advertised on Barnesandnoble.com
</P>
<P>
   The experience turned out to be anything but merry. After
several weeks, Blauvelt still hadn't received the book. He zapped
off a complaint via e-mail. In response, he got a canned e-mail
thanking him for his business and informing him that the book was
on its way.
</P>
<P>
   He waited and waited to no avail. He sent the company about 10
more e-mails _ each more incendiary than the last. In return, he
got the same boilerplate reply.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in utter frustration, he phoned the customer service
hotline. ``The person on the phone had no record of my problem,''
said Blauvelt, a 35-year-old lawyer from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A total of four months later, he was informed that
Barnesandnoble.com no longer stocked autographed copies of the book
and he would just have to make another selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done a lot of shopping on the Internet because of
this experience,'' said Blauvelt. ``It really soured me.''
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season, Web retailers are working overtime to make
sure customer-service horror stories like Blauvelt's remain a thing
of Christmas past.
</P>
<P>
   Their performance could be a litmus test for the future of
e-tailing. Sites with minimal glitches and maximum responsiveness
could win customers for life, analysts believe, while those with
problems might not have a second chance to prove themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's an especially crucial time for e-tailers because the number
of Christmas shoppers on the Web is expected to explode. According
to a new report by Internet research Jupiter Communications,
consumers will spend an estimated $6 billion online this holiday
season, or nearly double what they shelled out a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fogdog Sports, an online retailer of sporting goods, is
preparing for the holiday rush by giving all 95 employees _ from
the president to the mail-room guy _ a crash course in customer
service. That way, if the company's nine official customer service
reps are swamped, someone can step in quickly to pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Fogdog in Redwood City uses a software package from Kana
Communications to manage the hundreds of customer e-mails it gets
each day. The software automatically can direct a customer e-mail
to the appropriate person so that it is answered quickly and
accurately. For example, if a customer has a question about what
kind of hiking boots to buy, the message will be routed to the
customer service rep specializing in outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shop online because they are strapped for time and are
looking for more convenience,'' said Tom Romary, vice president of
marketing at Fogdog. ``Customer service is integral to the online
experience. If we can't meet expectations, then we are in the wrong
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this could mean investing millions of dollars in new
customer service technologies as well as in personnel costs. For
some, this may run counter to the traditional notion of an
e-commerce company as a lean operation with minimal overhead and
limited labor requirements. But a growing number of Web outfits are
singing a new tune _ namely, if they spend more on customer
service, customers will spend more on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Successful Web companies are more focused on customer service
than they are on selling stuff,'' said Bob Chatham, an analyst with
Forrester Research. Still, too many e-tailers are ignoring customer
service outright, added Chatham.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more disappointing examples, he said, are well-known
brick-and-mortar retailers like J. Crew and Victoria's Secret,
which also sell their products online. These companies do not allow
customers to return purchases made over the Web to their physical
stores. Instead, consumers must pack up the merchandise themselves
and send it back by post.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a major no-no,'' said Christopher Lochhead, chief
marketing officer at Internet consulting firm Scient. ``Customers
want to be treated the same, whether it's on the Web, in a store or
on the phone. Businesses that don't have these things tied together
will get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   RightStart.com, a new Web company in Westlake Village (Los
Angeles County) that sells child-care products such as baby seats
and personal playgrounds, is determined to be around for the long
haul. ``Seamless customer service is the key to our survival,''
said Gerald Mitchell, executive vice president of RightStart.com.
</P>
<P>
   When consumers order an item from the Web site, they immediately
get a message telling them that items can be returned hassle-free
to the nearest brick-and-mortar Right Start store, of which there
are 45 across the country. Consumers receive a map to retail
outlets within a 20-mile radius of their home address. The company
said it provides clear instructions for customers who need to
return items by post.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Taylor, a consultant in Palo Alto, Calif., could have
used that kind of service when she bought a Palm V electronic
organizer from the ValueAmerica Web site two months ago. The
product arrived in a timely fashion, but Taylor had to return it
because it was not the version she ordered. That's where she ran
into problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no instructions in the box about how, or even
where, to send it back,'' she griped. ``There wasn't even a phone
number.'' She finally tracked down the customer service number on
the Web site and then waited 20 minutes on the phone before getting
an agent who could help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have thought there'd be tremendous improvements in
retail Web sites by now,'' said Taylor. ``But that's not the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet shoppers would agree with her. A recent study by
Forrester Research found that about 70 percent of all shopping
carts are abandoned on the Internet. That means consumers start the
buying process but for a variety of reasons leave a site before
making any purchases. Of course, some people are just window
shopping, but analysts believe that e-tail sites are still too
frustrating for consumers and simply do not provide an engaging
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com is trying to change that perception. The
Framingham, Mass., company, which sells high-end furnishings on the
Web, has adopted some leading-edge technologies to reinvent the
online customer experience. The most compelling weapon in
Furniture.com's arsenal is good old human interaction. The site has
about 20 online design consultants who carefully observe as
customers browse the site and then, using live chat software, send
out polite messages that pop up on the consumer's computer screen,
asking if they can be of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site also can request a personal shopper. Using
the chat software, the personal shopper can browse side by side
with a consumer, answer questions and even offer design and
furniture-arrangement advice.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Brooks, CEO of Furniture.com, said about half of his
customers place their orders with the help of a design consultant.
``It's easy to get a customer for the first time,'' he said. ``What
separates a successful Web site from the hype is the ability to
deliver such a compelling experience that the customer becomes a
champion of electronic business.''
</P>
<P>
   EToys Inc. is another company trying to take online customer
service to new heights. The Santa Monica (Calif.) company, which
gets thousands of calls and e-mails each day, is ramping up for the
holidays by boosting its customer service staff from 30 to 160
reps, largely by hiring temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   John Hnanicek, chief information officer at eToys, said the goal
is to answer all e-mails within 24 hours and never make a customer
wait on the phone more than three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   EToys takes both a high-tech and high-touch approach to customer
service. Customer service reps, for instance, sit cheek-by-jowl
with a cart of toys so that they actually can touch and play with
the products while answering questions. Service reps are trained to
answer questions about how to complete an online transaction as
well as questions about the toys themselves, like whether a
particular toy is suited for a 4-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   EToys also employs live chat and rapid e-mail-response
applications. Moreover, the company is working with a new
technology called voice-over IP that soon will allow customers
simply to click a button and begin talking with a customer service
or sales rep directly via PC.
</P>

   Bob Chatham of Forrester likes the eToy approach. ``Just like
the physical world, consumers need someone to browse with them and
hold their hand,'' he said. ``Companies cannot expect consumers to
just show up and send them money. They have to learn to service
customers online.''

JACKSON CHALLENGES SILICON VALLEY TO BOOST DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson is challenging Silicon
Valley enterprises to hire more minorities, saying that the booming
technology region's record on racial and cultural diversity is ``a
national disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leader on Tuesday unveiled his action plan for
bringing an updated version of the 1960s civil rights movement to
the 1990s high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before an enthusiastic crowd at a meeting in San Jose,
the civil rights leader and onetime Democratic presidential
candidate said he would soon open a Silicon Valley office of the
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition that he heads. From this outpost, Jackson
said his staff would force diversity onto an industry known for its
mostly white, male entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the staff would monitor the top 50 technology
companies, issuing a report card in April to rank these companies
on their ethnic and racial diversity and contributions to education
for the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that have government contracts, Jackson said, would be
closely monitored to ensure compliance with racial equality
regulations, and low-wage workers who do assembly work for the
high-tech industry would be unionized, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said he would stage a Silicon Valley convention of
civil rights leaders and supporters to call attention to the nearly
``all-white board rooms'' of the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements signal Jackson's intention to throw down an
anchor in the center of the region's robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked it,'' Jackson said about his recent visits to the
Silicon Valley. ``And we intend to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's visit follows an April 12 session when Jackson met
with dozens of power brokers, including Steve Jobs, the interim
chairman of Apple Computer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition would use its current
ownership of stock in 50 Silicon Valley companies to monitor
corporate performance. He added that Rainbow representatives would
attend shareholder meetings to express discontent with a particular
company's practices.
</P>
<P>
   To standing ovations, Jackson decried the overwhelmingly white
executive ranks of the country's high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accept the moral challenge,'' he said. ``Include all in this
valley of hope and leave none behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's Silicon Valley visits have gotten the attention of
some companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really trying to work with him on developing a
dialogue,'' said Tracy Koon, a spokeswoman for the Intel Corp. the
Santa Clara-based computer chip-maker that employs some 66,000
workers worldwide. ``Companies shouldn't be threatened by what he
says.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Thompson of Cupertino-based Symantec, the only black
chief executive in the top 150 top ranked high-tech companies, has
not been an enthusiastic supporter of Jackson's Silicon Valley
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Thompson said he would not be a ``poster boy'' for the
Silicon Valley high-tech companies.

 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Internet commerce expanding at an exponential
rate, many states are becoming panicked at the disappearance of
sales tax revenues and conventional retailers are incensed that
their sales are being taxed while cybersales are not.
</P>
<P>
   But the movement to collect taxes on the $20 billion Internet
commerce industry is floundering on Capitol Hill, opposed by a
growing coalition of officials who believe taxing the infant
industry will smother it. In recent weeks, in fact, the political
winds in Congress have shifted toward abandoning the idea of taxing
the Internet in any way _ in the United States and around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Internet entrepreneurs are cheering the trend, arguing that
their contribution to the booming economy compensates for any loss
in sales tax. A similar view is gaining currency in Congress, where
lawmakers are looking to outlaw Internet taxes to keep the
electronic marketplace healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Senator John S. McCain introduced a bill that would
forbid US Internet sales taxes forever. And last week, over the
cries of municipal leaders, a bipartisan congressional coalition
launched an even more ambitious campaign: convincing the World
Trade Organization to ban Internet sales taxes worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stifle Internet commerce before it even starts, we're
killing the goose that lays the golden egg,'' said Senator Patrick
J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, a cosponsor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Governor Paul Cellucci long has supported the
idea of forbidding an Internet sales tax regardless of what the
federal government decides, and members of the Massachusetts
Sofware Council say Cellucci is ``very much on the industry's
side.''
</P>
<P>
   But most governors and local officials around the country are
not. Their concerns are local; downtown music stores won't stay in
business, they argue, if people buy all their compact discs on the
Internet to save money on sales tax. Not to mention that, for all
local leaders, their own pocketbooks are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The problem right now, according to state leaders, is that the
system ``discriminates against customers or businesses based on the
means by which they sell things,'' said Bret Hester, a policy
analyst for the National Governors Association. In the future, the
disparity is only likely to grow worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy a book from a bookstore, you should be treated the
same, from a tax perspective, as if you bought it over the
Internet,'' Hester said.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern to municipalities, however, is the revenue
generated by retail sales taxes. According to the most recent
estimates, states stand to lose a total of $15 billion a year in
sales tax revenues by 2003 if the laws are not expanded to include
the Internet, Hester said. Concerned about that figure, the US
Conference of Mayors is scrambling to devise a proposal that would
let states and cities levy taxes on Internet sales the same way
they now do on regular store sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about is funds now going for schools, for
police, for fire protection, for parks,'' said Larry Naake,
director of the National Association for Counties. ``We are not
asking for new taxes. We are just asking for the ability to collect
the taxes that are legally due now.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet in a Congress where the very phrase ``tax cut'' can
spark a political firestorm, opposition to proposals banning
Internet taxation has been strikingly slow to form.
</P>
<P>
   In part, those who would tax the Internet have been frustrated
by one nagging fact: no one can quite figure out how to tax fairly
the virtual storefronts that crowd the information superhighway. A
blue-ribbon panel appointed to sort out the mysteries of Internet
taxation reportedly is stumped, just six months before it is
scheduled to report to Congress on how to proceed. And even the
lawmakers, such as Senator John F. Kerry and Representative Edward
J. Markey, who consider themselves sensitive to local business
needs, refuse to dismiss notion of banning Internet taxes while the
commission is still doing its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult task,'' Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of
Oregon, said. ``All of us are wrestling with something we know very
little about.''
</P>
<P>
   When e-commerce started out, Internet retailers followed the
same basic rules as mail-order catalogs, collecting sales tax only
from consumers who lived in the same state as the company. But as
pressure from local leaders grew, Congress was forced to debate an
Internet tax. In October 1998, the Internet Tax Freedom Act was
passed, temporarily forbidding states from doing two things: taxing
the fee consumers pay to their Internet service providers, and
levying ``multiple or discriminatory taxes'' on electronic commerce
_ a sales tax, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year moratorium on sales tax was designed as a grace
period of sorts. During that time, the 19-member US Advisory
Commission on Electronic Commerce was ordered to assess the impact
of taxing the Internet. So far, the commission, headed by Virginia
Governor Jim Gilmore, has met twice, and is still fielding
proposals on how an Internet tax might work. It is supposed to
deliver its findings to Congress next April.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous questions are in play: should states tax consumers
based on where they live, or should taxes be based on where a
company is headquartered? If the tax is based on residency, what
happens if a consumer in Massachusetts buys a product and ships it
to a friend in New Hampshire, where there is no sales tax? And if
the tax is based on where corporate headquarters reside, what would
stop e-commerce companies in Massachusetts from moving to Nashua?
Or to a country with no Internet rules at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of schemes floating around that could be
either very positive or very negative for us,'' said Chris
Gabrieli, general partner of Bessemer Venture Partners, a Wellesley
venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission has made little progress, according to Senate
aides. Last week, Representative Christopher Cox, a California
Republican, said there was a real possibility the commission would
need to extend its deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said, Congress is not necessarily going to
wait.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, Ernst &AMP; Young released a study concluding
that local governments were barely affected by Internet sales in
1998. Buttressed by those claims, McCain introduced a permanent
extension of the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act _ one that would
spell out precisely what taxes states cannot levy. Then, with the
administration gearing up for the World Trade Organization summit
in Seattle next month, Cox and Wyden proposed legislation urging
the organizaton to make a global ban on Internet taxation
permanent. The idea, Cox said, is to ``get there with the fire
engines before it's too late.''

THE WOMAN WHO'S LED A `DELICIOUS REVOLUTION'

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alice Waters, one of the two most famous women in food (the
other is, of course, Julia Child), is seated at a table on the
pocket-sized outdoor terrace of Cafe Louis. A small woman with
clear blue eyes and brown hair flecked with gray, no makeup on her
lovely skin, she stands out among Boston diners boasting hard gold
jewelry and tautly lifted skin. Waters is unintimidating, smiling
serenely, ready to share a lunch and a conversation. Yet it's a
little hard to imagine the opening question of the interview.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly do you ask an icon?
</P>
<P>
   The need to figure that out is delayed a bit when the
restaurant's young chef, David Reynoso, comes out and asks if he
could relate a story to Waters. In his chef's whites, the tips of
his ears getting pinker with nervousness as he talks, Reynoso tells
of arriving in Chicago from his native Mexico at age 17, washing
dishes in a restaurant to get by. ``I was taking an English class
and read a book of essays about food,'' he says, his eyes intently
on Waters. ``Yours changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As he shyly departs, the first question becomes obvious: Do
these testimonials happen often? All the time, replies her
assistant, Cristina Salas-Porras.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation starts in a meandering way, from farmers to
winter vegetables to her new cookbook, ``Chez Panisse Cafe
Cookbook'' (Harper Collins). Waters, who speaks in a surprisingly
soft, fluting voice, is nevertheless a woman of strong opinions.
The change of seasons, colder climates, general lassitude on the
part of Americans about what they eat _ none of that fazes her.
``You just have to eat differently in the winter,'' says the
longtime champion of organic food, of eating seasonally and
locally. We start talking about vegetables, about what to eat in
fall and winter, while nibbling on thin grilled pizza blessed with
late-summer tomatoes and corn. Chez Panisse, her Berkeley, Calif.,
restaurant and cafe, is so much a part of Waters's persona that her
personal pronoun is invariably ``we,'' meaning the people, staff
and friends, who work with her in the restaurant. ``We make stews,
use winter greens. The last couple of weeks, we had pizza with wild
nettles, sliced very thin, and prosciutto.'' Delicious, she says,
as she thoughtfully eyes Cafe Louis's crust. ``Ours is puffier at
the edges,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   She talks passionately about vegetables, about radishes from the
Berkeley farmers' market _ ``I would be happy to pay $5, and I'm so
surprised when they say 50 cents'' _ about more and more people she
meets telling of their vegetable patches, their experience with
growing food.
</P>
<P>
   Her own food epiphany came early, when she went to France as a
college student. ``I sort of came to it so simply,'' says Waters,
who grew up in New Jersey and admits she had had no particular
interest in food or cooking before that year. ``It's just a way of
life I fell in love with.'' The French way of focusing on good
ingredients from local farms, on gathering together to cook and eat
and converse, simply seemed ``reasonable'' to her, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Although she returned from France, got a degree in French
cultural studies from the University of California at Berkeley, and
trained to be a Montessori teacher, those life lessons propelled
her to open Chez Panisse in 1971 with several friends. From the
beginning, the restaurant was very of-the-moment California, with
its collaborative methods of working _ more like friends gathering
to make dinner for friends than any formal restaurant model.
Waters's insistence on connecting with growers to assure the
quality of ingredients was also unusual. ``Really good restaurants
have to connect with the farmers,'' she says _ almost a truism now,
but revolutionary then. Chez Panisse, once an oddity, became the
trendsetter, and Waters the spokesperson for a movement that swept
the nation's restaurants. Now even casual eateries credit the
vegetables on the menu to a specific local farm.
</P>
<P>
   Her new book of recipes from the less formal cafe, which opened
in 1979, is the seventh Chez Panisse cookbook, all of them
extending Waters's philosophy to the home kitchen. Like its
predecessors, this book includes some recipes so simple as to be
mere sketches of an idea, and others that are startling in their
complexity. Asked about a recipe for headcheese, which starts with
a small pig's head, Waters calmly asserts: ``I think it's important
to have an idea of what it takes to make something.'' Cookbooks,
she adds, are read on many levels.
</P>
<P>
   Waters is on a national tour to promote the cookbook, and will
returns here in late November for a Schlesinger Library function
and possibly other appearances. She enjoys the bookmaking process,
down to choosing a typeface. She also enjoys writing the cookbooks,
she says, because it allows her to elaborate on the Chez Panisse
philosophy, exemplified by the fact that vegetables are the book's
first chapter.
</P>
<P>
   As she talks, another diner comes by, asking to say hello, to
profess admiration. By the time Waters and her assistant are
talking about Chez Panisse's family-friendly restaurant and cafe
staffing _ chefs work only three days a week in the kitchen and one
in the office, and no one works more than 40 hours _ the sun has
slipped behind the New England building next door. We move inside
Cafe Louis, where Waters, dressed simply in a pin-striped top and
pants, makes more heads turn.
</P>
<P>
   At the indoor table, she starts talking about another project
that is now dear to her, the Edible Schoolyard. It began five years
ago, after Waters, on her way to work each day, noticed how
uninviting a middle school looked. When she commented on its
bleakness to a reporter, the principal of the Martin Luther King
Jr. Middle School called her up and challenged her to get involved
in the ethnically diverse school, which didn't even have a
cafeteria for its 1,000 students. Out of that challenge grew an
entire curriculum. The Edible Schoolyard, so far mostly supported
by private donations and volunteer work, has evolved into a garden
where children grow food, and a cooking program where they learn to
cook what they've grown. The program also connects to other parts
of the school's curriculum, incorporating science, math, and
history. Despite kids' reluctance at first to try new foods, she
finds that ``when they grow it and when they cook it, they want to
eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this project is still a fledgling, Waters hopes it
could be a model for other schools, and a way to get out the Chez
Panisse philosophy. ``I think they're hungry for good things to eat
and for companionship,'' she says of the Berkeley kids. That's true
of the nation as a whole, she believes, as she marvels at the
growth of farmers' markets and the change in the restaurant scene.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the afternoon is growing late. Jasper White, the Boston
restaurateur and an old friend, arrives to take her to the airport.
First, though, he pulls up a chair to help taste desserts. Joanne
Killeen and George Germon, who own Cafe Louis, come over to say
goodbye. The table has become Waters's ideal of companionship, of
sharing food and conversation.
</P>
<P>
   And Waters, an icon with indelible opinions, hits her points
once more. Americans, she says, are changing _ for the better _
their attitudes about food. ``By making the right choices in
everything you eat, it leads you to the land,'' Waters says. ``It's
a delicious revolution.''

A WINNER LANDS IN `ROSWELL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ROSWELL 
Starring: Jason Behr, Shiri Appleby, Katherine Heigl, Brendan Fehr,
Majandra Delfino, Colin Hanks, Nick Wechsler, William Sadler 
On: The WB, Wednesday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What with the networks' growing passion for teen angst, not to
mention jeans ads, it can't be easy for the ordinary American youth
to claim his or her natural-born right to alienation. How can kids
feel properly alone and withdrawn when there are some 10 TV dramas
currently processing their misery at the global hearth? And it
can't help that so many of these shows _ from ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' to ``Popular'' and ``Freaks and Geeks'' _ are so clever
and well-observed.
</P>
<P>
   WB makes it even harder for the cause of youthful isolation by
delivering yet another sweet and intelligent series about the
impossible years. Called ``Roswell,'' it performs an etymological
trick on teen alienation by presenting a trio of teen aliens, as in
we-are-not-alone extraterrestrial beings. A genre-bender if ever
there was one, ``Roswell'' takes the ``Romeo and Juliet'' love
story, dresses it in ``Rebel Without a Cause'' Americana, and then
gives the whole thing an ``X-Files'' twist. The show is a long,
long way from ``My Favorite Martian'' and ``Mork &AMP; Mindy.''
</P>
<P>
   The human heroine is Liz Parker, a waitress at the Crashdown
Cafe in Roswell, N.M., site of the alleged 1947 spaceship crash.
Liz likes to goof on the UFO groupies who flock to her hometown,
until the day her life is saved by the mysterious healing touch of
Max Evans. Turns out Max, his sister Isabel, and their pal Michael
are outsiders that do ``Outsiders'' author S.E. Hinton one better:
They were hatched from pods on the spacecraft that crashed in 1947,
destroying their parents. Liz and Max fall in love, but, of course,
there's a major obstacle: These star-crossed lovers literally come
from different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many newer shows, the tone of ``Roswell'' is elastic, as
it stretches from heartfelt teen romance and self-discovery to the
adventure-conspiracy plot, which has the three aliens searching for
clues to their past and evading a suspicious sheriff. Rightly, they
fear they will become prisoners or worse if the authorities learn
their secret. In one science-class scene, Max gets a hall pass to
escape having to examine his own cheek cells under a microscope.
``Roswell'' also shifts easily from drama to sly humor,
particularly with the help of Liz's nutty pal Maria, who freaks
when Liz tells her about the aliens. By setting their show in
Roswell, creators David Nutter (``The X-Files'') and Jason Katims
(``My So-Called Life'') can also feature comic UFO kitsch,
including a crash festival that has the school camping it up in
space suits.
</P>
<P>
   The kids in ``Roswell'' aren't as hipped-out as many of TV's
other teens. As Max and Liz, Jason Behr and Shiri Appleby throw
lots of soulful looks, and Behr is particularly understated. He
doesn't act so much as radiate. Except for a few choice music
tracks, there is almost nothing MTV about ``Roswell'' _ no fast
edits or ultra-now lingo. Now that's otherworldly.

WITH `AMEN,' COLE MINES THE DEPTHS OF SPIRITUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When last in the public eye, Paula Cole was a media magnet who
starred at Lilith Fair and won best new artist at the Grammy
awards. Her album, ``This Fire,'' sold in the millions, pushed by
the novelty hit, ``Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?'' (a parody of
macho lifestyles) and the exquisite pop of ``I Don't Want to
Wait,'' the theme of the TV show ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   A different, more pensive Cole emerges, however, on her
long-awaited follow-up album, ``Amen,'' now in stores. It doesn't
have any novelty songs and doesn't genuflect to pop programmers.
Believing that success is a ``platform and an opportunity,'' Cole
has fashioned a beautifully contemplative, R&AMP;B/soul-accented record
about love and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was finally willing to discuss my spirituality in music. I
was shy about that before,'' says Cole, who grew up on the North
Shore in Rockport, before attending Berklee College of Music and
earning seven Grammy nominations for her exceptional year in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The new album is very influenced, she says, by Marvin Gaye's
``What's Going On'' record from 1971. His music from that era,
likewise a dreamy pastiche of R&AMP;B styles, extended hope for the
unity of all people and races.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, God is an energy that bonds all life,'' says Cole, 31,
who believes in no single denomination, but rather a more personal
outlook in which ``you're meant to be your own Buddha and your own
Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   The main ingredient is love. That's apparent from the opening
track (and first single), ``I Believe in Love,'' which has a
Whitney Houston-like grandeur in its orchestral arrangement and a
dogged determination in its message: ``The clouds may come, the
clouds may go, and I'll still be here . . . I believe in love as
the center of all things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it all boils down to love,'' adds Cole, who wrote and
produced the album. ``If you look at Gandhi and at his life and
teaching, or at Jesus or Buddha, it all comes down to love. You
can't change the world with violence. You can't even change it with
religion or conversion to religion. But you can change it with
love. You can touch an individual on a daily basis, and you can
touch the world in a lifetime through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another striking tune is the title track, ``Amen,'' which cites
individuals as varied as Elvis Presley, Mahatma Gandhi, Ronald
Reagan, and Malcolm X, while postulating ``Amen for the unity of us
all.'' It's a pretty song in which Cole, who took vocal lessons
before entering the studio, extends her range and completely
hypnotizes the listener.
</P>
<P>
   Cole addresses social issues in ``La Tonya,'' an R&AMP;B ballad
about a daughter whose parents have broken up but who is still able
to conclude, ``My house ain't a home no more/ Still, my faith is
unshaken.'' And in ``Free,'' she sings to ``just have the courage
to open up yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the album is all about hope _ and about the humility
of Cole in the face of her remarkable success. She has diva-like
vocal pipes, but not a diva-like disposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous if you start to believe that you're the center
of the universe,'' she says. ``You kind of are when you're on the
road, because you have all these employees and they're there to
make it all work. But it's really important to have time off and be
with your family and go grocery shopping yourself and clean your
toilet yourself. I've since had some time to do that, and I feel
more invigorated because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fame can be dangerous. It can take you away from where you are
sometimes. And it can also make you a nasty bitch sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my energy was mostly devoted to my career,'' she says
of her whirlwind emergence in 1997 and 1998. ``But I was so busy
that it really became hard to see my family and my friends, and I
suffered personally because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole, who now lives in Manhattan, grew busy again making the new
album. She says her last trip to Rockport was in April for her
grandmother's 80th birthday. ``I wanted to go there again this
summer, but in the end, I couldn't. I was too busy. It kind of
broke my heart, because I spiritually needed to get back to my
roots again. I'm dying to get back and see the same old rocks and
beaches and people. It's very grounding.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album lacks up-tempo songs, which is regrettable in so
far as the rhythmic balance is concerned, but it does have many
melodies that persuade in a quieter, more thoughtful way. And the
production is simply A-plus quality.
</P>
<P>
   Cole was the first solo woman ever to receive a solo Grammy
nomination for best producer (for ``This Fire''); and she may do so
again on the new CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was way more fun and exciting to produce,'' she says.
``The last time, I had to make a record in two weeks. I had half a
budget and a lot of pressure and had to prove myself. I had people
coming into the studio to check me out. I was much more
nerve-racked. But this time, I had a lot of trust and a lot of
faith from people. I had a full budget and could fulfill the dreams
that I always had, like have an orchestra. I've been dying to have
an orchestra my whole career. I love strings.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole, who likely won't tour until the winter with carry-over
bandmates Jay Bellerose (drums) and Kevin Barry (guitar), plus
newcomers Doug Wimbush (bass) and Rakiya Diggs (backup vocals),
knows that some people ``will think I'm a flake'' because of the
new-age-style spirituality expressed on the album. But the sheer
beauty of the music should win converts. As she concludes, ``It was
the album I always wanted to make.''

YES, VENTURA SAYS STUPID THINGS _ BUT LIGHTEN UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It came as no surprise to this reporter when I heard that Jesse
Ventura was coming to speak at Harvard's Kennedy School, because he
(itals)is(unitals) the governor of Minnesota, and the K-School
takes on all comers (and many of what can be called goers).
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it unusual when I heard that Governor Ventura requested
a special audience with one segment of the Harvard community. Maybe
he'll want to chat up the Business School profs, I mused, those
pricey consultants who spray capitalist nostrums over any willing
(and paying) audience.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps he'll seek out some of those ubiquitous Law School
boffins who spend so much time on cable television talk shows,
mouthing learned discourses on topics ranging from Monica to Joey
Buttafuoco and every topic in between. Or perhaps an economics
expert, a Ken Galbraith or a younger bird, for some high-level
macro-vs.-micro chitchat on developing jobs to keep the kids in
Hibbing from having to move off the Iron Range.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's seeking advice from a K-School spin-meister, one of
the many alums of the political system, retired involuntarily or
otherwise, in Cambridge to reflect on the meaning of it all. Or
perhaps an expert at Jerry Murphy's Graduate School of Education to
jazz up Minnesota's school schemes, or a theologican from the
Divinity School, where the new dean, the Rev. Brian Hehir, is
drawing raves.
</P>
<P>
   None of the above, it turns out. Let others come to Harvard to
schmooze with philosophers, physicists, poets, play writers. Jesse
The Body is into the body thing. And it works for him. As a
professional wrestler and now a professional interview-giver, the
Reform Party's titular leader has asked to meet with: . . . the
Harvard football team.
</P>
<P>
   Why am I not surprised?
</P>
<P>
   Governor Ventura does it (itals)his(unitals) way, and his
free-wheeling, shoot-from-the-lip style has made him the darling of
the media, the young, the uncultured, and the
tired-of-the-same-old-same-old, a cobbled-together coalition that
elbows its way to the forefront of national debate now and then
with refreshing vigor.
</P>
<P>
   The balding wrestler who fancies casual clothes for the
governor's job and eye makeup and feather boas for ring work
represents the marriage of wrestlemania and politics, and he's darn
good at it. His popularity back home is being tested by his recent
interview in Playboy Magazine. Not since a lay preacher (no, that
is (itals)not(unitals) a sly pun about a skin book) named Jimmy
Carter confessed to ``lust in my heart'' has Playboy got so much
out of a politician.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said a number of quotable things, chief among them:
</P>
<P>
   ``Organized religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded
people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and
stick their noses in other people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a bit of a hand grenade of an offhand comment, it turns
out. But before Ventura becomes the Salmon Rushdie of the Land of
Lakes, fricasseed in his own frisson of fatwah, let us stop and
think about this, which is what the governor probably should have
done before he spake thus.
</P>
<P>
   First, consider the source. Peeking through the prurience of
Playboy is not the place for exalted ecclesiastical explanations,
can we agree on that? Second, it's a free country last time I
checked. Why can't politicians say some outrageous things and live
to muse upon their folly?
</P>
<P>
   I like the way Ventura refused to grovel and groan and sweat and
sway. He didn't try to weasel out of it. Yeah, I said it, he
shrugged. While he's getting booed and jeered for that, and
ancillary comments, like the one suggesting the Tailhook scandal
was hyped way out of proportion, can I suggest that the Irish
confetti aimed at Ventura's hairless pate is a bit excessive?
</P>
<P>
   Organized religion has been around for eons and can survive an
offhanded jibe from a generally well-meaning fellow. As a
talk-radio ratings hound before beguiling Minnesota voters, Jesse
knows how to get attention. He has to be a lot smarter than he
sometimes appears; aren't we all? And don't we all say or do
bone-headed things from time to time? Admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Surely a man clever enough to get elected and charismatic enough
to have a national following comprehends the role of religion
beyond the narrow parameters he sketched in Playboy. It would be
tragic if his world view is as coarse as his more outrageous sound
bites. It would be a lot more savage world without churchgoing's
pacific influences, would it not?
</P>
<P>
   There are heroic religious figures from every epoch and culture.
The Catholic Church's various health organizations, for example,
provide medical care for one American out of five, I just read.
What would Minnesota state government do if every religious outfit
packed up its operations of schools, hospitals, nursing homes,
etc., and left it to Ventura's imagination to fund and run all
manner of social services? Punt, that's what.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a bozo statement by an exuberant politician trying
to be provocative for a girlie mag. No real harm done. I think a
politician can say something dumb and not have to be boiled in
rhetorical oil. Pat Buchanan is a yobbo, by my lights, but I don't
think he's an anti-Semite just because he voices goofy theories
about Hitler. And I think Jesse is right when he says the
politically correct went overboard on the Tailhook punishments
after some licentious groping by boozed-up carrier pilots letting
off steam. How about we all lighten up?

CHEF, COOKBOOK AUTHOR TURNS COOKING INTO A PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Emeril Lagasse likes to raise a ruckus. Arguably
one of the most popular television chefs in the country right now,
Lagasse entertains with gusto. He throws ingredients into the bowl
and yells, ``BAM.'' His signature phrase is ``Kick it up a notch,''
which means add more of the seasoning mix he calls ``Essence,'' and
he's prone to making ice cream with raw eggs and forming bocconcini
hands.
</P>
<P>
   The food-safety police ``are going to break down the door any
minute,'' Lagasse said in a phone interview from his restaurant in
Las Vegas last week. Now he's needling the company that published
his latest cookbook, ``Every Day's a Party'' (William Morrow), by
insisting that his book tour visit cities in middle America.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always want you to go to Miami and Chicago and Los
Angeles,'' Lagasse said. ``For two years, I've been pushing on this
thing. To get them to let me go to places like Buffalo, Albany,
Rochester and Syracuse. They think I'm crazy, but they're letting
me do it. It's great to get with the real people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real. It's like it is in New Orleans,'' said Lagasse
of this, his fifth book. ``This particular book is very special.
There's a lot of family and friends that celebrated during this
whole thing.'' ``Every Day's a Party'' takes cooks through a year
of events, including the Sugar Bowl, Mardi Gras, the French Market
Tomato Festival, the New Iberia Gumbo Cook-Off and Christmas
dinner, Louisiana style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inspiration came a couple years ago when people started
talking about this millennium nonsense,'' Lagasse said. ``I don't
want people to lose the tradition and the wonderful things that
have built over the last couple of hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   Lagasse worked on the book with co-writers Marcelle Bienvenu and
Felicia Willett, and photographer Philip Gould.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to take people through this journey month by month.
We traveled around the state and none of this stuff was staged,
this is the real deal.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the recipes go, Lagasse says they too are for real
people. ``The recipes are solid and work, they've been home-tested.
I feel that for a lot of people there's a trust factor. I don't
want people to be intimidated about cooking, so we pay particular
attention to the number of ingredients and where they can get them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to have the trust and smudge the pages all up
and feel like they can really do something neat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   SPINACH AND CHEESE QUICHE
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 8)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups bleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 teaspoons salt, divided 1/4 teaspoon plus
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon cayenne, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 tablespoons ice water, as needed
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   3 cups tightly packed, fresh spinach, stems removed, washed and
patted dry
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces Gouda cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces sharp white cheddar, grated
</P>
<P>
   Combine the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the
cayenne in a medium-size mixing bowl. Cut in the shortening with
two knives until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 4
tablespoons of the ice water and mix until the dough comes away
form the sides of the bowl. Add the remaining teaspoon of water, if
necessary. Form dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 350 degrees. Remove the dough from the refrigerator
and let sit for 5 minutes. Lightly dust work surface with flour.
Roll the dough out into a 12-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick.
Fold the dough into fourths, place it in a 10-inch quiche pan and
unfold it. Press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the
pan. Roll a rolling pin over the pan to cut off the excess dough.
Prick bottom of the crust all over with a fork. In a large mixing
bowl, combine the cream, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and cayenne, and
the nutmeg. Whisk to blend. In a large skillet over medium heat,
melt the butter. Add the onions, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt
and the black pepper and cook, stirring, until the onion is soft, 3
minutes. Add the garlic and spinach and cook until the spinach
wilts, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Arrange the
spinach mixture evenly over the bottom of the crust. Sprinkle the
cheeses over the spinach. Pour the cream mixture on top. Bake until
the center is set and the top is golden, 45 minutes. Serve warm or
at room temperature.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SWEET POTATO CHOCOLATE BARS
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 2 dozen)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds medium-size sweet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   3 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups graham-cracker crumbs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups pecan pieces
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces semisweet chocolate morsels
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the sweet potatoes with the vegetable oil and place on a
baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake until fork-tender, 1
to 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and let cool, then peel and
mash in a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the mashed potatoes the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg,
salt, vanilla, eggs and 2 1/2 cups of the milk; mix well. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the graham-cracker crumbs and pecan pieces in a food
processor and process for 1 minute to make a fine meal. With the
motor running, gradually pour the melted butter through the feed
tube and process for 1 minute. Transfer the crumb mixture to a
13-by-18-inch baking pan and, using your fingers, firmly press the
crumbs evenly onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the sweet potato mixture into the crust and spread evenly
with a rubber spatula.
</P>
<P>
   Put the chocolate morsels and remaining milk in a medium-size
saucepan over medium heat and stir constantly until the chocolate
melts and the mixture is smooth. Spoon the chocolate in 3 rows
about 2 inches apart, lengthwise over the sweet potato mixture.
Then, with a knife, make a zigzag pattern to marbleize the
chocolate and sweet potato mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the edges are browned and the filling is set, 20 to
25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely. To serve,
cut into bars.

POWERPUFFS MOP UP THE BADDIES, CAPTURE GIRLS' HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are three little pastel-colored sisters from suburban
Townsville, and they are just dripping with cuteness. They also
happen to be superheroes whose motto is ``saving the world before
bedtime.'' They play hopscotch, they fly, and their names _ can you
stand it? _ are Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know them yet, you will soon. Move over, Furby.
Make way, Pokemon. Pow! Pow! Pow!
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about ``The Powerpuff Girls,'' a half-hour
animated comedy series that has been winning fans on the Cartoon
Network. While barely big enough for kindergarten, these characters
_ who bust up baddies, kick up their Mary Janes, and shake their
pigtails _ are the embodiment of Girl Power.
</P>
<P>
   And they're trendsetters, too: Suddenly, little girls are
sticking bows in their hair and acting tough _ like Amanda Leone,
5, of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stands with her hands on her hips and tells me she is
going to conquer someone today,'' says her mother, Denise.
</P>
<P>
   But Powerpuff fans aren't limited to Amanda's age group.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year after the show's debut, the Powerpuff Girls have
become to teenagers _ and even some older girls _ what Teletubbies
are to toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Teens voted ``The Powerpuff Girls'' the best animated series on
TV, according to the latest issue of the Big Blue Dot Trend Update,
an on-line e-mail newsletter produced by Big Blue Dot, a Watertown
design firm dedicated to kids. The girls got 42 percent of the
vote, beating out the Simpsons (13 percent) and Pokemon (3
percent).
</P>
<P>
   And trend-conscious teenagers, who last year were swooning over
Leonardo DiCaprio and hooked on ``Dawson's Creek,'' are ordering
glittery Powerpuff angel T-shirts from the Alloy catalog, purveyor
of hot style trends for teens.
</P>
<P>
   Girls in their late teens and even young women in their early
20s are aligning with their favorite Powerpuff girl. Nicole Weaver,
19, of Maynard, whose tongue is pierced, says she likes ``the one
with black hair the best. She has an attitude problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the 32-year-old graphic artist in Philadelphia who
has designed a Powerpuff Girls Web site just for the fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   Powerpuff merchandise is hot. You think Pokemon is saturating
the market? Just wait till you see what the Cartoon Network has up
its sleeve with the Powerpuff Girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the spectrum of heat, this is our first breakout
for a real opportunity at the retail product level,'' says a nearly
breathless Bob Bryant, vice president for off-channel commerce at
the Cartoon Network. ``We're doing just about everything with them
in the development of what's become a really hot property for us.''
</P>
<P>
   He then outlines plans to roll out Powerpuff underwear, plush
toys, outfits, and accessories for young children and teenagers,
and he indicates this is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powerpuff Girls have probably gone to market faster than
almost any made-for-television animated property, perhaps ever,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   The show's fans are buying into the marketing machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cute and funny,'' says target audience member Rebecca
Manning, 14, a freshman at Newton (Mass.) North High School, who
considers the show to be ``neat'' and has bought herself a
Powerpuff T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they have Girl Power,'' adds her friend Alyssa Sweet, 13,
of Newton, who spent a day at summer camp this year dressed as the
Powerpuff Buttercup.
</P>
<P>
   The teenage girl world, apparently, has been poised for Girl
Power. The Spice Girls foreshadowed it, with their freewheeling
feminism and attitude. The sports world has heralded it, with the
victories of female athletes like the Williams sisters in tennis
and the World Cup soccer players. Even the fashion world has hinted
at it, with the recent popularity of glittery Care Bear and
Strawberry Shortcake T-shirts, the girlie heroines of teen
yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Add a hint of the Japanese-style animation that's currently the
rage, and suddenly everything coalesces in the unexpected guise of
three doe-eyed kindergarteners who aren't allowed to stay out after
dark, yet fight evil menaces like Fuzzy Lumpkins and Mojo Jojo.
There is no moral ambiguity about these siblings, who are so
innocent and pure they sleep in the same bed, with no hidden
meaning whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're superheroes,'' Blossom says, in a typical segment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we do,'' says Buttercup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duh,'' says Bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   How to account for their popularity?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a backlash against the idea of sarcasm and
irony and the whole snotty attitude in American culture,'' suggests
Bob Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study of
Popular Television at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, there is something terribly appealing about the
extreme saccharine sincerity of the Powerpuff Girls. . . . They
have the feel of your feet in the pajamas you used to wear. They're
warm and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is ``a way to go back (to childhood) and not have to
worry about what everyone else is thinking about you, and about
stresses like social life and popularity,'' theorizes Anna Grady,
16, who was recently seen riffling through the Powerpuff shirts at
the Hot Topic store in the Natick (Mass.) Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Simensky, vice president of original animation for the
Cartoon Network, offers an opposing view: ``I think it's the idea
(that) girls always come out the winners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the show is produced by a man, it seems to be kind
of a commentary on feminism and role models,'' agrees Elizabeth
Nephew of Philadelphia, the graphic artist who designed a Powerpuff
Girls Web site (http://www.nephco.com/powerpuffgirls). ``It's not
that women want to become men, but that they want to become more
like powerful girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one is more surprised by the show's success than its
creator, Craig McCracken, 28, of Sherman Oaks, Calif. When he first
came up with the idea of a show about three mini-superheroines, he
presumed his audience would be little children. Still, he held out
hope that the subtleties wouldn't be lost on older people.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends all liked it. We were hoping people would get it,''
McCracken says. ``It is a little bit tongue-in-cheek and campy.
It's the basic idea of these cute things being tough, beating up an
evil monkey. When you step back, you say, `Wait a minute, I'm
seeing little children beat up a monkey.' ''

EX-CASCADE CREW HOPES LIGHTNING STRIKES TWICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Desh Deshpande and Daniel Smith became stock market heroes
when they built Cascade Communications into a telecommunications
leader by going toe to toe with industry giants. Get ready for
their second public act.
</P>
<P>
   Deshpande and Smith, who sold Cascade for $3.6 billion in 1997,
are now running Sycamore Networks Inc. of Chelmsford, Mass.
Sycamore executives have just embarked on a road show that will
lead to a closely watched initial public stock offering later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Despande and Smith, who split $150 million in the Cascade deal,
have made no secret of the fact they don't plan to sell this time.
Our question: Will they always be able to say no in such an
unpredictable corner of the market?
</P>
<P>
   The pair have brought in no fewer than seven senior executives
from their old Cascade management crew to build Sycamore's
business, selling fiber-optic network products.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they are developing the next generation of the
products they sold at Cascade. Again they will be going up against
much bigger competitors, including the likes of Cisco Systems Inc.,
Nortel Networks Corp., Lucent Technologies Inc., and Ciena Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management and staff have lived through this before and
survived as Cascade,'' said analyst Frank Dzubeck of Communications
Network Architects Inc. in Washington. ``They've gone through all
the negatives that are classically there (as a start-up) and grew
extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Those credentials are especially important to the big network
operators Sycamore is targeting as customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large company like AT&AMP;T or Bell Atlantic doesn't want to
take chances with young upstart vendors,'' said analyst Dana
Cooperman of Ryan, Hankin &AMP; Kent. ``It's difficult to get into this
market if you don't have that kind of background.''
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore executives hope to raise about $123 million by selling
less than 9 percent of the company, an offering that would value
their business at about $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That would be an astounding feat for a company that shipped its
first product in May, has billed just one customer to date, and
recorded total revenues of $11.3 million. Even more amazing: Many
observers expect the stock to take off like a rocket after the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors look at comparable networking stocks that
have soared by as much as fivefold over their IPO price in recent
months and believe that Sycamore can do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very realistic,'' said analyst Ken Fleming of
Renaissance Capital, which manages the IPO Plus Aftermarket fund.
``It's certainly going to be a hot IPO.''
</P>
<P>
   Despande and Smith, whose Sycamore stock would be worth about
$250 million apiece at the estimated IPO price, could become
instant paper billionaires in such a scenerio.
</P>
<P>
   For now, investors are unabashedly wild about telecommunications
stocks and none more so than companies that supply gear for
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   The basic story line: The high-capacity communications
infrastructure being built to support vastly greater demand from
Internet users and other customers needs many pieces of equipment
and software. So much money is being spent so quickly to build
complicated networks that specialized companies are in demand and
command huge valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some of the recent stock developments among
telecommunications companies:
</P>
<P>
   --Juniper Networks Inc., a company similar to Sycamore Networks,
went public at 34 per share in June and sold more stock at a price
of 190 three months later. It closed at 184 Tuesday, giving Juniper
a market value of $9.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   --Redback Networks Inc., which went public at 23 per share in
May, was priced at 114 1/2 Tuesday. With less than $17 million in
first-half sales, Redback's stock market value has zoomed to $4.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   --Foundry Networks Inc. went public eight days ago at 25 per
share, boomed to more than 166 in its first day of trading, and
finished Tuesday at 158.
</P>
<P>
   One transaction that excited Sycamore followers never made it to
the public market. Cisco Systems opened its wallet like never
before when it purchased Cerent Corp. in August.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sycamore Networks, Cerent makes products for fiber-optic
networks and has recorded scant actual business so far. Its
revenues amounted to just $9.9 million for the first half of 1999.
But Cisco paid $6.9 billion to buy the company, the most it has
ever spent on an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Cisco acquisition of Cerent speaks a lot for the
worth of Sycamore,'' said John Golden, a technology analyst at John
Hancock Mutual Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore's products are designed to improve the efficiency and
flexibility of fiber-optic networks that can transmit vast amounts
of information.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital investors were drawn to the track record of
Sycamore's team of former Cascade executives, but the company's
starting technology is the product of two researchers at MIT's
Lincoln Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Barry and Eric Swanson, who came from the lab's Advanced
Networks Group, had no commercial experience before they took some
space at the offices of Matrix Partners, the Waltham venture
capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix executives put them together with Deshpande and Smith,
and the business started to grow. At first, Matrix put $2.5 million
into Sycamore and eventually invested a total of about $10 million.
Its stake would be worth about $250 million at the estimated IPO
price range.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore got off to a lightning start, designing a product,
recording its first sales, and getting an IPO in the works over
just 18 months. The next year and a half could be just as much of
an adventure.

   1. LOVE AT RANDOM : KIRSTEN SCOTT THOMAS ON LIFE,
</P>
<P>
   LOVE SCENES AND HARRISON FORD ``I think the movies have typecast
my life,'' says actress Kirsten Scott Thomas. ``I'm Mrs. Tragedy in
the movies and people expect me to be that way in real life. It's
like I want to scream ``But I am a lighthearted person!'' She says
she had a high-school crush on Harrison Ford - and now he is her
co-star in her latest film, ``Random Hearts.'' She believes the
film speaks to women who are fooling themselves about their mates'
fidelity. Even though she has worked with such heartthrobs as Ford,
Ralph Fiennes and Robert Redford, Scott Thomas says she has never
enjoyed filming the love scenes. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,300 words +
photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
THE LIMEY SIDE OF TERENCE STAMP It's been almost 40 years since
Terence Stamp, then a 20-year-old neophyte actor, was nominated for
a best supporting actor Oscar for ``Billy Budd'' (1962.) ``I know
it's fashionable to put the '60s down,'' he says, ``but it was
heaven on earth for a few minutes.'' He didn't win an Oscar, but
almost four decades later he is a contender for the award again
with a powerful performance in the title role of a very different
kind of movie - ``The Limey.'' Stamp plays a lean, mean, senior
citizen just released from a British prison ... and bent on
vengeance. The movie is violent and intense. By Ivor Davis. 1,500
words + photo. N/A Great Britain and Australia.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
'WEIRD AL' YANKOVIC FINDS THE
</P>
<P>
   FUNNY SIDE OF MUSIC There are many arbiters of success in the
pop-music world - hit singles, gold and platinum albums, adoring
crowds. But you aren't really a star until ``Weird Al'' Yankovic
parodies one of your songs. His songs may be funny, but that
doesn't mean he isn't serious about the music he makes. Even though
some critics dismiss his work, he says he always tries to deliver
something that works as a parody and as a song in its own right. By
Gary Graff. 1,000 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
BAD BOY CHIC : ALAN CUMMING AND THE ALLURE OF DECADENCE Alan
Cumming's resume is jammed with flamboyant and/or gay characters.
And the actor wouldn't have it any other way. In fact, he
emphasizes, no one - agents, manager, family or friends - has ever
dared suggest that it might help his career if he toned down his
characterizations. ``I'd just think they were stupid if they did,''
the bisexual actor says. ``The people around me know me well enough
to know I don't adhere to those types of rules and never have.'' By
Ian Spelling. 1,300 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 5.
KING CLOONEY Is George Clooney a movie star? He is a sex symbol and
has been a talented actor in ``ER'' for many years. But he has yet
to break through on the big screen. despite a star-making
performance in last year's ``Out of Sight.'' Now he heads to the
desert with two rapper-turned-actors, Ice Cube and ``Marky'' Mark
Wahlberg. The unlikely trio are the ``Three Kings,'' in an off-beat
war story set during the Gulf War. By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,300
words + photos.
_____________________________________________________________ 6.
JAY ROACH, MAN OF MYSTERY Jay Roach is best known as the director
of both ``Austin Powers'' movies, but it seems there is more going
on inside his head than very silly comedy. Roach's latest film,
``Mystery, Alaska,'' teams him with screenwriter David E. Kelley
(the multi-Emmy-winning creator of ``Ally McBeal.'') The result,
filmed in the starkly beautiful Canadian wilderness, is a low-key
and heartfelt story of a small town that lives for its amateur ice
hockey team. By Joshua Mooney. 1,300 words + photos.
_____________________________________________________________ 7.
UNDERCOVER 'ANGEL' He is a handsome, centuries-old vampire. She is
a gorgeous vampire slayer. Theirs is the age-old story of opposites
in love. And though their love has already endured numerous
supernatural trials, this romanced is doomed. The new TV show
'Angel' begins with the dark, brooding vampire taking up residence
in Los Angeles, the City of Angels. By Tamara Conniff. BPI. 900
words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 8.
ROB REINER TELLS 'THE STORY OF US' It's been a decade since
actor/director Rob Reiner explored romance and relationships in his
hit comedy, ``When Harry Met Sally'' (1989.) His new film, ``The
Story of Us,'' takes that exploration one long step further. Bruce
Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer play a husband and wife who are on the
verge of divorce after 15 years of marriage and two children. By
Jeanne Wolf. 1,300 words + photo.

NYERERE, ILL IN LONDON, HAILED AS AFRICAN PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ That Tanzania is known more for Mount Kilimanjaro
than for ethnic violence, more for the migrations of the Serengeti
than mass flows of refugees, is largely the legacy of one man.
</P>
<P>
   News that Julius Nyerere lies gravely ill with leukemia in a
London hospital is causing people across Africa to reconsider the
work of one of this continent's most important sons.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of modern Tanzania, Nyerere is often remembered for
experimenting with a home-grown version of socialism that ended in
dubious results. But his political contribution to post-colonial
Africa is far-reaching and enduring. He coaxed his country into a
model of stability amid turbulent neighbors, nourished southern
Africa's major freedom movements, and asserted African causes long
before Western leaders were receptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This individual has to be considered one of the great African
leaders,'' said Mahmood Mamdani, an African intellectual at
Columbia University. ``His vision of African unity was remarkably
inclusive'' and ``insisted that independent Africa support
decolonization _ politically and materially _ elsewhere on the
continent.''
</P>
<P>
   Africans call him Mwalimu, the Swahili word for teacher. Born in
1922, the son of a disreputable man with 22 wives, Nyerere showed
early integrity, determination, and political resolve. He worked
his way through Uganda's Makerere University and started the
Tanganyika African Welfare Association to improve the lives of
Africans under British colonization. In 1948 he traveled to
Edinburgh to study economics and politics. Four years later, he
returned to then-Tanganyika to teach.
</P>
<P>
   But his tenure in the classroom was short-lived. Three years
into his career, he formed the Tanganyika African National Union,
the organ through which he led his countrymen to independence. By
1960 he had become chief minister of the colony in a carefully
crafted deal with the British, and a year later prime minister of a
newly independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Once in power, he unified the country's more than 120 ethnic
groups under one language, Swahili. In 1967, Nyerere brokered a
plan to unite mainland Tanganyika with the Indian Ocean island of
Zanzibar, and modern Tanzania was formed. In 1985, after 24 years
in power, he ushered in an era of multiparty politics and became
the rare African head of state to step down peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his visit to the east African state in early 1962,
Nelson Mandela, then an underground operative of the outlawed South
African liberation movement the African National Congress, wrote in
his autobiography of Nyerere's keen intellect and humility: ``We
talked at his house, which was not at all grand, and I recall that
he drove himself in a simple car, a little Austin. This impressed
me, for it suggested that he was a man of the people. Class,
Nyerere always insisted, was alien to Africa; socialism
indigenous.''
</P>
<P>
   That latter point formed the core of Nyerere's African
philosophy. He rejected capitalism as a scourge of colonial rule,
and vowed to found Tanzania on the principles of self-reliance,
self-sacrifice, and a moral commitment to the liberation of all
African peoples. The country lacked minerals and other resources,
so Nyerere built his socialist vision around the concept of
communal land ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere remains adamant that his system worked. When the British
left, he once noted, the new country had two trained engineers, 12
doctors, and an 85 percent illiteracy rate. By the time he stepped
down, he said, nearly every child was in school and 91 percent of
adults could read and write.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are less effusive. Nyerere's socialism ``kept Tanzania
underdeveloped,'' said Shadrach Gutto, a human rights lawyer at the
University of the Witswatersrand in Johannesburg. ``It generated
all these sentimental theories _ use a hoe rather than a tractor _
that were out of touch with major development trends. That kept
production at very low levels.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, Nyerere skillfully remained unaligned, and
reaped dividends. Patrons courted him from all sides, and Tanzania
became Africa's most-aided country by the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere's vision for Africa rested on a principle of unity. He
was a founding father of the Organization of African Unity in 1963,
and urged _ unsuccessfully _ his immediate neighbors to create an
integrated east African market.
</P>
<P>
   But Nyerere could also take a stand against his African
counterparts. Promoting human rights, he was the first African
leader to break with Nigeria and support the Biafran secessionist
movement in 1968. A decade later, he rolled his troops across
Uganda's border to oust dictator Idi Amin.
</P>
<P>
   Tireless in his efforts to promote stability, Nyerere during a
visit to the White House in 1963, badgered President John F.
Kennedy to apply sanctions against South Africa, and now, decades
later, has spent much of this year trying to defuse Burundi's
ethnic tensions. He influenced Africanists like Black Consciousness
leader Stephen Biko in the 1970s, and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni and
South Africa's Thabo Mbeki today.
</P>
<P>
   As Mandela said in a tribute in 1997, ``it is humbling to recall
the contribution that Mwalimu Nyerere has made to the liberation of
our continent. . .his burning desire for justice everywhere, and
his commitment to Africa's interests.''

<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Happiness existed before Harvey Ball, but it
was more difficult to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   When Ball, then a 42-year-old commercial artist, enclosed two
dots and a curved line in a yellow circle, he created an image that
became an icon so quickly, and with such penetration, that 37 years
later it is impossible to imagine that the ``smiley face'' didn't
come into existence on its own.
</P>
<P>
   But a person was necessary _ and as a variety of Worcester
officials and postal service dignitaries were at pains to point out
Friday, Ball is that person.
</P>
<P>
   As a chorus of schoolchildren sang ``The Ballad of Harvey
Ball,'' and postal service dignitaries unveiled a smiley-face
stamp, city fathers hailed the yellow button as Worcester's
greatest claim to fame _ supplanting such previous achievements as
barbed wire, shredded wheat, and the monkey wrench. Worcester is
also the only city in the United States where Sigmund Freud
officially lectured, but you can't put that on a postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of Worcester's history, you think first,
always, of the smiley face,'' said Bill Wallace, curator of the
Worcester Historical Museum.
</P>
<P>
   If members of the assembled crowd had a certain ferocity in
their claim, they have reason. Ball never secured the trademark to
his design _ it didn't occur to him at the time _ and has fended
off a long series of challenges to his authorship.
</P>
<P>
   Especially reviled in Worcester is a Belgian named Franklin
Loufrani, who reportedly has registered the symbol in 80 countries
and promised to sue any US company trying to market the image
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The way they tell it in Worcester, the smiley face was born out
of corporate discord. A Worcester-based insurance company, State
Mutual Life Assurance, had bought out an Ohio firm called Guarantee
Mutual, creating an office dynamic that Ball sums up as people
yelling at one other.
</P>
<P>
   State Mutual's vice president came up with the idea of an
in-house friendship campaign, and the company's marketing director
farmed out the graphic work to Ball. She suggested a smile. Ball
added eyes, so that ill-tempered employees couldn't turn it into a
frown.
</P>
<P>
   After Ball received $45 for his work and bade a permanent
farewell to his design, the smiley face took off in a way no one
had expected. State Mutual, which originally ordered 100
smiley-face pins, reordered them in batches of 10,000 and made
vague attempts to associate the logo with the company, at one point
dubbing it the ``Smile Insurance Companies,'' according to the
Historical Museum.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm couldn't pretend to control the phenomenon; the
yellow button had taken on a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking around, and I said, `For God's sake, the
smiley's everywhere,' '' Ball recalled.
</P>
<P>
   When State Mutual finally inquired about securing rights to the
design, Ball said, managers were told that the image had been so
thoroughly absorbed into the public domain that it could not be
copyrighted. Although that judgment cut Ball off from legal
ownership, it is also, to some, the brass ring of graphic design _
proof that he created an image that's as universally recognizable
as a stop sign or a heart shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a blur in some ways,'' said Julie Townsend, a
graphic designer and president of Barrett Communications in
Cambridge. ``It's like the symbols for men and women you see on
airport bathrooms. In some ways, that's the ultimate logo, because
it was so ubiquitous that it really became part of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball's design has been mythologized in ``Forrest Gump'' and
abused by surly rockers like Kurt Cobain and Marilyn Manson, who
stormed off stage when he glimpsed a smiley-face sticker. The
Worcester Historical Museum, in exhibit notes, reported that ``the
smiley face came to symbolize mindless optimism and bland
conformity.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this makes much sense to Ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Worcester native went off to World War II, where duty
reached its low point with eight weeks storming the Japanese line
at Okinawa. One incident that stands out for him is the explosion
of a mortar shell in front of him and four other soldiers. Three to
his left were killed, one to his right was injured. Ball, 3 feet
away, was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   When he got home, Worcester seemed so dreamlike, Ball said, that
he sat on a bus one day and wondered quite seriously if he had gone
to heaven. In that context, the money he could have earned off the
smiley face is not important, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a money-driven man,'' said Charlie Ball, Harvey's son
and a Worcester attorney. ``It could be that nobody would have paid
money for that in 1963. Maybe its success has to do with the fact
that it was free, it was out there, nobody attempted to own it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his son says, it ``doesn't sit well with Harv'' when
others take credit for designing the smiley face. ``His attitude
is, `Damn it, this is my legacy and nobody else's. Let's be clear
on that,' '' Charlie Ball said. ``That absolutely motivates him.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Harvey Ball came up with the idea of Friday's
World Smile Day, and he secured the rights to a smiley face with
his name signed in small cursive letters on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   John Zamoida, education coordinator for the Worcester museum,
said city historians had followed Ball's high-minded lead and
concerned themselves only minimally with Belgian pretenders. But he
also said they had learned a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``World Smile Day,'' he said, ``is trademarked.''

LOS ANGELES POLICE KEEP EYES ON THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The stolen cocaine was only the start.
</P>
<P>
   The latest corruption scandal to unfold at the Los Angeles
Police Department now includes allegations of cops who stole
cocaine from evidence storage, cops who dealt drugs, cops who
planted guns on suspects, cops who beat a suspect inside the
station, even a cop who shot a suspect in the head, paralyzing him
for life. As ominous for a departmental image tarnished by the
Rodney King beating and the Los Angeles riots are all the police
officers accused of looking the other way.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-expanding probe, which began more than 18 months ago
but only came to light last month, also featured cops of another
kind: the ones who first reported the cocaine missing, as well as
the ones who pursued the case against the officer who this month
pleaded guilty to stealing it. In exchange for a lighter prison
sentence, he has been spilling department secrets ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``All through this investigation, you have had a lot of people
policing their own, turning over every rock, and continuing even
when there were obstacles,'' said Edith Perez, the former head of
the Los Angeles Police Commission. ``It's an opportunity for the
LAPD to hold everyone involved accountable, including supervisors
who had reason to know or who knew what was going on and did
nothing about it. . . There's been a feeling for some time now that
the department is going to be called on the mat if its house is not
in order.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Police Chief Bernard C. Parks has relieved a dozen
officers of duty, with pay, from the Rampart Division, which
handles a part of town heavily populated by immigrants and is at
the center of the scandal. A somber Parks has also indicated others
might be implicated.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear how deeply the scandal reaches into the LAPD
in general and its Rampart Division in particular. The Los Angeles
Times has reported that the investigation has expanded into the
command ranks, with the police captain who ran the Rampart station
until last year now a focus of the probe. Another captain since
transferred out of Rampart reportedly was cited for failing to
supervise officers under his command.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael A. Perez, 32, the convicted officer whose testimony
touched off the city's worst police scandal in memory, has called
the corruption ``a cancer.'' He himself shot and framed a young
illegal immigrant from Honduras, who was released from prison on
Sept. 17 as the scandal broke open. Javier Francisco Ovando, the
victim, is now paralyzed and in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is expected to serve five years in prison as part of his
plea bargain. Attorneys for Ovando's 2-year-old daughter are filing
a $20 million claim against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Although Parks said many of Perez's allegations against other
officers cannot be corroborated because evidence has been
destroyed, no one disputes that the problems appear to run deep.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Perez's former partner was recently fired on
unrelated charges that he planted evidence and made a false arrest.
Another officer is under investigation for allegedly beating a
handcuffed suspect so badly inside Rampart station that the suspect
vomited blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's good the department uncovered this, but the
department also let it go on,'' said Erwin Chemerinksy, a
University of Southern California law professor who worked closely
with Parks as chairman of the city's elected Charter Reform
Commission. ``A lot of people in the department knew about this and
let it go on. There's increasing evidence that there was serious
illegality going on and that the code of silence was again
operative.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the already uncovered police abuses, criminal
cases are certain to be reopened. Some shootings that were ruled
justified are being reexamined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorting through the evidence until we can get a handle
on how many or which declarations involved officers who may be
under suspicion and to verify information that may no longer be
credible,'' said Marty Vranicar, a supervising deputy city attorney
in the antigang section. ``We have to decide what's left, then
decide what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the simplest of questions must be answered: What
exactly happened and how was it allowed to happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no telling how far this went,'' said spokesman Ken
Ferber of the police commission, the department's civilian
overseer. ``My gut feeling is that it runs from incompetent
management from the captain's perspective to the sergeant looking
the other way to the cops who did these things. . . . They did weed
this out themselves, and that's to their credit. Now they've got to
take it as far as it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the department's system of checks and
balances has failed, Parks has called for sweeping reforms embraced
by some other large police departments. He said he would push for
drug and polygraph testing of officers, as well as the right to
review their finances.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Protective League, which represents the
rank and file, has indicated it would support some of the changes
and probably resist others.
</P>
<P>
   With his take-charge, accept-no-excuses attitude, Parks has
helped to reassure Angelenos that the scandal can be contained. In
statement after statement, Los Angeles's police chief of about two
years has put officers across the city on alert that he will not
tolerate abuses on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chief Parks is determined to change the culture of the
department, the culture that thrived under (former chief) Daryl
Gates,' '' Chemerinsky said. ``That was a police department where
officers wanted to take the law into their own hands, a police
department where racism was prevalent, a police department where
officers would not expose the wrongdoing of other officers. This is
a chief who wants to have strict discipline within his
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some observers worry that the police cannot police
themselves. The American Civil Liberties Union wants an independent
investigation into the corruption charges. The city attorney made a
point of asserting civilian control over the department last month
when it reaffirmed the police commission's role as overseer with
investigatory powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does speak well of the department that they are
investigating these kinds of issues,'' said Angelica Salas, acting
director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrants of Los Angeles.
``The thing is how long it actually took them to discover that
these things were happening. This is years of misconduct and
criminal behavior. The police can't fix it alone. We all have to
take responsibility by demanding the utmost conduct so this doesn't
happen again.''

NOTRE DAME LIE LEAVES COACH FUMBLING FOR TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, Mass. _ An assistant football coach who claimed to be
a former All-American running back at Notre Dame has resigned after
it was revealed his story was a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   William Nicholas McMullen was hired at Old Colony Regional
Vocational Technical High School after saying he was Nick Eddy, a
former Heisman Trophy candidate in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   His charade came to light this week when the real Nick Eddy,
living in California, heard about McMullen's posturing and called
the New Bedford Standard-Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does express remorse,'' Eddy said. ``But I also sense that
the big reason he expresses remorse is that he got caught. He had
20 years to tell the truth, and he didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   McMullen said Tuesday he had told the team's head football coach
he was resigning, effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   He said his days of assuming Eddy's identity began more than 20
years ago when he was in dire need of a job with only $15 in his
pocket, and he committed a ``desperate indiscretion'' and claimed a
college degree he didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the boss's office for an interview at a New Bedford
manufacturing plant, surrounded by Notre Dame memorabilia, he said
that he, too, was a Notre Dame graduate.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen, now 58, said he could not fathom at the time that
moment of weakness would escalate, then dog him for the next two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday he patiently answered questions about why he'd spent a
third of his life claiming to be Eddy, the famed halfback for the
Fighting Irish during the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Old Colony Superintendent David Ferreira expressed bewilderment,
saying McMullen never had reason to lie. The coach, Ferreira said,
was hired for his obvious knowledge of football and later judged
for his skill with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that if he had never done this, he would have
been successful anyway,'' Ferreira said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to prove yourself with kids every day. They accepted
him for the motivation he provided, and I don't think they cared
about an All-American from 35 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   McMullen said he maintained the mammoth deception not for
personal gain, but simply because he had recklessly dug himself
into a hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a job. I needed a job badly. I took a left turn when
I should have taken a right turn, and I unfortunately kept going
instead of making a U-turn and coming back and doing it right,''
said McMullen by phone from his Fairhaven home.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, he had no intention of claiming to be Eddy, he said.
McMullen, who never attended college but played football and other
sports in high school, only wanted to impress his job interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   He made no mention of football. And he got the job at the
now-closed plant.
</P>
<P>
   Though Nick Eddy was about 6 feet tall and weighed 200 pounds in
his prime, it was perhaps too easy for the athletic McMullen, who
is about 5 inches shorter and weighs much less, to take on his
identity. A three-year starter on the school's powerhouse teams of
the mid-1960s, Eddy was on a team that won a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted by the Detroit Lions, Eddy overcame an early knee injury
and spent several years with the team until he retired. He now
sells insurance in Modesto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre coincidence, McMullen actually had been known by
the name Nick Eddy, he said. Since his father was also a William,
McMullen had always been called Nick. And his stepfather's last
name was Eddy.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen said he never intended to claim Eddy's stardom. But the
explanation fit when, a few weeks after the initial lie, his boss
wondered why he wasn't listed in an alumni directory. McMullen said
Nick Eddy had been his nickname at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen said he believed the falsehood would vanish because he
planned to move to California to help his ex-wife raise their three
sons.
</P>
<P>
   But while working in New Bedford, McMullen met his current wife,
who made the trip with him. The two returned to Massachusetts to be
near her family and raise their young son. Back home, some people
still knew him as Nick Eddy since the lie, as he said, had
``snowballed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got involved with Little League, and people would come up
and say, `Are you Nick Eddy?'' he said. ``I would say, `Yes, I am,'
but I would never go into detail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept it as low-key as I possibly could in the hopes that it
would become a nonissue,'' McMullen added. `` `That was a long time
ago,' as I would say to people.''
</P>
<P>
   McMullen lied about his past even to his wife and son, but they
never seemed particularly interested or impressed with the story of
his being a Heisman Trophy finalist, he said.,
</P>
<P>
   When McMullen happened to meet Old Colony head coach Kevin
Gonsalves several years ago, he hesitated to accept his offer of an
assistant coaching job, fearful that he would be forced to
perpetuate the masquerade. But his love of football overruled his
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   If McMullen is telling the truth, he had only been waiting for
the right moment to reveal his identity.
</P>
<P>
   He had started seeing a psychiatrist, he said, and planned to
admit his two-decade confabulation at the end of the season, when
it would be less disruptive to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to live the rest of my life as a dual person,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen said Eddy, whom he described as very understanding, was
``exceptionally nice and pleasant'' in their conversations and was
concerned for McMullen's family. McMullen added that his wife and
son have been supportive.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes that school officials allow him to explain his
actions to them and to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could take each kid one by one and shake their hand
and hug them and express my regrets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that someday they'll understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddy said he has forgiven McMullen and the deception caused him
no harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four years ago, I heard rumors that I was divorced
and living in the Boston area,'' Eddy said. ``Now I know why.''

IN MEXICO, FIELD RATS ARE A SECRET DELICACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZACATECAS, Mexico _ Joanna and Catalina Herrera, the co-oof a small luncheonette in this central Mexican city, swear it has
more healing powers than chicken soup. And Gerardo Luna, a state
government employee, says that when prepared as a tea with anise
and pepper, it can ``raise the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret? Rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds awful, even to many of us,'' said Joanna, 32. ``But
the truth is they taste very good and they're good for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Boiled in a soup, grilled over an open pit or mixed in a stew,
rats are more than just a nuisance to be chased with a broom.
They're also a delicacy and a tradition here that has been passed
from indigenous ancestors to computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't your run-of-the-mill gutter city rodents, but their
country cousins, the field rat. The difference, connoisseurs say,
can be detected by the field rodent's longer torso _ much like a
small squirrel _ light brown pelt, and shorter tail.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a rat, with a rat's bad public image, which might
explain why none of the local restaurants features such dishes on
their menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something people would want to see on a menu,
especially the tourists who come here,'' said Raul Rodriguez, a
chef at La Cuija, one of the city's poshest eateries, which offers
other dishes such as cow's tongue and, occasionally, rabbit. ``I'm
sure a lot of the local people eat it at home, but they might not
admit it because of the stigma.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, demand for the rodents at times is so great, that
vendors who come in from the farms to sell their animals at the
local market on weekend mornings usually run out of their supplies
within an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the scavenging city rats better known for scurrying
through garbage dumpsters and sewers, field rats eat mostly grains
and seeds planted on farms, experts and rat-eaters say, giving them
a higher nutritional value and a better taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're rich in iron and protein, and more affordable for a
poor family than buying meats, vegetables and fruits,'' said Teresa
Ochoa Rivera, a health professor at the Iberoamerican University in
Mexico City. ``But as with other meats, it depends on careful
handling and preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it taste like chicken?
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it tastes better,'' said Manuel Samaniego, 34, who
manages a crafts shop in the city's historic center. ``It has a
sweeter taste, more like rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   To catch his rats, El Yuri wakes up at 3 a.m. to check the
wooden traps set out in the field the night before. The animals are
then killed and skinned before he drives to the city market, where
he arrives by 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, vendors used to spread their offerings on a
sidewalk _ rabbits on one side and skinned rats stretched on a
skewer on the other. Each rat sells for about $2.
</P>
<P>
   But now, El Yuri has to crouch carefully behind a market wall
and keep his animals tucked secretly in bags because local health
officials have clamped down on rat sales after one vendor was
reportedly caught selling city rats instead of the field kind. Two
people reportedly died from mistakenly eating city rodents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that this is embarrassing so much as it is a health
issue,'' said an official who requested anonymity. ``Selling and
eating rats is not a formal part of the food sector so there are no
regulations to monitor it. We don't want more cases of bad rats.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a place where Big Macs and Whoppers are quickly becoming
the new culinary standard _ Zacatecas recently got its first Burger
King restaurant _ rats, like worms, fried crickets and grilled
snake, will probably fizzle out on their own, without the heavy
hand of government.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the tradition for the Herrera sisters will remain
alive so long as there are colds, flus and fevers to cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works in minutes,'' said Catalina, 24, as she stood in the
kitchen of the family's Rancho Grande restaurant. ``You can't eat
it all the time because it's so powerful. Once you get past the
thought of eating a rat, you'll see that it's not what you think.''

MOSCOW POLICE WAGE RACIST WAR AGAINST SUSPECTED TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Veshnyaki market, in Moscow's far eastern reaces,
is a marvel of bargain-basement capitalism, a sprawling maze of
wholesale fruit and vegetable vendors, cheap imported-clothing
stands, and kiosks that serve hot, greasy fast food.
</P>
<P>
   But when Alexander Grigorievich, a lieutenant colonel in a crack
Moscow police squad, stares out at the massive bazaar, he sees only
criminals and potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
   That is because most of the vendors at Veshnyaki are not
fair-skinned Slavs from Moscow, but dark-complexioned Azerbaijanis
from the Caucasus. And Alexander Grigorievich _ who asked that only
his first name and patronymic but not his surname be used _ and his
unit, known by its Russian acronym OMON, are in the vanguard of
Moscow's openly racist campaign against people with dark skin.
Soon, they know, they may be headed to the Caucasus on a new
mission: to fight in Russia's latest war against the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks,'' sputters Alexander, repeating the word many Russians
use as a slur to describe people from the Caucasus. ``Blacks,
blacks, blacks. Do you see any Russians here? That's what's wrong
with this city. That's what's wrong with this country. Nothing but
blacks. We ought to round them up and deport them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Muscovites _ 55 percent, according to a recent poll _ agree
with that. So would much of Alexander's police unit.
</P>
<P>
   These are tough-looking men with truncheons and shiny black
leather jackets inscribed with the insignia ``Team Special.'' They
are hardened special forces cops who are trained to break up riots
and rescue hostages, to round up crime gangs and intimidate
law-abiding citizens into staying that way. They seem to enjoy the
work, even at the below-average salary of $60 a month.
</P>
<P>
   With a new war breaking out in the breakaway Caucasus region of
Chechnya, every one of his men is likely to be sent to the front,
just like all of them saw time in the bloody 1994-1996 campaign in
Chechnya. About 350 of the unit's 2,000 members already have been
dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the five apartment blasts that killed 300 peopole and
rocked this nation last month, the job of Alexander's unit has been
to raid markets, stop all the dark-skinned people, and check their
documents to see what crimes they might have committed.
</P>
<P>
   Chechens _ dark-skinned people from the Caucasus _ are suspected
by Russian investigators of setting off the four apartment building
blasts that killed nearly 300 people as they slept last month in
Moscow and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Chechens are also the ones who invaded the southern Russian
region of Dagestan twice in August and September, killing more than
250 federal troops and wounding 800 others, including men from
Alexander's unit.
</P>
<P>
   It does not matter to any of these officers that there are no
Chechens at Veshnyaki market. For them, a ``black'' is a ``black.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, it's all connected,'' says Igor, an OMON officer and
Alexander's driver, whose specialty is coaxing his boxy, unmarked
Zhiguli through Moscow traffic jams at speeds over 100 miles per
hour. ``The Chechens, the Azerbaijanis, the Armenians. These people
are not from Russia. They are outsiders, and they are more likely
to commit crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   OMON's method is simple.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover officers approach a raid site, closing off possible
exits. Then the main OMON ``fighters,'' as they call themselves,
drive up in two or three of the rickety old buses that Russians use
for ritual services.
</P>
<P>
   The OMON swarm the market, stopping anyone who looks suspicious,
or like he's from the Caucasus, and demanding to see documents.
Inevitably, the search reveals people who have violated Moscow's
strict, Soviet-era residency rules, which have been declared
unconstitutional but are still observed in the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cast the net wide and see what we catch,'' Igor says during
a break in the day's action that allows him to read a few pages of
his paperback thriller, ``I Will Order A Hit On You.''
</P>
<P>
   During a daylong sweep of six major markets in eastern Moscow
last week, Alexander's OMON unit caught 200 violators of the
residency rules, only a small portion of the 6,000 who are detained
each day in the citywide operation. Each one will be fined 8 rubles
(about 30 cents) then let go. Someday, the OMON men hope, City Hall
will follow through on a promise to mark deportation mandatory in
such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is upset. Many of the vendors' documents have been
registered properly. The OMON officers have no choice but to let
them go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is, many of them are marrying Russian women,''
says Yura, a senior lieutenant, as he, Alexander, and Igor enjoy a
free lunch from a fearful Azerbaijani cafe owner at the Vehnyaki
market whose documents, as well as those of his clients, had just
been checked. ``Soon, they'll have children who will speak
Azerbaijani and Armenian and Chechen. Soon, people won't be able to
talk Russian in school.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a depressing conversation, so the men quit lunch and go
back out to search for more criminals. But that gets boring after a
while. They have been doing this, seven days a week, since the last
bomb exploded in Moscow on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the kind of work we should be doing,'' says Yura.
``OMON has lost respect in the eyes of people from the Caucasus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should see us sometime when we do crowd control!'' Igor
chimes in.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation is interrupted by a man who runs up and tells
the two OMON officers of a crime in progress: Three men are
drinking vodka in public, in clear violation of Mayor Yury
Luzhkov's recent decree outlawing the sale and consumption of
spirits at market places. But by the time the OMON arrive, the men
have finished the vodka.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Augusto Pinochet,'' says one OMON officer, referring
to the former Chilean military dictator under house arrest in
Britain. The officer gives his name as Colonel Petukhov. ``We need
London to hand us over Pinochet for six months. That will put
everything in order. In America, if you buy a beer, you have to put
it in a bag. Here, people drink it on the street. You have
democracy, we have anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The men are convinced that the disorder in Chechnya is a result
of this anarchy. OMON units were accused of atrocities in fighting
in the 1994-1996 war, and the men say that if they go back, they
will be no more forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should just use the atom bomb on Chechnya and be
done with the problem,'' says Yura, a senior lieutenant in
Alexander's unit. ``Look, the Chechens are a bandit nation.''
</P>
<P>
   However well-trained they are, police detachments like OMON are
not military units. They do not train with the army, and they are
not intended to be used as front-line battle troops.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent conflicts between Russian forces and Islamic
rebels, the federal command has relied on OMON detachments. This
has often led to confusion.
</P>
<P>
   During the fighting in Dagestan, OMON detachments were shelled
by Russian artillery and bombed by Russian planes, according to
Alexei Arbatov, deputy chairman of the defense committee in the
Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament, who recently
toured the battlegrounds in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Grigorievich's unit finally catches some crooks: a
group of swindlers running a scheme called ``Lokhotron.'' Like
three-card monty, the scheme is a way to separate unknowing players
from their money. Two undercover officers watch the players to make
sure, then close in.
</P>
<P>
   All of them protest. But they are caught red-handed. A number of
them have Ukrainian or Georgian passports. That is good luck. The
few that have Moscow passports are let go.
</P>
<P>
   An OMON officer also catches a young man with a passport that
has been tampered with. The man is obviously working as muscle for
a large flower stand at one end of the market. But the police let
him go, because there's nothing illegal about that, and he has a
Moscow residency stamp. Later, they sit in the car and watch as the
man badgers and shoves old ladies selling wildflowers until they go
away.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The signs rerouting traffic and warning off
pedestrians have become nearly ubiquitous in this French-flavored
city of gray granite and silver church bells: ``Tournage
Cinematographique'' _ film crew at work.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta is in town, doing ``Battlefield Earth.'' Bruce Willis
has come and gone for ``The Whole Nine Yards.'' And Eddie Murphy's
``Pluto Nash'' is in the wings. All headed for a theater near you,
though you won't have a clue that French Canada is the real setting
for these ostensibly American flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Look out, Los Angeles: There's yet another ``Hollywood North''
looming across the border. Montreal is suddenly hot, vying with
archrivals Toronto and Vancouver as a Canadian shooting set for
anyplace _ standing in for gaslit Manhattan circa 1890, the tawdry
gaming pits of present-day Las Vegas, even a far-future Earth
occupied by a plundering alien race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fashionable to do American movies in Canada,'' Travolta
told a Montreal news conference. ``I don't register a
controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perk up your ears, John. The warning drums are thudding loud in
Tinseltown, and the natives are astir.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's soaring film fortunes come just as the real Hollywood
is getting seriously rattled by the stunning northward flight of
film and television productions over the past decade, mainly to
British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, several thousand California film folk _ directors,
actors, camera operators, set designers, lighting technicians,
grips, and gofers _ thronged down Hollywood Boulevard waving Old
Glory and jeering the Maple Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring Hollywood home!'' roared the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Home from Canada, that is. This stolid northern neighbor, better
known for salmon fishing than sex appeal, is siphoning off billions
of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs from the world's most
glamorous industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting massacred,'' said Jack De Govia, a motion
picture art director and chairman of California's Film and
Television Action Committee. ```Canada is hijacking the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Canadians can't seem to decide whether to crow
or cower as Hollywood roars its anger like MGM's famous lion.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, relax, Americans, Hollywood is still center of the
universe,'' said Mark DesRochers, a spokesman for the British
Columbia Film Commission. ``Our industry has grown quickly, grown a
lot, but compared to California, we're not even on the radar.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the closeup, Canada's movie modesty rings a trifle false.
</P>
<P>
   According to one recent study, conducted by the Cambridge-based
Monitor Company, Hollywood suffered $2.8 billion in lost production
expenditures in 1998, plus an estimated 60,000 jobs over the past
three years, to so-called runaway productions _ American films or
TV shows shot mostly in foreign places. Canada attracted the huge
majority of the runaways, more than 80 percent, worth some $2.2
billion last year, according to the study, commissioned by the
Screen Actors Guild and the Directors Guild of America.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials insist that figure is inflated.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Explosive increase
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But no one denies that the cross-border expansion of the film
industry during the 1990s has been explosive, and that Canada's
gain has been at least partly Hollywood's loss. Last year, for
instance, Ontario alone saw ``foreign film and TV production'' _
read: American _ jump by 57 percent, to $243 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Quebec, Travolta may be the star of ``Battlefield Earth'' _ a
big-money science-fiction epic _ but much of the cast and nearly
all of the production crew are Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for Hollywood, especially for the front-line
workers _ the technicians, heavy lifters, film editors, bit actors,
equipment operators, hairdressers, and others who form the real
backbone of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a significant, alarming shift away from
traditional production centers in the US to foreign locations,
especially Canada,'' said Rafe Greenlee, a spokesman for the Guild.
``This is a national problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, three of the top seven production centers for what is
seen as a quintessentially American industry are now in Canada:
Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal join Los Angeles, New York City,
Orlando, and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood trade magazines, Canada has become the new Evil
Empire. Typical of the accusations hurled across the 49th parallel
these days is the ad placed recently in Variety by a committee of
directors and actors: ``Canada is killing the television and
feature film industry in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   That's hyperbole, of course, from the world capital of hype. But
it's a sign of how much Hollywood is feeling the big chill from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts say Canada is just an easy scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major studios are cutting back on the number of films, there's
intense focus on costs, and jobs are being lost,'' said Jack Kyser,
chief economist for the Los Angeles Development Corp., a business
association. ``Canada is a part of Hollywood's problem. But just
one part.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, California politicians are rallying around
Hollywood's cause. ``We in the United States cannot permit the loss
of production jobs without a struggle,'' said Representative Howard
L. Berman, a California Democrat, in a letter to Canada's
ambassador to the United States, Raymond Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians see Hollywood's alarm as overwrought. And insulting.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kim Campbell, Canada's consul general in Los Angeles, ``The
world film industry is not an American industry. We don't see it as
something that belongs to California, and that Canada is not
entitled to a share.''
</P>
<P>
   And Andre Lafond, film commissioner of Montreal, referring to
Americans angered by Canada's emergence, said: ``They have a
feeling we're stealing something from them, and they are perhaps a
little right. We have a word for that in Quebec _ competition.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A smaller price tag
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never mind Travolta's assertion that shooting in Canada is
``fashionable.'' The real attraction is the bottom line. The
Canadian dollar has plummeted to historic lows against the
greenback. That means most everything comes cheaper across the
border, from snacks for the extras to trailers for the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Even more appealing are lavish tax credits, rebates, and other
incentives offered by Canada's federal government and most
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1-2 combination of the exchange rate and tax credits, a
director shooting in Canada can knock anywhere from 10 percent to
30 percent off production costs, compared with a similar shoot in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, cheapness isn't everything; otherwise movies would
all be made in Mexico City or Budapest. Canada also offers high
production values, first-rate infrastructure, proximity to the
United States, skilled film crews, actors who can pass for
Americans in smaller parts (Americans of all colors _ another bonus
is that Canada is as multi-ethnic as its neighbor), as well as
urban, suburban, and rural backgrounds that make convincing
stand-ins for Anywhere USA.
</P>
<P>
   How convincing? Did you catch ``Good Will Hunting''? The 1997
film, in which Matt Damon plays a tormented blue-collar math
genius, won praise for the way it depicted the authentic ``feel''
of metropolitan Boston, from Southie to Harvard Square. But while
the skyline and a few wide-angle street shots were filmed around
the city, the bulk of the movie was made in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the two most recent ``Spenser'' TV movies,
Boston's hard-nosed private eye is really sleuthing his way down
the mean streets of, um, Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hollywood has been pulling the same trick for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that the whole idea of movies? They make you believe a
reality that isn't real,'' said Lafond. ``If Montreal can be more
Boston than Boston, it's just movie magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Magic, sure, but Canada is getting more out of the deal than
fairy dust.
</P>
<P>
   In British Columbia alone, American filmmaking accounted for
more than 70 percent of Vancouver's $565 million TV and film
industry _ an industry projected to soar past $700 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Moviemaking has become so intensive, so pervasive, that
passersby in the country's three major cities hardly gawk anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In Montreal, there's even grumbling that American moviemakers
are much too thick on the ground, causing traffic congestion,
forcing up rents, and hogging all the seats at the fancier
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Montrealywood,'' wrote Josh Freed, a columnist for
the Montreal Gazette. ``American crews have already rented every
vacant house and cappuccino maker in town, and will soon be closing
a street near you . . .''

COMPANY SHEDS ITS IVORY TOWER IMAGE

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ For years Intermagnetics General Co. was run
more like a university than a business. There was plenty of time
for research and science for science's sake.
</P>
<P>
   The system worked. Intermagnetics is now a pioneer in the field
of superconductivity, making magnets, wires, gases and other
materials that can be used to conduct electricity almost without
resistance, and thus creating a more efficient flow of power.
</P>
<P>
   But the new chief executive officer, Glenn Epstein, wants to
make the company more market sensitive. Outside of the lucrative
MRI market, Intermagnetics hasn't made enough of an effort to find
the best commercial markets for its inventions. Instead, the
company took on too many low-paying research projects that didn't
result in a new product line or market area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge cultural shift for the company,'' said Epstein,
who joined Intermagnetics two years ago as president. Epstein was
brought on board with the notion that he would eventually succeed
Carl Rossner, the principal founder, as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company is a leader in making the magnets used in the
magnetic resonance imaging systems. Those are tubelike systems
employed in hospitals and clinics to obtain images of patients'
central nervous systems and in soft tissue areas. It's been posting
more than $100 million in sales and provides 600 jobs globally.
</P>
<P>
   Rossner, who is still chairman, turned 70 this year, and in June
turned over the chief executive title to Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, 41, brings a blend of engineering and management
experience to Intermagnetics. He was previously president of
competitor Oxford Instruments Nuclear Measurements Group in Oak
Ridge, Tenn., and had worked before that in both engineering and
management at the General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   He's changed the face of the company in a number of ways. Some
upper-level managers quit or were fired because they couldn't make
the transition to being a more market-oriented company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other employees were given the freedom to
dress casually on days when they were not meeting customers. Now
there are barbecues and employee appreciation days.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, the company is looking closely at a new market
for the future: the utilities that provide electricity across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   With the electric industry in the throes of deregulation,
utility companies are going to be looking for ways to deliver power
more cheaply and reliably, Epstein said. It's a natural conclusion
that some will want to buy superconducting materials, especially
since they are also facing the need to upgrade transmission
equipment installed more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you can make out of copper can be made out of
superconducting materials,'' Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   It will take time to develop, he acknowledged, perhaps till 2003
to get market acceptance of superconducting products.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a market the company can't ignore, he said. In the
meantime, the MRI market _ about 70 percent of the company's
revenues _ continues to grow at 10 to 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   More hospitals and clinics continue to install MRI systems, and
to replace older, larger systems with smaller, more efficient
models. Older systems are resold, often to hospitals in poorer
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein also is looking for improvement in the company's stock
price, which has stayed around $6, except for an unsustained and
unexplained spike to $13 a share earlier in the year.

Now, in a paper published in this week's Nature, biologists say
they prune the trees to separate them from surrounding trees, which
are occupied by several different, fiercer species of ants.

   MEMPHIS-MAYOR _ The way Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton sees it,
his main opponent in Thursday's election isn't even on the ballot.
City Council Chairman Joe Ford, considered the top challenger in a
crowded field, is just a figurehead for his big brother, former
U.S. Rep. Harold Ford Sr., according to Herenton. The animosity
between the outspoken Herenton, the city's first elected black
mayor, and the fiery Ford, patriarch of the city's most politically
powerful black family, is only part of the intrigue of this year's
mayoral election. Fifteen candidates are on the ballot in the
nonpartisan election, including professional wrestler Jerry ``The
King'' Lawler, who gained notoriety in 1982 when he slapped
comedian Andy Kaufman on ``Late Night With David Letterman,'' and
Pepper Rodgers, the former Georgia Tech football coach who led
Memphis' failed attempt to get an NFL franchise. (Konigsmark,

   KOCH-TRIAL _ TULSA, Okla. _ Testimony continues in the trial
that has become the latest legal battle between the warring

company led by two of his brothers _ one of them his twin, David,
also of Palm Beach. The brothers inherited a fortune generated by
the second-biggest privately held company in the United States,
Koch Industries of Wichita, Kan. The low-profile company operates
oil refineries and pipelines and engages in numerous other
businesses, from cattle to asphalt. It does not release earnings,
but published reports put its annual revenues at $30 billion to $35
billion. The trial is about largely technical issues _ how the
company measured oil it obtained under leases from the federal
government and American Indian tribes, particularly the Osage
Nation in Oklahoma. Neither side has said how much money is at
stake, but published reports say William alleges the shortages
amounted to millions of dollars. (Cohen, Palm Beach Daily News).

SILICON VALLEY BUSINESSMAN CONSIDERS SENATE BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron Unz, who
wrote a successful 1998 ballot initiative banning bilingual
education in California, says he will seek the Republican
nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Unz, 38, is the most prominent statewide figure to challenge
Feinstein so far. But Feinstein, with more than $2 million in the
bank, high popularity in voter polls and a tested campaign
operation, is a formidable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In his announcement Tuesday, Unz said he would spend $6 million
or less on the primary campaign, much of it from his own bank
account. The figure is the spending limit contained in a campaign
finance measure that is sponsoring on the statewide ballot in March
2000.
</P>
<P>
   He said the current system is corrupt to the core. ``Many of our
elections are bought and sold for cash payments,'' Unz said, ``and
the politicians do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Ray Haynes of Riverside and San Diego County
Supervisor Bill Horn, both conservatives, already have announced
they are running against Feinstein. U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell, a
moderate Republican from San Jose, is expected to announce soon.
</P>
<P>
   Kam Kuwata, Feinstein's campaign spokesman, said he takes every
candidate seriously, including Unz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest opponent is complacency,'' Kuwata said. ``We have
been dogged about setting up our shop and getting ready and raising
money and putting the structure in place. It doesn't really change
whether you put in Campbell, Horn, Haynes or anybody else. We know
what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when he was 32, Unz ran against then-Gov. Pete Wilson
during his re-election bid. At the time, Unz called himself a true
Republican and said Wilson was an ``ideological cross-dressing
Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Unz opposes abortion rights, saying abortion should be
restricted only in cases of incest, rape or when the life of the
mother is threatened. He doesn't believe in strict gun control and
thinks gays and lesbian should not have ``special rights.'' Unz
said he would have voted to convict President Clinton if he had
been in the Senate during the presidential impeachment trial
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unz, a graduate of Harvard University, studied quantum
gravitation under Stephen Hawking at Cambridge University and began
but did not complete a doctoral program in theoretical physics at
Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he took his first job, at First Boston Bank on Wall
Street, and on the resume he submitted he listed his IQ as 214.
</P>
<P>
   Unz made millions after co-founding Wall Street Analytics Inc.,
a Palo Alto software company.
</P>
<P>
   Unz spent $750,000 on Proposition 227, last year's initiative to
ban bilingual education in California, just as the state GOP was
struggling to attract Hispanic and other minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   Unz could face his most serious challenge in the primary against
Campbell.

COOKBOOK SAYS WE'VE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT BLANDNESS ITSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Austin is as close as Texas gets to having a Berkeley, Calif.
The Texas capital is where all the remaining men with long hair
live; it is the only place where people two-step to rhythm and
blues, and where crushed-straw cowboy hats can be worn with
low-quartered shoes.
</P>
<P>
   No tennies with colored socks after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   There are free spirits in Austin, but not as many as there used
to be. You can still find a few down on Sixth Street. Or you can
travel out toward Lake Travis and the limestone house that serves
as the restaurant hideout for Jeff Blank and Jay Moore. Blank owns
the restaurant _ Hudson's on the Bend _ and Moore is its executive
chef.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have developed a reputation for in-your-face food
preparation, specializing in use of the grill, and high-octane
taste.
</P>
<P>
   They have also been known to set their toques on fire. No,
really, they actually set their big chef's hats aflame. It is kind
of a PR gimmick, but it works. The two smiling pyrotechnicians are
on the cover of their new cookbook _ shoulder to shoulder, burning
hat to burning hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooking Fearlessly, Recipes and Other Adventures From Hudson's
on the Bend,'' (Fearless Press, $32.95) is a delightfully clever
and interesting cookbook. ``Sometimes you don't know if you've gone
too far, until you've gone too far,'' it advises.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``Some people march to the beat of a different drummer,
other people tango.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is bold and colorful, the way the chefs want their
readers to cook. They even add to each recipe the name of a
specific song, or piece of music that will help you get in the
right mood.
</P>
<P>
   Those selections, we're told, are the work of a
``gastromusicologist.'' That's something you'll find only in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   There are several pretentious aspects of the book. Hudson's on
the Bend is well-known for its exotic meats, so the chefs felt
compelled to add recipes like wild boar schnitzel, and elk or
caribou backstrap stuffed with chorizo.
</P>
<P>
   Such items are not easily accessible at your local Piggly
Wiggly. In fairness, they do offer substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few recipes that just sound pretentious: toasted
pinon-coriander crusted goat cheese atop garden greens tossed in a
poblano-almond-lime vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooking Fearlessly'' does come back to earth with recipes such
as rib-eye steak in a bock beer marinade, and green chile corn
crawfish soup. They sound fantastic and promise jam-packed flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The book is also instructional. Especially in its use of the
cook's body parts to judge the doneness of meats.
</P>
<P>
   Don't poke the meat, or slice it open to see how well-done it
is, the authors warn. The juices will run and the meat will dry.
Learn to poke it with your fingers. Compare the firmness of the
meat with points on your face.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a `straight face' (no smiling or you'll be overdone),
touch your cheek _ that'll be `rare,' '' the advice goes.
</P>
<P>
   Touch your chin; that's medium rare. The end of your nose is
medium; the area just above the bridge of your nose on your
forehead is medium-well.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of your shoe is well-done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooking Fearlessly's'' greatest value is that it doesn't take
itself too seriously. In the introduction, the chefs explain:
``Cooking Fearlessly is about cookin' with a boogie back beat. The
mood is upbeat and festive with recipes that beg to party and which
make the chef look good as well as the food.... Cooking Fearlessly
is about trusting your instincts, breaking the rules, using your
hands, and inventing new tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's one of the ``Cooking Fearless'' recipes. It is for corn
pudding, one of the restaurant's most popular dishes. The batter
can be made a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Just
give it a whisk before putting it in a greased and floured
casserole dish at baking time. One of the beauties of this recipe
is that it is flexible and can be modified with various
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   CORN PUDDING
</P>
<P>
   Serves 10-12
</P>
<P>
   Dry mix:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   Wet mix:
</P>
<P>
   6 whole eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 stick butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 8-ounce can cream-style corn
</P>
<P>
   Veggie mix:
</P>
<P>
   1 medium poblano pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 medium red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 Anaheim pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh-cut corn
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine all dry ingredients in a bowl. Mix well and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a second bowl, whisk the eggs until blended, then add melted
butter, cream, and cream-style corn.
</P>
<P>
   Blend the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients using a wire
whisk.
</P>
<P>
   Clean all three peppers, discarding the seeds and stems. Dice
into 1/4-inch pieces. Add fresh-cut corn kernels and the diced
peppers to the mixing bowl. Blend together.
</P>
<P>
   Coat a medium-size casserole dish with butter or light vegetable
oil and dust with flour.
</P>
<P>

QUINTESSENTIAL VOICE OF NPR GETS A MORNING RUSH FROM THE NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BERNADETTE FAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bob Edwards is a grown man with a bedtime of 6
p.m. That is so he can rise in the dark five days a week to be in a
Washington studio by 2 a.m. to host the early-morning radio news
program ``Morning Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   With his wave of graying hair and nondescript tie, he doesn't
look like a news anchor. Yet when he opens his mouth to speak, out
comes the familiar voice that National Public Radio listeners have
been hearing in the morning five days a week for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a disappointment,'' Edwards, 52, says with a
laugh. ``People have an idea of what you should look like, and you
should never mess with that. They should never take my picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who was recently in San Francisco to celebrate the 20th
anniversary of the radio show, is usually on the other side of the
table _ asking the questions.
</P>
<P>
   But he says, ``I love talking about `Morning Edition.' It's my
life for 20 years.'' And, yes, he says, the schedule is getting
old; the schedule was old after the first week. So what gets him
out of bed in the middle of the night when sensible people are just
turning off late-night TV?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love doing the program,'' Edwards says. ``It never gets old.
The news changes every day. And I'm doing what I've always wanted
to do: Be on the radio with a national audience. That never gets
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking news never gets old, either. ``The adrenaline is almost
intoxicating,'' he says of the challenge of jockeying a breaking
news story on live radio. He recalls the morning in 1981 when
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't leave the chair until noon, except when Carl (Kasell)
was doing the newscast and I could sneak a quick bathroom break. By
noon, when `Morning Edition' ended, they still hadn't confirmed
(Sadat) was dead. They were very tight with information because, in
Cairo, they didn't know whether this was a revolution, a coup,
whatever, so they weren't being terribly forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Another big day was the 1981 presidential inauguration of Ronald
Reagan, coupled with the release of American hostages in Iran:
``Two parallel stories intersecting right as we go off the air, and
still no resolution. We still didn't have the hostages out. But
that was a hell of a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was drafted into the job at the inception of the show.
He had been hosting NPR's afternoon news show, ``All Things
Considered,'' when he was asked to step into the a.m. show for 30
days. But a funny thing happened in those early-morning hours: He
started enjoying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a challenge to make something of this morning program
that would be as good, as professional, as well-received as `All
Things Considered.' I said, what the hell. Let's roll the dice.
Let's see if this can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And happen it did. ``Morning Edition'' has the most listeners of
any program on NPR. And in large part, this is because of the
nondescript guy with the floppy hair and the voice now familiar to
the show's roughly 8 million listeners.
</P>
<P>
   His calm, wry tones have guided us through tragedy and chaos:
``That's my job, to be calm, or to sound that way when there's
chaos going on amongst the staff, trying to bring in a last-minute
report and people are running around, cussing each other out,
tripping and falling, and I've got the microphone. I'm just
`Bob.'''
</P>
<P>
   Part of being ``just Bob'' is bringing listeners something
called, in NPR parlance, the return. It's the 23-second happy news
spot that signals the return to ``Morning Edition'' from the
affiliates. As Edwards says, ``There's so much death, destruction,
famine, pestilence, war that you've got to lighten the load for
people once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   One spot of relief over the years, of course, was the Friday
chat with the late baseball announcer Red Barber. Edwards turned
his years of talks with Barber into the 1993 book, ``Fridays with
Red.'' The easy repartee between the two on everything from sports
to camellias didn't start that way. Edwards remembers many a
white-knuckled chat, on his end, until he learned to get in the
groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red would throw me curveballs. He would ask me questions. You
spend a lifetime not having opinions, and he'd ask me about my
family and now I've got to censor myself before I answer _ what is
going to make my wife angry? But it was great fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an interviewer who's used to doing news interviews, I
wasn't in control,'' he says with a laugh. ``And when you're not in
control in a live radio broadcast, it can be a panicky thing. It
took me probably a couple of years before I said, `To hell with
that. Let's have some fun.' I thought the listener was enjoying it,
though I thought probably the listener enjoyed train wrecks, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, his favorite interviews have been those that
captured the spark of spontaneity, ``great talkers'' such as Lauren
Bacall, George Shearing, Dave Brubeck. Some of his least-favorite
interviews have been with politicians. This could have something to
do with one of his worst moments: When a Minnesota senator (now a
``former senator,'' Edwards says pointedly) put Edwards on hold in
the middle of an on-air telephone interview: ``It was bizarre _ I'm
thinking, `Did he really do that?' so I'm saying, `Senator.
Senator.' And then he was back. It wasn't very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Just long enough to get the adrenaline pumping.

<P>
   Joan Wulff handles a fishing rod with grace and explosive power.
In 1960, she set the women's unofficial world record for distance
casting _ a blistering 161 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Now the grande dame of fly-fishing at age 72, Wulff has not lost
her touch. Standing on the banks of the Beaverkill River near her
fabled fishing school in New York's Catskill mountains, she raises
and points the tip of an 8-foot rod just over her shoulder, gives a
sudden backward snap of the wrist, and sends 40 feet of the line
sailing straight back behind her.
</P>
<P>
   As the line hangs in the air, she drops her arm down toward her
waist. Then she launches the line forward, depositing a feathery
fly silently out on the water exactly where she wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do it right,'' Wulff says, ``the fly shoots by your
head like a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   While other fishermen lazily dangle bait in front of hungry
fish, flyfishers sweat over strategy and technique, struggling to
imitate with rods, lines and lures the delicate landing of a fly on
the river's surface.
</P>
<P>
   To catch a fish, a fly-fisher sends out a wispy lure attached to
an almost invisible 7- to 15-foot-long leader, which is in turn
attached to a thicker and much longer braided Dacron line.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is launching the virtually weightless fly to a distant
spot with deadeye accuracy. The thicker line must hit the water
first, allowing the leader and fly to then gently alight upon the
water just the way an insect might settle on a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is to make it all look as natural as possible to the
fish so they'll bite,'' Wulff says.
</P>
<P>
   Natural, of course, doesn't mean easy. In bait fishing, a sinker
adds heft and a fish-scaring splash to a cast. By contrast,
propelling an ultralight fly the way Wulff does is akin to pitching
a cotton ball at major-league speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The only weight resides in the nylon line itself, which uncoils
from a reel during the cast. The relatively small backward and
forward motion of the fly rod sends the line streaking through the
air as far as 236 feet, the current world record.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have yet to come up with a comprehensive explanation
of how the simple motion of a cast propels a line and attached lure
such a great distance. Part of the answer lies in momentum, the
product of an object's mass and velocity. Except for gravity and
drag from air friction, momentum is conserved in any interaction of
objects.
</P>
<P>
   During a cast, the fly-fisher achieves peak energy in the
flick-of-the-wrist stage, which ``gives you all the momentum you're
going to get,'' Jeff Kommers says.
</P>
<P>
   A physicist, Kommers kept fellow Ph.D. candidates at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology entertained with his failed
attempts to come up with a mathematical equation for the process.
</P>
<P>
   Following this moment of peak energy, the arm's snapping force
passes through the rod to the flexible tip, which then wriggles
back and forth. This motion translates the force from the arm to
the speed of the line and fly.
</P>
<P>
   Because momentum _ created by the arm, absorbed by the rod, and
passed into the thin fishing line _ must be conserved, the tiny
mass of the line achieves tremendous velocity, ``especially at the
end of the string,'' Kommers says.
</P>
<P>
   Bullwhips operate under the same principle as the fly line.
Energy travels from the arm to the thick end of the whip all the
way down to the tapered tip, which accelerates wildly as the mass
decreases. The characteristic crack of the whip results from the
tip literally breaking the sound barrier and producing a concussion
of sound waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' Kommers says, ``fly-fishermen aren't interested
in making mini sonic booms when they try to catch fish,'' and they
can't _ no matter how forcefully they cast. The leader and the
fuzzy fly at the end of the line create enough air drag to slow
things down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest velocities I calculated were about 600 feet per
second,'' Kommers says, ``and that's quite a bit less than the
speed of sound,'' which is 1,070 feet per second.
</P>
<P>
   The type of rod also affects the speed and distance a line
travels. Salespeople call some rods fast and others slow in
describing how far they might cast a fly.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Spolek, a mechanical engineering professor from Oregon's
Portland State University, set up an experiment to figure out just
what these vague terms meant.
</P>
<P>
   He hauled a bundle of rods into a darkened gymnasium, set up a
strobe light, and took a sequence of photographs to examine the
movement of the rod and the line during the forward cast. Rods have
to be stiff enough to handle the lunges of a caught fish, but
flexible enough to effectively transfer energy from the arm to the
line during a cast. This requirement means that the tip wiggles
quickly back and forth, which Spolek called the rod's frequency.
</P>
<P>
   In another experiment, he counted how many times the tip of each
rod moved back and forth per second, and this number, he
discovered, allowed him to predict which rods would cast the
farthest. High frequency gives you a faster tip speed, creating
swifter line speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that allows you to cast a long way,'' Spolek says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his research, Spolek now has a good understanding
of the separate parts of the cast _ the arm movements, the tip
wriggle and the line flying.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kommers, however, he has yet to come up with a tidy
equation that combines the multiple variables, including the drag
of friction based on the size of the fly or the length of the
leader and the possible line lengths released during the forward
part of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't underestimate how urgent the need for this is,''
Spolek says, who dreams of taking a year's sabbatical for further
study of the problem. ``I mean, who cares about finding a unified
theory of the universe? What we need is a unified theory of
fly-fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Joan Wulff offers her own explanation of how
the fly cast works: ``It's all in the arm.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Nefertiti had large thighs, a decidedly fertile-shaped belly,
and ample hips accentuated by the smallness of her chest.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt in the 14th century B.C., she was a paragon _ her name
meant ``the beauty has come'' _ and yet Nefertiti did not rely on
her natural looks alone. She applied makeup in bold strokes,
outlining her almond-shaped eyes in black and darkening her brows.
So did her husband the pharaoh.
</P>
<P>
   From the pyramid-builders of the Old Kingdom (2700 B.C. to 2200
B.C.) to Nefertiti and her son-in-law Tutankhamen of the New
Kingdom (1554 B.C. to 1080 B.C.) the ancient Egyptians pampered
their bodies _ from massaging themselves with scented oils to
battling body odor by mashing little balls of incense-scented
porridge into their armpits. They even applied the blood of black
animals to strands of telltale gray.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they cared for their eyes _ so much so, it now seems,
that they went to the trouble of inventing chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, chemists at the Louvre Museum and at L'Oreal, the
French cosmetics manufacturer, recently analyzed eye-makeup
residues preserved in tiny alabaster vases and hollowed-out reeds
dating back to the second millennium B.C.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered that the black or gray makeup _ which the
Egyptians called mesdemet but which later acquired the name kohl
from the Arabic _ contained compounds nearly nonexistent in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient chemists, the researchers say, must have painstakingly
synthesized these substances.
</P>
<P>
   It has been known for more than a century that the main
component of mesdemet was galena, a dark sulfide of lead extracted
by the Egyptians from a mine near the Red Sea. Sometimes they
lightened the galena by mixing in cerussite, a white carbonate of
lead obtained from the same place.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's where the analysis stopped,'' says Philippe Walter
of the Laboratory of the Museums of France. ``The older studies
were very superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Louvre _ his lab is in the basement _ Walter had no
shortage of material for a more probing analysis. The museum owns
roughly 500 ancient Egyptian vessels that were used for toiletries
of one kind or another.
</P>
<P>
   Some arrived in France as booty from Napoleon's ill-fated
invasion of 1798 (its one positive legacy was the scholarly
discipline of Egyptology; a soldier in Napolean's army brought back
the Rosetta stone).
</P>
<P>
   Many of the vessels still contain residues of their original
contents.
</P>
<P>
   But the Louvre's Egyptologists allowed Walter and his colleagues
to take no more than a single cubic millimeter from each of 49
containers. That made the work rather challenging.
</P>
<P>
   The L'Oreal chemists discovered that the Egyptians made mesdemet
creamy by mixing in nearly the same proportion of fat _ between 7
and 10 percent _ that's found in most eye makeup today.
</P>
<P>
   While L'Oreal uses vegetable fat, the Egyptians favored the fat
of animals, possibly geese.
</P>
<P>
   Their choice of minerals was even more surprising. Examining the
powdery residues with an electron microscope and X-rays generated
by a synchrotron particle accelerator, Walter and his colleague
Pauline Martinetto discovered that mesdemet usually contained two
components besides galena and cerussite: laurionite and phosgenite.
They, too, are lead compounds, but contain chlorine as well.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Egyptians certainly knew how to cook, so it may seem
natural that they should have mastered other types of chemistry as
well. But creating these cosmetic solutions required a very
different process.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make laurionite and phosgenite, they couldn't use fire and
high temperatures,'' Walter says. ``Those compounds are not stable
above 170 degrees Celsius. So they had to use much gentler methods
involving wet chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   The exact recipe the Egyptians followed has not been found, but
a millennium or two later the Greeks created the same compounds by
first heating galena to drive off the sulfur and form lead oxide,
and then mixing in water and salt while maintaining a low
temperature. Adding water several times a day for 40 days or so
keeps the PH neutral and yields laurionite.
</P>
<P>
   Using a little ground-up natron produces phosgenite.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been a lot of trouble for the Egyptians _
especially because the results would not have been visible. Both
laurionite and phosgenite are white. If the goal was to lighten the
galena, why didn't the Egyptians simply use white cerussite?
</P>
<P>
   Yet most of the mesdemet samples Walter and his colleagues
examined contained the two synthetic compounds as well. What was
the point?
</P>
<P>
   Walter thinks mesdemet must have been medicinal as well as
cosmetic. The Greeks and Romans treated eye diseases with
laurionite and phosgenite, he says, and the Egyptians might very
well have used the compounds for medical purposes too.
</P>
<P>
   Now that lead compounds are known to be toxic _ at least when
ingested _ pharmaceutical researchers aren't interested in
experimenting with them.
</P>
<P>
   But Walter is sure the Egyptian chemists must have been onto
something worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time believing that several civilizations over
3,000 years would have used these substances if they only had a
placebo effect,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from statues of them, says Lise Manniche, an
Egyptologist at the University of Copenhagen, rich Egyptian women
sometimes powdered their faces white with cerussite. On occasion
they may have applied red ocher rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstick too: The Turin papyrus, a kind of Egyptian Kamasutra,
shows a woman painting her lips with a brush.
</P>
<P>
   The famous bust of Nefertiti also has painted lips. So far no
one has ever found a sample of ancient Egyptian lipstick, but
Walter intends to try; there are some vases in the Louvre
collection, he says, whose brownish contents may once have been a
fetching red.
</P>
<P>
   Nefertiti's lips were full and perfect. And though by today's
harsh standards she was plump in places, she also had exquisite
cheekbones and those fabulous eyes. No doubt she was aware of these
assets.
</P>
<P>
   As she aged (it is reasonable to speculate), her desire to
highlight them may only have increased.
</P>
<P>
   Some Egyptologists think her husband, Akhenaton, lost interest
in her (or was it she in him?) and started hanging out in a
separate palace with its own harem.
</P>
<P>
   The essentials of the human life cycle haven't changed. The
Egyptians, as Walter says, were surely driven by some of the same
motives that impel us to use cosmetics: in youth, the desire to
seduce; in later years, the desire to forestall age.
</P>
<P>
   And for the ancient Egyptians, these motives extended to the
grave. That's why perfume and makeup were indispensable funerary
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They enhanced the atmosphere,'' Manniche says.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetics were a ticket to the cosmos: They promoted sex after
death as a way of achieving eternal life.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to think of a better excuse for inventing makeup _ or
chemistry for that matter.

<P>
   Nefertiti had large thighs, a decidedly fertile-shaped belly,
and ample hips accentuated by the smallness of her chest.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt in the 14th century B.C., she was a paragon _ her name
meant ``the beauty has come'' _ and yet Nefertiti did not rely on
her natural looks alone. She applied makeup in bold strokes,
outlining her almond-shaped eyes in black and darkening her brows.
So did her husband the pharaoh.
</P>
<P>
   From the pyramid-builders of the Old Kingdom (2700 B.C. to 2200
B.C.) to Nefertiti and her son-in-law Tutankhamen of the New
Kingdom (1554 B.C. to 1080 B.C.) the ancient Egyptians pampered
their bodies _ from massaging themselves with scented oils to
battling body odor by mashing little balls of incense-scented
porridge into their armpits. They even applied the blood of black
animals to strands of telltale gray.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they cared for their eyes _ so much so, it now seems,
that they went to the trouble of inventing chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, chemists at the Louvre Museum and at L'Oreal, the
French cosmetics manufacturer, recently analyzed eye-makeup
residues preserved in tiny alabaster vases and hollowed-out reeds
dating back to the second millennium B.C.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered that the black or gray makeup _ which the
Egyptians called mesdemet but which later acquired the name kohl
from the Arabic _ contained compounds nearly nonexistent in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient chemists, the researchers say, must have painstakingly
synthesized these substances.
</P>
<P>
   It has been known for more than a century that the main
component of mesdemet was galena, a dark sulfide of lead extracted
by the Egyptians from a mine near the Red Sea. Sometimes they
lightened the galena by mixing in cerussite, a white carbonate of
lead obtained from the same place.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's where the analysis stopped,'' says Philippe Walter
of the Laboratory of the Museums of France. ``The older studies
were very superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Louvre _ his lab is in the basement _ Walter had no
shortage of material for a more probing analysis. The museum owns
roughly 500 ancient Egyptian vessels that were used for toiletries
of one kind or another.
</P>
<P>
   Some arrived in France as booty from Napoleon's ill-fated
invasion of 1798 (its one positive legacy was the scholarly
discipline of Egyptology; a soldier in Napolean's army brought back
the Rosetta stone).
</P>
<P>
   Many of the vessels still contain residues of their original
contents.
</P>
<P>
   But the Louvre's Egyptologists allowed Walter and his colleagues
to take no more than a single cubic millimeter from each of 49
containers. That made the work rather challenging.
</P>
<P>

GOVERNOR VETOES BILL ON RACIAL PROFILING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATTHEW YI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Angry elected officials said it was ``racist''
for Gov. Gray Davis to veto legislation that would have required
police officers to track the race of motorists they stop.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling has become a prominent national issue this year
with several states and the U.S. Congress considering bills to
track it.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have charged that a disproportionate number of minority
motorists, especially blacks and Hispanics, are pulled over by the
police on minor traffic violations or even without cause in hopes
of finding evidence of crime. This practice of targeting minorities
is known as racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   While Davis, who is a Democrat, vetoed the bill by Sen. Kevin
Murray, D-Los Angeles, at least two other states, Connecticut and
North Carolina, have passed their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the bill would have required officers who make
traffic stops to record the race or ethnicity of the driver; the
reason for the stop; whether there was a search; and whether there
was an arrest, citation or warning issued.
</P>
<P>
   More than three dozen county and city officials, business
leaders and representatives of minority organizations, gathered at
the steps of the Alameda County Courthouse on Tuesday to denounce
the veto.
</P>
<P>
   The governor had said ``there is no evidence that this practice
is taking place statewide'' and that such sweeping legislation
would be too costly and would place a heavy burden on the police.
</P>
<P>
   But those reasons are unwarranted and poor excuses for not
signing the bill, officials here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a racist action,'' said Alameda County Supervisor Mary
King. ``In my experience, those who participate in racist actions
are racist, and he has an opportunity to prove that he is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Keith Carson also blasted Davis, adding that he would
not forget the governor's veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Governor Davis comes into our community, we're
going to ask him the hard questions. Why did he veto this
legislation? Why has he been so inactive ... in trying to bridge
the gap of racial divide?'' Carson said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said it was ``laughable'' to
say that the governor is racist because he vetoed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This governor has spent his career defending the rights of all
individuals, be they women, minority or anyone else,'' Bustamante
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Davis believed it would not be appropriate to force
every police agency in the state to collect the data when they may
not have the resources to carry out the mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather, he has ordered the law enforcement agency under his
care, the California Highway Patrol, to look at the issue,''
Bustamante said. ``If local law enforcement agencies want to do it,
there's no reason why they can't do it.''

   MONTREAL _ The signs rerouting traffic and warning off
pedestrians have become nearly ubiquitous in this French-flavored
city of gray granite and silver church bells: ``Tournage
Cinematographique'' _ film crew at work.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta is in town, doing ``Battlefield Earth.'' Bruce Willis
has come and gone for ``The Whole Nine Yards.'' And Eddie Murphy's
``Pluto Nash'' is in the wings. All headed for a theater near you,
though you won't have a clue that French Canada is the real setting
for these ostensibly American flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Look out, Los Angeles: There's yet another ``Hollywood North''
looming across the border. Montreal is suddenly hot, vying with
archrivals Toronto and Vancouver as a Canadian shooting set for
anyplace _ standing in for gaslit Manhattan circa 1890, the tawdry
gaming pits of present-day Las Vegas, even a far-future Earth
occupied by a plundering alien race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fashionable to do American movies in Canada,'' Travolta
told a Montreal news conference. ``I don't register a
controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perk up your ears, John. The warning drums are thudding loud in
Tinseltown, and the natives are astir.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's soaring film fortunes come just as the real Hollywood
is getting seriously rattled by the stunning northward flight of
film and television productions over the past decade, mainly to
British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, several thousand California film folk _ directors,
actors, camera operators, set designers, lighting technicians,
grips, and gofers _ thronged down Hollywood Boulevard waving Old
Glory and jeering the Maple Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring Hollywood home!'' roared the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Home from Canada, that is. This stolid northern neighbor, better
known for salmon fishing than sex appeal, is siphoning off billions
of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs from the world's most
glamorous industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting massacred,'' said Jack De Govia, a motion
picture art director and chairman of California's Film and
Television Action Committee. ```Canada is hijacking the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Canadians can't seem to decide whether to crow
or cower as Hollywood roars its anger like MGM's famous lion.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, relax, Americans, Hollywood is still center of the
universe,'' said Mark DesRochers, a spokesman for the British
Columbia Film Commission. ``Our industry has grown quickly, grown a
lot, but compared to California, we're not even on the radar.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the closeup, Canada's movie modesty rings a trifle false.
</P>
<P>
   According to one recent study, conducted by the Cambridge-based
Monitor Company, Hollywood suffered $2.8 billion in lost production
expenditures in 1998, plus an estimated 60,000 jobs over the past
three years, to so-called runaway productions _ American films or
TV shows shot mostly in foreign places. Canada attracted the huge
majority of the runaways, more than 80 percent, worth some $2.2
billion last year, according to the study, commissioned by the
Screen Actors Guild and the Directors Guild of America.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials insist that figure is inflated.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Explosive increase
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But no one denies that the cross-border expansion of the film
industry during the 1990s has been explosive, and that Canada's
gain has been at least partly Hollywood's loss. Last year, for
instance, Ontario alone saw ``foreign film and TV production'' _
read: American _ jump by 57 percent, to $243 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Quebec, Travolta may be the star of ``Battlefield Earth'' _ a
big-money science-fiction epic _ but much of the cast and nearly
all of the production crew are Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for Hollywood, especially for the front-line
workers _ the technicians, heavy lifters, film editors, bit actors,
equipment operators, hairdressers, and others who form the real
backbone of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a significant, alarming shift away from
traditional production centers in the US to foreign locations,
especially Canada,'' said Rafe Greenlee, a spokesman for the Guild.
``This is a national problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, three of the top seven production centers for what is
seen as a quintessentially American industry are now in Canada:
Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal join Los Angeles, New York City,
Orlando, and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood trade magazines, Canada has become the new Evil
Empire. Typical of the accusations hurled across the 49th parallel
these days is the ad placed recently in Variety by a committee of
directors and actors: ``Canada is killing the television and
feature film industry in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   That's hyperbole, of course, from the world capital of hype. But
it's a sign of how much Hollywood is feeling the big chill from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts say Canada is just an easy scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major studios are cutting back on the number of films, there's
intense focus on costs, and jobs are being lost,'' said Jack Kyser,
chief economist for the Los Angeles Development Corp., a business
association. ``Canada is a part of Hollywood's problem. But just
one part.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, California politicians are rallying around
Hollywood's cause. ``We in the United States cannot permit the loss
of production jobs without a struggle,'' said Representative Howard
L. Berman, a California Democrat, in a letter to Canada's
ambassador to the United States, Raymond Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians see Hollywood's alarm as overwrought. And insulting.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kim Campbell, Canada's consul general in Los Angeles, ``The
world film industry is not an American industry. We don't see it as
something that belongs to California, and that Canada is not
entitled to a share.''
</P>
<P>
   And Andre Lafond, film commissioner of Montreal, referring to
Americans angered by Canada's emergence, said: ``They have a
feeling we're stealing something from them, and they are perhaps a
little right. We have a word for that in Quebec _ competition.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A smaller price tag
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never mind Travolta's assertion that shooting in Canada is
``fashionable.'' The real attraction is the bottom line. The
Canadian dollar has plummeted to historic lows against the
greenback. That means most everything comes cheaper across the
border, from snacks for the extras to trailers for the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Even more appealing are lavish tax credits, rebates, and other
incentives offered by Canada's federal government and most
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1-2 combination of the exchange rate and tax credits, a
director shooting in Canada can knock anywhere from 10 percent to
30 percent off production costs, compared with a similar shoot in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, cheapness isn't everything; otherwise movies would
all be made in Mexico City or Budapest. Canada also offers high
production values, first-rate infrastructure, proximity to the
United States, skilled film crews, actors who can pass for
Americans in smaller parts (Americans of all colors _ another bonus
is that Canada is as multi-ethnic as its neighbor), as well as
urban, suburban, and rural backgrounds that make convincing
stand-ins for Anywhere USA.
</P>
<P>
   How convincing? Did you catch ``Good Will Hunting''? The 1997
film, in which Matt Damon plays a tormented blue-collar math
genius, won praise for the way it depicted the authentic ``feel''
of metropolitan Boston, from Southie to Harvard Square. But while
the skyline and a few wide-angle street shots were filmed around
the city, the bulk of the movie was made in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the two most recent ``Spenser'' TV movies,
Boston's hard-nosed private eye is really sleuthing his way down
the mean streets of, um, Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hollywood has been pulling the same trick for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that the whole idea of movies? They make you believe a
reality that isn't real,'' said Lafond. ``If Montreal can be more
Boston than Boston, it's just movie magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Magic, sure, but Canada is getting more out of the deal than
fairy dust.
</P>
<P>
   In British Columbia alone, American filmmaking accounted for
more than 70 percent of Vancouver's $565 million TV and film
industry _ an industry projected to soar past $700 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Moviemaking has become so intensive, so pervasive, that
passersby in the country's three major cities hardly gawk anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In Montreal, there's even grumbling that American moviemakers
are much too thick on the ground, causing traffic congestion,
forcing up rents, and hogging all the seats at the fancier
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Montrealywood,'' wrote Josh Freed, a columnist for
the Montreal Gazette. ``American crews have already rented every
vacant house and cappuccino maker in town, and will soon be closing
a street near you . . .''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ever since molecular biologists figured out how to
clone genes, the concept of ``fixing'' malfunctioning genes to cure
disease has been a siren call for science.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a promising start, there were no quick or complete
cures.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had a lot of unrealistic expectations for gene
therapy,'' said Dr. Bonnie Ramsey, director of the Cystic Fibrosis
Center at Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in
Seattle and co-director of the Gene Therapy Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assumed the first time they put a vector (carrying a
new gene) in, there would be a cure. But like any new area of
research, it takes several permutations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, a group of Seattle scientists has found a way to slip new
genes into cells at a much higher rate, fixing one of the key flaws
in early approaches. A few patients are undergoing experimental
therapy trials which, if successful, could be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle scientists, from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center, the University of Washington, Children's and the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center in Seattle, are in the vanguard of
researchers around the country who are trying to resurrect the
early promise of gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The first gene therapy trials were conducted in 1990 on two
patients with a genetic immune disorder called adenosine deaminase
deficiency (ADA), also known as the ``boy in the bubble'' disease.
Patients with ADA have a genetic defect that shuts down their
immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers were able to insert a new copy of the corrective
gene into a significant number of cells in the patients, and bring
about therapeutic improvement in one of them. But not enough of the
enzyme was produced to effect a cure, said A. Dusty Miller, a
virologist at Fred Hutchinson and a UW professor of molecular
biology who worked on that early trial. Miller pioneered some of
the altered viral particles used for delivering genes. Since then,
gene therapy has produced many more false starts, but no cures,
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointments have driven gene therapy from the headlines
and researchers back to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hutch team's work, using a disarmed virus as a kind of
Trojan horse to get more ``good'' genes into the cells, could
provide the push that gene therapy needs to become reality. Some of
the most exciting work is being done in Dr. Hans-Peter Kiem's lab
at Fred Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   By refining the process of infecting cells with one of Miller's
viral vectors created to deliver the new genes, researchers have
been able to get genes transferred into 10 percent to 20 percent of
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``That range is sufficient (to correct) for many genetic
diseases,'' said Kiem, an oncologist and assistant professor of
medicine at the University of Washington. In the past,
gene-transfer rates were less than 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 10 to 100 times better than it was three to four years
ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The technique borrows the ability of a ``retrovirus'' to insert
its own DNA into the genome of a host cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viruses have evolved over millions of years to do this job,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists use the viral ``envelope'' to deliver the new genes
to the cells by removing the viral replication genes and replacing
them with the genes they want transferred into the cell. They've
also perfected new techniques for getting more of the virus to
infect the target cells.
</P>
<P>
   A new trial using those techniques on patients with leukocyte
adherence deficiency, a fatal genetic blood disorder, currently is
under way in Seattle. If it proves successful, that could help
expedite trials in other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at other diseases that can be corrected by
replacing a single gene,'' Kiem said. Such diseases could include
hemophilia, a bleeding disorder; Fanconi anemia, a DNA repair
defect that predisposes patients to cancer; Gaucher's disease, a
disorder that affects the body's ability to process fat; and a
number of other immune deficiency diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, single-gene disorders could yield insights that will
help scientists tackle more complex diseases, such as cancer or
cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, it will help us deal with diseases with more than
one gene,'' Kiem said.
</P>
<P>
   Many questions remain, however. Researchers are watching the
current trial to see whether patients develop immune reactions to
proteins made by the new genes. They also want to see the
population of corrected cells increase over time as the cells
carrying the new genes divide and multiply.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the death recently of a young man who died four
days after participating in a gene therapy experiment at the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia may weaken support for
the technique.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Gelsinger, an 18-year-old who died Sept. 17, had received
an infusion into his liver of altered viral particles carrying
genes intended to correct a rare metabolic defect. Other patients
treated in the clinical trial so far have done well, with some
reporting improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's defect, called ornithine transcarbamylase, was not
life-threatening and it had been controlled through diet and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question this will put a damper on gene therapy for
a while,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   But any invasive therapy, even routine day surgeries, carries
risk, he said. The primary obstacles in gene therapy have been
mostly technical and not due to any unusual safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Early disappointments surrounding gene therapy have plenty of
precedent in the history of medicine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery was first attempted without the benefit of anesthesia or
sterile technique. It took decades to perfect the bone marrow
transplant, now one of the most powerful treatments for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, gene therapy could deliver the same kinds of payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are already exploring other vectors, besides
retroviruses, to widen the range of diseases that could be
addressed by gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Targeted Genetics Corp., a Seattle-based biotechnology company,
for example, is developing gene therapy approaches to cystic
fibrosis and cancer that use different vector systems.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are hoping to
start new trials for muscular dystrophy and hemophilia within a few
months. Groups at the University of Indiana, Harvard University and
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are gearing up for
gene therapy studies in other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Work is even under way at the Salk Institute for Biological
Studies in La Jolla, Calif., to harness HIV, a virus known for its
aggressive invasion of a wide range of cells, as a gene-delivery
tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand everything right now,'' Miller said. ``But
that doesn't mean we won't.''

TEST GENE-THERAPY PROCEDUCE MAY OFFER HOPE FOR BLOOD DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucas Parks spent his 16th birthday hooked up to intravenous
lines and monitors in Room 318 at Children's Hospital and Medical
Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   For some kids, that would be a major disappointment. For this
Tennessee teenager, it was a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas has leukocyte adherence deficiency, a rare genetic blood
disorder that often kills children before age 5. On Aug. 28, he
became the second person in the world to receive an experimental
gene-therapy treatment that researchers hope will restore his blood
to normal.
</P>
<P>
   In LAD, the white cells _ one of the body's main armaments
against invading pathogens _ lack a ``sticky'' protein they need to
attach to bacteria. Without that protein, even minor scratches can
turn into gaping wounds and life-threatening infections.
</P>
<P>
   The white blood cells never leave the bloodstream and go to the
site of the infection, said Dr. Dennis Hickstein, a professor of
medicine at the University of Washington and LAD expert at the VA
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a convoy of ambulances without brakes screaming past
the site of the accident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Simple wounds can take months to heal, often requiring painful
and disfiguring skin grafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven is supposed to be a long lifespan,'' said Dana Parks,
Lucas' mother. Lucas was diagnosed at age 1 after a mysterious
fever put him in the hospital for two months. At first doctors
thought he had leukemia, but a chance encounter with a doctor from
the University of Tennessee revealed the rare diagnosis. At the
time, there were only 100 known cases of the disease worldwide, and
doctors knew almost nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were afraid we were going to lose him,'' Dana Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, infections have put Lucas in the hospital for
weeks at a time, every other month or so, she said. ``But we try to
let him lead as normal a life as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Normal for Lucas means building model cars, a favorite hobby,
and getting outside to hunt, fish and camp as often as possible. He
tries not to let his disease get in the way of being a freshman in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Lucas, things are either good or bad, there's nothing in
between,'' said his father, Steve Parks. ``He keeps going so hard,
it's sometimes a few days before we realize things have gotten bad
again. He keeps on a good front.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who was struggling with several nasty sores during his
Seattle visit, was too weak to talk much, but still glad to be
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was good when I first heard about it (the
treatment),'' he said in a long Southern drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Current treatments are limited to white cell transfusions,
antibiotics, and bone marrow transplantation. But bone marrow
transplants, which involve massive doses of chemotherapy and
radiation that wipe out the body's immune system, are toxic and
potentially life-threatening for patients with LAD.
</P>
<P>
   The new gene-therapy protocol offers the potential of a cure
without the risks of a bone marrow transplant. LAD, which afflicts
about 200 people worldwide, is caused by a defect in a single gene.
Doctors hope they can correct the disease by inserting a good copy
of a gene into the patient's cells.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will try to slip the correct gene into stem cells,
the master cells made in the bone marrow that give rise to all the
other cells of the blood and immune system. If the re-engineered
stem cells persist and multiply, they should give white cells that
descend from them the ability to produce the sticky protein and
ward off bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the new technique could be used to cure other
genetic blood diseases, such as hemophilia, Fanconi anemia, a
disease that causes the bone marrow to fail, or Gaucher's disease,
a disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize fat.
</P>
<P>
   It may also signal a rebirth in the gene-therapy movement,
giving new life to attempts to cure other genetic diseases such as
cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol being used on Lucas Parks was developed through a
collaboration between Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the
University of Washington, the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and
Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center. Much of the work
to develop a gene therapy for LAD was done by Tom Bauer, a
researcher at the VA who helped spearhead the clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hickstein originally cloned the missing gene for LAD,
it was Bauer who spent the past seven years developing the protocol
using gene therapy to treat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worked hard on this,'' Hickstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' treatment involved drawing blood, isolating the stem
cells and then treating them in the laboratory with a specially
engineered virus designed to ``infect'' his own cells with a new
gene.
</P>
<P>
   The genetically altered stem cells were then reintroduced into
Lucas' bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is based on the ability of a special class of
viruses, called retroviruses, to insert their own genetic material
into the genomes of the cells they infect. For gene therapy, the
retrovirus has been modified so instead of transferring its own
disease-causing genes, it transfers a piece of foreign DNA, in this
case a correct copy of the gene that will tell Lucas' body how to
make the missing protein it needs to fight infections.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old woman, the first patient ever officially diagnosed
with LAD, was the first to receive the treatment last summer.
Initial reports are positive. One month after receiving her
genetically altered cells, her body was showing signs that the
treatment was beginning to work.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors use a ``skin scraping'' to test how well the white cells
are working, Hickstein said. In the first patient's case, the
number of white blood cells responding to the scraping site had
more than doubled, compared with a similar test done before
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Patients don't need 100 percent restoration of gene function to
fight infection. ``Even if you have 2 percent of normal (white cell
response), it would help,'' he said. ``You don't need much.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be several months before scientists have a good read on
whether gene therapy has worked for Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who has been anxious to get the treatment since first
hearing about it, is hoping for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky to be in this research,'' he said.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dave Frohnmayer has a more compelling reason than most
to be watching the new gene therapy trial under way in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Frohnmayer, president of the University of Oregon, has already
lost two daughters to a rare genetic disease called Fanconi anemia
that causes the bone marrow to fail. A third daughter, Amy, now 12,
has the disease as well.
</P>
<P>
   If the gene therapy trial against the blood disease leukocyte
adherence deficiency proves successful, scientists may move quickly
to test the same techniques against Fanconi anemia.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the Frohnmayers hope Amy will be spared the fate of
sisters Kirsten, who died at age 24 in 1997, and Katie, who died at
age 12 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Amy's blood counts are stable now, Frohnmayer said. But they're
low and could dive to dangerous levels at any time, especially as
she enters puberty, when the body is in a state of rapid change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch her counts all the time,'' he said. ``Our backs are
against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Frohnmayer, a former Oregon attorney general who is on the board
of directors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, has
been raising money and awareness for gene therapy since Kirsten,
his oldest daughter, was diagnosed in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis was a shock. Kirsten was 10 years old when she
suddenly began showing signs of unexplained fatigue, weakness and
bruising. When tests revealed she had Fanconi anemia, the
Frohnmayers also got the hard news that Katie, then 4, had the
genetic trait as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Frohnmayers have two sons without the disease, which strikes
boys and girls equally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Frohnmayer and his wife, Lynn, started the Fanconi
Anemia Research Fund, which has since raised more than $6 million
for research into the genetic causes of the disease and possible
gene-therapy treatments.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, there were only about 18 researchers around the
world working on Fanconi anemia, which affects about 1,500 patients
in the United States. The genes that caused the disease were
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are more than 100 scientists working on the disease
and scientists have cloned three genes that account for about 90
percent of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Groups at the University of Indiana, Harvard University,
University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center are now poised to begin clinical trials of
various gene therapy protocols for Fanconi anemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the trials are open for families yet,'' Frohnmayer
said. ``We're watching very carefully. We're hopeful it (a
treatment) will be there in time for Amy.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other alternative for Amy is a bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   But patients with Fanconi anemia are hypersensitive to radiation
and chemotherapy, which makes bone marrow treatments extremely
risky.
</P>
<P>
   Fanconi anemia is a defect in the body's natural DNA repair
mechanism. The genes associated with the disease are part of a
suite of ``caretaker'' genes that protect the body against cancer.
The failure of one of these genes causes bone marrow cells to die,
but it also predisposes patients to cancer because the body can't
repair cancerous mutations.
</P>
<P>
   Better understanding and treatment for the disease could help
researchers understand how to treat some forms of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, we're convinced this (gene therapy) will be the
molecular medicine wave of the future,'' Frohnmayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, he'll keep fighting in memory of his two
daughters and for the future of his third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to fight back,'' he said. ``It's a horrible price
we've already paid. You have to believe something more lasting and
positive will come of it.''

DRUNKEN FANS ARE THE FOUL ODDBALLS IN SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dale Carter has a huge knot near his right eye,
and potential permanent damage to his vision. He got hit by a metal
object thrown by one of the fans at Denver's Mile High Stadium as
he came off the field Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Carter plays for the home team. That is, if his eye isn't so
damaged that the sentence should read, ``Carter played for the home
team.''
</P>
<P>
   This story has been somewhat underreported given its
ramifications, not to mention its most recent antecedents: the fans
at the Ryder Cup in Brookline, Mass., performing the Dance of the
Drunken Swine for an entire weekend, and Houston's Billy Spiers
being literally mugged while playing right field in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   In short, fans have gone beyond just abusive, and one wonders if
maybe we aren't closing in on the day when fans finally outlive
their usefulness on site.
</P>
<P>
   There have been plenty of examples where the athletes have
baited fans into bad behavior, but Carter did nothing more
provocative than come off the field after the Broncos' 21-13 loss
to the New York Jets. The victims in the Ryder Cup mess were the
European golfers, who had the bad breeding to be bred in another
country. Spiers was standing in right field minding his own
business, which was with his back to the fan who jumped him.
</P>
<P>
   Some smart people suggest that the common denominator here is
alcohol, and that makes sense as far as it goes. These people
suggest that selling beer, wine or mixed drinks at events is just
asking for trouble, and of course that is true.
</P>
<P>
   If the man who jumped Spiers wasn't drunk, he ought to be
looking at jail time, and the same goes for the guy (at least we
assume it's a guy) who clocked Carter. And remember, there is no
constitutional right to be served beer at a sporting event, so
don't start with that, ``But it's an American tradition'' nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the resourceful ticket-buying creep can get around a
potential alcohol ban by coming in drunk (and if you've seen a
tailgate at any 49ers or Raiders game, you know how common that
is). And without Breathalyzers and metal detectors at every gate,
said creep will still be a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at some point, we can pretty much expect someone to up
the ante some day and bring a firearm and foul mood to a game.
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, though, the problem lay not in the bottom of the
bottle but in the heart of its user. Somewhere in the recent past,
fans decided that, at the prices they're paying, they have a right
to impact the game in more than the cheer-as-loud-as- you-can way _
as though the whole idea of going to a game is to impress your pals
with the limits you will disregard to get noticed.
</P>
<P>
   And this is where the line that properly separated fans from the
objects of their affectionshas become blurred. Players are now
being attacked for the affront of plying their craft, and if those
are the new rules of engagement, then the days of fans in the
stands are seeing their end.
</P>
<P>
   You think not? You think we overstate? The three incidents
described above all happened in the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   You think we generalize where we should specify? Well, as we
approach the day a player is killed on the field, what makes you
think that the people running the games we watch will be any less
sweeping in their assumptions? How many athletes, confronted with
the growing possibility they could be beaten, or worse, while
performing, are going to stand quietly and take it because of the
sometimes broadly applied notion the customer is always right?
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, we have three fresh incidents where the customer
was dead wrong, and in the Spiers and Carter cases, ought to be
dead wrong in prison. Nobody's going to worry about the 75,000 at
Mile High who didn't throw a piece of metal at an athlete's head,
or the 11,000 at County Stadium who stayed in the seats they paid
for. If this is where we're heading, maybe banning beer is only a
half step. We may be heading, incrementally, toward the day when
the sixth man, the seventh man, the 10th man and the 12th man teams
prize so highly will be invited to stay home and buy the games on
pay-per-view, or submit to full body searches on the way in and out
of stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   And when it happens, don't complain about another lost slice of
Americana. Dale Carter and Billy Spiers showed how much closer we
are to that day than we want to believe.

   JUST ONE BLOOM
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a bromeliad (Aechmea fasciata), which I keep indoors.
For 10 months, it had a center spike with beautiful pink and blue
flowers. Then, it suddenly wilted and died. I don't believe I
changed anything, so what went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sounds just about right. Many bromeliads, including your A.
fasciata, are usually sold when they are in bloom or just about to
open, because they flower once and then die. They linger on a year
or more after the bloom fades, like the heroine of a 19th-century
novel, but it is just playing on your emotions.
</P>
<P>
   All is not lost, however, assuming you haven't tossed it out.
While you were admiring the flower, the plant was busy producing
offsets, called daughter plants, around its base. Once flowering is
over, you should remove the spent flower stalk and continue caring
for the plant until the offsets are about half the size of the
mother plant. They can then be carefully cut off (make sure you
don't lose any roots) and placed in individual pots.
</P>
<P>
   If the mother plant is looking too shabby, carefully cut it out,
leaving the daughter plants until they are large enough to cut and
pot on their own. In two or three years, the daughter plants will
become mother plants, and flower.
</P>
<P>
   TREE'S REVENGE?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Several years ago, I had a large and healthy silver maple
tree in my yard taken down because it had been planted too close to
the house. The four- or five-foot-wide stump was ground down to a
few inches below ground level.
</P>
<P>
   Now, every fall, my lawn gets covered with some kind of mushroom
that I believe is coming from the roots of the removed tree. Short
of digging up and removing the tree roots, is there anything I can
do to prevent these mushrooms from sprouting every fall? They make
it very difficult to use or maintain the lawn for the last month or
two before winter. I guess I'm being punished for taking down a
healthy tree.
</P>
<P>
   A. Perhaps the person who should be punished is the one who
either planted the tree or built the house there, depending on
which came first. Let it be a caution for the future: small trees
become larger, and large trees spread out. Both eventual height and
width need to be taken into consideration when purchasing and
siting any tree.
</P>
<P>
   As the roots continue to decay the problem will lessen, and the
mushrooms should be gone in another two or three years. In the
meantime grab your golf clubs and play driving range.
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING LONGHORNED BEETLES
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now that most insects are disappearing for the winter, is
there anything I can do with regard to watching for the dangerous
Asian beetles that were recently spotted in Manhattan?
</P>
<P>
   A. Asian longhorned beetles, which previously had been found in
Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island, were found in Manhattan this
summer. These beetles attack and kill primarily maples, but also
horse chestnut, elm, willow, poplar, ash, box alder and rose of
Sharon trees. As recent invaders, they have no natural enemies in
the United States except you. With fall here, it would be easy to
let your guard down and stop looking for them.
</P>
<P>
   But don't. While the adult beetle _ an inch to an inch and a
half long, black with white spots and huge antennae _ dies after
laying eggs, the larvae overwinter in the holes they make in trees.
The distinctive holes are only slightly smaller than a dime,
perfectly round, and have smooth edges. They are found singly or in
scattered groups. As the larvae bore through the vessels that bring
water and nutrients up from the roots, the tree quickly withers and
dies.
</P>
<P>
   Report holes to the New York state Agriculture and Markets
Department's Asian longhorned beetle line (800-554-4501, ext.
72087).
</P>
<P>
   While they have not been found outside the New York City area,
Connecticut and New Jersey have numbers to call just in case. In
Connecticut, the number is (203) 974-8600. New Jersey residents
should call (609) 292-5441.
</P>
<P>
   Information and updates on the Asian longhorned beetle problem,
including photographs of the beetle, can be found at the U.S.

SAN ANGELO TAKES ART TO HEART WITH NEW MUSEUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When architect Malcolm Holzman says the new San Angelo Museum of
Fine Arts and Education Center is ``unusual for a number of
reasons,'' he's not kidding. It's a decidedly unconventional
structure for the West Texas town of 90,000 known more for mohair
exports than for visual art _ but that's also why the town has
embraced it.
</P>
<P>
   Marked by its curved copper roof, the building has drawn
comparisons to a saddle, a covered wagon, and, if you listen to
museum director Howard Taylor, a Pace picante sauce bottle on its
side. In any case, it is a deceptively subtle visual impression of
West Texas _ exactly what the architects wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of our first questions,'' Holzman says. ``How do
we make this building look like San Angelo?''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is the latest in a long history of Texas projects
done by architectural firm Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, which
has offices in New York City and Los Angeles. Most recently,
Holzman headed projects for the Lucille ``Lupe'' Murchison
Performing Arts Center at the University of North Texas and the
Walsh Center for the Performing Arts at Texas Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   His partners' endeavors include the recent Radio City Music Hall
renovation, which opened Monday, and the Brooklyn Museum of Art,
home of the art world's latest controversy, over its ``Sensations''
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The San Angelo museum includes four galleries, not all directly
connected. A central atrium, which provides breathing space, is
overlooked by walkways on the upper levels that lead to an outdoor
sculpture terrace. Here stand works by Luis Jimenez, Jesus Bautista
Moroles and others.
</P>
<P>
   The largest gallery features pan-European Old Master paintings
from the 17th to 19th centuries, lent by Houston's Sarah Campbell
Blaffer Foundation. An adjoining and more intimate space with low
ceilings highlights landscape and still-life paintings by
Cuban-born Texas artist Lilian Garcia-Roig.
</P>
<P>
   Another gallery showcases an exhibit of projects by Hardy
Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, plus a retrospective look, if you
will, at the museum's design process. Models of previous roof ideas
_ from peaked to rounded _ show why the current look is indeed the
best choice: It's functional and a little irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally we wouldn't'' show old models, Holzman says. ``It's
more like office gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   The wood ceilings are supported by beams, all of which rest on
parallel cement walls unified by five square windows in an arching
design. The floors are of West Texas mesquite, as are the benches,
which are cushioned in natural Texas wool from Alvaredo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to (use) materials from the region,'' Holzman says.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior sports a typical Holzman-in-Texas material _
limestone. There are three levels to this, the middle section a
rougher, sedimentary layer replete with meteorite and fossil
pockmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent to the building is the Paseo de Santa Angela, a walkway
connecting historic Fort Concho to the downtown area. From the
paseo, foreboding, conical steps lead to the museum's main
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at every major museum in the world,'' Taylor says,
``there are steps. And always, there are people sitting on them. I
project that in 10 years, this will be a popular place.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the museum slopes 25 feet from end to end. ``It really
conforms to the site,'' Taylor says.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the atrium, one wall is lime green, a color that connects
to the exterior, and not just because ``limestone'' and ``lime
green'' share a word. Both exude a cool, calm confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``HHPA really likes to expose the character of a building,''
Taylor says.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the museum is its
connection with nearby Angelo State University. An additional back
area, funded by the university, provides educational facilities for
the school's ceramics program _ classrooms, outdoor and indoor
kilns, supply areas, etc.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the museum, an auditorium serves as a place
for public receptions. Eventually, the museum will screen films,
hold the city's chamber music series and, the most intriguing idea,
offer culinary classes.
</P>
<P>
   The art museum doesn't have a permanent collection yet _ but
it's working on it. It recently acquired a piece from Fort Worth
artist Vernon Fisher. Exhibits will be encyclopedic, showcasing
classical works and Texas contemporary artists such as Robert
Wilson. Every two years, the museum will host an international
ceramics exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor recognizes there's a long way to go, but a fresh new
building is definitely a great start.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Angelo will never be a major art market,'' he says. ``But
it can be a wonderful place to make art.''

ANOTHER MAKEOVER FOR AOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online, the world's largest Internet service, this week
announced the worldwide debut of a new version of the basic
software used by its 18 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   AOL customers do not need the new software, AOL Version 5.0, but
it is actually a pleasant improvement over earlier versions. It
maintains AOL's traditional emphasis on ease of use instead of
jazzy, cutting-edge innovation, but it does add a handful of new
features intended to appeal to a Norman Rockwell audience.
</P>
<P>
   The new features on the AOL welcoming screen include My Calendar
and My Places (right below My Weather) and, inexplicably breaking
syntax, You've Got Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   AOL has also made changes behind the screen. It has expanded
both the number and length of the screen names available to
subscribers, improved its search engine for finding information not
just within AOL but also on the wider World Wide Web, and bolstered
the reliability of the service to reduce the number of busy signals
and broken connections.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, with version 5.0, America Online has succeeded in its
declared attempt to ``make the connected experience even more
central to members' everyday lives,'' assuming that your life was
somehow incomplete without having access to an online picture
album, and a digital calendar, plus a witty new screen name.
</P>
<P>
   With its new My Calendar feature, in fact, AOL goes so far as to
urge subscribers to ``plan your life online!''
</P>
<P>
   That is essentially the same vision described last month by the
closest thing America Online has to a direct rival, the MSN.Com
online service from the Microsoft Corp., which pithily calls its
new vision the Everyday Web.
</P>
<P>
   AOL wants to be the window through which its customers get the
most current news and weather, check up-to-the-minute stock prices
and investment portfolios, share letters and pictures with Grandma,
search for information, find out what time Sally has to be at
soccer practice, go shopping on line, play games, check Billy's
school lunch menu, set up a family Web site, make plans for weekend
entertainment, pursue hobbies, and trade gossip and jokes with
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you are doing all this at standard dial-up modem
speeds, you probably don't have time left in the day to have much
of a life.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda is ambitious, but AOL 5.0 manages to pull it off with
a newly redesigned welcome screen that cleverly organizes all these
activities, and more, into a relatively simple and orderly
rectangle.
</P>
<P>
   My Calendar may turn out to be the most popular new feature. It
is a server-based calendar, which means the calendar does not
reside on the user's own computer, but rather in a giant digital
brain floating in a vat of goo at AOL's headquarters, with
tentacles stretching out to any computing device it can reach.
Well, perhaps that is overly dramatic, but you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   What it means, really, is that AOL subscribers can check their
personal calendars from any computer that has an Internet
connection and a Web browser. It can be checked from home, from
work and on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when AOL figures out how to do it, the personal calendar
will be available on noncomputer devices like smart digital phones,
pocket-size organizers or even automobile dashboard screens.
</P>
<P>
   AOL asserts that it will use all its skills to protect this
private information from computer criminals and snoops. But I would
probably not make intimate or sensitive entries like, ``Tuesday
3:30 p.m.: Drive gold bullion to the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the calendar is server-based, AOL can ``push'' local
event information, like the weather or local music and television
listings, down to the subscriber's calendar. The information is
based on the user's zip code.
</P>
<P>
   But even though it had already asked for my zip code, My
Calendar still asked me to choose my personal weather and concert
choices from a long list of cities. The only explanation I can
think of is that people who enter a zip code for Buffalo, say, are
graciously being offered a chance to pretend that they can order
weather from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is famous for its You've Got Mail! alerts, and now, for
better or worse, it has added You've Got Photos. AOL, in
partnership with Eastman Kodak and a joint AOL-Kodak venture called
Picturevision, wants America to throw away its shoeboxes and store
photographs instead in online digital photo albums.
</P>
<P>
   People with digital cameras can easily take advantage of this
new service, but so can people with conventional film cameras.
Thousands of drugstore and photo finishing centers around the
country will soon offer customers the choice of getting pictures
back as conventional prints, as digital pictures posted directly to
a private photo album on AOL, or both.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The owner then can discard bad shots, order special prints and
copies of the good ones, send photos to friends and relatives, and
_ this is the scary part _ set up slide shows of vacation photos to
share with millions of unsuspecting viewers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The You've got Pictures feature in AOL 5.0 works only with newly
developed pictures. AOL says future releases of the software will
enable people to upload their existing digital pictures, either
from digital cameras or from scanned prints.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is My Places, a corner of the welcome screen where
the user can set up one-click access to five favorite online
destinations. This is something of a dud for anyone even vaguely
familiar with the concept of Web bookmarks because My Places allows
links only to AOL's own content.
</P>
<P>
   It is like being offered trips to anywhere in the world, as long
as you stay in Iowa. There are many delightful places in Iowa, of
course. But still.
</P>
<P>
   And, as mentioned here last week, AOL has a new search engine
that prowls not just AOL content, but also the entire Web. Other
search engines cannot search AOL content, because AOL blocks them.
</P>
<P>
   The new AOL 5.0 software is available for Windows computers
only. AOL says a Macintosh version will be available ``later.'' A
preview version of the Windows software was made available late
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to get the software is to wait for AOL to
carpet-bomb your neighborhood with free CD-ROM disks, as it is wont
to do. Those in a bigger hurry can download it from the AOL.com Web
site, but beware: The basic software is a 13-megabyte bolus that
takes about 40 minutes to squeeze through a 56-kilobit modem. With
a slower 28.8-kilobit modem, it takes 1 hour 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is also distributing a special version of AOL 5.0
that comes with _ surprise! _ a copy of Microsoft's Internet
Explorer 5.0 Web software. That is surprising because AOL owns
Netscape, Microsoft's bitter rival in the Web-browser category. The
AOL 5.0 with Internet Explorer 5.0 browser combo weighs in at 25
MB, so double the downloading times given above.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the software is free. The catch is that it costs
$4.95 to $21.95 a month to use it, depending on how much time is
spent on line.
</P>
<P>
   Of immediate concern to all those people who have been saddled
with drab AOL screen names like Bill836283 (please do not try to
send e-mail to this address, I made it up) is that AOL has now made
screen names 16 characters long, instead of 10. That will enable
Bill to change his screen name to something less common, like
Bill836283652049, although I suspect that he is more likely to want
to change it to something like BillThePresident.
</P>
<P>
   Also, AOL now allows seven screen names per account instead of
five, which is welcome news to large families, and to small
families where everyone wants to have multiple screen names. There
are many valid reasons to have more than one screen name. A person
may wish to have one screen name for a home-based business, and a
different one for personal use, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But this is AOL, after all, where a quick search of member
profiles reveals that more than 100 subscribers answer to ``sex
moron.'' (AOL simply stopped counting at 100.) There is reason to
suspect that other subscribers may simply need the extra screen
names for their multiple personalities, so they can participate in
online chat sessions with themselves.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The basics of the water system in a home are easy to understand.
After water enters the house, the supply line splits into a cold
and a hot line. The hot line starts with cold water, but it is
routed to a heater where the water is heated to a temperature of
about 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Both lines are routed to fixtures in
the bathroom, kitchen, laundry room, and so on, where they may
tapped for water.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each line, fixtures allow you to draw water on
demand. These are the most familiar valves in the system, but
throughout the system others are placed in strategic locations so
you control the flow of water anywhere in the house. As long as the
plumbing system is working perfectly, there is no need to concern
yourself with these valves. But should a leak or malfunction occur,
it might be necessary to locate a specific valve to shut off the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the main shut-off valve, for example. This valve
controls the water going to all the pipes in the house. If a supply
pipe leaks or bursts, this is the valve to close to keep water from
feeding into that pipe. The main shut-off valve is situated close
to the point where the water enters the house, by the water meter
(Many newer homes now have shut-off valves on both sides of the
water meter.) If you don't have a basement, look in the crawl space
or along a ground-floor wall next to the street.
</P>
<P>
   Near the main shut-off valve there may be another valve, called
the water-pressure valve. Unlike the other valves, this one has an
adjustment screw, not a handle, on top. The water supplied by the
municipal water supplier is usually delivered at around 40 to 55
pounds per square inch. Sometimes, however, it may be as high as
80.
</P>
<P>
   Pressures above 60 can strain the pipes, causing them to burst,
or they could cause a water ``hammer'' when faucets are turned on
and off. The adjustment screw on the pressure valve can be turned
to regulate the water pressure coming into the house. Look for the
pressure valve on the house side of the water meter.
</P>
<P>
   Faucets are the familiar valves found on kitchen, bathroom and
laundry-room sinks. Plumbing codes now require an additional valve,
called a shut-off valve, for each hot and cold line supplying a
fixture. These are usually found under the sink. They make it easy
to shut off the water to a specific fixture without affecting the
water in other lines. This is convenient if you need to repair or
replace a sink faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Shut-off valves are designed to be left in either the fully open
or closed position, and they will often leak if turned half way.
Some do-it-yourselfers will mistake a leaking shut-off valve as a
malfunction and replace it, when simply turning the handle to the
open position would stop the leak.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a refrigerator with an ice maker or an instant
cold-water dispenser, you may also have a saddle valve attached to
the cold-water line. Unlike other valves that are threaded onto the
supply pipes, the saddle valve is attached to the pipe with a
clamp. A hollow metal spike is pushed through the pipe wall to tap
into the water line. Strictly speaking, the saddle valve is not a
valve at all, since it is not used to control water flow; this is
done through the appliance.
</P>
<P>
   Saddle valves are not durable and have a high failure rate. They
should be checked periodically for leaks and replaced if they show
signs of deterioration. Unfortunately, this is not always easy
because they are often situated in remote places, like behind a
cabinet or appliance. Also, they are not usually controlled by an
individual shut-off valve, so you may have to go to the main
shut-off valve and turn off the water to the whole house in order
to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of valve is the hose bib. This is simply a faucet,
usually on a laundry or utility sink or on an exterior wall. It is
called a hose bib because the faucet spout is threaded to accept a
hose fitting. Some plumbing codes require hose bibs to be equipped
with a vacuum breaker. This is a device that interrupts any
siphonage that might occur if a vacuum occurs in the water-supply
line. Vacuums are caused by a sudden drop in water pressure, and
they can create a siphon action that will pull contaminated water
(if the end of the hose is in a pool or a water-filled sink) back
into the clean-water supply.

49ERS NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE YOUNG CROP OF PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ On a team deep in the throes of ancestor
worship, the time is as ripe as a summer peach for the San
Francisco 49ers to look to the future by seeing if the young
players populating the lower economic rungs on the roster can
actually play the game.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the first month of the season, it's apparent some can
while others are badly miscast as football players.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have relied on the inspiration of Steve Young and the
polished brilliance of Jerry Rice and the valiant leadership of Tim
McDonald while legions of draft picks have trotted through the
doors on the road to Wal-Mart employment.
</P>
<P>
   These are the final, wheezing days of the old 49er superstars.
Enjoy them while they last because their time is dwindling. Young
is another concussion or two from becoming the chief executive of
an Internet start-up. Rice's average gain per catch is down to 9.3
yards, a career low.
</P>
<P>
   To the club's credit, management _ that is to say, Bill Walsh _
recognized the need for a rapid infusion of young talent as a way
to stave off the inevitability of decline. Steve Mariucci, whose
job security ultimately depends on how well the team's young
players develop, recognizes it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be able to replace our superstars because they're
not going to play forever,'' Mariucci said. ``We've got to find
these rising stars. Not just new players; not just guys. You can't
win your division with just guys. You need good players.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers took an emotional hit when Merton Hanks was released
(he does look good in Seahawk blue, though), but the man who
replaced him at free safety, Lance Schulters, looks to be a
long-term starter. Schulters has two interceptions in four games,
one of which he returned for the winning touchdown against New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The next such proactive step is to insert Fred Beasley into the
starting lineup at fullback. Based on what he did Sunday against
Tennessee, there's no reason why Beasley should be languishing
behind Tommy Vardell. Conversely, there's no reason why Vardell,
30, should be starting ahead of Beasley, who's five years younger
with a bigger upside.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is all about production on game day, and Beasley's
teammates took notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, he came out and played great,'' Rice said. ``He
made plays, caught the ball, he did everything. That's a great
addition right there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us were impressed with him,'' Ken Norton said.
``Playing like that, they might try to find a place for him weekly.
I go against him in training camp all the time. I've always known
his potential. Hopefully he'll get more opportunity from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said Beasley had a chance to be a starter. ``Fred's
going to be a good one. He's a tough kid. He's a good blocker and a
capable pass receiver. Let's fit him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fit him in there now. On Charlie Garner's 53-yard run that set
up the winning touchdown against Tennessee, Beasley took out middle
linebacker Barron Wortham with a terrific lead block to make the
play go. He also caught two passes for 27 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' Beasley said. ``There's a chance to be
around a lot of great guys. I hear a lot of horror stories about
other places. I hope I have a good future here. I feel great about
the whole situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another second-year player having an impact with the 49ers is
Jeremy Newberry on the offensive line. He was tried at tackle in
the first two games but appears to be better suited for guard,
where at 315 pounds he can be the levee that holds back the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Newberry, Schulters and Beasley are products of the 49ers' draft
class of 1998, which is shaping up as the club's best since '94.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Phil Ostrowski also is a member of the '98 class. He's a
skilled interior lineman who should take over when Ray Brown,
closing in on 37, decides to call it a career.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the dismal Class of '99, a fallow yield
indeed. Top pick Reggie McGrew, who was supposed to get significant
playing time at defensive tackle, was placed on injured reserve
with a bum elbow, ending a rookie year that was just clearing its
throat to holler ``Bust!''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Chike Okeafor is getting a few turns with the
starters but has yet to make an impact. Cornerback Anthony Parker
tore a knee ligament in training camp and is done for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Another cornerback, Pierson Prioleau, is running around on
special teams, as is running back Terry Jackson. Guard Tyrone
Hopson is injured. Wide receiver Tai Streets is on injured reserve.
Linebacker Kory Minor was waived. Not much to build on.
</P>
<P>
   But it becomes more promising when Jeff Garcia is included in
that group, since he came to the 49ers in '99, albeit as a
29-year-old free agent. That's an age when many quarterbacks are
just starting to learn how to play the game. If the 49ers do not
find their idealized Quarterback of the Future in next year's
draft, they could do worse than prepare Garcia to take over when
Young, finally, inevitably, moves on to an occupation where people
don't hit him.

<P>
   It's hard to imagine Jon Walz, a film producer and vintage-phone
collector in Los Angeles, getting as worked up in 20 years about
today's cordless telephones as he does about his Western Electric
302 rotary dial phone.
</P>
<P>
   To hear him lovingly describe its clickety dial, the chime of
its two-toned ringer and the shiny Bakelite handset (the size and
weight of which make him feel small in comparison when he picks it
up), Walz could just as well be referring to a long lost toy truck,
or even an old teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a reminder of slightly better days, when things
were more fun and less stressful,'' said Walz, who is 29. ``They
remind me of being at my grandma's house.''
</P>
<P>
   Walz is one of a dying breed of people who still use rotary
phones in their daily lives. Like other touch-tone avoiders, he
will gladly wait the extra seconds it takes for the dial to twirl
back and forth between the numbers and its starting position in
exchange for the feeling of nostalgia that the phones evoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like little sculptures, very substantial and beautiful
pieces of craftsmanship,'' he said of his rotary phones. (In
addition to the circa 1930s Western Electric 302, Walz has an Art
Deco desk model made by Northern Electric as well as a Princess
phone from the late 1960s.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a business that recycles itself yearly,'' Walz said,
``so it's nice to have the phones around the house as reminders
that things are still stable and that there's quality to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people who collect rotary dial phones are looking to
recapture a piece of their childhood, said Jonathan Finder, a
pediatric specialist in Pittsburgh who sells vintage phones through
his Web site, www.oldphones.com. ``Some want wall phones, some want
candlesticks, like the ones they used on `The Andy Griffith
Show,''' he said, referring to the type of phone that uses a stand
for an upright receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sell a ton of pink Princess phones. There are a lot of
professional women who grew up in the '70s who never got them as
little girls, and by God, they're going to get one now.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sought-after models, collectors say, include phones with
hollowed out ``spit cup'' receivers manufactured in the 1920s and
1930s, as well as phones built before the 1950s. One way they can
be distinguished from later models is that their numbers are
located inside the finger wheel instead of being distributed, a few
at a time, around each finger hole (much as letters are put on the
buttons of touch-tone phones).
</P>
<P>
   Many vintage-phone enthusiasts marvel that nearly 80 years
later, even the earliest rotary dial phones can still communicate
with modern phone networks. Although networks largely recognize
numbers through a combination of tones, most can still recognize
the series of interrupted pulses in the electrical circuit
generated by rotary dials.
</P>
<P>
   Rotary dial phones were introduced to American consumers in
1919, said Sheldon Hochheiser, the corporate historian at AT&AMP;T, but
they did not become widely used until the mid-1950s. Until then,
people relied on phone boxes with magneto cranks or battery
switches. The phones sent an electrical signal to an operator, who
would get on the line and ask, ``Number, please?''
</P>
<P>
   But in a bit of well-known lore among collectors, the patent for
the first automatic switch used by rotary phones was issued in 1891
to Almon B. Strowger, a Kansas City, Mo., undertaker who wanted a
device that could make direct connections to the phone switching
offices.
</P>
<P>
   He was convinced that switchboard operators were accepting
bribes to steer calls for undertakers to his competitors, so he
wanted a way for calls to bypass the operators. Strowger later
became a founder of the Automatic Electric Co. of Chicago, an early
manufacturer of rotary phones.
</P>
<P>
   Even though rotary phones work with most phone networks, most
people who use them still have to keep a touch-tone phone around
for navigating through the sea of automated recordings now used by
many businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Helene Lyons, who sells vintage phones at her shop, Remembrances
of Things Past, in Provincetown, Mass., uses a touch-tone phone to
get access to her automated voice mail. But she uses her
see-through rotary phone from the 1960s to call into automated
switchboards like customer service lines.
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She finds that she often reaches a person more quickly by
waiting for one to come on, and she suggests that touch-tone users
try this approach, too. ``Sometimes someone will come on the line a
lot faster if you just hang on instead of pushing all the
buttons,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rotary phone users are somewhat surprised when they have to show
young children how to use them. That happened to Rick Walsh, a
broadcasting engineer in Hartford who has been collecting vintage
phones for 25 years, when he installed an intercom system based on
rotary phones at his friend's camp this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it would be pretty intuitive,'' Walsh said,
``but a lot of the kids had no concept of how to use one. One
10-year-old boy who was trying to dial a three put his finger in
the zero dial hole, brought it to three, and then released it.
You'd have to see it to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   But vintage-phone lovers aside, most people who switched to
touch-tone phones decades ago now find that waiting for a rotary
dial to make its rounds is too excruciatingly slow.
</P>
<P>
   Channing Wilroy, an actor and rotary phone devotee from Truro,
Mass., who has appeared in several films directed by John Waters,
said that when Waters visited his house, he found the rotary phones
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be near a phone at all times, and my rotary phones
just drive him crazy,'' Wilroy said. ``He screams and carries on
when he has to use one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not until you have something that works faster that you
become frustrated with something that works perfectly adequately,''
Hochheiser said. ``And it's not just true with the telephone. I
don't think people used to mind waiting several moments for the
vacuum tubes in their radios and TV's to warm up either. That would
never be tolerated now.'' &QL;

HELP FOR FILES ON OLD DISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a number of files on old 5\-inch diskettes that I'd
like to retrieve, but I no longer have a computer with a floppy
drive that will read them. Is there any way I can get these files
onto my new computer?
</P>
<P>
   A. Even though the 5\-inch floppy disk _ the most common size
for PC disks made before 1987 _ has pretty much gone the way of the
eight-track tape, it might still be possible to get your files
back. But if the documents were created in an old program that has
also fallen by the wayside, you may also have to get your old files
converted to a format that will work on your new computer.
</P>
<P>
   Data conversion companies can take many types of obsolete
storage media and transfer the material onto the modern 3{-inch
floppies or CD-ROMs or Zip disks. In addition to 5\-inch disks,
conversions can also be done for more obscure storage media, like
8-inch floppy disks (the ones that were actually floppy), magnetic
data tapes, optical disks and Syquest cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the service depend on the type of files you have and
the condition of the disk or tape. Some conversions can be as cheap
as $5, while more elaborate jobs could cost several hundred
dollars. Some companies to try include Computer Conversions
(www.computer-conversions.com) and the National Data Conversion
Institute (www.ndci.com).

WINE-SELLER AMBROSIA LAUNCHES WEB SITE  
(DW)

 THE PRESS DEMOCRAT ,  Santa Rosa (Calif.)   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Napa direct marketing company Ambrosia
jumped into the growing market for Internet wine sales Tuesday,
launching an e-commerce site, www.ambrosiawine.com.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco investment banker William R. Hambrecht, who owns
Belvedere Winery outside Healdsburg, provided capital for
Ambrosia's expansion with a minority investment in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1991, Ambrosia was based on a class project by
co-founder Lesley Berglund while attending Harvard Business School.
The company's catalogs sell wine and gourmet food through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Its Internet site, created with Lucent Technologies'
``CentreVu'' system, will allow users to browse Ambrosia's Web site
and simultaneously talk with a company representative over the same
telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen companies have announced plans this summer to sell
wine over the Internet. Ambrosia hopes to differentiate itself by
focusing on customer service and offering top-notch wines, Berglund
said. To expand from catalog sales to e-commerce, Ambrosia doubled
its staff this summer and quadrupled its office and warehouse
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambrosia is not trying to be the Wal-Mart of wine sales. Our
benchmark is closer to Nordstrom _ the best products and
knowledgeable, passionate customer service,'' she said in a
statement.

ITEMS FOUND ON THE INTERNET DRESS UP A MUSEUM'S EXHIBITION

<P>
   As if New York museums needed more publicity the Whitney Museum
recently
</P>
<P>
   revealed that it had been involved in a fierce bidding war for a
25-year-old copy of Playgirl magazine.
</P>
<P>
   This auction didn't take place at Christie's. It took place on
the Internet. A guest museum curator, Maurice Berger, needed
everyday objects _ campaign buttons, album covers and vintage
magazines _ to include in the show ``American Century: Art and
Culture, 1900-2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending years traveling, sifting through flea
markets and other museums' collections, Berger assembled the
objects in less than six months by making bids on Ebay and other
auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said this was the first time a major art institution had
curated part of an exhibition by buying artifacts on line. The
experience had a powerful effect on his co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've addicted half the museum to Ebay,'' he said. ``I guess
I've become Ebay's most famous curator.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 350 items he collected, 160 were purchased online,
including a hotly contested copy of High Times, a magazine of drug
culture that began in the '70s, and the special Las Vegas Holiday
issue of Playgirl, dated January 1975. The items provide a social,
political and commercial context for the art in the show.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Berger was able to use the Web to find a number of
banned books, including ``The Tropic of Capricorn'' by Henry
Miller, to illustrate the themes of blacklisting and censorship in
earlier decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a 1957 edition of `Tropic of Capricorn' through
Bibliofind.com and located a bookstore in Normal, Ill., that
happened to have a copy,'' Berger said. ``It was the very edition
printed in Paris in English with the censor's mark on the back
cover. The Internet gives you pinpoint accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Curators usually organize an exhibition by selecting from the
museum's own collection and by visiting other museums, galleries,
artists' studios and collectors' homes to borrow works of art.
</P>
<P>
   But the Whitney does not own popular-culture artifacts. Berger
said he had purchased the items from online auctions because it was
more efficient than filling out hundreds of loan forms and saved on
travel costs. He spent $5,000 for objects purchased on the Net and
estimated that he would have spent three times that amount had he
gathered them off line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was less serendipity in locating what he was looking
for,'' said Maxwell Anderson, the museum director. ``He was more in
the driver's seat, with ample selection to choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever critical reaction the Whitney show may receive, Berger
will have at least secured his reputation in another forum. ``I am
now considered an excellent Ebay-er,'' he said. ``The vendor
feedback on Ebay told me I was a reputable, prompt payer.''

GAME THEORY: THE LITERARY MYTH UPDATED WITH HIGH-TECH
PRESENTATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)   (Editors: Product notes at end of review ;  Campbell excerpt should
be italicized . )  
 (bl)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ``The mythological hero, setting forth from his commonday hut or
castle, is lured, carried away, or else voluntarily proceeds, to
the threshold of adventure. There he encounters a shadow presence
that guards the passage. The hero may defeat or conciliate this
power and go alive into the kingdom of the dark, or be slain by the
opponent and descend in death. ... When he arrives at the nadir of
the mythological round, he undergoes a supreme ordeal and gains his
reward.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Joseph Campbell, ``The Hero With a Thousand Faces''
</P>
<P>
   Computer games are the primal myths of the digital age. Despite
what hundreds of ivory tower deconstructionists might say about
displaced identity and post-modern media culture, yadda yadda
yadda, most video-game adventures are a deep-dish slice of
archetypal heroism greedily consumed by young people who crave
mythic drama (though they're too cool to admit it).
</P>
<P>
   Most action-adventure games stage a descent into hell by
funneling the player into a labyrinth filled with gothic demons. In
Shadow Man, the mythic descent is more literal and more literary.
The hero, Mike LeRoi, is an erstwhile English major from New
Orleans who has been forcibly transformed into a voodoo
warrior-slave by his girlfriend, a 200-year-old priestess in the
body of a lissome 20-year-old barmaid.
</P>
<P>
   At her behest, the reluctant hero descends from the Louisiana
swamp to Deadside, where he becomes Shadow Man, a more powerful,
supernatural version of his real-world self. After a brief chat
with Jaunty the gatekeeper (a talking skull with a snake's tail, a
top hat and a thick Irish brogue), he passes into Deadside proper.
</P>
<P>
   There he discovers an apocalyptic prophecy involving serial
killers employed by the ultimate incarnation of evil. To keep the
demons of Deadside from overrunning the world, he has to track down
the killers on Earth and face the ultimate enemy in hell. For the
rest of the game, he alternates between Liveside and Deadside,
surfacing as Mike LeRoi and descending as Shadow Man, gathering
strength below for his battles above, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the symbolism, this dynamic creates a very strong
cyclical narrative because it's not possible for Mike or Shadow Man
to ``die'' in the traditional sense. Should Mike's life force be
exhausted, he passes across the veil into Deadside, where as Shadow
Man he has the power to return to the land of the living.
</P>
<P>
   There is no stop-and-start repetition, no interruption, no blind
alleys. Every action taken, in death or in life, pushes the story
forward. As the hero confronts each killer in turn, he gets closer
to the center of Deadside. As he gains strength, he is pulled
toward forces that are even more powerful. The horror at the core
is like a black hole _ the closer he gets, the more force it
exerts. Like all unknown horrors, it's deeply attractive and
terrifying at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   As the plot thickens, so does the knot in your stomach. In this
world, you feel fear. And it's not survival fear. It's not chase
scene, blockbuster, blood-and-guts fear. It's moral fear, ``Silence
of the Lambs'' fear, and profound dread.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because of the way the place looks; all the
surface textures were lifted from an illustrated encyclopedia of
skin diseases. The patterns are blurred, but you know
subconsciously that the walls and floors are festering.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the eczematous wallpaper, the landscape is modeled
after the industrial north of England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving back from playing soccer at lunchtime, and I saw
this huge disused factory that was being broken up because the
northeast is quite depressed in the U.K.,'' said Guy Miller, Shadow
Man's producer. ``And I thought that's exactly what parts of
Deadside should look like, this place of misery and desperation.
We're actually based up in Teesside in the northeast of England.
But people call it Deadside now.''
</P>
<P>
   The sound design is also exquisitely creepy (and more than makes
up for mediocre voice-overs). Shadow Man's audio effects are pure
nightmare material.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the game's emotional wallop stems from the story
structure. Primal narratives have survived thousands of years for a
reason: they work. People want to experience a heroic ordeal, and
computer games deliver, big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The player has gone through 70 hours of game play,'' Miller
said. ``And in the end he's achieved an apotheosis. That is part of
the myth: the hero achieves godhead _ he must die and return. And
in sort of a shamanic way, he has. He's gone to Deadside and back
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age of channel surfing, ``Pop-Up Video'' and attention
deficit disorder, hundreds of thousands of people are willing to
invest two working weeks in this myth.
</P>
<P>
   High school English teachers, take heart.

   NEW iMAC OFFERS MORE THAN A CHOICE OF COLORS
</P>
<P>
   With its announcement of new models of this week, Apple has
significantly redesigned and improved the iMac, its popular
computer for home and school users.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with its original philosophy of making only one version
of the iMac _ the hard part was choosing the color _ Apple has
created three models. All have features that makers of
Windows-based computers are probably already scrambling to try to
copy.
</P>
<P>
   The new iMac that most closely resembles the original has a
faster processor (a 350-megahertz G3), a faster system bus (100
MHz), more standard memory (64 megabytes), a better 3-D graphics
card for games (ATI Rage 128) and a pair of built-in Harmon Kardon
hi-fi stereo speakers, a new trap door slot on the bottom to make
it easy to add as much as 512 MB of RAM, and a simple slot that
replaces the sliding CD-ROM tray. Even with the improvements, the
new model, which comes only in blue, costs $999.
</P>
<P>
   The new iMac case, which still comes in five colors, is now
fully translucent and about an inch shorter, front to back. The
carrying handle is ringed by ventilation holes, enabling Apple to
get rid of the noisy internal fan. Apple says that the new iMac is
not only the most powerful consumer PC on the market, but also the
quietest.
</P>
<P>
   The new iMac trapdoor slot can also accommodate a $99 wireless
network card, which, when it is coupled with a $299 Apple Airport
base station, will allow two Macintoshes to communicate wirelessly
at distances up to 150 feet. Another cool iMac option is a
subwoofer from Harmon Kardon mounted in a transparent enclosure
that resembles the severed head of Robbie the Robot. It will cost
$99 when it goes to market in November.
</P>
<P>
   The next new model, for $1,299, is the iMac DV, for digital
video. Besides the other new iMAC features, the DV has a 400-MHz G3
chip, a 10-GB hard drive, a slot-loaded DVD-ROM drive instead of a
CD-ROM, a pair of Apple's Firewire high-speed connection ports for
attaching digital video cameras and other high-speed peripherals,
and connectors for attaching to color televisions, video recorders
and other video devices. It will come with Apple's Final Cut Pro
video editing software, which promises to do for home video what
desktop publishing software did for newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   The third new iMac is the DV Special Edition, which will be
available only in a translucent gray color scheme that was
introduced last month in the new G4 professional desktop
Macintoshes. The Special Edition will have a 13-GB hard disk and
128 MB of RAM, and will cost $1,499.
</P>
<P>
   Apple said all three models would be available this week. But
the company has been hurt by product shortages and shipping delays
for almost all of its most important recent products, including the
G4 desktops, the iBook portables and the Airport wireless
networking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pretty much just about caught up with demand,'' said
Apple's top executive, Steve Jobs.

   TALKING TO THE WEB ON YOUR TELEPHONE
</P>
<P>
   To most people who follow wireless communication, phone-based
Web browsing means reading two or three lines of text on tiny
display screens. But Nuance, a voice-recognition company based in
Menlo Park, Calif., has created an invisible Web browser called
Voyager that responds to voice commands instead of pushed buttons
or mouse clicks. It is designed to be used by people speaking
through a regular or mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you dialed into Voyager, you could gain access
to a series of audible bookmarks for say, your favorite travel
site, a search engine, or a news page. If you wanted to book a
flight on the travel site, you could simply speak into the phone
and ask for one. The travel site might ask you to confirm arrival
times or airport locations and, instead of requesting a code number
or password, could verify your identity by listening to your voice.
</P>
<P>
   When you were done with that transaction, you would not have to
hang up the phone to continue Web browsing. You could simply ask
Voyager to take you to a news page, list your bookmarks, or even
dial a specific number for you.
</P>
<P>
   Nuance's officials are now talking with representatives from Web
sites so that they may format their Web pages to handle voice-based
browsing. And it has signed deals with telephone companies, like
British Telecom, to begin trials next year.
</P>
<P>
   But will people really want to browse the Web by voice? Ronald
Croen, president and chief executive of Nuance, thinks so _
especially if they are in a car or somewhere that a computer screen
is not available or safe to look at. Croen equates the convenience
of Voyager with voice-mail boxes in which people can leave long
messages without having to ask a receptionist to write everything
down. ``In some cases,'' he said, ``we really do prefer to talk to
machines rather than people.''
</P>
<P>
   _ LISA GUERNSEY
</P>
<P>
   A BOOK THAT TEACHES CHILDREN HOW TO READ
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Johnny can't read, but if he can crack open the latest
booklike electronic gadget, there may be hope.
</P>
<P>
   Leap Pad, from Leap Frog, an educational toy company in
Emeryville, Calif., is a learn-to-read tool that on the outside, at
least, resembles an iBook laptop computer. Open it up, though, and
there is not a keyboard or screen to be found _ just an electronic
pen and the blank plastic inside the covers.
</P>
<P>
   But fit a special spiral-bound book into the plastic covers,
touch the pen to the pages, and Leap Pad becomes an interactive
storybook. Children can hear each page read aloud, or tap
individual words to hear their component phonemes. The pages also
feature games and other activities to help maintain interest in
reading. (A green ``go'' circle on each page must be tapped to
synchronize the paper book with the electronic book.)
</P>
<P>
   The Leap Pad is intended for children 4 and older and is
available in two versions. Both the basic (about $60) and deluxe
(about $90) models include a 32-page starter book; the deluxe
version adds two more books narrated by Whoopi Goldberg, with
accompanying plug-in cartridges. Other book-cartridge combinations
are available for about $11 and up.
</P>
<P>
   The starter book features a story about three frogs and a loose
tooth, as well as excerpts from a Richard Scarry book and a Winnie
the Pooh tale. It also includes an interactive map of the United
States and a human skeleton to teach the Latin names for the bones
of the body. So even if Johnny never learns to read, maybe he can
still become a doctor.

   COMPAQ SLIMS DOWN A NEW DESKTOP PC
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. has never been known for sleek PC designs,
and until now its line of Presario consumer computers have taken up
more desk space than most of competitors. But earlier this week
Compaq introduced the Presario 3550, a supermodel-thin system that
includes a 15-inch flat-panel LCD monitor, a ``slim tower'' case
that is less than half the size of other Presarios, and a set of
flat-panel speakers from Monsoon, all in a metallic, midnight-blue
casing.
</P>
<P>
   The Presario 3550 is based on a 500-megahertz Intel Celeron
processor and comes with a CD-RW drive as standard equipment. The
list price is $1,999.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been hinting lately that the Presario 3550 is just
the first of several new computer systems that will break the
company's beige-box tradition.

 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Standing on Rockefeller Plaza, looking across the
skating rink toward Fifth Avenue, it looks as if a prairie has
flown in and landed on the Channel Gardens. Grasses the color of
wheat nod their seed heads in the breeze, and sparrows swoop across
the water channels. The yellowing leaves of crape myrtles drift
across the slate walkway, as fall moves through the city.
</P>
<P>
   This garden, as ephemeral as the changing season, will last only
until next Thursday, and it's a gift to a city always rushing to
make deadlines and corporate decisions and Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by David Kamp, a landscape architect, in collaboration
with other designers interested in restorative gardens, it
transforms this grand stone space of vertical buildings and sky,
for a fleeting two weeks, into a softer, more natural place of calm
and meditation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are calm, you experience more,'' said Kamp, whose
firm Dirtworks specializes in therapeutic design. ``There's so much
visual clutter in the city, so much noise. This garden might seem
boring in a sense, but it's calming.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no jazzy orange pumpkins here this year, no purple
ornamental cabbages. In fact, the branches of those crape myrtles
have been carefully unpruned, and their seed pods, as black and
wrinkled as raisins, look a bit ratty. Which is intentional,
because this is fall, and nature doesn't go around tidying up for
the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they would stop sweeping up the leaves,'' Kamp said
wistfully, as we watched them float down from the trees. But, of
course, they will, because this is Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   These trees and grasses are planted with the same elegant
formality. The tall grass, Miscanthus sinensis Nippon, forms a
buff-colored wall on either side of the water channel, echoing the
color and lines of the limestone buildings that flank the space _
as well as the tower of 30 Rockefeller Center that soars over the
skating rink to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp points out how the 20 crape myrtle trees frame the Fifth
Avenue entrance, punctuate a cross-axis walkway and finally frame
the west end of a central bed of white daisylike chrysanthemums.
The mottled gray and orange-red bark of the trees picks up the
subtle tones of limestone, slate and granite. Their placement, in
deep planter boxes set at right angles to the water channel, turn
what is essentially a promenade into a restful series of garden
nooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We added the boxes to close off the garden a little more,''
said Nancy Gerlach, a garden designer specializing in healing
landscapes. ``They invite you to walk into the garden and sit down
on a bench and have a conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamp, whose work includes grand spaces like the Parliament house
in Canberra, Australia, said: ``This is the essence of design: You
ask yourself, `What is the space? What is the scale and context?
And how do you relate plants to it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kamp talked of the effect of Rockefeller Plaza on the emotions:
the way the buildings ``pull back'' and allow a space that cradles
the humans pausing here.
</P>
<P>
   The seed heads of the miscanthus nodded slightly in the wind.
``I can't tell you how many people have come along and drawn their
hands up these seed heads,'' Kamp said, doing just that. And as the
sun rose over the buildings, the silky tassels glowed with a white
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kaplans call this soft fascination,'' Ms. Gerlach said,
referring to the work of Michigan environmental psychologists
Stephen and Rachel Kaplan on nature's restorative effects. ``It's
like watching squirrels in the park. It takes your mind off things,
but it's not enough to stimulate you. It's the garden equivalent of
fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the miscanthus echoes the verticals of the buildings,
it's more like a veil, allowing you to see people strolling along
the opposite side. Shorter grasses (Pennisetum alopecuroides
Hameln) form another soft wall to look through, if you are sitting
on a bench, and a blue-green aquatic grass, Juncus, frames the
fountains of Triton and Nereids riding their spouting dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   It is this contrast of soft and hard that is so arresting _ and
restful at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why you put an antique in a modern room,'' Kamp said.
</P>
<P>
   We sat for a while, watching the dappled light and shade move
across the Channel Gardens and we almost forgot to go to work.

   RUSSIA-YELTSIN-FAMILY (Omsk, Russia) _ Leonid Dyachenko,
son-in-law of President Boris Yeltsin and husband of Yeltsin's
daughter and right-hand strategist, Tatiyana Dyachenko, was once so
anonymous that even prying reporters were unsure of his first name.
But Dyachenko turns out to have a colorful life indeed. He is a
participant, if not a key figure, in a network of politically
blessed companies that ship Siberian oil products to Ukraine and to
eastern Europe. The disclosure of his dealings is at the least
embarrassing to the Kremlin. At worst, it could plunge the Yeltsin
family into a corruption sinkhole over which, so far, they have
managed only to teeter. By Michael Wines.

URBANE, HUMANE BIOGRAPHY DOES JUSTICE TO TOM FOLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As longtime aide Jeff Biggs worked on a biography of former
House Speaker Tom Foley, friends wondered about the outcome of a
gentlemanly tug-of-war: Biggs wanted humor and insight, while Foley
seemed inclined toward pontifical reflection.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, this is one instance in which staff set the agenda.
``Honor in the House: Speaker Tom Foley'' has emerged as a humane,
urbane book, an accurate depiction of the Spokane Democrat
described by GOP Sen. Slade Gorton as ``the number one citizen of
the state that I represented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One was a fighter, the other a healer,'' Biggs writes,
contrasting House Speaker Jim Wright with his successor. For most
of his 30 years in the House, Foley was a symbol of civility and
the coexistence of partisan fervor with personal good will.
</P>
<P>
   As an anti-Congress populism took hold in the early 1990s,
however, this man who quoted DeToqueville proved no match for the
cut-and-slash, confrontational politics of Newt Gingrich, who urged
his followers to read such books as ``Panzer Leader,'' the memoirs
of Nazi Germany's tank commander Heinz Guderian. In 1994, Foley
became the first House Speaker in 134 years to lose his bid for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman John Dingell put it
accurately, in a telling reflection on Foley, when he said: ``He's
a gentleman _ perhaps too much so for the circumstances he finds
himself in.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is structured so that Biggs' analysis alternates with
Foley's reflections. The former speaker, who now serves as U.S.
ambassador to Japan, has an ear for the revealing anecdote.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Foley tells how Ronald Reagan, early in his
presidency, began to regale congressional leaders with his oft-told
(but untrue) story about the Chicago ``welfare queen'' with two
BMWs and a Mercedes. One of the Gipper's ideological allies, House
Republican Conference chairman Jack Kemp, whispered to Foley:
``This is all campaign (bleep). I wish he'd get off this stuff.
Nobody cares about this anymore. And it's all in his imagination
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley recalls the bullying of powerful chairmen in the closed
Congress of the 1960s. A powerful old pork barreler, Rep. Mike
Kirwin of Ohio, admonished freshmen on the greatest mistake they
could make at the start of a career in Congress. ``That great
danger, above all else, is ... thinking for yourselves,'' Kirwin
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Congress would become a lot more open and democratic, but a lot
more ideological, during Foley's time on Capitol Hill. But aside
from a 1989 decision to shed 80 pounds and start pumping iron,
Foley was changed little by three decades of public life or the
assumption of high office.
</P>
<P>
   Son of a judge and protege of the late Sen. Henry Jackson, Foley
was careful, deliberate and resistant to moods of the moment. Power
sought him out, not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring a plea from Foley, the upstart 1974 class of House
Democratic freshmen deposed reactionary Texas Rep. W.R. Poage as
chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. They promptly elected
Foley to take his place. Foley graciously eased Poage's humiliation
by naming him committee vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in 1989 Foley supported the embattled Jim Wright
until the moment Wright was forced to resign the speakership.
Although the subject of personal smears, he took no retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   A life in politics can change people in strange ways. One of
Foley's aides in the 1960s, newspaperman Dick Larsen, was to become
a conservative polemicist, emerging in the 1990s as an
image-shaping Henry Higgins to Jennifer Dunn's Eliza Dolittle.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress rise in self-esteem and acquire a
retinue of sycophants of the type that surrounded Jim Wright.
Incumbency can instill impatience with ordinary folk. More than one
veteran Washington congressman has left a meeting with angry
constituents muttering, ``What those people don't know is. ...''
</P>
<P>
   None of this happened to Foley. He maintained a fine
self-deprecating sense of humor. He surrounded himself with a
brainy staff, several of them (including Biggs) former
Congressional Fellows. He made the rounds of town meetings in
Eastern Washington, never leaving until the last question was
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Foley was anchored by beliefs. A civil libertarian,
he opposed a stream of what he called ``unnecessary and unneeded''
constitutional amendments, including such popular proposals as a
ban on flag burning. He paid a political price by serving as lead
plaintiff to a successful legal challenge against an initiative
that imposed term limits on federal elected officials. The
well-heeled Americans for Term Limits would pump $300,000 into an
anti-Foley advertising campaign in his district.
</P>
<P>
   To those on the political right who promoted such amendments,
Foley gave a stinging rejoinder: ``If it is not conservative to
protect the Bill of Rights, then I don't know what conservatism is
today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honor in the House'' is, at times, a candid book. It discusses
in-House resentment at Foley's wife, who served as unpaid chief of
staff to her husband. A lawyer of strong opinions, Heather Foley
refused to heed unwritten Capitol Hill rules of conformity. She
found sandals comfortable, often wore her hair in pigtails and took
on the administrative burdens to which her husband was oblivious.
</P>
<P>
   The result was plenty of old-boy grumbling. When Heather Foley
interrupted a meeting to deliver a message to her husband, House
Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski sneered: ``Who
was that? Pocahontas?'' The anecdote appears in the book, along
with the famous story of the distaff Foley, who suffered from
asthma, asking then-Speaker Tip O'Neill to put out his smelly
cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the book downplay the ugliness of the '94 campaign, in
which ``hot talk'' programs carried a steady drumbeat of anti-Foley
hate. The low point of excess was Todd Herman of KSBN radio, who
labeled Foley ``the Sphincter of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   In places, however, Biggs and Foley hold their fire. Endless,
tedious endorsement editorials from the Spokane Spokesman-Review
are quoted. But nowhere is it mentioned that Foley's hometown
newspaper shut down its Washington, D.C., bureau just as he was
becoming House Majority leader. It is not for nothing that the
Inland Empire is sometimes called the ``Ingrown Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley delivers a cerebral critique of Gingrich's leadership
style, but no sense of the raw partisan ugliness that has gripped
the House over the past four years. Biggs and Foley make no
reference to the fact that GOP Rep. George Nethercutt, the man who
beat him, has reneged on his pledge to serve only three terms.
After running on the slogan ``a listener, not a Speaker,''
Nethercutt has made himself far less open to constituents and
criticism than was his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honor in the House'' makes the reader long for the lost comity
and bipartisanship of Capitol Hill. One hopes that Foley's style
has not gone out of style.
</P>

A BEATTY PRESIDENTIAL RUN WOULD SPICE UP THE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 10)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warren Beatty's decision to sip provocatively of
the aphrodisiac of presidential politics recalls an incident that
occurred when another Hollywood actor drank heartily of that
pungent potion.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1966. Ronald Reagan had just been elected governor
of California, and I asked the state's junior senator, Republican
Thomas Kuchel, how he thought the former actor would fare in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor fellow,'' replied Kuchel, shaking his head. ``In two
weeks, he'll fall flat on his ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans, in and out of politics, shared that assessment
of the handsome, 55-year-old actor who had been propelled into
elective politics by wealthy conservatives following his eloquent
televised appeal on behalf of Barry Goldwater's disastrous
presidential bid in 1964. But, as we all know now, their judgment
was totally wrong.

   Reagan went on to serve two successful terms as governor and two
as president. Among conservatives nationwide, he has become a folk
hero. Among current presidential hopefuls, he is the president most
often cited as a role model.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kuchel, a delightful human being and a very good senator,
he was defeated in the GOP Senate primary two years later by
Reagan's conservative operatives under the command of Caspar
Weinberger. They did so by mounting a strong campaign behind the
state's right-wing superintendent of public instruction, Max
Rafferty.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Rafferty was defeated in the general election by
Alan Cranston, a liberal Democrat, at the same time California
Republican Richard Nixon was elected president.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kuchel, he not only misjudged Reagan, he also declined to
support the former actor's candidacy for governor beyond a lukewarm
declaration that he would vote for him. To the staunch Reaganites
of that era, he carried an additional burden. The moderate
Republican benefactor who named Kuchel to Nixon's Senate seat when
Nixon was elevated to vice president in 1953 was California's
then-governor, Earl Warren, who was anathema to the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   That long-ago conversation with Kuchel came to mind as Beatty
appeared before an audience of liberal Democrats in Los Angeles to
accept the Americans for Democratic Action Eleanor Roosevelt award.
</P>
<P>
   Where Reagan entered the political arena from the right, Beatty,
a youthful 62, is entering from the left. His concern, he told his
audience, is that the Democratic Party ``is drifting'' and ``being
enslaved by big money.''
</P>
<P>
   He described himself as a Franklin Roosevelt-Harry Truman-Adlai
Stevenson-Hubert Humphrey-John Kennedy Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   All of that might appear unimportant had Reagan not made it
acceptable for an actor to leap from a Hollywood sound stage to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   When Reagan first took the plunge into elective politics, Beatty
was a promising young actor who had appeared opposite Vivien Leigh
in ``The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone'' and Natalie Wood in
``Splendor in the Grass.'' While Reagan was in his first term in
Sacramento, Beatty scored heavily as the Depression-era bank robber
in ``Bonnie and Clyde.'' In 1981, he won an Oscar for his direction
of the movie ``Reds.''
</P>
<P>
   He had an additional claim to fame: he was the brother of screen
star Shirley MacLaine, a member of the Frank Sinatra's ``Rat Pack''
that partied with President John Kennedy on his journeys to
California.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Gahagan Douglas, the musical comedy star who was married
to actor Melvyn Douglas, may have been the pioneer in traversing
the road from Hollywood to Washington. She served three terms in
the House in the 1940s and was defeated by Nixon when she sought to
move up to the Senate in 1950. A down-the-line liberal Democrat,
she was labeled the ``Pink Lady'' by Nixon, who implied that her
votes in Congress followed the communist line.
</P>
<P>
   Motion picture song-and-dance man George Murphy, a conservative
like Reagan, served one undistinguished term in the U.S. Senate in
the 1960s. Sonny Bono, in his post-Cher persona, was a member of
the House when he died on a California ski slope.
</P>
<P>
   Now other celebrities are toying with public office, following
in the footsteps Jesse Ventura, who lunged from the professional
wrestling ring to the governorship of Minnesota last year.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Schwarzenegger has indicated his desire to follow in
Reagan's footsteps and seek the California governorship in 2004.
But even if he wins, Schwarzenegger cannot hope to move into the
White House because he is not a native-born American. He was born
in Austria 52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cybill Shepherd, the lanky blonde star of both the big and
little screens, has indicated an interest in seeking the presidency
so that she can guarantee a woman's ``right to choose'' on the
abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is that other celebrity who is not a paid actor,
developer Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   As the field gets crowded with non-politicians seeking to become
politicians, it recalls another story from the past.
</P>
<P>
   When movie producer Samuel Goldwyn, who had been wholly
indoctrinated into Hollywood type-casting, was informed that Reagan
would run for president, he reportedly replied, ``No! Jimmy Stewart
for president, Ronald Reagan for best friend.'' If he were around
today and were told that Beatty might seek the presidency, Goldwyn
might declare, ``No! Harrison Ford for president. Warren Beatty for
the first lady's lover.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty cannot be kissed off lightly. He has an unusual advantage
over other presidential hopefuls, with the possible exception of
Trump, who appears eager to become the Reform Party candidate. If
Beatty could garner the votes of all his former girl friends, he
probably could win hands down.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years ago this fall, the Internet got its start as the
Arpanet, a federally-financed computer network for universities and
military sites. That network has gradually morphed into today's
Internet, which 200 million people around the world use, misuse,
cherish and curse.
</P>
<P>
   About three years ago, a project called Internet2 began. It
involves a new high-speed data backbone connecting universities,
much like the way they were connected in the original Arpanet. It
is one of several attempts to steer a future course for the
connected world, a reinvention of the Net meant to feed new
technologies to the public eventually. But opinion is divided on
whether it is the bridge to the 21st century or an expensive dead
end.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the Internet2 project, whose users are almost
exclusively at universities, say it is a unique sandbox in which
researchers can conduct experiments in areas like advanced
videoconference techniques, virtual reality and telemedicine. They
say the technological innovations to emerge from the project will
quickly filter down to the ``commodity'' Internet, as the general
Internet is sometimes called.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the project is falling short of its original
goals, that it has little technical innovation to show for three
years of work and that much of Internet2's prodigious capacity
often stands idle. Further, they say, the expense to universities
outweighs the project's usefulness to faculty and students.
</P>
<P>
   Internet2 started with much fanfare in 1996 as a high-capacity
private network for researchers at universities to use for
developing and testing futuristic applications that require a lot
of bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who started Internet2 were looking back on this
kind of nostalgically as the days when universities had the Net to
themselves and now they don't,'' said Dr. Vinton Cerf, an Internet
leader who is senior vice president for Internet architecture and
technology at MCI Worldcom, which supplies part of the high-speed
backbone for Internet2. ``And now they were all going to get
together and build their own backbone. They seemed to be moving
back to the stage where they had a Net to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The promise surrounding the new network held a definite appeal
for those who joined. ``Internet2 was built largely on a field of
dreams _ if you build it, they will come,'' said Ira Fuchs, the
vice president for computing and information technology at
Princeton University, an Internet2 member. ``The hope was that you
build the infrastructure, make it available, and there will be
applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, Internet2 has grown to include 163 member
institutions; it has the backing of 20 corporate partners.
Astronomers use the network to send huge data sets from telescopes
and to manipulate those faraway telescopes. Medical researchers use
it to view complex anatomical models from many miles away.
Successful demonstrations of high-definition television
transmissions have taken place over the network. And network
specialists at several universities are using the Internet2 project
to conduct experiments in computer networking itself.
</P>
<P>
   Internet2 is similar to the Internet in its earlier days in that
its use is limited to those universities and a handful of corporate
research centers that pay for the high-speed connection. If a
researcher at an institution wants to send data to a researcher
elsewhere over Internet2, both institutions must belong to the
network.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to universities is high. Helped by subsidies from the
National Science Foundation, each campus pays $500,000 to $1
million or more a year to gain local access to the high-speed
Internet2 backbone and upgrade its campus network so the network
can deliver data to campus desktops at a guaranteed speed of at
least 10 megabits per second, which is 10 million bits per second.
That is nearly 200 times as fast as a modem handling 56,000 bits
per second.
</P>
<P>
   But the foundation is scheduled to discontinue its subsidies
next April, and some Internet2 members are beginning to view the
cost as an unwelcome burden. ``Someone forgot to tell the
universities how expensive Internet2 will be when the subsidies go
away,'' said Dr. David Farber, a professor of computer science at
the University of Pennsylvania. At most universities, Farber said,
faculty involvement in Internet2-related projects is minimal, at
best.
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs of Princeton said he knew of no universities that are
seriously considering withdrawing from the project. But Fuchs,
Farber and others agreed that additional funds generated by faculty
research grants were crucial to help defray the cost of the
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without campuswide support, the bill will be more than the
administrator will be willing to pay,'' Farber said.
</P>
<P>
   Applications that require a high-capacity network are at the
center of the project's charter. One project, still in the
formative phase, is called Gumbo, which stands for Grand Unified
Modeling of Biological Organisms. Led by researchers at the
California Institute of Technology, the project will create highly
ambitious computer models of biological systems by having computers
at many places on the network work on pieces of the problem, a
strategy called distributed computing.
</P>
<P>
   Another project, perhaps the one best suited to Internet2, is
called tele-immersion; it is under the direction of Jaron Lanier,
who is known for his work with virtual reality and is also the
co-director of the Gumbo project. Tele-immersion, an advanced form
of virtual reality, lets users in different places interact in real
time in a shared simulated environment, making them feel as if they
were in the same room. Instead of the gear often associated with
virtual reality _ body suits, goggles, gloves _ tele-immersion uses
a ``tele-cubicle,'' which is equipped with large screens, scanners,
sensors and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``With prior forms of virtual reality, you're in an entirely
synthetic environment so that people end up looking like
cartoons,'' Lanier said. ``With tele-immersion, the goal is
complete realism so that people look real, they feel real and the
environment they're in, such as their office, feels real and you
feel like you're really there.'' Lanier said he hoped that the
project would be ready for a full working demonstration by April.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to see me just as if I was right in front of you,
in three dimensions,'' said Allan Weis, chief executive of Advanced
Network and Services, a nonprofit organization based in Armonk,
N.Y., that is an Internet2 corporate partner and is sponsoring the
tele-immersion project. ``You can touch me on a shoulder, and I'll
feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tele-immersion is ideal for Internet2, Lanier said. ``The goal
is to stress the network,'' he said. ``We're really trying to push
Internet2 to its limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Applications like tele-immersion require what network
researchers call quality of service, the ability to assign
priorities and types of service to different types of data.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're transmitting an X-ray of someone's lung, you can't
afford losses of data,'' said Dr. Lawrence Landweber, a professor
of computer science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
``You've got to get it all, because you don't want to miss that
spot on the lung. But you can have it be delayed. If you're looking
at a real-time video of somebody, on the other hand, and you're
interacting with them, you can't afford to have a delay, but you
can lose some data.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Wood, an Internet2 spokesman, said a plan for introducing
quality of service over Internet2 would be tested in the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say Internet2 suffers from a dearth of highly demanding
applications. Projects like tele-immersion, Landweber said, are the
exception, not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the actual utilization of the network is far below
its capacity. Aside from an occasional burst of activity, which can
make parts of the network run at as much as 100 percent of
capacity, the usual utilization figure hovers around 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Douglas Van Houweling, president of the University
Corporation for Advanced Internet Development, a nonprofit
organization that oversees the Internet2 project, sees it
differently. As long as people are using the new system to run
applications that do not take full advantage of its capacity, the
network will be underutilized. ``The key is to raise people's eyes
to see a new horizon of advanced Internet applications,'' he said,
``and I think that's clearly happening, but it's not happening
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The job of drumming up interest among faculty members has fallen
to Ted Hanss, Internet2's self-described evangelist _ his official
title is director of applications development. He is frequently on
the road, visiting campuses to raise awareness among faculty
members. ``To engage faculty, you need to give them confidence that
there's a long-term commitment on the part of university
administrators to keep the infrastructure,'' Hanss said. ``They
don't want to be told it's going away.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The group of companies providing the Internet2 backbone has made
a firm commitment to keep it in service until 2003. What might
happen after that is unclear. ``We'll work to insure
high-performance network capabilities among universities beyond
2003,'' Wood said. ``That's part of our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the original Internet, which gradually metamorphosed into
a network for the general public, Internet2 will most likely
remain, in some form, in the academic domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our intention to take the Internet2 backbone and make
it a public thing, but to make what we learn in the project a
public thing,'' Van Houweling said. ``I don't know that we'll ever
name it Internet 3 or 4. But the whole objective is that the things
we do become a part of the Internet that everyone is able to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that technology transfer will take place through the
project's corporate partners, Van Houweling said. ``Let's say we
figure out a way of doing quality of service,'' he said. ``Then
Cisco and others will adopt those standards in their products and
ship them out to commodity consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely such companies that are stealing a march on
Internet2, the project's critics say. ``I'm not sure what Internet2
has taught us about building the next-generation network,''
Landweber said. ``The reality today is there's a lot of interesting
work, but it's mostly being done in the bowels of companies like
Cisco, AT&AMP;T and Lucent.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2.4 gigabits per second, Internet2 may be fast, but, some of
its critics say, not fast enough. ``If you said you'd supply a
network with a bandwidth of 5 gigabits to my department, I'd say,
`Hey that's an interesting field of dreams,''' Farber said. ``But
Internet2 is nowhere near that.'' Cerf of MCI Worldcom agreed. ``My
sense is that it isn't far enough ahead of where industry is,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Houweling, however, said the capacity of Abilene, part of
the Internet2 backbone, would quadruple in the next year, to nearly
10 megabits per second. ``All of our forward thinking is based on
the assumption that we're going to have a hard time keeping up with
the demands of the applications,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in Internet2 is not a requirement for high-speed data
transmission. MCI Worldcom recently announced vBNS(plus), a
commercial service that is similar to one the company already
provides for a portion of Internet2 traffic. The new vBNS(plus)
service is now available to all college campuses as well as to
corporate research laboratories.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That announcement caught the eye of Michael Ribaudo, who is
university dean for instructional technology and information
services at the City University of New York. Ribaudo, who oversees
his university's technology purchases, held his university back
from joining Internet2, and all of the peripheral expenses that go
with it, when it started, and now he considers himself vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been proven correct to buy the bandwidth as a
commodity item from a provider such as MCI,'' he said. ``It's a
smarter way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ribaudo hastened to add that he was not speaking for all
universities. ``I'm just saying that Internet2 isn't for
everyone.''

   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly large
difference between Indianapolis (no. 1) and Jacksonville (2), and a
much smaller difference between Jacksonville (2) and Dallas (3).

SEEING RED ABOUT PEOPLE WHO RUN LIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it seems like a lot of drivers are running red lights these
days, it's because they are.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey conducted by researchers at Old Dominion
University in Norfolk, Va., 55.8 percent of those polled confessed
to the crime of zipping through a stoplight. Which raises a
question: If nearly 56 percent of drivers admit to red-light
running, how many more do you suppose are doing it but don't want
to talk about it?
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press article on the survey quoted the chief
researcher, Bryan Porter:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough red light runners out there that when you
come up to an intersection and you stop, your first worry should be
what's coming the other way. I tell you, if you do this research
long enough, you will get frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a news flash: I haven't done any research on this subject
other than reading the AP story about it _ but I'm still
frightened.
</P>
<P>
   I was especially frightened a few days ago when I started across
Henderson Street in Fort Worth and had to slam on the brakes when a
car came flying through the intersection several seconds after the
light had changed. The nitwit driving that car must have been half
a block away when the light turned red.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Dominion research suggests that this sort of thing is a
problem everywhere. But if 56 percent of drivers nationwide are
running red lights, I'll bet that the percentage in Texas is 96.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the rules of the road have changed recently, a yellow
light is a warning to motorists that they should slow down and get
ready to stop because the light is about to turn red. But many
Texas drivers apparently consider it to be exactly the opposite:
Here, the yellow light is obviously a directive to slam the gas
pedal to the floor and barrel through the intersection _ even if
the light goes red before you get to it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that such lawbreaking occurs only in Texas; I'm
saying that it happens in Texas with mind-boggling frequency.
</P>
<P>
   It took me a while to figure this out when I first started
driving in the Lone Star State on a regular basis. At first, I was
thoroughly baffled at the way cars would just sit, not moving an
inch, when a traffic light turned green.
</P>
<P>
   What are these people doing, I wondered. Taking a nap? Window
shopping? Working the crossword puzzle in the newspaper?
</P>
<P>
   I even suspected at one point that whoever was driving the first
car in line would sit through darn near the entire green light just
to annoy the drivers behind him. I thought maybe it was some sort
of gamesmanship by which the guy in front tried to see if he could
wait just long enough to get through on the green light or
left-turn arrow while forcing everyone else to wait through another
red.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I got it. Green does not mean ``go'' around these
parts; green means that it's time to sit and wait for the red-light
runners to clear the intersection. Sometimes two or three cars will
run one red light.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Where did these folks get the idea that a red light is merely a
suggestion?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I don't get around enough, but I have never seen one of
these red-light violators pulled over by a police officer. I'm sure
the cops hand out plenty of tickets to red-light runners; I've just
never seen it happen.
</P>
<P>
   The AP report about the survey also included some statistics
from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The DOT says that
red-light runners are involved in 89,000 car crashes each year _
crashes that cause 82,000 injuries and nearly 1,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody does it, all demographics, all types of people,''
said Bryan Porter. ``We've all run red lights.''
</P>
<P>
   The penchant for running red lights is all the more amazing when
you consider that 98 percent of the drivers polled said they were
well aware that the practice is dangerous. Why do they do it?
</P>
<P>
   Because they're in a hurry. That's what 47.8 percent told the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The red-light runners not only don't stop for stoplights; they
evidently don't stop to think how long it takes to go to the
hospital.

   STEPHENVILLE, Texas _ At many rural Texas high schools, a prayer
before a weekend football game has been as much a part of the
autumn ritual as exuberant cheerleaders, die-hard boosters and
homecoming queens. But a recent ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals silences school-sponsored prayer at the games. The
court action, some local officials and pastors say, runs contrary
to the deeply held religious beliefs shared by many people in these
Bible-belt communities. Some schools openly defy the ruling, others
use imaginative maneuvers to get around it, and all bemoan the

POUND FOR POUND, GO WITH THE GAL

 (ATTN: Wash., Nev.)  (rk) 
 By BOB PADECKY   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like you, I was concerned when I heard that this Saturday night
in Seattle a woman is going to fight a man in the first officially
sanctioned mixed-gender boxing match in the sport's history.
</P>
<P>
   As mixed genders go, you can't mix 'em any more dangerously than
this, unless a woman asks her husband to clean up after himself. So
it was natural to wonder if maybe the wee lass Margaret MacGregor
from Bremerton, Wash., was in over her head a bit on this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret? Shoot, she's a rough customer,'' said Bob Jarvis, a
Seattle trainer and promoter who made the fight happen. ``She has a
long record of assault in Bremerton. She'd get drunk, pick fights
with sailors and then beat the hell out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's definitely not your everyday girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, mom, I want to introduce you to my girlfriend, Margaret,
who has a terrific right cross.
</P>
<P>
   What would you expect of a woman who, when Jarvis first
suggested the idea, jumped at the chance? This is a 35-year old
woman who grew up as a street fighter, was nicknamed ``Tiger''
because of her aggressiveness, knocked out a drunk who was sassing
some kids on a street corner, even served some time in the joint.
</P>
<P>
   When she was a kid and her older sisters would torment her, as
older siblings tend to do, Margaret would bite off the heads of
their Barbie dolls, according to boxing writer Scott Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, you do not want to tease Margaret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you be afraid to aggravate Margaret?'' I asked Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' Jarvis said, ``I'd hook the hell out of her. Go ahead
and print that. We're good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Geez, can you tell this is a boxing story?
</P>
<P>
   Margaret stopped talking to the media last Monday to concentrate
on the fight. Her opponent, Loi Chow, still will speak publicly if
you pay him. According to Jarvis, Chow charged the London Daily
Mail newspaper $150 for an interview and stopped talking to the
producers of the television show ``Extra!'' when they refused to
pay his cab fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a wad of bills on him that would choke a horse,''
Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   Only in America. Only in boxing. Where the outrageous is the
norm because what passes for the norm usually is boring and
unquotable. And how can you promote a fight that way?
</P>
<P>
   Chow claims, for example, that he speaks several languages, does
two-finger push-ups with one hand tied behind his back, is a
commodities broker in Vancouver, B.C., and a horse jockey. Chuck
Stark of the Bremerton Sun, however, has talked to jockeys who have
been in the Pacific Northwest for the last 25 years and none of
them have heard of Chow, who is a year younger than MacGregor.
</P>
<P>
   Stark is still checking out Chow's claim he can turn sourdough
into salmon.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, of course, irritates Marc Ratner, executive
director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am adamantly opposed to that fight,'' Ratner said. ``I would
go to court to prevent it here. Boxing is a brutal sport. The issue
is safety. But you also have a sport which has suffered enough
indignities without this.''
</P>
<P>
   A sham. A joke. A travesty. What are we talking about here? Mike
Tyson saying he'd bite off Evander Holyfield's ear again if he had
the chance? The decision in the Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad
fight? A woman fighting a man? You want mockery? Where do you draw
the line? Boxing doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   If boxing wasn't around, you might say, we'd invent it so we
could have for our amusement a sport so excessive, flamboyant and
absurd. No, we couldn't. We couldn't get boxing past the censors,
the religious right or people who specialize in common sense. If
boxing was a bill, it would never get out of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But a woman with a colorful past will fight a man with a
colorful past this Saturday night at Seattle's Mercer Arena. Media
from all over the world have applied for credentials. With the
circus in the background, a line has been crossed. As Forrest Gump
might say, outrageous is as outrageous does and so, in this case, I
take the woman, by a TKO, in the third round.

   1975: The word ``fajita'' appears in print for the first time.
From the Spanish ``faja,'' for ``girdle'' or ``strip,'' the word
actually means the cut of meat itself. Cooking the meat over wood
has always been a Texas tradition, but how the name derived is
anyone's guess _ including that of Homero Recio, who used a
fellowship to Texas A&AMP;M in 1984 to study the subject. But Texas
restaurants should probably thank Ninfa Laurenzo for popularizing
the item when she put it on her menu at the original Ninfa's in
Houston in 1973 as tacos ``al carbon.''

   Single was sexy in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in response to the politically and socially tumultuous
1960s, the '70s were all about ``me.'' My life, my job, my
indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   A war in Vietnam tore this country apart by the timeit was
finally over. President Nixon lost his job, throwing the country
into further disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Felix and Oscar showed us that it was all right, although often
loony, to be divorced. The Bradys portrayed families that were
reconstructed and blended. Mary Richards proved that living ``la
dolce sola'' could be a hat-flinging good time.
</P>
<P>
   T.G.I.Friday's had 10 locations by 1975, popular spots for
singles sipping the likes of fuzzy navels and tequila sunrises as
they noshed on potato skins.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's, and its copycats, were often decorated with a plethora
of well-displayed junk and hanging plants, leading to the term
``fern bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Further liberated by the feminist movement, women who chose to
work outside the home as well as raise children had help from food
producers always willing to make things easier. Breakfast could be
purchased at McDonald's, and food processors became a part of the
home kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   While ethnic foods were no longer relegated to the coasts, where
most immigrants landed, Americans were far from the familiarity
with foreign food that they were to reach by the end of the
century. There were Taco Bell locations in tiny towns in Missouri,
but President Ford still did not know to remove the corn husk from
a tamale before eating it.
</P>
<P>
   And as always, the American diet continued to fuel debate.
</P>
<P>
   The beliefs espoused in communes and by hippies of the 1960s
moved into the culinary mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Madison was one of a group of American Zen Buddhists who
opened the acclaimed Greens vegetarian restaurant in San Francisco
in 1979. (Not surprisingly, Madison now lives in Santa Fe.) Quaker
Oats introduced granola to the mainstream supermarket in 1972.
Yogurt was no longer relegated to Greek and Middle Eastern
enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   And low-fat became big business, as the extreme thinness that
was so chic in the 1960s continued to be considered the height of
beauty. The weight-loss method of choice across college campuses of
the time was Dr. Stillman's water/boiled eggs/protein diet.

   1970: Orville Redenbacher's Gourmet Popping Corn is introduced.
Agronomist Redenbacher has found a yellow corn that expands nearly
twice as much as other brands. In five years, it will be the
country's largest-selling brand.

   1973: Bar codes begin appearing on food packaging.

   1973: ``Eating Well is the Best Revenge'' is the October issue
of New York magazine. America is becoming familiar with the wide
world of cuisine.

fast-food breakfast item.

the $140 machine at first, but Julia Child and James Beard's

 `BEYOND THE WALLS' : WRITER TACKLES SPIRITUALITY EARNESTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of article.)  (DW) 
 By BEN STEELMAN   
 Morning Star, Wilmington, N.C.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a year, writer Paul Wilkes spent a few days each
month in Moncks Corner, S.C., at Mepkin Abbey with Cistercians of
the Strict Observance _ the Trappists, reputedly the strictest
order of monks in the Roman Catholic church, the ``shock troops of
holiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other ``cradle Catholics,'' Wilkes had wondered if he
had a vocation in the church. One of his heroes as a teen-ager had
been Thomas Merton, author of The Seven-Story Mountain and probably
the best-known Trappist of the 20th century. He had even directed a
PBS documentary on Merton's life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his new book, ``Beyond the Walls,'' is not strictly about
the Trappists. (Some good recent studies of the order include Frank
Bianco's ``Voices of Silence'' and Esther de Waal's ``The Way of
Simplicity,'' which Wilkes quotes respectfully.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Wilkes, a faculty member of the University of North
Carolina at Wilmington, tries to take some of the Trappists'
hard-earned lessons of spirituality and apply them to the everyday
life of the ordinary lay Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wilkes is no Thomas Merton, yet he approaches his task
earnestly, with a welcome, self-deprecating sense of humor, and his
observations are usually worth heeding.
</P>
<P>
   In short, spry essays, he tackles such issues as prayer,
discerning God's will and finding community in a commercialized
society of atomized individuals. He ponders the concept of chastity
from the standpoint of a husband and father, and finds, beyond
sexuality, a rule of relationships in all aspects of life:
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, is not chastity modesty? Modesty in conversation,
when we need not dominate, but instead invite others to the true
intimacy that the honest sharing of thoughts can allow. Modesty in
thought and desire _ regarding other people, yes, but also
extending to the things of this world that we might hungrily seek,
mistakenly believing that they will bring us deep and lasting
satisfaction. Modesty in our very demeanor ... modesty in our
expectations, both of others and ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As in such previous books as ``The Good-Enough Catholic'' and
``The Seven Secrets of Successful Catholics,'' Wilkes writes
primarily for readers within his church, but other Christians can
study ``Beyond the Walls'' with profit.
</P>
<P>
   The author himself takes an ecumenical approach, following the
example of Thomas Merton, who spent his last years exploring
Buddhist spirituality. Beyond the Walls quotes Frederick Buechner,
the Presbyterian pastor and author (whom John Irving cited as an
influence in ``A Prayer for Owen Meaney'') on the subject of faith
and Orthodox rabbis on the practice of meditation upon scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley _ as basketball player, not as presidential
candidate _ provides lessons in stability. Even that decidedly
un-Christian rake, Woody Allen, has something to offer: ``Ninety
percent of life is just showing up.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wilkes' mind is on other things, as a journalist whose
work has appeared in Atlantic Monthly and The New York Times
Magazine cannot help but provide fascinating glimpses of the
50-year-old community of monks and their daily lives.

IN `WASTELAND,' SESQUIPEDALIAN VOCABULARY GROWS WEARISOME

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gimme an er! Gimme an um! Gimme a y'know! What does it spell?
</P>
<P>
   Inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   At least in Kevin Williamson's world. As a term paper,
Williamson's new series, ``Wasteland,'' might get an A if it were
graded by a nervous teaching assistant intimidated by big words,
long sentences and nonstop adjectives. But a seasoned professor
looking for a little substance in ``Wasteland'' would probably have
tenure by the time she found it.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dawson's Creek,'' the sort of staircase wit that
Williamson's teenage characters exhibit was charming in its first
season because no kid, aside from 11-year-old prodigies with 1600s
on their SATs and Rhodes scholarships in their ``Pokemon'' packs,
ever talks like that. But in ``Wasteland,'' an um-free zone where
articulateness is the only significant measure of a man or a woman,
it is tiresome. Enervating. Exasperating. Annoying. Irksome.
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention wearisome? Galling? Vexatious?
</P>
<P>
   Williamson knows a lot of words. He could stand to know an
editor, lest anyone watching ``Wasteland'' should switch over to
``Frasier,'' where the writing is supportive of the characters, not
contemptuous of them.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of ``Wasteland'' is offered by Dawnie (Marisa
Coughlan), a grad student, in the early going of tonight's
premiere. Speaking to her anthropology professor, Dawnie says:
``I'm 25 years old, actually 26 today, and profoundly lost as a
human being. I've spent my entire life in school, my parents still
support me, human relationships baffle me and I am acutely
self-aware to the point where I'm clueless and slightly suicidal.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor, still awake at this point, says: ``And you
represent today's generation?''
</P>
<P>
   Dawnie replies: ``Absolutely. In generations past the window
into adulthood began at 18, and now it's 30. ... I believe that
this second coming of age is representative of a kind of barrier, a
wall that we hit, a manifestation of a certain type of fear that
immobilizes us. For some it's professional, for others it's
relational, emotional, sexual, et cetera.''
</P>
<P>
   Et cetera? Kevin Williamson put ``et cetera'' in a script? Did
he run out of words?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, no.
</P>
<P>
   Dawnie has more to say, as do her former college buddies Sam,
Jesse, Ty, Vandy and Russell, all trying to make their way in New
York City without slipping on this prime-time soap. FYI, in that
pile of names, Sam and Jesse join Dawnie (sounds like Donnie) as
women with guy-sounding names, Ty and Vandy are guys with
dog-sounding names, and the one with the most guy-sounding name,
Russell, is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. There's also Vince, a black man who is Sam's boorish boss in
the D.A.'s office. He was added to the cast because the network
discovered NYC is a multiethnic place, but his role is like
everything else in ``Wasteland'': slick, artificial and hard to
like.
</P>
<P>
   Wasteland. Hourlong drama series about young adults who were
friends in college and are now struggling to find themselves in the
real world. Starring Marisa Coughlan, Rebecca Gayheart, Sasha
Alexander, Brad Rowe, Eddie Mills, Dan Montgomery and Jeffrey D.
Sams. Series premiere Thursday night on NBC. Parental guideline
rating: TV-PG.

<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ She has a lived-in laugh, a deep, rueful
chuckle made of good times and bum times, of cigarettes and singing
and long, hard nights on the road. Somewhere around the first sip
of the second cocktail in her elegant old living room, it dawns on
a visitor just what a life Rosemary Clooney has lived.
</P>
<P>
   For 46 years, she has made her home in this rambling house,
where George and Ira Gershwin wrote their last song, ``Love Is Here
to Stay.'' The silver frames that line her bookshelves and piano
hold photographs of Marlene Dietrich, John F. Kennedy and her
movie-star nephew, George, who started his Hollywood career as a
gofer and chore boy here. When she talks about Bing and Bob, Dean
and Frank, they are not legends, but friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did Bing's radio show, always, and later we did a 15-minute
daily show, five days a week that we taped in this room,'' she
said. ``We would sit around the table sort of like this, and then
they'd set up the microphones, and we'd break out some Scotch.''
They would circle their own lines, but not read them in advance, so
that when they performed the scripts, it was always spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   Spontaneous is Ms. Clooney's default mode. At 71, she is a
survivor of a swinging era whose greats are almost all gone. She
still sings the old songs the way they were meant to be sung, and
she tells priceless stories of watching the fights on television
with Crosby and his date for the night, the young Grace Kelly, in
sweater set and pearls. But Ms. Clooney is no nostalgia act. She is
the spiritual godmother to younger singers like Linda Ronstadt, and
she has just recorded a duet of ``The Boy From Ipanema'' with Diana
Krall, the hot young jazz pianist and singer, to be released next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   It was not quite twilight, and Ms. Clooney and her husband,
Dante DiPaolo, a dapper Hollywood hoofer she fell in love with
nearly 50 years ago at Paramount studios and then jilted to marry
Jose Ferrer, were sitting at a needlepoint chess table Ms. Clooney
had made for Ferrer between nightclub shows at the Waldorf-Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't take it with him,'' Ms. Clooney said dryly of the
man she married and divorced twice and with whom she had five
children. Ferrer's smiling picture still hangs in a prominent place
in her den.
</P>
<P>
   As the day's last minivans full of stargazing tourists glided by
the crape myrtle tree in the front yard, the conversation drifted
gently over the past. But the evening was actually a rare lull
before Ms. Clooney would plunge headlong into the future again.
</P>
<P>
   First would be a trip to her hometown of Maysville, Ky., just
down the river from Cincinnati, to raise money to rebuild the
theater where her first film, ``The Stars Are Singing,'' had its
premiere in 1953. Then there would be a two-week stint, through
Oct. 16, as the opening act at her friend Michael Feinstein's new
150-seat supper club at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan. ``And we
have the power of the pencil!'' Ms. Clooney said of their ability
to sign for their drinks and food, with the glee of one who knows
too well what it's like to cook on a hotel hot plate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, next month, comes the publication of ``Girl Singer''
(Doubleday) her new memoir, co-written with Joan Barthel, along
with a compilation album of career hits, reissued by her longtime
label, Concord Jazz, and a book tour that is to include an
appearance on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clooney's first autobiography, ``This for Remembrance''
(Playboy Press, 1977), was made into a television movie starring
Sondra Locke, with Ms. Clooney dubbing the vocals. The book is out
of print, and badly out of date, since it was published just as she
was beginning a tentative comeback, with Crosby's help, after a
nervous breakdown, years of addiction to prescription drugs and
one-night stands in suburban Holiday Inns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then a lot has happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, too. As a child, Ms. Clooney was passed to
relatives by her divorced, dysfunctional parents, and started
singing on the radio in Cincinnati. At 18, with her sister, Betty,
she went on the road with Tony Pastor's big band. ``Come On-a My
House,'' an improbable fake Armenian folk song with a hokey
harpsichord accompaniment and words by William Saroyan, made her a
solo star at 23. She then made five movies in quick succession,
including ``White Christmas,'' with Bing Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage to Ferrer produced five children in five years.
(Bob Hope called it ``Vatican Roulette,'' and after the third one,
he and Crosby gave her track shoes and starting blocks; Tennessee
Ernie Ford insisted, ``You've got to find out what's causing
this.'') But Ferrer, 16 years her senior, was an incorrigible
womanizer, as she learned on their honeymoon. They split up for
good in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   A heartbreaking and ill-fated affair with the arranger Nelson
Riddle, the rise of rock 'n' roll and her own growing dependence on
a rainbow arsenal of uppers and downers left Ms. Clooney on the
edge. When her friend Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 as
she waited to greet him at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, she
snapped. Weeks later, convinced Kennedy was still alive, she
stormed off a stage in Reno and drove her white Cadillac covered
with flower decals up the wrong side of a mountain road to Lake
Tahoe in the dark, yelling, ``That's one for you, God!'' every time
an oncoming car veered out of her way. That got her placed in the
locked ward of Cedars-Sinai Hospital with other severely depressed
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confused at first,'' Ms. Clooney said. ``Not confused,''
she amended. ``I was crazy. But Phil Silvers was there, and he was
walking up and down the halls, really nervous, highly charged, and
I thought, `Well, this is just pretend, you know.''' Her sense of
unreality was heightened by the fact that one of the therapists on
the ward was Betsy Drake, who had been married to Cary Grant. ``Who
could take that seriously?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was serious enough: Ms. Clooney was in therapy for the next
eight years, kicked her drug habit, and began to rebuild
relationships with her children, then 8 to 13, who had been largely
raised by Ms. Clooney's mother _ a bitter twist, since her mother
had abandoned Rosemary and her younger sister, Betty, when they
were young.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She never really reconciled with her mother before she died in
1973. It was only a few weeks later that she became reacquainted
with DiPaolo. As she was stopped at a traffic light in Beverly
Hills in her Corvette convertible, he pulled up in his Thunderbird
and called out, ``Rosella!'' She had not laid eyes on him in 20
years, but she invited him to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later he moved in, becoming her road manager and
indispensable man. Two years ago, tired of explaining their
domestic arrangements to Ms. Clooney's nine grandchildren, they
were married in the church in Maysville where Ms. Clooney was
baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Decades before, when she dropped him for Ferrer, DiPaolo said,
``Oh, I crashed. I mean, I really couldn't understand that at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clooney said gently: ``He was the kindest man that I've ever
known. He was also funny.''
</P>
<P>
   But in those years, Ms. Clooney said, she was too busy running
away from her own insecurities to pick a man like DiPaolo. And her
Hollywood life was heady, in a household that featured butler,
cook, housekeeper, upstairs maid, laundress, secretary, gardener
and pool man, on a block where the neighbors included Jack Benny,
Lucille Ball and James Stewart. There were friendly evenings with
Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, after-dinner coffee with Nat King Cole
at the piano, girl talk with Dietrich and Billie Holiday, nights in
Las Vegas watching Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was happy in a lot of ways,'' Ms. Clooney
said of Sinatra. ``I think that's why the kind of immature things
that Sammy and Dean and Joey Bishop and all those guys did when
they were together. That was the fun that he had that he'd never
had when he was a kid, and he could be in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes now, she said, she sees her nephew George (his father
is her brother, Nick) seeking safety in a somewhat similar
camaraderie. ``I see him hanging with his friends, the guys that
play basketball,'' she said. ``They're his guys, and they have to
go on their golfing trip every year. I see that, and I wonder if
it's the same kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clooney knows the loneliness of fame. In her new book, she
recalls a Christmas Eve party at Humphrey Bogart and Lauren
Bacall's in the mid-'50s. Her own career was on a roll, but she
felt strangely depressed. She caught sight of Spencer Tracy, who
asked what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' she writes. ``I've never been to a party on
Christmas Eve. I guess I'm just homesick.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy said, ``Get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess maybe it was just a couple of burned-out Catholics,''
Ms. Clooney recalled. ``Sometimes I felt way out of my depth, you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, her Christmas Eves are very different, with Champagne and
caviar in her big house on North Roxbury Drive full of family and
friends. Her eldest son, Miguel, is an actor in New York, as is her
youngest, Rafael. Gabriel, married to the singer Debby Boone, is an
artist and Episcopal priest at a Beverly Hills church near her
house. Her older daughter, Maria, raises Arabian horses in the
Santa Ynez Valley near Santa Barbara. Her daughter Monsita is
married to a television executive and raising a family.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clooney has made some concessions to age and knee surgery,
and now sings only one show a night. But she keeps trying new
things and said a new album of Brazilian songs, with the guitarist
John Pizzarelli and featuring the duet with Ms. Krall, was the
hardest music she ever had to learn. She said she'll keep singing
as long as she can stand, and if she can't, she'll sit, as Mabel
Mercer did.
</P>
<P>
   But she has yet to schedule the sessions with a voice coach that
Bob Hope's 90-year-old wife, Dolores, recently gave her as a
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``She still sings, beautifully,'' Ms. Clooney said of her old
friend. ``But I'm too old to take a lesson now.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technological advances, it has often been noted, can bring both
good and bad. Take, for example, what happened to Alfred Acree one
night in April 1993, in Charles City, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Acree was being chased on foot by police officers, who suspected
him of dealing in drugs. At the time, Acree was wearing the latest
in footwear technology: a pair of running shoes from L.A. Gear
featuring red light-emitting diodes in the heels that flashed with
each step.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes were designed to help runners be seen easily on
darkened roads at night, but on this night they enabled Acree to be
easily spotted as he fled through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Good for the police, bad for Acree.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of children, the experience of wearing sneakers
with lights that blinked as they walked has been a happier one. The
battery-powered children's sneakers were a sensation in the first
three years after they were introduced by L.A. Gear in 1992, said
Mark Goldston, a former chief executive of the company.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, L.A. Gear offered 30 to 40 different models. ``We
took the market by rage,'' Goldston said. ``We sold millions of
these things.''
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Gear's adult shoes did not fare as well (``It was a hot
idea for six months, like many products in the adult market,''
Goldston said), and sales of lighted children's shoes eventually
dipped too. But the children's market remains steady today, and
L.A. Gear has been joined in it by several other companies,
including Stride Rite and Skechers.
</P>
<P>
   The basic red lights have been supplemented by green and other
colors. Some models blink in patterns up and down the outside of
the sole, some flash around the heel, and some even have diodes
sewn into the uppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like little red wagons _ every kid has to have them,''
said Robert Greenberg, who created L.A. Gear in the 1980s and went
on to co-found Skechers in 1992. At Skechers, Greenberg said,
lighted sneakers account for 5 percent to 10 percent of sales of
children's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Just who had the inspiration for sticking light-emitting diodes
in the soles of sneakers is a matter of some dispute. Goldston said
the concept first came to him in the late 1980s. He said he was
inspired by light sticks, those plastic tubes that contain a liquid
that glows in the dark when activated.
</P>
<P>
   Goldston wondered what would happen if he had a sneaker with a
clear heel into which light sticks could be inserted. ``It was a
great idea,'' he said. ``But light sticks only last a couple of
hours, and cost about a dollar each. But it got me thinking, what
about lights?''
</P>
<P>
   Goldston's account is disputed by others in the industry, but in
any case, inventors had struggled for decades to marry lights and
footwear. Often the intention was safety: a lighted shoe makes the
wearer more visible. But just as often the goal was simple novelty,
or entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   A 1979 patent for ``flashing discoshoes,'' for example, featured
lights embedded in a clear plastic shoe with four-inch heels.
</P>
<P>
   Patents for lighted shoes with an on-off switch in the sole or
heel were issued at least as far back as 1933, but early designs
suffered from a common drawback, as described in a later patent:
rapid depletion of the battery when the lights are continuously on,
``such as occurs in activities involving much standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Various switch designs were developed to get around this
problem, including one with a ball bearing that would roll in a
tube as the foot moved, completing an electrical circuit when it
reached contacts at the tube's end.
</P>
<P>
   In its first models, L.A. Gear used a mercury switch, in which a
small amount of the liquid metal functioned like a ball bearing,
moving within a capsule as the foot moved. But mercury is a toxic
metal, and when environmental regulators in Minnesota learned in
1994 that thousands of children were walking around with it in
their shoes, they took action.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislature voted to ban sale of the shoes, and L.A.
Gear negotiated an agreement with state officials in which the
company agreed to pay for disposal costs associated with the
roughly 20,000 pairs of sneakers it had sold in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Similar bans were considered in other states, but by then L.A.
Gear had shifted to a different switch, the kind that is used in
most lighted footwear sold today. Called an inertial switch, it
consists of a metal spring that is connected to the electrical
source on one end, and is close to, but not touching, a metal
contact at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   When the shoe is at rest or during a steady movement, the spring
remains stationary. But if the shoe moves violently or strikes an
object (such as the floor, when a step is made) the spring vibrates
enough to touch the contact, completing the circuit. A simple chip
produces the pattern of electrical pulses to the various
light-emitting diodes.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Gear experimented with other kinds of switches too,
including a pressure switch that would turn on when the wearer
jumped. They were incorporated into a model the company called Leap
Gear, which sold for about $125 a pair and were endorsed by the
basketball star Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association promptly banned them, and
Leap Gear went nowhere. But all the publicity helped L.A. Gear's
other models, Goldston recalled. ``It made little Johnny in Peoria
want to buy the other lines. It's an old story _ using the Corvette
to sell Camaros,'' he said.

   Page-jacked. Mouse-trapped. Innocent surfers diverted from
perfectly benign sites to online pornography enclaves and unable to
escape. Streaming Webcast at 11.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, dirty tricks are everywhere. Last month, would-be
visitors to 25 million popular Web pages were intentionally
rerouted to and then stuck at pornography sites. The incident
brought to light one of the annoying aspects of Web surfing: You
cannot always go where you want and, if you are in a place you
don't want to be, you cannot always get out easily.
</P>
<P>
   Some side trips are the result of mistakes by surfers, but many
are the work of Webmasters who bend and twist HTML code into
trapping people in one spot like overeager used-car salesmen. Sites
that specialize in pornography are the most obvious practitioners
of user manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my experience, they were definitely the ones leading
it,'' Daniel Glovich, the manager of Web development at the
e-commerce site Cybershop, said of the use of these tricks. ``But
then, like a lot of things on the Web, everybody saw that it worked
_ and followed.''
</P>
<P>
   All of these tricks are irritating. Some are downright
deceptive. The Federal Trade Commission filed an injunction against
the parties responsible for last month's page-jacking case. One
reason the agency took such aggressive action was that ``there
isn't a whole lot the consumer can do,'' said Paul H. Luehr,
assistant director of marketing practices at the FTC. ``They were
deceptively driven to these sites and then held there against their
will.'' The FTC has a form on its Web site (www.ftc.gov) and a
toll-free number (1-877-FTC-HELP) for consumers to file complaints
about misleading sites.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, creative coders are constantly thinking up new ways
to turn Web pages evil. Here are some of the more common and more
frustrating dirty Web tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking Your Back Button
</P>
<P>
   You're clicking your way around the Web, exploring pages and
following links. On one site, you click on the Back button at the
top of the browser. Nothing happens. You click again and repeat
until bedtime. Most likely, the button was intentionally disabled
by the Web page itself. The button may even be ``grayed out'' on
some sites. Why does it do this? To keep you right where you are so
you'll look at the content (and the advertising). This type of rude
behavior was used in last month's scheme: the user's Back and Home
buttons were rigged to lead to more pornography sites.
</P>
<P>
   The dastardly deed is commonly performed with Javascript, a
powerful programming tool used with HTML, a common programming
language used for making Web pages. Programmers can use Javascript
to create a loop: Each time a window closes, a new one opens.
Because the window is ``new,'' there is no Back button because the
browser thinks there is no place to go back to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time that window closes,'' Glovich said, ``there's
another Javascript that will do the same thing. You try to close
it, and it opens up another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there any way out of these endless loops? ``There really
isn't a way to beat it,'' Glovich said. ``You just have to shut it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   You can disable Java: most Web browsers will let the user do
this in the program's preferences. ``There are some trade-offs in
doing that,'' Luehr said. ``Turning off your Javascript reduces the
power and interactivity of the Internet in some respects.'' A Game
of Metatag: You're It
</P>
<P>
   Has your favorite search engine ever brought back all sorts of
results that had nothing to do with your request? Take the tale of
a certain volunteer who was teaching a roomful of 10-year-old girls
how to use search engines during a Take Our Daughters to Work Day
event. (OK, it was me.)
</P>
<P>
   The class, being of That Age, wanted information on the pop star
Britney Spears. Back came the results, most from pornography sites
that had cleverly embedded variations on the Britney Spears name _
which the girls had misspelled _ in a special area of their pages
that search engines use for indexing.
</P>
<P>
   A metatag is a place in the HTML code where information about
the page can be listed _ like who made it and how often they update
it _ as well as keywords that indicate what the page is about. HTML
coders can put whatever they want in the metatags, including things
that have nothing to do with it. According to a recent list in a
site that tracks search terms, ``MP3,'' ``sex'' and ``Hotmail''
were the most popular search words. Imbedding popular terms in the
metatags of a site on, say, lobster traps in Nova Scotia will draw
many more surfers, not just the ones that searched for ``traps AND
lobsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies will even imbed the name of business rivals into
the metatags on their own home page. ``That way, if someone
searches for them, they'll find you,'' said Danny Sullivan, editor
of the Search Engine Watch site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of part art, part science, but they really know how
to work the search engines using metatags,'' Glovich said. ``But
metatags are only a part of it. It's keyword density, how many
times that word appears in the document, in what locations in
appears, in what format does it appear in _ a bunch of things like
that contribute to the placement in the results. They totally know
how to work it, and it's not all that difficult to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution lies with the search engines, not the surfers.
``Search engines are moving away from crawling and just indexing
anything automatically,'' Sullivan said. ``Now, what the search
engines are doing is relying on humans to categorize Web sites.''
Lycos and the search engines on AOL and the Microsoft Network are
adopting this tactic, he said. ``It's harder to spam, if you will,
a human being,'' he added. ``You can't just flip it past them,
because they're smarter than a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The law has already caught up with a few companies using
trademarked terms just to get search hits. Playboy has sued a
number of sites for embedding its name in their code.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Begetting Windows
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever called it quits after hours of surfing, closed
your browser window and discovered several other open browser
windows still on your screen, all neatly piled one on top of
another?
</P>
<P>
   That trick is also used to keep users connected to one site,
even if they are looking at another. The HTML code writer can tell
the browser to treat the desired link as a new window, which opens
on top of the first one.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites use this tactic to smack you in the eyes with
advertisements, but also to display supplementary information or to
lead you to a different section of the site. Sites that specialize
in MP3 downloads are often guilty of this ``window farming.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sites will open even more windows that contain paid
advertisements. ``They get paid per view in general for these
cases,'' Glovich said. ``So the more they pop, the more they
make.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to put a stop to this sort of thing is to visit your
favorite shareware archive for inexpensive little programs that
keep browser windows from breeding like bunnies. Intermute
(www.intermute.com) sells such a program for $20.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Spellcheck Won't Save You Now
</P>
<P>
   Everyone makes a typo now and then. Some of the craftier Web
entrepreneurs rely on these slip-ups to send you to sites that you
were completely unprepared for.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo had the foresight to pay for an extra ``O'' and claim
www.yahooo.com &UR;  &LR; as its own, which properly leads to www.yahoo.com.
If you don't know how it is spelled, though, and try www.yawhoo.com
by mistake, you go to The Net One, a different search site. In
another case of competitors trumping their rivals,
www.microsfot.com &UR;  &LR; leads to the home page of Linux, the operating
system that is challenging Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a transposed keystroke can be more problematic,
especially if you are teaching a child how to search the Web.
Mistyping www.excite.com can whisk you to a porn site. Missed
punctuation, like the period after the ``www,'' may also result in
unplanned visits.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites will gamble on your guessing wrong when you don't
know the exact address of a site. Many browser versions will let
you type just the middle part of the domain name, adding the
``http://www.'' and the ``.com'' automatically. A classic example
of a sex site preying upon unsuspecting users is a variation of the
White House site address, www.whitehouse.gov. If you want to drop
Clinton a note, take special note of the .gov suffix.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the FTC was involved in a case in which an
Australian company was selling domain names through a Web site
called www.internic.com (as opposed to internic.net, the real site,
run by Network Solutions). The company was charging $250 for
domain-name registration, sending the regular fee to Network
Solutions and pocketing the rest. As many as 13,000 people in nine
countries were duped.
</P>
<P>
   Look, Don't Touch
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever noticed two Web sites that look exactly like each
other except for the domain names and contact information? One may
just be a clever copy, made to steal the economic or creative
thunder of the original. And you may have no other clues that you
are not looking at the original site.
</P>
<P>
   In last month's Internet case, as many as 25 million popular Web
pages were copied onto Web servers and code was added to reroute
viewers to pornography sites. When search engines displayed the
fake pages as search results and the users clicked on the links,
they were taken on a triple-X ride. Some people are slicker than
others about doing this type of thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the equivalent of somebody taking a shotgun, pointing
it at the sky and hitting a whole bunch of ducks,'' Sullivan said.
``It wasn't subtle at all. In contrast, people who are really
sophisticated don't throw up 25 million pages and hope to pick up
traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   The copied-pages syndrome often happens to sites celebrating
pop-culture icons like Xena the Warrior Princess, but corporate
theft, like stealing a business competitor's pages and changing the
contact information, also abounds. A successful digital
communications company had its Web site stolen by someone in Russia
who presented it as his own. (Fearing further security breaches,
the company refused to comment on the matter.) For the common user,
though, paying close attention to what is on the screen _ look out
particularly for Web addresses that bear little resemblance to the
site name _ might be the best defense.
</P>
<P>
   What You See Isn't What You Get
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when Netscape's Navigator was slugging it out
with Microsoft's Internet Explorer to be king of the browser hill,
some sites would optimize their pages for their browser of choice,
intentionally make their content look bad for the competition and
even block access to the site. Although these browser wars have
pretty much ended, a few stalwarts are probably still clinging to
old grudges.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason a page may look bad is that it was never intended
to be looked at in the first place. Some companies slap together
Web ``landing pages,'' _ also called ``bridge'' and ``spam'' pages
_ that are meant to be seen not by people but by search engines. By
playing these pages into a search engine's algorithm, businesses
that specialize in Web placement can boost a client's ranking on
the search results page.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are actually companies out there that their whole
purpose is just to create and maintain landing pages like that and
redirect the traffic,'' Glovich said. Although driving up
search-engine results is a lot harder now, he said, it was not that
way a few years ago. ``It got to the point where, literally, inside
of 10 minutes, you could manipulate Infoseek and take over the top
five positions for any given query.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not that easy anymore,'' said Bill Rose, vice
president of search and content at Infoseek. ``We have a lot of
technology that's analyzing the URLs that people are submitting to
be sure they're not trying to spam or create bad search results.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said that some major search engines were starting to
use different criteria to rank a page, like how many other pages
are linking to it. ``If lots of links are pointing at it, then
maybe it will rank higher,'' he said. ``It's a harder thing for
somebody to go through and try to manipulate for spam.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements in Disguise
</P>
<P>
   Some Web links are intentionally misleading, or they will
display an advertisement before you can continue to your desired
destination, or they will camouflage themselves. One box on Alta
Vista's Computer's and Internet page looks like a site-search line
for hardware and software, but clicking on it takes you to an
online computer store.
</P>
<P>
   Another increasingly popular trick is a banner ad _ the
horizontal strip of commercialism found at the top and bottom of
Web pages _ disguised as something else, like a form to fill out or
a trivia question to answer. Yet another popular facade trick
involves a system-alert box.
</P>
<P>
   Duplicitous banner advertisements can be designed by graphics
professionals to resemble ominous computer messages, and new users
may be nervous enough to click on anything that says ``OK'' to make
them go away. Only after you end up in an unexpected sales
environment with a perfectly functioning computer does the ruse
become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Next time you are on the Web and think your computer is
complaining about something with an alert box, look closely. Real
system alert boxes pop up in the middle of the screen and float
above the active window. Fakes are usually nestled right in there
with the Web page content. Of course, Macintosh users will probably
spot them right away _ most of the ads resemble Windows messages.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: As a first time homeowner I was told to keep a rubber
plumber's ``plunger'' handy in case one of my sinks got clogged.
However, when my bathroom sink did clog recently, I tried to use my
plunger but it didn't seem to be very effective.
</P>
<P>
   I finally called in a plumber who cleared the drain (by using a
plunger) and he told my wife (I wasn't home) that I probably did
not use my plunger properly.
</P>
<P>
   Is there some special method or technique I should know about
before I have this type of problem again?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are a few points to keep in mind when using a plunger.
In a bathroom sink be sure you first plug the overflow hole near
the top of the rim by forcing a wet rag in as shown here. If the
sink has a pop-up drain plug, remove this.
</P>
<P>
   Then fill the basin about half way up with water and coat the
rubber rim of the plunger with a light film of petroleum jelly so
it will form an airtight seal with the inside bottom of the sink.
</P>
<P>
   Press the rubber cup firmly over the drain opening and pump up
and down on the handle a few times without actually breaking the
seal or lifting the rubber cup from the drain opening. Finally,
give the handle a sharp yank upward to break the seal and create a
sudden suction on the drain.
</P>
<P>
   Although this will usually do the trick, in stubborn cases you
may have to repeat the process two or three times to completely
break up the clog.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an old family picture frame that has a gold finish
which I believe is gold leaf. However, the gold has tarnished and
turned dark so that it no longer looks like gold. How can I restore
this finish and bring it back to the original gold color?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gold leaf does not tarnish or change color, regardless of how
old it is. Your frame was obviously finished with a gilt or gold
paint of some kind, or with a type of metal leaf that is not
actually real gold.
</P>
<P>
   You can try refinishing the frame by first wiping down with a
rag moistened with paint thinner to clean it, then sanding it
lightly before you apply a gold paint or wax-type gilt finish of
some kind (sold in many paint stores, as well as in most art supply
stores).
</P>
<P>
   You could also bring the frame in to a professional to have it
refinished with actual gold leaf _ but this will be quite
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My roof is covered with asphalt shingles that are about 10
years old and still in pretty good condition. During a severe
windstorm recently a couple of the shingles on one side of the
house got lifted up and torn, and one shingle has a little piece
missing. How can I repair those damaged shingles without having to
call in a professional roofer?
</P>
<P>
   A. Assuming you can find shingles that match in color, you can
do the job by first lifting the damaged shingles up slightly, then
sweeping out any dirt and debris underneath them.
</P>
<P>
   Spread a liberal coat of roofing cement under the shingle, then
slide a new shingle under the old one and on top of the layer of
cement.
</P>
<P>
   Drive in one or two roofing nails up near the top of the
replacement shingle. Spread another layer of cement over the nail
heads and over part of the new shingle _ the part covered by the
old shingle when it is pressed back down.
</P>
<P>
   If the shingle tends to curl back up it may be necessary to
weight it down with a brick for a day or two until the cement bonds
it in place.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The walls inside our old house have a sand finish on them,
although they have been painted many times. This rough surface is
hard to wash or clean so I would like to smooth it down. Sanding
would be very messy and very difficult for me, so can you tell me
if there is any other way I can smooth these walls?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two possibilities that I can think of. One is to
have a paperhanger cover the walls with one of the special heavy
duty lining materials (usually a canvas or vinyl) that is sold for
use on rough or textured walls. They leave you with a smooth
surface that can be painted or papered.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to have a contractor install new drywall panels over
the existing wall surfaces.
</P>

EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTERS THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ANNE EISENBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the latest problems computers are taking on is evolution
_ their own, that is.
</P>
<P>
   In many spots in the United States and abroad, scientists have
created computer programs that can change and refine their own
software through successive generations; the process continues
until the software does what needs to be done with no help
whatsoever from the pesky humans who initiated it.
</P>
<P>
   One such project involves computer programs that are given
algorithms _ math-based strategies _ and the rules of physics and
then assigned certain architectural tasks to perform. They wind up
reinventing structures like the triangle. The scientists who set
the programs in action in the first place have built the designs,
using Lego components, and given the artificial architects a
limited vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying a computer can replace an architect _ at least,
not yet,'' said Jordan B. Pollack, a professor in the computer
science department at Brandeis University's Center for Complex
Systems in Waltham, Mass. ``But our computer did start with a
simple algorithm and end with blueprints for structures that it
took humans hundreds of years to develop. And when we built the
structures, they were functional.''
</P>
<P>
   The structures Pollack is talking about are modest ones: tables,
bridges and cranes made from toy blocks. But as he and Pablo Funes,
an Argentine graduate student, report in the current issue of the
journal Artificial Life, the computer came up with structures that
could be built without specific guidance from them.
</P>
<P>
   What the computer was given was a program that included the laws
of physics and some random patterns of Lego bricks. It was also
given the ability to let its designs evolve, in a ``survival of the
fittest'' system. Then the programmers stepped back.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack's field, evolutionary computing, is a futuristic place
where computers solve problems without being programmed to do so,
selecting the fittest solutions by mimicking natural selection.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack predicts that evolutionary computing may one day lead to
robots smart enough to generate and test themselves with no human
engineering costs whatsoever, making them cheap enough to be
disposable. For now, though, Pollack and his graduate student are
at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
   The computer did have some initial input from the two
researchers. Funes wrote the program that gave the computer the
background in physics it needed to get started _ no small job. And
Pollack and Funes together developed an evolutionary strategy for
generating and testing designs.
</P>
<P>
   Then the computer was given randomly chosen initial designs and
permitted to proceed through ``mutations'' _ random modifications
of the locations of the bricks _ or ``crossovers'' _ random
switches of pieces of two parent designs. Each ``offspring'' design
was then rated for fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't teach the computer how to design triangles or
counterbalances,'' Pollack said. ``It figured this out without any
engineering advice from us.'' As the computer designed a crane, for
example, it selected a triangle to make the crane's base more
stable _ something it knew how to do by applying the laws of
physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used the interaction of evolutionary algorithms and the
laws of physics to produce these interesting, very functional
structures that carry weights effectively at certain heights,''
Pollack said. ``It came up with fairly sophisticated solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   When the computer was done with a task, Pollack and Funes built
the design according to the blueprint produced, building a crane
that lifts one kilogram, a two-meter bridge, a table. ``Ours are
one of the first systems in evolutionary robotics where
evolution-in-simulation translated into reality,'' Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   His long-term vision is for computers to produce robots by
specifying both the mechanical bodies and the neural networks to
control them. The blueprint would be turned over to a fully
automated factory that would fabricate the robots ``as cheaply as
today they make Sony Walkmans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Fogel, the chief scientist at Natural Selection, a
company in La Jolla, Calif., that uses evolutionary algorithms to
solve problems in medicine and industry, works in areas related to
Pollack's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most critical thing in Pollack's work is that he
demonstrates that you do not need to have specific expertise in,
say, mechanical engineering to design a useful construct,'' he
said. ``All you need is a simple evolutionary algorithm and a good
model of the physics of the environment. The significant thing is
that he didn't design the crane _ the program did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogel, too, uses evolutionary programming, but he does not test
designs with Legos. Instead, he focuses on the game of checkers, in
addition to looking at more serious building blocks like molecules.
Using as little expert information as possible, he and a colleague
wrote an evolutionary program to see if the computer could teach
itself to play checkers at an expert level.
</P>
<P>
   The computer's tactics evolved as it played against itself.
After 10 generations, it defeated both Fogel and a graduate
student. ``After 100 evolutions, we put it on the Internet,'' he
said, ``and let it play against opponents without telling them they
were playing a program, not a person.'' The program has moved up to
the fourth-highest ranking, Class A, for checkers players.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Koza, an expert in evolutionary programming who is
president of Genetic Programming, in Los Altos, Calif., cited many
examples of automatically created solutions that were competitive
with results produced by people.
</P>
<P>
   As one example, he pointed to circuits that are so original they
infringe on patents. ``This is significant because if you
automatically create something that infringes, you have created the
essence of that invention,'' he said.

THE CHARITY CONCERT GOES ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the curtain rises Saturday afternoon on Netaid, a series of
international benefit concerts to raise money for world
anti-poverty programs, pop idols like David Bowie, Sting and Sean
``Puffy'' Combs are scheduled to perform. But the real star of the
show is more likely to be the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For years, audiences at events like ``We Are The World'' and
``Farm Aid'' have gathered and listened to wealthy entertainers
sing, play and plead for the more fortunate to help out the less
so. But after the last note dissolves into history, the public's
commitment to the cause of the day usually evaporates quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Netaid's principal creators and organizers, the United Nations
Development Program and Cisco Systems, are planning to make the
10-hour event the exception. To do that, they say, they will take
advantage of the Internet's ability to be informative, immediate
and intimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to use the computer to help change how the world looks
at poverty and motivate people to help,'' said Djibril Diallo,
public affairs director for the United Nations agency, which began
examining ways of combining music, high technology and altruism
more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet broadens its reach, Amnesty International,
Habitat for Humanity and other humanitarian and philanthropic
groups have been turning to what may be the planet's biggest
soapbox, hoping to raise money materials and find volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the United Nations agency, which has the stated
mission of eradicating extreme poverty, the Web site
(www.Netaid.org) is a clearing house of information on the state of
world poverty and the agency's programs as well as a means of
raising money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between this and earlier concerts is that we
created a vehicle for people to come back, not just on the night of
the concert with the one check they write,'' said Mark Malloch
Brown, the new administrator of the the development program. ``But
instead, here's a site they're going to come back to time after
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Using techniques and technologies more commonly found on sites
devoted to electronic commerce, the site, which was opened last
month with President Clinton, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain
and Nelson Mandela, South Africa's former president, logging on, is
expected to make global philanthropy more efficient, its designers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Netaid's organizers say they are hoping to draw millions of
people to the site by using it for a Webcast of the concerts being
held Saturday at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Wembley Stadium in
London and Palais des Nations in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   While the concerts will also be broadcast over a global network
of conventional radio and television stations, the Webcast is
scheduled to offer exclusive interviews and peeks backstage.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish the task, the site, created through a partnership
led by Cisco Systems with Akamai Technologies and KPMG, is expected
to use more than 125,000 simultaneous live streams to reach an
anticipated online audience of more than 10 million people, said
Douglas Graham, a partner with KPMG, a New York-based professional
services firm that designed the site.
</P>
<P>
   The largest previous Webcast was a lingerie fashion show last
winter done by Victoria's Secret using 12,000 live streams. That
number proved inadequate, leaving throngs of potential viewers
unable to view the show. By contrast, Graham said, the Netaid site
has the capacity to handle enormous amounts of Internet traffic,
including 60 million hits an hour, and process 1,000 donations a
second.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which is built on a network created by 1,500 servers
in more than 90 data centers around the world, is prepared to
handle a billion hits, Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Malloch Brown said, the Netaid site could be used to
help give contributors a clearer accounting of how donations are
used. ``We're looking at developing reporting systems where they'll
be able to log on and check how their money is being used by a set
of projects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Lang, vice president of service-provider marketing for
Cisco Systems, which through its corporation and foundation has
donated $20 million to Netaid, said the site might soon have a
high-tech, active matching system born in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The system will permit groups and people with particular needs
to register them in a Netaid database. It will also allow people
who are willing to donate particular skills or materials to
register them in the database.
</P>
<P>
   Technology that is used to match buyers and sellers in the
financial world could then match those in need with those willing
to fill those needs by introducing one to the other by way of
automatic e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that is good about this effort,'' Lang said,
referring to the Netaid project, ``is that it reminds people that
the Internet is a powerful tool to amplify human capabilities and
to demonstrate the better sides of our nature.''

 &HT;    GORE OPENS NASHVILLE HEADQUARTERS, DECLARES ``NEW DAY'' IN HIS
CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore declared ``a new day''
in his presidential bid Wednesday with a symbolic homecoming and
the opening of a new campaign headquarters far from the constant
political intrigue and daily odds-making of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home is where we start from,'' Gore told the nearly 300 people
who gathered in the asphalt parking lot of the office building that
will serve as his campaign headquarters as he tries to rejuvenate a
White House bid that has not gone according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife Tipper and his 87-year-old mother Pauline at his
side, the vice president said, ``Home is not only a place _ it's an
idea ... Home is where we learn our values. It's where we turn to
remember ourselves in the best sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the new headquarters building, across the street from
Nashville's Centennial Medical Center, once served as a
rehabilitation center. And Gore 2000 officials readily acknowledged
that the campaign needs rehabilitation in the wake of a stronger
than expected challenge from former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   And what better place to do that, they said, than in Tennessee,
the state Gore represented in Congress for 16 years before being
elected vice president on the ticket with Bill Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee has a tremendous amount of pride in Al Gore and he
connects with people in Tennessee,'' said Tony Coelho, the chairman
of Gore's presidential campaign. ``There will be a great deal of
enthusiasm and support for him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, newly appointed campaign manager Donna Brazile said
Tennesseans will be recruited in the coming weeks to make political
pilgrimages to Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states with the
first voting in the Democratic presidential contest next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 'Tennessee Travelers' are going to tell everybody in Iowa
and New Hampshire what Al Gore is all about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, a dark horse for the Democratic nomination in
1976, used a similar tactic, sending hundreds of Georgians to the
early primary states. They called themselves the ``Peanut
Brigade,'' in honor of Carter's background as a peanut farmer.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of enthusiasm for Gore was absent in Washington, 550
miles away, Coelho acknowledged. ``Inside the Beltway, they are a
little jaded about presidential candidates,'' he added. ``That's
why a lot of presidential campaigns are run from local areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, Gore's campaign had been run from high-rent
offices on K Street in Washington, the corridor favored by the
lobbying and law firms that wield so much influence in the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in one of the more dramatic actions of his campaign,
Gore announced that he was moving the operation ``from K Street in
Washington to the aisles of Kmart in Nashville'' in an effort to
get the attention of average voters.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Kmart near his new headquarters on the west side of
downtown Nashville, Gore's decision to run his presidential
campaign from Tennessee was widely praised by customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to stand up for the working families in this
country,'' said William Moorman, a 48-year-old blue collar employee
of British Petroleum, who was dropping off film at the Kmart. ``I
guess that's what he's trying to do. There's just too much money
influencing things in Washington,'' added Moorman, who described
himself as an ``independent'' voter.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have suggested that the campaign move is little more
than a stunt by a presidential candidate who, as vice president,
senator, congressman and the son of a senator, has spent virtually
his entire life in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tennesseans who came to watch Gore cut the ribbon on his
new headquarters have always viewed the vice president as one of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of us, always has been,'' said Deedie Drake, an
elderly woman from Murfreesboro.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is often mocked for his formality, continued to
project a more relaxed style at Wednesday's ceremonies, though he
promised a ``rip-tootin' campaign'' against Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was dressed in a blue sports shirt, khaki pants and cowboy
boots. Most staff members were similarly casual.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Gore campaign is anything but casual in trying
to shift its massive political operation from Washington to
Nashville. Brazile said the Nashville site will not be fully
operational until the middle of October.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, Brazile and Carter Eskew, the media consultant hired to
help develop Gore's campaign message, are already working out of
the Nashville office. But there still is no final word on how many
of the 90-member campaign staff in Washington would move to
Tennessee.

 &HT;    TUTU URGES U.S. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID TO SOUTH AFRICA'S
GROWING ECONOMY
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu called on the United States
to increase its financial support of South Africa during a speech
at the National Press Club on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the United States gives Israel $3.5 billion annually
in foreign aid, Tutu said South Africa needs similar assistance as
it struggles to right its economy eight years after abolishing
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give South Africa $2 billion for the next five years,'' Tutu
told a luncheon crowd at the National Press Club here. ``Here is a
chance to help a country become a vibrant economy. When South
Africa prospers, it will be the engine driving the economy of the
continent''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, chairman of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission and a visiting professor of theology at Emory University
in Atlanta, sprinkled some humor into his speech on how the country
has fared in a post-apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tremendous privilege to come to places such as this
where we were once asking for help,'' said Tutu, whose impassioned
pleas and sermons helped end apartheid in South Africa. ``You gave
help. We accomplished the goal. We are free''
</P>
<P>
   Many had predicted that bloodshed would accompany the transition
to a democratic society, and that black South Africans would not
remain committed to reconciliation once in power, Tutu recalled.

 &HT;    TUTU URGES U.S. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID TO SOUTH AFRICA'S
GROWING ECONOMY
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu called on the United States
to increase its financial support of South Africa during a speech
at the National Press Club on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the United States gives Israel $3.5 billion annually
in foreign aid, Tutu said South Africa needs similar assistance as
it struggles to right its economy eight years after abolishing
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give South Africa $2 billion for the next five years,'' Tutu
told a luncheon crowd at the National Press Club here. ``Here is a
chance to help a country become a vibrant economy. When South
Africa prospers, it will be the engine driving the economy of the
continent''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, chairman of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission and a visiting professor of theology at Emory University
in Atlanta, sprinkled some humor into his speech on how the country
has fared in a post-apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tremendous privilege to come to places such as this
where we were once asking for help,'' said Tutu, whose impassioned
pleas and sermons helped end apartheid in South Africa. ``You gave
help. We accomplished the goal. We are free''
</P>
<P>
   Many had predicted that bloodshed would accompany the transition
to a democratic society, and that black South Africans would not
remain committed to reconciliation once in power, Tutu recalled.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was charged with
hearing testimony from those who allegedly carried out orders to
intimidate or kill blacks during the apartheid regime, was a
particular source of concern.
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 Nobel Peace laureate remarked with glee that the nation

<P>
   A very chilly day is expected in New England as sunshine mixes
with a few clouds. A blustery breeze will gust over 30 mph in
northern sections, which will enhance the day's chill. A few
sprinkles or flurries are likely in northern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure near Toronto will produce a killing frost Thursday
morning over much of the northern Appalachians. Sunshine will
dominate from southern New England through the Middle Atlantic
States.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary with tropical air over the Gulf of Mexico will be
activated by a jet stream disturbance moving east from New Mexico.
High level winds from the south will draw clouds and rain into the
central Gulf Coast. More showers will dampen central and south
Florida. Increasing onshore winds in the Carolinas will cause rough
surf.
</P>
<P>
   A wedge of very warm air will move from Texas into the central
Plains. As warmer air glides northward into the Great Lakes,
showers and a few thunderstorms will develop. Cold winds from the
northeast will make an inclement day around Lake Superior.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific air will stream eastward across the northern Rockies
with broken clouds and slightly above seasonal temperatures. A
large disturbance moving through the southern Rockies will trigger
numerous showers from Colorado to central New Mexico. Offshore
winds, circulating around high pressure in Oregon, will draw warmer
air into southern California.
</P>
<P>
   A moist onshore flow in northern Washington will bring abundant
clouds and some rain to the Olympic peninsula. Clouds will stream
into the Bitterroots.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: UTAH UNDULATIONS
</P>
<P>
   A casual observer of the weather would have been struck by what
appeared to be a dramatic cold front straddling the state of Utah
on Tuesday. An Oct. 5 record minimum of 26 degrees was set in Park
City in the northeast section, while the afternoon brought record
heat of 92 degrees to Delta in the southern part of the state.
Actually, the sky was clear across the region and no front could be
found. The chill in Park City was a residual shallow cold air mass,
lingering with the lengthening nights. The hot air in Delta
signaled a resumption of an air flow from the deserts of the
Southwest.

Now, in a paper published in this week's Nature, biologists say
they prune the trees to separate them from surrounding trees, which

City Council Chairman Joe Ford, considered the top challenger in a
crowded field, is just a figurehead for his big brother, former
U.S. Rep. Harold Ford Sr., according to Herenton. The animosity
between the outspoken Herenton, the city's first elected black
mayor, and the fiery Ford, patriarch of the city's most politically
powerful black family, is only part of the intrigue of this year's
mayoral election. Fifteen candidates are on the ballot in the
nonpartisan election, including professional wrestler Jerry ``The
King'' Lawler, who gained notoriety in 1982 when he slapped

company led by two of his brothers _ one of them his twin, David,
also of Palm Beach. The brothers inherited a fortune generated by
the second-biggest privately held company in the United States,
Koch Industries of Wichita, Kan. The low-profile company operates
oil refineries and pipelines and engages in numerous other
businesses, from cattle to asphalt. It does not release earnings,
but published reports put its annual revenues at $30 billion to $35
billion. The trial is about largely technical issues _ how the
company measured oil it obtained under leases from the federal
government and American Indian tribes, particularly the Osage
Nation in Oklahoma. Neither side has said how much money is at
stake, but published reports say William alleges the shortages
amounted to millions of dollars. (Cohen, Palm Beach Daily News).

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHERN PINES, N.C. _ The playground at Southern Pines
Elementary School used to be four acres of thorny, barren land and
some rickety play equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids used to fight every day,'' said Damita Nocton, a
first-grade teacher at the school, which has 550 pupils in
kindergarten through third grade. ``They were confined to a little
square of asphalt, and the rest was just sandspur and cactus.''
</P>
<P>
   Children called it the Desert. ``We saw a lot of aggressive
behavior, because they were bored and unhappy,'' Ms. Nocton said.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the Blanchie Carter Discovery Park _ renamed in
honor of the beloved principal who retired just as renovations
began _ tells a different story.
</P>
<P>
   At recess, the children fan out over ``the purple monster,'' as
they call a challenging but inviting set of play equipment where
they can leap, hang, climb and run, blowing off steam and
exercising gross motor muscles. They can tear down the sandy track
that circles the professional-grade soccer field. Or maybe they
head toward the log cabin the third graders built, or to the
blueberry maze planted by the first grade. Some might wander to the
top of a grassy hill where the Earth Buddies meet or the pile of
sand dumped by the edge of the woods, looking for sharks' teeth.
</P>
<P>
   This grand space is a work in progress, a collaboration of
children, parents, teachers and community members, guided by Robin
Moore, an urban planner who teaches in the school of design at
North Carolina State University and has specialized in play areas
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is at the forefront of a growing movement in American
education that seeks to reconnect children with nature. California
has vowed to put a garden in each of its 8,000 schools, and has
about 1,650 so far. Maryland encourages every new school or
renovation project to include natural habitats that are accessible
and are incorporated into the curriculum. Ohio, Florida, New
Hampshire, Utah and Vermont have similar plans, and North Carolina
is financing Moore's ``Natural Learning Initiative''
(www.naturalearning.com), based at North Carolina State, which at
the moment is focused on helping child-care centers build creative
outdoor learning environments.
</P>
<P>
   A ``green'' schoolyard not only allows for safe, free play, but
can be used as a giant, diverse classroom, where hands-on
activities integrate math, science and the language arts. ``The
school greening movement is very big in Europe, but Robin is the
strongest, clearest voice right now in this country,'' said Dr.
Roger Hart, the director of the Children's Environments Research
Group at the City University of New York. Hart is working in poor
communities around the world to create green, safe places for
children.
</P>
<P>
   As the federal government pushes for higher test scores and
``accountability'' from teachers and school systems, and about a
dozen states have halved or even canceled recess as too frivolous
an activity for children, educators like Moore maintain that
outdoor activities, whether directed or ``free'' play, encourage
observation and creative thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are no comprehensive studies yet to prove that such
environments improve test scores, schools like Southern Pines
Elementary report a marked reduction in violence and rising
academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our incidents and fights have really gone down,'' said Mary
Scott Harrison, the principal. ``And our test scores have improved
big time.''
</P>
<P>
   In four years, the percentage of children meeting or exceeding
proficiency levels in math and reading rose to 79 percent from 60
percent, she said. The school is aiming for an 80 percent
proficiency rate this year, she added, ``which will make us a
school of distinction in North Carolina.'' She called the pupils'
performance remarkable, considering that many entering kindergarten
``don't even recognize colors or know their numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   On any given day at Southern Pines Elementary, you may see
children planting native grasses in the longleaf pine forest that
abuts the playground, peering at birds through the bird blind,
making musical instruments from sticks or testing the acid-alkaline
balance of water from a storm sewer as they collect data for a
water quality project.
</P>
<P>
   The park has become fertile ground for what Moore calls
``natural learning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued by how this place has become a place of
imaginative play,'' he said as, from a discreet distance, he
watched children fooling around with logs and wood chips inside the
pioneer cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave a little bit of looseness in the environment, and
the kids will adapt it to something,'' he said. Like pretending the
cabin is a spaceship, and the pieces of wood are transmitters.
``Hello! Hello! Coming in!'' they shout as they run among the
shrubs and trees behind the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon Moore watched a group of 7-year-olds, boys and
girls, black and white, playing horse. ``They were riding each
other, galloping around that circle of logs by the cabin,'' he
said. ``It was very positive social action. And it doesn't happen
on a hard place where kids are bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore grew up freely roaming the hills and woods of Kent in
England, poking around old mines and abandoned military camps with
his pals. They built underground forts and leapt from the pliable
branches of coppiced linden trees. They helped with the haying. As
long as they got home for dinner in one piece, no questions were
asked.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from children's play today, of course, where
school and park administrators are constantly worried about being
sued, and parents are anxious about kidnappings, drug abuse and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many parents work long hours, children spend most of
their days indoors or in supervised activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That culture of childhood that played outside has gone and
been replaced by after-school programs,'' Hart said. ``If you're
rich it's programs; if you're poor it's TV, so you're trapped
indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore studied architecture at London University in the 1950s,
when the city was still full of ``adventure playgrounds'' _
bombed-out World War II sites that children put to free-spirited
use. Supervised by play leaders who looked out for their safety,
they invented games and leapt from tall towers built from the
rubble, exhilarated by the risks that Moore thinks are essential
for agility and self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adventure playgrounds never really caught on in the U.S., even
though their safety record is exemplary,'' said Moore, who was the
president of the International Association for Children's Right to
Play for 15 years. ``If kids are really engaged and have a
stimulating environment where they can take risks in the healthy
sense of the word, they are not going to have an accident. That
happens when they get bored and start pushing each other around.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at Southern Pines Elementary, children may not be leaping
off homemade platforms _ Mrs. Harrison keeps a close eye on safety
and liability issues _ but they aren't patronized with kiddie
tools, either. They built the pioneer cabin with real 18th-century
tools under the guidance of parents, and use grown-up saws to cut
logs for the campfire.
</P>
<P>
   In the longleaf pine forest, a forester from the State Fish and
Wildlife Service helps third graders saw young scrub oaks to
prepare for a controlled burn.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Harrison is requiring teachers to create at least six
lessons related to the environment outside the school doors and is
encouraging them to read the works of Howard Gardner, the Harvard
cognitive psychologist whose theory of multiple intelligences
includes sensitivity to the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All this seems light years from the day she met Bruce Cunningham
and Ann Petersen, who had decided to send their daughter, Katie, to
kindergarten at Southern Pines Elementary, with its ebullient 50-50
mix of black and white children, rather than to the mostly white
Episcopal church school in their own neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawyers, they were impressed not only with the school's
racial mix, but also with its teachers and the charismatic
principal, Blanchie Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school was a very good school, but it had a stigma,'' Ms.
Petersen said. ``Whenever the local paper reported what little bit
of drug or violent crime we have here, it would say it was coming
out of the school, `which is known to be in a high crime
district.'''
</P>
<P>
   The incidents were limited, parents say, to a street three
blocks from the school. The only real danger that Ms. Petersen and
Cunningham could see was in the rickety equipment on the playground
and the thorny weeds that kept the children cooped up _ and
fighting _ on the one clear patch of hot asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harrison, who was then the assistant principal, invited
them to head up the new playground committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial plan was to raise $40,000 for a piece of
equipment, stick it into this desert and call it a playground,''
Ms. Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   But then Cunningham discovered the work of Moore and talked him
into visiting the school. He arrived with slides of his
``environmental yard'', a playground that children and grown-ups
had transformed from an acre and a half of hardtop into a natural
landscape complete with woods and stream. He laid out some of his
ideas about natural learning and was struck by the spirit of
community at Southern Pines Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   So he agreed to do a master plan. Everybody wanted trees, grass
and new play equipment. But Moore's plan considered circulation
patterns _ how people flow through a space _ and made sure there
were various active and quiet places all through the site.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Everyone worked together on the principles of universal design,
so that a child like Evan Long, who has a learning disability,
could leap from a low platform in the purple monster with as much
joy as his friends who were jumping from higher spots.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Nilda Cosco, a play therapist trained in Argentina, guided
parents away from the Swiss chalet they wanted for a playhouse.
``Build your own culture,'' she counseled them, so they decided to
build their own log cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Moore recalled that when Cunningham suggested putting snow
fencing around the young sycamore trees the children had helped
plant near the play equipment, he shook his head and said, ``Get
each class to adopt a tree, water it and measure it, and you won't
have any trouble with vandalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nocton has watched her first graders become more observant
as they have planted a bird habitat and a butterfly garden. ``They
bring me things, like seedpods, eggshells and feathers,'' she said.
``They tell me about a special place where they heard a bird
singing. They are more respectful _ they want to take care of the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence plummeted as soon as the new park opened. ``Before,
they didn't value the school as much,'' she said. ``They didn't
have a sense of ownership. Now they are actively involved in its
development.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Madie Davis, a counselor for the school who has worked in this
neighborhood for 15 years, has noticed more families going to the
schoolyard to jog or walk. She finds herself using the park during
counseling sessions with troubled children, ``because it is a
serene, peaceful environment and they are more subject to opening
up.''

THE DALAI LAMA'S KEYS TO HAPPINESS (AND THE BEST-SELLER LIST) 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you want to be happy? Just follow this procedure. ``Generally
speaking, one begins by identifying those factors which lead to
happiness and those factors which lead to suffering. Having done
this, one then sets about gradually eliminating those factors which
lead to suffering and cultivating those which lead to happiness.
That is the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of happiness may not really be quite that simple,
but the formula, offered by Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, in
``The Art of Happiness,'' certainly seems to have struck a chord.
Written with Howard C. Cutler, a psychiatrist from Phoenix, ``The
Art of Happiness'' (Riverhead) has been on the New York Times
best-seller list for 37 weeks. Following up on that success, the
Dalai Lama published another book that is very similar in theme and
style to the first. It is ``Ethics for the New Millennium,'' also
issued by Riverhead, which has been a best seller for seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Two simultaneous best sellers, every author's dream, suggest
that the Dalai Lama, until recently a rather remote spiritual
leader living in exile in India, has become highly accessible; a
guru and a popular one. Yet as with other books of the
how-to-be-happy genre, the Dalai Lama's probably tell us more about
those who are reading them than about the author. And in this light
it seems fair to ask what it is about his books that has made them
so prized. Beyond that, what special wisdom does the Dalai Lama _
as opposed to others in the lucrative business of spiritual
self-help _ bring to bear?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the first question is that the books contain a
powerful element of integrity and sincerity. A comparison with an
even longer-running best seller from the spiritual uplift shelf,
Neale Donald Walsch's ``Conversations With God: An Uncommon
Dialogue,'' helps to make this point. Walsch's book, which has been
on the best-seller list for 129 weeks, purports to be the result of
direct communication with the Deity _ who sounds, as Walsch
transcribes His words, like a cross between Norman Vincent Peale
and Ann Landers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama refreshingly claims no unusual spiritual powers.
He identifies himself as an ordinary man, prone to the same
troubles as the rest of us, but one who has learned something about
conquering the impulses that make us unhappy. He probably gains a
degree of moral authority because of the dignity he has shown, the
unshakable public calm he maintains in the face of China's
oppressive policies in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Conversations With God'' is pretentious
theological fakery; the Dalai Lama's books are intelligently,
unpretentiously secular. But the message or, as Walsch's God puts
it, the ``profound spiritual truth'' of both is essentially the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do for your Self, you do for another,'' Walsch's
Supreme Being intones. ``What you do for another, you do for the
Self.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, even without a direct line to God, takes a
similar position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altruism is an essential component of those actions which lead
to genuine happiness,'' the Dalai Lama writes. ``We find that the
spiritual actions we undertake which are motivated not by narrow
self-interest but out of our concern for others actually benefit
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It is remarkable in an age where the self, the ego, the I is not
exactly hiding under a rock that the best-selling message is that
the self is not what it's cracked up to be. Here is a partial
answer to the second question, about the extent to which the Dalai
Lama's counsel is based on some special, arcane knowledge he
possesses as a monk schooled in Tibetan Buddhist philosophy. In
fact, his teachings about the self seem drawn from the fundamental
Buddhist precept that the self is an illusion, that the belief in
it traps us in the repeating cycles of painful existence from which
enlightenment can free us.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is thus no single thing that can be found under analysis
to identify the self,'' he writes in ``Ethics for the New
Millennium.'' ``Indeed, we are forced to conclude that this
precious thing which we take such care of, which we go to such
lengths to protect and make comfortable, is, in the end, no more
substantial than a rainbow in the summer sky.'' That is very
Buddhist in tone and inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, the Dalai Lama strives not to be a specifically
Buddhist teacher. He even gently repudiates religion. ``I sometimes
say,'' he writes, ``that religion is something we can perhaps do
without.'' One wonders if that is not part of his appeal _ a call
for a ``spiritual revolution'' that does not depend on the idea of
a Supreme Being. It is perhaps the perfect way to satisfy the
spiritual hunger of people living in a scientific and secular age.
Our secularism denies us spiritual satisfaction while making
conventional religious belief difficult or impossible. The Dalai
Lama's secular spiritualism steps into the void.
</P>
<P>
   There are problems with this, not least a blandness that makes
it seem pretty tepid stuff for a ``revolution.'' I myself found
reading most of the Dalai Lama's two books only barely interesting
enough to keep going, and I am an admirer of the man for his
political stand. The tone is so strenuously inoffensive that you
begin wishing for a dose of old-fashioned religion, a little fire
and brimstone instead of all that moderation.
</P>
<P>
   More important, perhaps, is that the very first assumption the
Dalai Lama makes in both of his best-selling books is a dubious
one. ``The purpose of our existence is to seek happiness,'' he
declares. Is that really true? The Dalai Lama's definition of
happiness is what he calls a ``spiritual'' one. Happiness comes, he
writes, from cultivating the traits of selflessness, generosity and
compassion for others.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you wonder: What would some modern-day Job feel if
confronted with the assertion that the very purpose of life is to
be happy? Doing good and being happy are not the same as ultimate
purposes. And then there are those who believe that the purpose of
life is to praise God and to obey His commandments. For them,
happiness is not the main goal.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you accept that happiness is the ultimate purpose, the
Dalai Lama's prescriptions for achieving it are on the abstract
side, and they pay only passing attention to such built-in
obstacles as the will to power, the death wish, the id, self-hatred
and what Carl Sagan called ``the reptilian core,'' the kernel of
savagery in the brain left untouched by the process of evolution.
The Dalai Lama simply states and restates his belief in the
essential goodness of human nature, but that seems a touch
Panglossian after this bloody century.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Dalai Lama has had more experience than most of
us with real suffering, and his ability to maintain a sober
composure is no doubt a key to his public image and thus also to
the success of his books. The subtext here is, If I can do it, so
can you. It is a subtext that has led many to embrace his texts.

 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lives of friends and acquaintances are as necessary to
fiction writers as the runaway slave was to Huck Finn, so beware of
the novelist or short-story writer as friend. If you don't, then
sooner or later you might be pridefully reading your chum's work
and the light bulb of recognition will pop in your head and you'll
say, ``Whoa, that's me.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer will have confiscated your character and stolen your
life story, and there you are, rendered exposed and helpless. Or
perhaps even exposed and feeling pretty good about yourself. Either
way, watch out. That's what fiction writers often do, and have
always done: snatch what doesn't belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no way to wrest your personal chronicle back from
the writer, and only very, very seldom is there any way to get
recompense for the appropriation of the property that is you.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point. Over the weekend, there was a lengthy item in the
gossip columns of The New York Post alleging that Melissa Bank,
fiction writer, had plucked a piece of the life of a friend, Judith
Keller, a playwright and filmmaker, and turned it into a short
story that was included in her best-selling collection, ``The
Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing'' (Viking).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Keller's play ``The Club Med Account'' has had a staged
reading conducted by Nigel Noble, and she is writing another play,
but what she is really afraid of, she says, is that now people will
think she stole her own life from Ms. Bank rather than vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   She said she and Ms. Bank had agreed in writing that when the
story, ``The Best Possible Light,'' appeared in a book, it would be
introduced this way: ``As told to me by Judith Keller.'' It wasn't.
But by Ms. Keller's account, the ``agreed in writing'' was a rather
singular ceremony in which the two women, sitting together, each
wrote on a scrap of paper the proposed story introduction and each
signed her own scrap, which each of them then tucked away without
exchanging them. Surely that's a scene worthy of a short story.
</P>
<P>
   Hello. A playwright and filmmaker should know that writers
shamelessly ingest what they see, what they hear, what you tell
them, and, if they are truly good, somehow they make all that their
own. That's their magic. Or, as Ms. Bank put it: ``Every story you
write has something to do with real life. Yours, or someone else's.
That's where you start. It's never where you end up if the story is
any good.'' She would say no more.
</P>
<P>
   The history of writing is rich with examples of the
extraordinary adventurousness with which authors make others' lives
the stuff of their writing. For instance, Flaubert's ``Madame
Bovary'' did more than tap the rhythms and idiom of French
petit-bourgeois village life. Flaubert's father was a physician,
and the novel is largely based on the marriage of one of Dr.
Flaubert's medical students, Eugene Delamare, and the suicide of
his wife, Delphine, after an adulterous affair.
</P>
<P>
   In Zola's most overtly autobiographical novel, ``L'Oeuvre,'' the
main character, an artist, was based almost entirely on the
novelist's lifelong friend Cezanne. The novel concluded that the
fictional artist, and therefore the great master, was, in the end,
a creative failure. Cezanne was deeply hurt, and there is no record
that the two men ever spoke to each other again after the work's
publication in 1886.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the main character in Saul Bellow's ``Humboldt's
Gift'' (Viking Press, 1975), the sumptuous Von Humboldt Fleisher,
poet, thinker and manic schemer, was based on the poet Delmore
Schwartz. The very conceit of a writer's pilfering someone else's
life seems to fascinate writers.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Margulies' play ``Collected Stories,'' very popular off-
Broadway last year, was about two women, an older writer and her
young disciple, a plot eerily similar in some ways to the
Bank-Keller flap. (Schwartz had a whole second life in other
writers' work. The older woman in the play also had a love affair
with Delmore Schwartz.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bank is obviously not Flaubert or Zola or Bellow. But did
she rip off someone's life the way they did? Ms. Keller says yes,
and there are those who would agree. Did Ms. Bank veer too close to
Ms. Keller's experience? Perhaps, but one publisher, not Ms.
Bank's, shrugged off the question when asked about the ethics and
said: ``That's what fiction writers do. They write not only their
own experiences but what they learn from other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this appropriating legal? In 1994, Viking canceled the novel
``While England Sleeps'' by David Leavitt in both Britain and the
United States after Sir Stephen Spender, the poet, sued in English
courts, charging that Leavitt had stolen the story of a doomed
homosexual love affair from the 1951 Spender memoir, ``World Within
World.'' Furthermore, the poet said that by adding explicit
imagined details, Leavitt had violated Spender's ``moral right'' to
control how his own material was used, the latter point arising out
of a British copyright law that was new at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this case the publisher's surrender was extremely
unusual. But pillaging someone's memoir is different from borrowing
someone's experiences. Generally if a person is identifiable, in
the sense that her friends and acquaintances recognize her, and she
is defamed, then there is a cause for libel action. But in the
practical world it is hard to prove that a fictional character
defamed a real person, short of the shock of an allegation of
terrible horror _ incest with one's father, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Can the plaintiff claim that a contract existed with the writer,
as Ms. Keller implies? It can be claimed, but the burden of proof
of a contract is on the plaintiff. A prominent publishing house
lawyer said that these cases were not usually very successful for
the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are cases in which the novelist should beware.
Years ago a novelist, Gwen Mitchell, went to a nude encounter group
and signed a firm contract that she wouldn't disclose what happened
there. Despite that, a couple of years later she wrote a novel
about it. The leader of the encounter group was tall, thin and
clean-shaven. To disguise him and the group, the author depicted
him in her book as bearded. But people change, and by the time the
book was published he was bearded. He sued, and Ms. Mitchell and
her publisher, Doubleday, were held accountable and had to pay
damages.

 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a partial list of questions that the two most curious
humans on this planet asked me the other day while they were eating
an after-school snack: What are the stages of a solar eclipse? When
is the Backstreet Boys' next concert? What are the definitions of
mean, median and mode? How can we get tickets to a Backstreet Boys
concert? Why do some bees have longer legs than others? Can we buy
a color printer, go online, find color photos of the Backstreet
Boys, print them out and tape them to our bedroom walls?
</P>
<P>
   As I looked at my two older daughters, ages 10 and 8, I realized
that for once I had got lucky. While there are some days when Zoe's
and Ella's unrelenting need to know everything about everything
stumps me completely, this time I knew the answer: No, you may
never, ever put tape on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of their queries, I decided that this would be a
good time for them to use some Internet search sites that are
designed for children _ and which in theory should know a broader
range of answers than I do. ``OK,'' Ella said. ``But we can only do
it for an hour because we want to watch `The Simpsons.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fine, I said, because I secretly had my own agenda: I wanted to
see how easily they navigated each site. I had spent a few hours
earlier in the week conducting test searches at five children's
search sites, but as a mere adult, what did I know about what kids
like? All five sites promised to have the best collection of online
information for children, and all five employed human or software
filters to block pornographic, profane and violent sites. I wanted
to put both claims to a test.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, my children's opinions differed from mine. They were
charmed by all five sites, found each intuitively easy to navigate,
never ran across a single inappropriate link and got so diverted
when their queries led them onto intellectual tangents that they
forgot to log off in time to watch ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   YAHOOLIGANS
</P>
<P>
   www.yahooligans.com
</P>
<P>
   Yahooligans looks like a junior version of its parent site at
Yahoo, with a home page that has both a prominent query box and a
list of general categories that you can click on to start delving
into more specific topics. Information is organized in a manner
that mimics Yahoo as well; when a user submits a query, it searches
for answers from among its own proprietary directory of sites,
which have been screened and organized by category, topic and
subtopic.
</P>
<P>
   The site differs from its parent mainly in the amount of
information available _ filtering blocks many adult sites available
on Yahoo _ and the way information is categorized. For instance,
two of Yahooligans' biggest categories are School Bell and Sports
and Recreation, with information geared to 7- to 12-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   How big is the site's directory? I can't say for sure, because
Catherine Davis, Yahooligans' managing editor and producer, told me
that Yahooligans doesn't release that information because ``we
don't want to start some kind of competition where another site
claims to be more comprehensive by claiming they have one more site
than we do.'' But in any event, my daughters found plenty of
relevant responses to their queries here.
</P>
<P>
   When, for instance, Ella typed ``Backstreet Boys'' in the query
box, the site responded in two ways: with a list of four categories
and a list of 62 sites where she could find information on tour
dates, band members and photos. And when Zoe typed ``sharks'' in
the query box on the home page, she was so overwhelmed by the
number of responses _ 24 categories and 143 specific sites _ that
she immediately went back and narrowed the search to ``shark attack
pictures,'' which led her two clicks later to a shark attack fact
sheet. Did you know that more people are killed annually by bees
than by sharks? Zoe does.
</P>
<P>
   To check the filtering, I searched for the word ``sex.''
Yahooligans responded with a list of three sites _ a technical
discussion of the process of fertility and two links to a separate
site guide for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Our only complaint: this heavily trafficked site, which had
463,000 visitors in August, according to the Media Metrix research
company, may be too popular. During a return visit on a subsequent
weeknight, the site was unable to process Ella's identical requests
for information about the Backstreet Boys. After the site told her
four times in a row that ``a connection to the server could not be
established,'' she got frustrated and signed off.
</P>

<P>
   ASK JEEVES FOR KIDS
</P>
<P>
   www.ajkids.com
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves for Kids has a very uncluttered home page, dominated
by an image of an intrepid butler on safari and a query box that
directed Zoe and Ella to ``please type a question and click
`Ask!''' This format is different from the searching techniques _
keyword searches or clicking on topics _ common at the other search
sites. My daughters immediately preferred this format; after all,
their inclination is to seek information by asking questions, not
by using Boolean logic to search on key phrases.
</P>
<P>
   When a user poses a question _ Zoe typed, ``What are stars?'' _
the site tries to match the wording against a list of two million
questions for which the site has answers. This technique of gently
nudging a child in the right direction is a very effective way of
teaching the site's intended audience _ 7- to 12-year-olds _ how to
pose thoughtful questions that will lead them to the answers they
really want. Instead of searching the Web for answers, the site
serves up responses that have been preselected and archived in a
directory. (My query about sex elicited two reasonable,
child-friendly alternatives: ``Where do babies come from?'' and
``Where can teens get advice online?'')
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Zoe's question, the site responded by asking
whether Zoe really had meant to ask ``Where can I see a star
chart?'' Within seconds, Zoe was examining a globe-shaped chart of
the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   The site focuses more on academic subjects than on
entertainment. Penny Finnie, the site's executive producer, said:
``Based on the questions we see children asking, we specialize in
answering questions about science and history. We don't offer as
much information about games.'' For my daughters, using the site
was as entertaining as any game.
</P>
<P>
   SEARCHOPOLIS
</P>
<P>
   www.searchopolis.com
</P>
<P>
   Designed for older children, ages 10 to 18, Searchopolis looks
and operates much more like a typical search engine than the other
children's search sites. The search results, for instance, list the
addresses of specific sites, not just text descriptions of their
contents. The search and filtering strategies are less restrictive
than the other sites'. ``Our philosophy is much different from the
other kids' search sites,'' said Peter Nickerson, chief executive
of N2H2, which owns Searchopolis. ``Our approach is to think that
kids will use the Web in ways we cannot even imagine, and so we
need to provide them access to as much information as possible, as
long as it's safe.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of answering queries with selections from a
relatively limited, pre-edited directory of sites, Searchopolis
uses the same powerful Inktomi search technology utilized by
general search sites like Hotbot. After filtering, 90 percent of
Inktomi's database of 100 million pages is available to
Searchopolis users.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an abundance of information _ on topics ranging
from the Backstreet Boys (the site offered a list of 6,669 sites)
to sex (with a list of 172 sites). ``Our own feeling is that an
awful lot of sites that have `sex' in them are not only appropriate
but also have information designed for kids,'' Nickerson said,
adding that a team of editors reviews each site with potentially
inappropriate content before deciding whether to filter it.
</P>
<P>
   When I searched for ``sex,'' for instance, the first 20
responses covered a wide range of topics, from ``Somatic
sex-determining signals act on XX germ cells in Drosophila
embryos'' to ``Massachusetts Sex Offender Registry Information.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Zoe asked the site to find ``pictures of the moon,''
Searchopolis responded with a list of 47,045. But the responses
weren't always as relevant as those from the pre-selected sites.
When Zoe clicked on the first response, the home page for a company
called Full Moon Pictures filled the screen.
</P>
<P>
   AOL NETFIND/KIDS ONLY
</P>
<P>
   This is a children's version of America Online's proprietary
search engine, and, like the rest of AOL, it has a design so simple
and clean that even a beginner can navigate it without much
trouble. Version 5.0 of the service made its debut this month, but
no changes were made to the way the children's search engine works.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe greeted this site like an old friend and informed me that
this is the search engine she uses at school, where she learned
tricks like how to narrow a search by adding more specific keywords
to her query. ``Most people in my class figured out how to use it
pretty fast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at children from ages 6 to 12, AOL Netfind/Kids Only uses
the Cyber Patrol software filter from the Learning Company to block
access to sites that are considered pornographic, profane or
violent. Using adult wiles and trying really hard, I managed to
find a link to a single inappropriate site: a search on the keyword
``breast'' led me to a college research paper called ``Kids
Online,'' which linked to both the Playboy and Penthouse home
pages.
</P>
<P>
   However, my standardized test for dirty words _ a search on the

<P>
   CHICAGO _ As it approaches, the premiere of an opera, almost
unbearably languorous in its gestation, gallops toward opening
night with frightful speed.
</P>
<P>
   It has been four years since Lyric Opera of Chicago commissioned
an adaptation of Arthur Miller's 1955 play, ``A View From the
Bridge,'' from composer William Bolcom and librettist Arnold
Weinstein. The last of the principal roles _ Eddie Carbone, the
Brooklyn dockworker whose lust for his niece, Catherine, brings
about his tragic death _ was cast a year ago. The set was designed
by early summer. The singers, who have had their parts since
spring, began rehearsals in August. The orchestra came in three
weeks ago. The costumes had their fine-tunings last week.
</P>
<P>
   The opera opens on Saturday night at the Civic Opera House here
to a sellout crowd of more than 3,600. But the first full-dress
run-through with the orchestra and all the creative elements in
place was only Tuesday. Wednesday, another dress rehearsal adds an
audience of invited guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a collision of forces,'' said Frank Galati, the stage
director. ``We're not careening out of control, but we are being
jettisoned toward the living event.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is the singers who will be propelled before the
public with the most stirring immediacy, which makes the last
rehearsals a swift pivot, from a concern with ingesting a role _ to
use the word of Catherine Malfitano, the soprano who plays
Beatrice, Eddie's wife _ to a concern with sharing and projecting
it.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, in these final days, seemingly minute changes
don't seem quite so minute. When the pronunciation of one
character's name was altered from Louis to Louie (Arthur Miller was
consulted on this) there was consternation among the singers, whose
musical interpretations of text are affected by such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the hardest thing is to go from the notes on the page
to the organic place inside of me where the words and music
suddenly come together and become my creation,'' Ms. Malfitano
said. ``To take something foreign to you and ingest it and make it
a part of you so that when you perform it nobody ever realizes it
was ever anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   During the home stretch, the singers are also making the
disorienting move from the rehearsal room to the theater, where the
larger stage requires a different spacing among the performers, and
the vast auditorium, with its own acoustics, demands a new
attention to projection. And as the singers work with the
orchestra, their hearing needs to be attuned anew as well. To
locate a pitch on the oboe or trombone after being accustomed to
hearing it on the piano is an adjustment; so is singing with brass
players, whose volume and tone may compete with those of a voice,
or with pianissimo strings, which an overly forceful voice may
threaten to obscure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've sung in this house,'' said Gregory
Turay, 26, who plays Rodolpho, the immigrant swain who steals
Catherine's heart. ``I've sung in the Met, and that has a warmer
feeling. In this house it's hard to feel my voice. I don't know if
I'm pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world premiere, of course, the pressure on opening night is
heightened by the notion that it is a defining occasion. This is
the first premiere for Turay, something he prefers not to think
about (``You can fill your head with that stuff and
self-destruct'') but that the singers acknowledge has complicated
their task all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overcoming the technical obstacles, getting the part in your
voice so it's a consequent expressive outpouring _ it's more
difficult with a new role because there's no other standard,'' said
Ms. Malfitano, whose 30-year career has included a number of new
works, including Bolcom's ``McTeague,'' at Lyric in 1992. ``We're
proving that the opera is eminently learnable, singable, doable,
enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious handicap, perhaps, is that there is no
recording of the work; in learning their roles the singers were on
their own, and as with much of contemporary composition the musical
vocabulary has an unbridled range. Chords of varying dissonance
mingle with those of wrenching sentimentality; leaps and dives in
pitch of more than an octave, not the easiest for even trained
singers to hear, are frequent, which can be grueling for the voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the fact that we all make a great case for modern
music, the truth is it is more anti-vocal than the older stuff,''
said baritone Kim Josephson, who plays Eddie Carbone. ``It's
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, many singers simply steer clear of contemporary
operas altogether. But those who don't relish the challenge
precisely because it allows them to unveil the thrill, the
sensuousness and the lyricism of unfamiliar sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That thrill is learned, to a certain extent,'' said Dawn
Upshaw, who will sing the role of Daisy Buchanan in John Harbison's
adaptation of ``The Great Gatsby'' at the Metropolitan Opera in New
York in December. ``By listening to singers of the past, we've
learned what the thrilling moments are supposed to be. It is true
that there are many composers today who are struggling to find a
new way to write for voice, and in so doing have lost a sense of
what is vocal and lyrical. But when they are written well, I love
singing leaps. They can be incredibly expressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolcom's score has its idiosyncrasies, the singers say; he's
fond of ninths and tritones, particularly discordant intervals. And
as difficult as the music can be, in learning it, the predilections
of the composer are revealed. ``Like Mozart or Bellini, Bolcom has
a musical language,'' said Juliana Rambaldi, the soprano who plays
Eddie's niece, Catherine. ``Once you understand the language, it's
easier; you start to hear like he does. You can expect a ninth
here, or a tritone there.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a new piece, Ms. Malfitano added, it's part of her job to
help the audience stretch their ears in order to find the beauty
she has worked to discover for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always say, `Is there something you can walk out of the
opera humming?''' she said. ``What they have to learn to appreciate
is the virtuosity of what we are doing, to try and make a ninth
sound as consonant as a second, to try and build a melodic line.''
For both singer and listener, she said, ``it's possible to find the
line there, but it's a little more work.''
</P>
<P>
   They are helped by the presence of Bolcom, a luxury generally
unavailable in a work from the classic repertory. ``When we come
across a section of the music that seems odd, we can ask him, `What
did you mean here?''' Josephson said. ``I have a line at the end of
a fight scene, the tessatura'' _ the general range of the passage _
``is high, and it comes on what feels like the wrong part of a
beat. It just seemed awkward, and finally I looked over at Bill,
and I said, `What is this?' And he said, `Oh, Kim, you're supposed
to be panting after this fight. It goes like this.' And he panted
it for me, and it made perfect sense.''
</P>
<P>
   They are helped as well by the very Americanness of the work.
Not only does Bolcom draw on an identifiably American musical idiom
(the influence of pop and show music is intermittently felt) but
the play, of course, is a standard repertory piece from the
American theater. The language is English of a particularly
American vernacular, that of working-class post-World War II
Brooklyn. (Hence: Louie.) The cultural familiarity is a boon to the
singers, particularly in their acting, which is of paramount
importance in a contemporary work that has no familiar music with
which to palliate an audience and needs all its available modes of
seduction: story and character as well as song.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, singers themselves have increasingly
acknowledged and concentrated on the dramatic elements of their
stage work, and lip service is often paid to the totality of
performance. But it was a bit of a surprise to discover how focused
these singers have been on the melding of text and music into
drama. In interviews they had to be pressed to discuss music at
all; acting was foremost on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catherine is between a girl and a woman,'' Ms. Rambaldi said,
``and for me it's been interesting to find when she's a girl and
when she's a woman. How much does she realize what's going on
between her and Eddie? It was tempting to approach her as too wise
a person, because I'm older than 17. I had to check back a little
bit and find the moments when she was a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   (Ms. Rambaldi, who is 32 and pregnant, will sing only the first
six performances; for the final three she will be replaced by a
Canadian singer, Isabel Bayrakdarian.)
</P>
<P>
   Mark McCrory, the bass baritone who plays Marco, Rodolpho's
brother and the agent of Eddie's demise, has only one significant
musical moment, but it is a doozy; an aria (with lyrics by Miller)
in which he channels the pain of immigrant life into his disgust
with Eddie, the man who has betrayed him. The furious emotion of
the moment is tempered by Marco's innate dignity and self-control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really pouring out his soul in that aria,'' McCrory said.
``What he feels, where he's coming from, and that gets channeled
into his hate for Eddie. With all that emotion, maintaining that
stoicism in the character is the difficult part. That's what I've
been struggling with throughout rehearsals, trying to sing it well,
balance out the emotions and still not let them get in the way of
the vocalism.''
</P>
<P>
   How the opera will be received by the opening night audience is,
of course, a drama in itself. But anyone witnessing recent
rehearsals would come away aware that the drama is working at least
for the performers, who have frequently been reduced to tears by
the tragic finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping everybody loves it like we do,'' Ms. Malfitano
said. ``We have the good fortune to become intimate with it, and
the audience will not have that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is often the plight of new operas, the vast
majority of which go unperformed a second or third time. The
frequent lament is that composers suffer and that audiences are
left the poorer. But singers have bet on a work with their time and
effort, and risk never having a chance to reprise their roles and
grow in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just beginning to taste this piece,'' Ms. Malfitano
said. ``And every night it will get deeper, more exotic, more
sensual. The sad part of this is that I've done over 100
performances of `Madame Butterfly.' I doubt I'll ever do 100
performances of Bea. I hope I'll do more than nine.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent crisis in the Taiwan Strait makes Patrick E. Tyler's
account of three decades of U.S. policy-making toward China
especially welcome, for Taiwan has always been at the center of the
U.S.-China relationship. China insists on its sovereignty over the
island and reserves the right to use force to prevent it from going
independent. The United States is committed to protect Taiwan from
the mainland's use of force, but does not want it to claim
independence.
</P>
<P>
   This might be a formula for peace if the people of Taiwan wanted
unity with the mainland, but they don't. So the American position
on Taiwan resembles that on Kosovo _ we defend your right to
autonomy as long as you don't want it _ but it is more troublesome
in some ways. How did we get here? Tyler's ``investigative
history'' is based on thousands of government documents, scores of
interviews, and a thorough mining of archives and memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler, a correspondent for The New York Times and its former
Beijing bureau chief, tells a complex story with impressive
clarity. He brings us deskside to the policy makers and shows us
their strategic visions and private manipulations. His material is
richer on the American side, but he tells us as much as possible
about the Chinese side as well.
</P>
<P>
   In these memoir-drenched times it is hard to come up with a
major revision of our understanding of how China policy was made.
President Richard M. Nixon ``opened'' China partly to balance the
power of the Soviet Union, but mainly to get help exiting from the
Vietnam War, a hope in which he was disappointed. President Jimmy
Carter normalized relations because he needed a big achievement
before the next presidential campaign. President Ronald Reagan
downgraded the role of China in his global strategy, over the
objections of his secretary of state, Alexander M. Haig Jr.
President George Bush tried to rescue the relationship from the
wreckage of Tiananmen. President Clinton bluffed China on human
rights and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Tyler's narrative concerns the fine-grain machinations
of the policy process, sometimes down to the banquet menus. Nixon
prevailed on the Chinese to delay invitations to Democrats until he
could get there first. His national security adviser, Henry A.
Kissinger, kept White House talks with China secret from the State
Department, hero-worshiped Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai and flattered
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security adviser, gave
about as much energy to defeating Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance
as to defeating the Soviet Union. Haig yelled at State Department
staff members. The U.S. ambassador J. Stapleton Roy gave a
newspaper interview to Tyler that undercut State Department policy
on human rights abuses in China.
</P>
<P>
   One can deplore the pettiness of the policy process, much of
which has long been known, but what about the results? In ``About
Face'' (Knopf, 1999), which covers the same history, James Mann
argues that the Americans were bamboozled by Chinese bluster and
dazzled by exaggerated visions of China's greatness. Tyler does not
believe China poses a substantial threat to America so he does not
make this criticism. He has a few tactical complaints, some larger
(Kissinger encouraged a Chinese attack on India in 1971,
fortunately without result) and some smaller (Kissinger might have
probed the Chinese position more forcefully in 1974). But he seems
largely to accept the wisdom of American policy on China as it has
evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Reading not too far beneath the surface of Tyler's account, one
can argue that it was the Chinese, not the Americans, who got
snookered, not once but twice. First, in the high-tension
negotiations over the normalization of diplomatic relations in
1978, the Americans only at the last minute told the Chinese
leader, Deng Xiaoping, that the United States intended to continue
arms sales to Taiwan. Because the American military link is all
that prevents China from gaining control over Taiwan, this point
was of fundamental importance. The Chinese had reasonably assumed
that the Americans would cease arms sales to a country they no
longer recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Deng was apparently shocked, but having started preparations to
invade Vietnam partly on the strength of the upcoming
normalization, he went ahead, telling the Americans that he would
readdress the question later. Meanwhile Congress _ that annoying
additional branch with which it is impossible for foreign
governments to negotiate _ added injury to insult by passing the
Taiwan Relations Act, which has been generally interpreted (rightly
or wrongly) as requiring extensive arms sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 the Chinese forced the Reagan administration to agree to
reduce arms sales to Taiwan step by step. Yet the Americans soon
weaseled out of this commitment, partly by twisting the language of
the accord and partly by simply violating it. Today, Tyler points
out, United States arms are flowing into Taiwan in higher
quantities and quality than ever, potentially creating the
conditions for a high-tech war.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's close review of the negotiating record makes clear that
the Americans thought the Chinese would have to compromise on
Taiwan because of their strategic needs, and the Chinese thought
the Americans could be weaned from their commitment to the
strategically secondary island. But despite decades of ingenious
draftsmanship on both sides, the positions on this issue have never
fundamentally changed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side ever fully understood the depth of the other's
strategic interest in Taiwan. Americans tended to attribute the
Chinese position on Taiwan to emotional nationalism and still do,
and the Chinese seem to think (and often hear from Americans) that
the United States position on Taiwan is determined by the need to
cater to the Republican right and the pro-Taiwan lobby. In fact,
the Taiwan issue is more nonnegotiable than this on both sides.
China's territorial security depends on control of the island, and
the Pax Americana in Asia depends on the United States' ability to
prevent resolution of the issue by force.
</P>
<P>
   As Tyler points out, the United States has worked itself into a
trap in which Taiwan is in charge of our China policy. He might
have added that the Chinese are in a similar trap because they need
unification and good relations with the United States. Thirty years
of effort have only consolidated this mutual dilemma and 30 years
more may not be enough to work ourselves out of it.

   MARTIN-GUERRE-MUSICAL (Minneapolis) _ ``Martin Guerre,'' the
British musical that has returned more often than, well, Martin
Guerre, finally had its American premiere here on Sept. 29. It was
the fourth opening for the show, counting its first one in London's
West End in 1996, and a climactic night for Alain Boublil and
Claude-Michel Schonberg, who first brought the idea to the producer
Cameron Mackintosh a full seven years ago. The tale is based on the
often-told true story of the 16th-century Frenchman who, left for
dead on the battlefield, returns home to find his identity _ his
standing in the village and his place in the marriage bed _ assumed
by his friend and fellow soldier. By Bruce Weber. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).

accustomed to gauging a movie's importance by its advertising
budget and buzz, may understandably scoff at such a claim.
Regardless, the director in question, Hou Hsiao-hsien, is a star of

set providing its own aural soundscape. That is one way of

   GIGLIO-OPERA-COMPANY (Lucca, Italy) _ Small opera companies like
the Teatro del Giglio here worry that their centuries-old trueness
to themselves marks them as provincials unable to cope with any art
but their own. American opera companies, long dependent on private
philanthropy and fund-raising prowess, look across the Atlantic,
envying countries like France and Germany, where federal money for
the arts has flowed almost endlessly. With financial faucets
closing, Europeans now wish they had developed the money-generating
skills that Americans have refined into an art. These matters are
particularly acute in a small Tuscan city like Lucca and a country
like Italy, where opera is not a plaything for the well heeled but
government business. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).

Oklahoma-born, Paris-based baritone David Pittman-Jennings
exemplifies the sign. Since choosing voice over the oboe as his
vehicle for artistic expression at the end of the Vietnam War, he
has gone on to master repertoire ranging from Bach to the most
mandarin of the moderns. On Saturday he celebrates what seems to be
a tardy New York debut in the title role of Luigi Dallapiccola's
``Il Prigioniero'' (``The Prisoner''), in concert with the Montreal
Symphony Orchestra under Charles Dutoit. By Matthew Gurewitsch.

   CORTAZAR-ART (Mexico City) _ The painter, Roberto Cortazar,
regards this city, where he was born 37 years ago, as ``a kind of
body.'' Cortazar's preoccupation with the human figure and his
meticulous rendering of it helped draw attention to his work soon
after he graduated from the National School of the Arts here in
1983. For his drawings, he won a prize that year named after the
important Mexican modern artist Jose Luis Cuevas. An exhibition of

expression: funny, sinister, ascetic, wild or haunting. ``Masks:

someone who is not exactly a household name? Well, no one, it

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Water, the mother of metaphors, means music,
narrative writing or for that matter just about anything else you
can think of. The sea is legato, Wagner's endless melody. Waves are
the phrases within it, establishing meter and rhythm. Currents
determine tempo.
</P>
<P>
   Melville's ``Moby-Dick,'' subject of Laurie Anderson's latest
theatrical meditation, presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music
on Tuesday, is both water and about water. From it our primeval
ancestors emerged, and we, their descendants, harbor urges to
return. Ahab's white whale calls to him and he responds.
</P>
<P>
   These are big, heavy themes, and ``Songs and Stories From
Moby-Dick'' thinks about them in one form or another. In an hour
and a half of music and dance _ elegantly lighted and illustrated,
fastidiously organized and presided over in a spirit of somber
whimsy _ Ms. Anderson and a small troupe of players and musicians
give us what amounts to a book of essays. We learn the habits of
whales and their problems in the modern world. We hear Melville's
words and words about him. The fishing industry is touched on;
Hollywood on ``Moby-Dick'' is explored. ``What does it all mean?''
we are asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson's art plays a dangerous game. For her the
metaphysical stakes are high, and a fatal fall from those heights
is never that far away. Indeed, not much distance separates
profundity from pretension. Negotiating big ideas requires careful
footwork and considerable courage, and there is something else: for
want of a better word, call it humor.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the type of humor that makes one laugh or even smile.
Here, dead seriousness and wry commentary on dead seriousness are
made to coexist. Melville's world is touched up with rock 'n' roll
surreality. Great, bass-heavy amplification surrounds the audience
and sets the chair underneath you to vibrating. Ahab's stovepipe
hat, whimsically elongated, is a major theme. The dancing veers
from frenetic outburst to slow-motion silhouette to the bandstand
choreography of the 1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, who sings, talks and performs on a variety of
electrified violins, ``talking sticks'' and keyboards, plays
technology for all it is worth. With the flip of a computer switch,
her voice dives to the depths of a Russian basso or accompanies
itself in two-part harmony. The music itself ranges from simple
balladry to rock to extensions of rock: namely, a ritual
repetitiveness hovering somewhere between the concert hall and
CBGBs.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely absent from the stage, and an extraordinarily subtle
performer on the bass guitar, is Skuli Sverrisson, whose shifting
rhythmic emphasis represents both change and stability. He is the
heartbeat of ``Songs and Stories From Moby-Dick.'' He and Ms.
Anderson are surrounded by four very effective singers and dancers:
Tom Nelis, Price Waldman, Anthony Turner and Miles Green.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson's other saving strength is the utter
professionalism of her production. At one moment surf rolls
photographically from back-lighted screens; at the next texts crawl
across them; later individual letters tumble by. The metaphoric
connections sound obvious, but they have been perfectly worked out,
function flawlessly and always know when to quit. Michael
Chybowski's lighting is striking.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson sings and plays with great style, but above all it
is her double personality that makes ``Songs and Stories'' a
worthwhile entertainment. We see only one of her, but there are
two. The first earnestly contemplates a world 150 years old and all
the mysteries of creation; the other is coolly up to date, with
just a touch of a smile on her face.
</P>
<P>
   There are more performances Thursday through Saturday and Oct.
12 through 16.

 &HT;    Relaxed pace puts Bowie back on course
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's rock's most celebrated poseur. From glam androgyne to
ambient alien to suntanned pop star, David Bowie has donned and
doffed enough identities over his three-decade-plus career to
outfit an army of Madonnas.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, the guises have seemed ill-fitting. ``Tin
Machine,'' Bowie's foray into torqued-up arena rock, drew
raspberries from critics and fans alike. And while the 1997
electronica-driven release ``Earthling'' had its moments, the
52-year-old singer at times had to strain to keep up with the
skittering drum-and-bass beats.
</P>
<P>
   It is nice to report, then, that, on his 20th solo album, Bowie
has struck his most comfortable pose in eons: He sounds like
himself. Much of ``hours...'' glides on the mid-'70s, epic-ballad
vibe of songs like ``Word on a Wing'' and ``Heroes,'' though with a
contemporary trip-hop gloss. The album's relaxed pace allows
Bowie's vocals to stretch to full languor as he wistfully croons
such reflective musings as ``All of my life I've tried so hard/
Doing my best with what I had/Nothing much happened all the same''
(from the melancholy opener ``Thursday's Child'').
</P>
<P>
   ``hours...'' isn't the fully formed artistic comeback Bowie
might have hoped to produce. It's pleasant without being
particularly arresting, intimate, but only intermittently moving.
Still, it's great to hear this rock chameleon once again finding
his true colors.

 &HT;    `Amen': Cole goes over to dark side
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The darling of the 1998 Grammys is back with the follow-up to
``This Fire,'' the phenomenally successful CD that spawned the hits
``Where Have All the Cowboys Gone'' and ``I Don't Want to Wait''
(which became the theme to TV's teen soap ``Dawson's Creek''). If
you're expecting another video-friendly pop soundtrack, don't hold
your bubble gum breath. Cole has decided to eschew commercial pop
to be a ranting/rapping voice in the wilderness, more John the
Baptist than Elton John.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every tune on the album is a downer, from lyrics about
drive-by shootings to therapy to Dr. Jack Kevorkian. There is
actually a verse about a girl ``that doesn't answer the phone and
eats like a tapeworm.'' On top of it all, nearly every tune is
layered over the same droning beat that sounds like a call to a
Viking funeral. Cole envisions herself as Venus Earth Mother but
has paid more attention here to her angry scribbles of poetry than
the coherency of the music.
</P>
<P>
   The only tune that might possibly be a single is the
out-of-place ``I Believe in Love,'' which is essentially a remake
of Taylor Dane's ``Love Will Lead You Back.''

   Being best known as the mother of much-touted R&AMP;B savior
D'Angelo's babies must be a good and bad thing for Angie Stone. On
the good side, hey, if they could create a life together, it's easy
to think that the least the talents could do together is create a
hit record. But the bad thing is people who've only known her since
she sang back-up for D'Angelo aren't taking into account her early
rap career in Sequence and more memorable turn in R&AMP;B group
Vertical Hold (``Seems You're Much Too Busy''). Oh well, this solo
debut should serve as a more than adequate education on her
abilities. Though it is occasionally as rough as the title implies
_ sometimes offering style (``Bone 2 Pic'') over substantive lyrics
(``Black Diamonds &AMP; Blue Pearls'') _ hang with it, dig deeper and
discover an emotive ability rivaling Chaka Khan's.

<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   There's always been something otherworldly about Stereolab
that's difficult to put into words. Describing the repetitive,
cyclical keyboard and guitar riffs, the breathy vocals of French
chanteuse Laetitia Sadier and a plastic '60s-era futurism only
hints at the (space) oddity of it all. Mentioning that they
actually rock live just muddies the waters further. After a couple
of mellower, poppier efforts the London-based band makes a slight
return to its early experimental efforts without losing the pop
appeal. ``Fuses,'' with its busy bass line and off-kilter jazz
feel, co-exists alongside the mellower lounge-pop vibe of tunes
such as ``The Spiracles.'' Within the space of one song, these
audio explorers can traverse the musical map. The opening minutes
of ``Caleidoscopic Gaze'' recall the acid-dazed ``Smile''-era Brian
Wilson right down to the jaunty piano and Theremin sound alike, the
electric saw. Those opening minutes give way to a choppy wah-wah
guitar riff, Sadier's lovely accented vocals and a little blurting
synthesizer before circling back to the beginning. It's an
eight-minute everything-but-the-kitchen-sink opus, something that
only Sterolab manages to do well.

</P>
<P>
   This recording is surprisingly good. From the syncopated delight
of ``Close Your Eyes'' to the swoony ``Lullaby in Rhythm,'' Michael
Feinstein does something he hasn't done since his earliest Irving
Berlin and George Gershwin discs. He swings, and does so within the
limits of his voice. No more pinched-off high notes. Here they
float, and Feinstein's cords are more pliable, playful and rangy
than ever. Add to the mix the deep-down rumbling (``You Can't Lose
Them All'') and the blessed squealing (``Girl Talk'') of the
Maynard Ferguson Big Band, and you've got a party that will bring a
smile to your lips and a shiver to your spine. There's only one
stinkeroo in this whole 16-pack: Skip the inane lyrics of ``Swing
Is Back in Style,'' and like Feinstein, you'll be back on track.

 &HT;    VIDEO OF THE WEEK
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Pushing Tin'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Donnie Brasco,'' his last movie, director Mike Newell's
new comedy-drama takes us into a high-stress, high-testosterone
parallel universe where men make life-and-death decisions and their
women are accustomed to being treated like steam valves.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Brasco'' was a fact-based slice of mafia life, ``Pushing
Tin'' (also fact-based) introduces us to another kind of family:
the sweaty fraternity of air traffic controllers who keep 747s from
colliding every few seconds in the super-crowded sky above
Manhattan. (``Pushing tin'' is controller slang for routing
planes.)
</P>
<P>
   John Cusack plays Nick, the star cowboy in the tower whose sense
of competition kicks into high gear with the arrival of his polar
opposite, the brooding, Harley-riding Russell (Billy Bob Thornton),
whose luscious young wife (Angelina Jolie) makes Cusack lose
appreciation of his own fine spouse (Cate Blanchett, doing fine
work as a Long Island hausfrau).
</P>
<P>
   For its first third, ``Pushing Tin'' is a fascinating look at
this obsessive-compulsive world. But it turns into something much
more routine, a comedy of discomfort as Nick's and Russell's
competitive streaks start to have repercussions in their bedrooms.
The movie becomes a domestic melodrama that could be unfolding in
just about any high-stress situation; it sheds the specifics that
make the film so interesting. Think of it as a juiced-up ensemble
showcase that loses its bearings midflight.

 &HT;    ASO Likes what it sees in Gilbert
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra clearly wants to get a
good look at Alan Gilbert from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   This week's ASO guest conductor, Gilbert conducted the orchestra
last season, to good reviews, and was asked back for two concerts
this season. This week's concert is orchestral; the second, Nov.
4-6, features a difficult choral/orchestral program of Stravinsky's
``Symphony of Psalms'' and the Mozart ``Requiem.'' Gilbert is the
first out-of-town conductor to lead the ASO Chorus since Robert
Shaw died in January.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he's playing with the Emory Chamber Music Society
on Sunday. This is, in effect, is another audition. At least one of
the musicians _ violinist Jun-Ching Lin _ is an old friend from the
Curtis Institute of Music; but three of them _ Lin, flutist
Christina Smith and violist Paul Murphy _ are on the search
committee for a new ASO music director.
</P>
<P>
   What everyone will see is a rising conductor with strong
credentials and an interesting personal side. Gilbert has a
Japanese mother and an American father, both violinists with the
New York Philharmonic. ``I practically grew up in the orchestra,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   He knows the ASO situation is not without past conflicts and
present stresses. ``You can find that out just by signing onto the
Internet,'' he says. ``But I'm under the impression there's a very
positive attitude here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel anything negative in my dealings with the
orchestra last time, and I was encouraged by the music we made,
which is the way it should be. If there's anything to be dealt with
outside the music, it should stay outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert's schedule for the week is ``crazy,'' he admits, with
ASO and chamber music rehearsals, as well as the non-public events,
such as meeting with the ASO board's search committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always get enthusiastic when I make up my schedule,'' he
says, ``and then I kick myself when I have to live it.''
</P>
<P>
   ALAN GILBERT
</P>
<P>
   -- Age: 32
</P>
<P>
   -- Roots: Parents Michael Gilbert and Yoko Takebe are New York
Philharmonic musicians.
</P>
<P>
   -- Education: Harvard University and Curtis Institute of Music
</P>
<P>
   -- Orchestra: Royal Stockholm Philharmonic
</P>
<P>
   -- Instruments: Violin and viola. He will play both at Emory. He
brought his viola but will borrow a violin. ``I couldn't carry
everything, so the violin lost out to the golf clubs. But things
are so busy this week that golf is probably going to lose out,
too.''

 &HT;    COLUMN:Craft brews on a roll with Thunderhead
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When a small but ambitious brewery in Florida harbored
hopes earlier this year of coming to Atlanta, it knew better than
to call on one of the area's major distributors. They have bigger
fish to fry, and a brewery unknown outside its own neighborhood
won't get its foot inside the door.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida people instead called Peter Marte of Thunderhead
Distribution, a David in a crowd of Goliaths.
</P>
<P>
   Since Marte and Joel Gregory founded the company two years ago,
Thunderhead has become a magnet for craft brewers trying to crack a
highly competitive market controlled by eight or nine distributors,
few of whom want to spend the time or money marketing boutique
beers.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Beers widely available in other cities _ Trappist
ales from Belgium, barley wine-style beers from the West Coast,
high-potency German maibocks _ weren't available in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Most still aren't, thanks to the state's antiquated 6 percent
alcohol-by-volume cap on beer. But the landscape has changed
dramatically, all because a pair of inexperienced upstarts wanted
to add color and variety. From a warehouse in Norcross, Marte,
Gregory and Thunderhead's small sales force work 12- and 15-hour
days making cold calls, filling orders and trying to interest
restaurateurs and retailers in something out of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderhead's still a small player in the game, but it's made a
difference. You want La Trappe, the only Trappist ale brewed in
Holland? Belhaven Scottish Ale? Red Seal ale from California?
</P>
<P>
   You can find them at larger package stores and supermarkets
because Thunderhead brought them to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida beer, as it turned out, was drinkable enough but no
more so than a dozen other craft beers. The best guess was that it
would sit on shelves unnoticed, like many others. ``That's when you
have to be brutally frank,'' Marte says. ``We had to tell them it
wasn't quite ready for this market.''
</P>
<P>
   But for other beers, such as the Flying Dog line from Aspen,
Colo., or the gold medal-winning Tuppers' Hop Pocket Ale and the
companion Hop Pocket Pils, Thunderhead has opened new markets and
given beer enthusiasts more choices.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just imported beers or beers from other states.
Thunderhead is also distributing beer from area brewpubs, notably
Percy's Fish House and Max Lager's, for special order from retail
stores, to Vickery Creek restaurant in Cumming and to the Taco Mac
tap emporiums in Snellville, Sandy Springs and Cumming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're crusaders, and they're going about it the right way,''
says J.K. Kenny, proprietor of Wild Wing Cafe in Marietta, one of
the area's more popular multitap bars. ``For the specialty beer
market, they've made some inroads. But they're also experiencing
some resistance because many bar owners don't understand the
variety of beer styles or how to make pairings of beer with food.
So they stick with the standbys _ Bud, Miller, Coors.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marte, a 36-year-old Rhode Island native, the biggest
challenge is interesting restaurateurs in something besides the
usual. ``They think Bud or Miller is all customers need,'' he says.
``We take the approach that if the only wine they sold was white
zinfandel, they'd never be known for a good wine list.''
</P>
<P>
   Marte credits Andy Klubock, proprietor of the Taco Macs in Sandy
Springs, Snellville and Cumming and a nationally known beer expert,
for pointing him in the direction of La Trappe, Tuppers' Hop
Pocket, McAuslan Oatmeal Stout from Quebec and other offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing they've done,'' Klubock says, ``is bring in
styles that weren't here two years ago. It shows you that people
will buy great beer if it's available. Tuppers' does fabulous here,
the Schneider Weissen (a German hefeweizen beer) does well, the
Duckstein (a German alt beer). It confirms what I've been saying
for a long time _ Atlanta is a lot more sophisticated a beer market
than people realize.''
</P>
<P>
   PICK OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   People addicted to making bad puns will call it a whale of a
beer, but the newest addition to the Thunderhead portfolio is
notable for other reasons. When people ask what beer is brewed in
Boston, they're apt to say Samuel Adams. But so is Harpoon, and the
Harpoon India Pale Ale is one of the better ones around.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it's not quite hoppy or full-bodied enough to be
called an IPA. But there are many excellent pale ales that call
themselves IPAs for marketing reasons, and Harpoon falls into that
category. Copper in color, with a pleasing hop aroma and finish,
it's well-balanced in the manner of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but
with slightly more hop character.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Adams has also come out with an India Pale Ale (look for
a report on it in this column next time). Harpoon is the much
smaller of the two Boston breweries, but its beers set the same
high standard of excellence in all styles. Besides the IPA,
Thunderhead will be distributing four Harpoon seasonals _ an
Octoberfest, a Winter Warmer, a Maibock in spring and an ESB in
summer.

 &HT;    A brief (case) encounter
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After Christina Couret of Marietta, Ga. wrote to the
``Where Can I Find It?'' column wondering where to locate the
perfect briefcase, we immediately got on her case.
</P>
<P>
   To get a handle on what's out there, we took Couret shopping.
Her dictates were clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a lawyer-ly looking case,'' said Couret, 26, an
assistant editor with American City &AMP; County Magazine. ``Rather, I
want something with a strap that looks feminine and in which I can
put a variety of things, including my planner, floppy disks and
notebook. But I will still carry a handbag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I want leather. I have a pleather (faux leather) case
but am thinking about upgrading. I realize a leather case or bag
will probably cost about $200. But as part of my job I attend trade
shows, and everyone has such a great bag. I've just been getting
by. Help!''
</P>
<P>
   While shopping with Couret, we found that there are a zillion
types of briefcases and totes, available in basic black or brown,
in leathers and faux leathers, nylons, microfiber and canvas. Boxy
cases, it seems, have lost their appeal, while large-size totes, in
which you can carry a computer, credit cards and cosmetics, are
gaining in popularity. Prices start at about $65 and can go to $300
for the leather cases.
</P>
<P>
   At Rich's in Lenox Square Mall, Couret went through the cases
and bags that had been culled by personal shopper Frann Beato. Our
intrepid shopper was almost fooled by a black Liz Claiborne tote
($64), thinking it was leather. She liked Calvin Klein's black
leather case with a strap ($200) but decided the flap closing was
not thief-proof. A Kenneth Cole leather case ($175), which she
could sling over her shoulder or carry by the handles, was deemed
``hip yet professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a 9 West microfiber briefcase ($89) caught her eye. It was
filled with slots for a cell phone, business cards, legal pads and
sunglasses as well as a comfy shoulder strap and outside pocket. It
was then she began to waver just a bit about wanting a leather
case.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over the offerings at Mori Luggage &AMP; Gifts, Couret
spotted a ``professional-looking'' oversize tote ($129) by U.S.
Luggage, as well as Travelon's business tote ($149.99), which even
had compartments for a water bottle, computer, umbrella and room
for an extra pair of shoes. ``Well designed,'' said Couret. Our
shopper also was stopped by Hobo International's three-sided zip
case in a sleek black microfiber ($130). It had the requisite
pockets and compartments and was super lightweight. Again, the
dilemma: microfiber vs. leather.
</P>
<P>
   Couret also reviewed two bags from Sam Flax. A classic Jack
Georges' tan leather case ($283.50) was ``in beautiful leather but
very heavy with nothing in it.'' And she thought a brown tote case
in lightweight microfiber ($70) was a ``good price'' and that it
would hold all the necessities.
</P>
<P>
   After mulling over the possibilities, Couret bought the black
leather case from Kenneth Cole for $175. ``I liked many of the bags
I saw,'' she said, ``but I really fell in love with this
all-leather case. And if you carry it everyday, you must love it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few words from the pros on briefcases:
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are looking for stylish yet practical briefcases but
will settle for practical over stylish. The size of the case and
how it looks, when worn or carried, is also a consideration. Some
love leather and won't buy anything else. Others, who are
vegetarians or animal rights activists, won't touch leather. They
simply want a good quality fabric case.''
</P>
<P>
   DAVID KELLER
</P>
<P>
   Senior manager, Sam Flax
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, manufacturers simply took a man's briefcase and
made it in a fabric for women. They thought this was feminine.
However, these cases were heavy and structured and did not have the
functions that women demanded: zippered pockets, compartments for
cell phones and computers. Some of today's cases, which are
lightweight, can even serve as overnight bags. Function is key.''
</P>
<P>
   JEFF ARON
</P>
<P>
   Buyer, Mori Luggage &AMP; Gifts
</P>
<P>
   ``Women, I find, are doing more oversize totes than briefcases,
especially to carry on casual Fridays. And manufacturers have
responded by making totes in soft expandable leathers or fabrics,
with briefcase features, including lots of pockets and
compartments. For many women, security is a concern, so they are
leaning toward more zippered pockets.''

 &HT;    Munch on a Mallomar to celebrate October
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   October may be the best month of all. Beauty abounds. The air is
crisp and clean and the pressure of all that holiday cooking is not
yet upon us. We can enjoy the apples, pears, mushrooms, oysters,
squash, brussels sprouts, Concord grapes and pomegranates that are
all part of the abundance of this beautiful month.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Mallomars. Any fan of these
chocolate-and-marshmallow indulgences knows they are not available
in the warmer months. They don't do well in the heat so Nabisco
distributes them to supermarkets beginning in October.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the month's other culinary milestones that may
provide some kitchen inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   -- Oct. 1. The new Waldorf Astoria hotel on Park Avenue in New
York opened in 1931, after the original, which was built in 1893,
was demolished to make way for the Empire State Building. For
generations the name Waldorf Astoria reigned as the epitome of
elegant and opulent hotels. The original Waldorf Salad, which has
been re-created by chefs countless times, began there. (See
recipe.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Oct. 6. German American Day. Germany is the quintessential
land of meat and potatoes _ its diet designed for cold weather and
hard work. Meat loaf, braised beef and horseradish, sausages and
wursts, sauerkraut and potato pancakes are just some of Germany's
contributions to American cuisine. Why not try Beer-Basted Sausage
With Caramelized Onions and German Mustard for your own
Oktoberfest? See www.globalgourmet.com/destinations/germany/ for
this recipe, plus a great wrap-up of the country's culinary
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   -- Oct. 11. Columbus Day. Whether Christopher Columbus actually
discovered America is disputed, but that he made a major impact on
Western cuisine is not. By the time he had retired from his
explorations, he had introduced tomatoes, chocolate, pineapples,
potatoes, paprika, peanuts, green beans, chiles, yams and turkeys
to Europe. In return he brought to America sheep, goats, cattle and
pigs, olives and walnuts, wheat and rice, peaches, apricots and
oranges. Despite all this he was known for his simple tastes in
food. See an Edible Bio of Columbus at www.wnol.com/L3/biocolum.htm
</P>
<P>
   -- Oct. 12. ``One of the very nicest things about life is the
way we must regularly stop whatever it is we are doing and devote
our attention to eating.'' A wonderful sentiment put forth by none
other than the reigning operatic tenor, and world class gourmand,
Luciano Pavarotti, born this day in 1935 in Modena, Italy, a
medieval city in Northern Italy. Salute the singer, the sentiment
and Northern Italian cuisine by trying your hand at polenta, a
staple of Northern Italian cuisine. See
www.polenta.net/Recipe1.html for some great recipes and
www.cuisinenet.com/glossary/itlnorth.html for a brief review of
Northern Italian cooking.
</P>
<P>
   -- Oct. 16. Since the creation of the United Nations Food and
Agricultural Organization in 1981, this day has been declared World
Food Day. The motto of the organization _ ``Let there be bread'' _
illustrates the need for education and efforts to recognize
malnutrition and diseases caused by lack of food around the world.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate the most basic of foods, why not bake some bread?

</P>
<P>
   -- Oct. 28. This is the birthday of Auguste Escoffier
(1846-1935), the celebrated culinary genius whose books, recipes
and philosophy of cooking have had a lasting impact on the art of
cooking and the culinary world. Called the Father of Modern
Cuisine, Escoffier began his career at 13 as a lowly helper in his
uncle's restaurant. Cooking schools still teach his methods, and
his many books are indispensable references for the serious chef.
Among his well-known creations are peach Melba and Melba toast,
which he named after operatic diva Nellie Melba, after she
requested a light snack. For the story of the creation of Melba
toast, see www.onlygourmet.com/ezine/9706
</P>
<P>
   /articlesnack.html. For a biographical sketch of Escoffier and a
look at a lovely portrait of the man known as the ``Emperor of
Chefs and the Chef of Emperors'' visit
www.wnol.com/L3/bioescof.htm. If you want to give a variation of
peach Melba a try, see SOAR's version at
soar.berkeley.edu/recipes/desserts/peach-melba1.rec
</P>
<P>
   -- Oct. 31. We all know it's Halloween _ lots of inspiration
there _ but it's also the birthday of Savannah native Juliette
Gordon Low, founder of the Girl Scouts. Why not try your hand at
the original recipe for Girl Scout cookies? See the 1922 version of
the shortbread cookies at
www.our-hometown.com/NY/Ontario/CliftonSprings/
</P>
<P>
   Scouts/cookies.html. Low initiated the home-baked cookie sale in
the 1920s as a way to fund activities. It wasn't until 1934 that
Girl Scouts sold commercially baked cookies.

 &HT;    Creativity works with punch cake
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There may be as many versions of the Punch Bowl Cake as there
are of punch.

<P>
   We published this combination three years ago and offer it again
for Barbara Roberts' starting point when she needs dessert in a
hurry for a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Roberts requested the recipe, we learned that it is
largely a matter of opinion and taste starting with the basics: a
boxed cake mix, instant pudding, pie filling and whipped topping.

 &HT;    Meatloaf: Old favorite never out of style
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cookbook author Melanie Barnard believes meatloaf has all the
right stuff for modern cooks. It's easy to make and serve, she
says. Very versatile. Economical. Nutritionally correct. Usually
good hot or cold. And loved by practically everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The variety in these recipes is intentional _ not only to
demonstrate that versatility but to tickle as many taste buds as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   The Felder Family Meatloaf
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 1 hour Standing time:

</P>
<P>
   Matzo meal is a key ingredient in this family recipe from Sharon
Lebewohl and Rena Bulkin's 1999 cookbook ``The 2nd Ave Deli:
Recipes and Memories From Abe Lebewohl's Legendary Kitchen''
(Villard, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   2pounds chuck or top round
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons matzo meal
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup grated onion
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon finely chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1raw egg
</P>
<P>
   4hard-boiled eggs, peeled
</P>
<P>
   4tablespoons coarse bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. With your hands or a wooden spoon,
mix together the beef, matzo meal, onion, garlic, salt, pepper and
raw egg. Pack half the mixture along the bottom of a 5-by-9-inch
loaf pan. Arrange the hard-boiled eggs down the center, end to end,
pushing them gently into the meat. Place the remaining mixture in
the pan, over the eggs. Sprinkle the bread crumbs evenly on top.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the loaf until cooked through, about 1 hour. Thirty minutes
into baking, tilt the pan and spoon off the fat. Pour a little of
the clear juice over the top of the loaf. Near the end of the
cooking time, spoon off fat again. If you choose, briefly place the
loaf under the broiler to further brown the bread crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Let the loaf rest in its pan for about 20 minutes to settle
before serving.

   The tastes of Asia have been incorporated into this ground chuck
loaf featured in Melanie Barnard's 1997 book ``Everybody Loves
Meatloaf'' (HarperCollins, $14.95). If you have trouble locating
fresh or dried lemon grass, Barnard says grated lemon peel is
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup uncooked brown rice (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2pounds lean ground chuck
</P>
<P>
   1cup thinly sliced green onions
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup chopped fresh basil
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon chopped lemon grass or 1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
</P>
<P>
   2teaspoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon grated lime rind
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon hot pepper sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4teaspoon dried hot pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1egg
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup of lightly salted water to a
boil. Add the rice, cover the pan, reduce heat to low and simmer
until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 35
minutes. (The rice can be cooked a day ahead and refrigerated.)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, use your hands to gently but thoroughly
combine all the ingredients, including the rice. Divide the mixture
into 6 individual portions and place on a baking sheet. Form each
portion into an oval about 4 inches long and 2 1/2 inches high.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the loaves are firm and richly browned, 30 to 35
minutes. Serve slices on a bed of shredded lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   Leftovers: Make sandwiches by cutting the meatloaf into chunks
and rolling into flour tortillas spread with honey mustard and
garnished with shredded lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   Note: One cup cooked brown rice can be used here, and leftover
white rice works fine, too. This is good served with a soy-ginger
sauce poured over the meatloaf and lettuce.

   Every loaf doesn't have to have meat. While this dish does have
an optional portion of prosciutto, its signature base is yellow
cornmeal topped with a richly red marinara sauce. The recipe is
from ``Everybody Loves Meatloaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Butter for the pan
</P>
<P>
   3cups yellow cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   3cups cold water
</P>
<P>
   6cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2cloves garlic, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1cup grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons chopped fresh sage or 1 tablespoon dried
</P>
<P>
   2eggs
</P>
<P>
   2ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, optional
</P>
<P>
   Meatloaf Marinara Sauce (see recipe) or a good-quality bottled
sauce
</P>
<P>
   Butter a shallow 3-quart baking pan. In a mixing bowl, whisk
together the cornmeal and cold water. In a heavy 5-quart saucepan,
bring the broth and garlic to a boil. Slowly whisk in the cornmeal
mixture. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring often, until the
mixture is very thick and leaves the side of the pan, 15 to 20
minutes. Stir in the butter, cheese and sage until smooth. Remove
from heat.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, whisk the 2 eggs, then whisk in about 1 cup of
the cornmeal mixture to warm the eggs. Whisk the egg mixture into
the polenta in the saucepan. Spoon the mixture into the prepared
baking pan. (The loaf can be prepared up to 6 hours ahead to this
point and refrigerated.)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. If using the prosciutto, arrange it
over the top of the loaf. Bake until the loaf is firm and pulls
away from the sides of the pan and the prosciutto is frizzled,
about 1 hour. Heat the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Let the loaf stand in the pan for at least 10 minutes before
cutting into squares. Spoon the sauce over the squares to serve.

   Bruce Aidell's four-meat wonder (three ground meats _ beef, pork
and veal _ and pancetta) comes from his and Denis Kelly's 1998 book
``The Complete Meat Cookbook'' (Houghton Mifflin, $35).
</P>
<P>
   1ounce dried porcini or other wild mushrooms, soaked in 2 cups
boiling water for at least 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1cup soft fresh bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1cup finely chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   2garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2pound fresh shiittake, porcini or other wild mushrooms,
cleaned, stems removed if using shiitakes, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2large eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1pound ground beef round (85 percent lean)
</P>
<P>
   1pound ground veal or turkey
</P>
<P>
   1pound ground pork
</P>
<P>
   3slices pancetta, bacon or lean salt pork, about 1/8-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Remove dried mushrooms from the soaking liquid. If using
shiitakes, remove and discard the stems. Chop the mushrooms and set
aside (save the soaking liquid for use in soups, stews or sauces).
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, soak the bread crums in the cream while you
prepare the rest of the ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large skillet, heat 1
tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and saute
until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for 2
minutes longer, stirring frequently. Remove the onions and garlic
to a large bowl and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan and increase
heat to high. Put in the soaked dried mushrooms along with the
fresh mushrooms and saute, stirring constantly, until the mushrooms
release their liquid and it evaporates, about 5 minutes. Add the
mushrooms to the onions in the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the eggs, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, thyme, salt and
pepper into the bowl. Mix well, then add the ground meats and
soaked bread crumbs with any liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Knead gently, using your hands, until everything is
well-blended.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse a 10-by-5-by-4-inch loaf pan with cold water and pack the
meatloaf into it.
</P>
<P>
   Invert the loaf onto a foil-lined baking sheet (with 1-inch
sides) or a shallow baking dish or gratin pan and remove the loaf
pan.
</P>
<P>
   Place the slices of pancetta, bacon or salt pork on top of the
meat and bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the internal
temperature is 160 degrees. Remove the meatloaf from the oven and
let it rest, loosely covered with foil, for 10 to 20 minutes before
slicing.

 &HT;    Increasingly popular DVDs divulge secrets, insights
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's gone from flirtation to a genuine love affair.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, digital video discs (DVDs) were still
cautiously viewed as a techno novelty, something only for
hard-wired geeks or rabid movie fans. Studios took a wait-and-see
attitude before committing their titles to the format. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood quickly saw the bottom line as the flexible,
crystal-clear technology took off, and consumers started purchasing
DVD players for their homes. Analysts predict DVDs will be in 4
million U.S. homes by the end of the year, and up to 50 million by
2007. The future of the format seems so strong, Blockbuster Inc. is
getting in on the act, introducing DVDs for rental in 3,800 of its
stores by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   But enough with statistics. Let's look at some recent releases
and see what makes them cool:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' ($24.95). The bad news
is, there aren't any real goodies on this disc. You get English,
French or Spanish subtitles, bonus trailers and a wide-screen
format. It looks great. Unfortunately, there's no audio commentary
by any of the Monty Python members. But the clopping sound of
coconuts comes through crystal clear.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``A Nightmare on Elm Street'' ($24.98). Freddy Krueger
fanatics will be glad to know that all the ``Elm Street'' flicks
are on DVD. I say stick with the first and best. A very clean,
restored transfer of the film offers full-screen and wide-screen
versions. The feature-length audio commentary from writer-director
Wes Craven, actors Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon, and the
director of photography makes for an amusing contrast with the
onscreen mayhem. They explain some of the secrets behind the gory
effects (including the full-revolve set to shoot the
murder-on-the-ceiling scene), reminisce about Johnny Depp (this was
his film debut) and, rather pointedly, don't talk much about Robert
Englund, the fellow who got famous as Freddy. DVD-ROM users can
also access the screenplay, play a New Dream World trivia game, and
see updated cast, crew and trivia information.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Lost Horizon'' ($27.95). The digital transfer of Frank
Capra's recently restored 1937 epic is crisp and clean. The disc,
like the theatrical release, includes about seven minutes of
``missing'' scenes, which were trimmed during a World War II
re-release to tone down on the film's message of pacifism (kind of
ironic, since that's what the movie is really all about). Though
the original film for some of these scenes was never recovered, the
restoration inserts still photos while the dialogue continues on
the soundtrack. Startling at first, the device becomes less
jarring.
</P>
<P>
   Extras include an alternative ending, three deleted scenes,
photo documentary with narration by historian Kendall Miller,
restoration commentary by film critic Charles Champlin and UCLA
film restoration expert Robert Gitt. And how's this for a choice of
subtitle languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean
and Thai.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Tommy'' ($24.95). Ken Russell's phantasmagoric version of
the Who's rock opera gets a clean restoration that retains the
movie's unique audio ``Quintaphonic'' mix. (If you want to know
what that entails, there's an essay about the audio restoration on
the disc that explains it.)
</P>
<P>
   The musical has French, English and Spanish subtitles, but there
aren't any real goodies, which is a big missed opportunity. In
other words, if you never understood what all the pinball symbolism
meant way back in 1974, nobody's around to explain to you now. It
would've been nice to have some audio commentary, explaining how
Elton John stayed afloat on his giant shoe-stilts, what church
allowed Russell to shoot his Marilyn Monroe worship sequence, and
why nobody bothered to find out if Oliver Reed and Jack Nicholson
could sing before they were cast.
</P>
<P>
   And am I the only one who'd like to know what, exactly, went
through Ann-Margret's mind the day she had to shoot the scene where
she wallows in a room full of baked beans?

 &HT;    MINI VIEWS: Short reviews of the latest on video
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Lost &AMP; Found'' (PG-13) _ There's something about David Spade's
new movie that's way too much like last summer's over-the-top _ and
better _ comedy, ``There's Something About Mary.'' Like gross humor
that'll kick your gag reflex into gear. Still, Spade's flick has
its moments _ especially his knockout impersonation of Neil
Diamond. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thirteenth Floor'' (R) _ A ``what is reality?'' sci-fi
thriller that doesn't measure up to earlier and better films like
``The Matrix'' and ``Dark City.'' It's about a modern-day computer
whiz team that creates, then walks around in, a digitized version
of 1937 Los Angeles. What follows is murder, intrigue and too much
flat acting. Your ultimate warning: The movie's from some of the
creative team that earlier flubbed ``Godzilla.'' Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is My Father'' (R) _ A burnt-out teacher (James Caan)
travels to Ireland to unravel the mystery of his father. What
unfolds is a small-scale tragedy, tinged with romance and regret.
In rural '30s Ireland, a headstrong young beauty (Moya Farrelly)
falls in love with a shy tenant farmer (Aidan Quinn) nearly twice
her age. But everything conspires against the lovers _ from curses
and small-town snobbery to the kind of timing that makes Romeo and
Juliet look lucky. The movie is somewhat muddled overall, but the
leads' mutual yearning is achingly clear. Grade: B

   (backslash)``Young Frankenstein: Special Edition'' (PG) _ If you
want to see what made movies funny before hair-gel jokes,
electrocuted dogs and violated apple pies, don't miss the
re-release of Mel Brooks' black-and-white 1974 classic. As much
affectionate homage as parody of James Whale's ``Frankenstein''
flicks, it stars Gene Wilder as the mad inventor's ancestor,
Madeline Kahn as his frigid fiancee, Teri Garr as a Transylvanian
lass, Peter Boyle as the monster and, of course, Cloris Leachman as
Frau Bluecher (cue the horses). The new edition features deleted
scenes and bloopers. $14.98 VHS, $34.98 DVD. Grade: A

 &HT;    Women with partners in multiple relationships likely to get
sexually transmitted diseases
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At least 17 million women in the U.S. have a higher
than usual risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted disease because
they or their sexual partners are in multiple relationships,
according to a new study. And 3.5 million women don't know they're
running the risk, because they think they're in monogamous
relationships, but they're not.
</P>
<P>
   A study published today by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a New
York nonprofit organization whose research focuses on reproductive
health, analyzed data from seven national surveys for two types of
risk: the number of sexual partners a person is exposed to, and
that person's willingness or disinclination to practice safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   The study, in the journal Family Planning Perspectives, found
that eight out of every 10 sexually active Americans have only one
sexual partner per year, a rate that hasn't changed much in a
decade. However, the remaining 20 percent - one-third of the
sexually active women and one-fourth of the sexually active men -
are running significant risks. Almost 17 million women bwteeen the
ages of 15 and 44 were found to be at risk; 5.4 million have more
than one partner in a year, and 6.3 million have partners who are
also sleeping with other people. Another 5 million both had
multiple partners and also knew that their partners were not
monogamous.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, though women who have more than one partner use
condoms more than average, those who knew that their partners were
not monogamous paradoxically used condoms less than average.
</P>
<P>
   The study comes as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention prepares today to mount a major national prevention
effort on syphilis, which has declined sharply in the U.S. in
recent years and is considered a marker for other sexually
transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that it is not always possible to know all the
ways in which one is exposed to risk,'' said Lawrence Finer, a
senior research associate at Guttmacher. ``It argues for increased
communication about sex and increased use of protection as well.''

 &HT;    Looking for a plastic egg beater or a plastic coin holder? We
know where you can find it
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having trouble finding a particular item? We'll try to help you
locate it. But due to the volume of mail, we cannot track down
every request. Readers whose queries are answered in the column
will receive a blue-and-cream canvas Buyer's Edge tote bag. Write
us at Buyer's Edge Find It, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box
4689, Atlanta, GA 30302; e-mail us at buyersedge(at)ajc.com (please
include your name, the city you live in and daytime phone number);
or call 404-582-7642.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had a two-piece plastic egg-breaker (for breaking
soft-boiled eggs in half), which, after many years of use, finally
broke, and I have been unable to find another one anywhere. It's
amazing how much I need it now that I don't have it!
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara Van Horn, Marietta, GA.
</P>
<P>
   A: The yolk's on you! The Pedrini shell cutter for boiled eggs
($4.99) is at Lechters stores. The plastic gizmo is simple to
operate. Pull out the blade and put the sheath on the egg top. Push
blade back, remove the top. Presto, a perfectly cut egg that's easy
to scoop out and eat.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find a pliable plastic coin holder to put into my
pocket? You pinch the edges to open it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob Kolody, Lithonia, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: You will no longer have to pinch pennies. They will fit
snugly in your red plastic coin holder ($1.59) from Artlite Office
Supplies &AMP; Pens. These handy-dandy gizmos also come in green and
would make great holiday stocking stuffers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been looking for Stretch-tite, a food wrap. It's the
greatest. I was first introduced to it about 15 years ago while
visiting a friend in Connecticut. Although it has been available
locally, it seems to have disappeared from store shelves. The name
on the box is Polyvinyl Films, Sutton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marie R. Perrotta, Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We were stretched thin on this request but managed to snag
the clear, plastic stretch wrap at Costco Wholesale. A two-pack _
two 500-square-foot rolls _ is about $8. Note: Costco is a
wholesale membership club. Cost to join is $40, which includes a
free spouse card. Or order Stretch-tite directly from the company:
1-800-343-6134. A single 500-square-foot roll is $6.95. Two or more
rolls are $6.50 each. In addition to covering foods in the fridge,
Stretch-tite can also be used for microwave cooking, as a freezer
wrap and as a cover for sterling silver to keep it from tarnishing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been trying to find a book that shows the ways to tie
a knot in a tie. I know of only one way but would like to learn
about others, including how to tie a bow tie.
</P>
<P>
   _ W.R. Shivers, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Soon you will be tied up in knots, all kinds of knots,
including the classic four-in-hand, the Windsor and half-Windsor,
as well as the bow tie. The Neckwear Association of America in New
York will send you a free pamphlet, The Tie Game, complete with
directions on how to tie these knots. Send a self-addressed,
business size, stamped envelope to: The Neckwear Association of
America, 151 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10016.

`WASTELAND': ANTHROPOLOGY PROJECT: STUDY YOUR OWN FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>

York area. Check local listings.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Wasteland'' wants to be a dramatic version of ``Friends'' with
Zeitgeist pretensions. Those pretensions will cause trouble every
time. The series, about six college friends now in their 20s and
still huddled together in New York City, was created by Kevin
Williamson, who so entertainingly combined adolescent
soul-searching with soap opera gloss in ``Dawson's Creek.'' But in
``Wasteland'' the soul-searching seems artificial and the dialogue
borrowed from generations of bad daytime soaps.
</P>
<P>
   The central character in this group isn't Dawson but Dawnie, who
has the most serious case of arrested adolescence on this show full
of Peter Pans. She is played by Marisa Coughlan with a perpetual
frown, which is probably meant to signal deep thought, because
Dawnie is a graduate student in anthropology who proposes studying
her circle of friends. ``In generations past, the window into
adulthood began at 18 and now it's 30,'' she tells her adviser. Or
maybe she just looks like a sad sack because she's 26 and still a
virgin, a state that makes her confused and unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   She uses this to comic effect at the start of Thursday's first
episode, when she willfully scares off an unctuous man trying to
pick her up in a bar by announcing what a big deal sex would be for
her. With this wry opening and its glossy quick cuts of New York
City, ``Wasteland'' gets off to a slick but appealing start. The
appeal is replaced almost at once by a sense of how off-putting
these people are. The women are brittle. With one exception, the
men are wimps. All their behavior is unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   Dawnie's virginity scares off her old college love, Ty, who is
back in town. As they are rolling around on her bed, he stops and
says: ``You've given me a chance here. I can be noble.'' Then he
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Their friend Jesse owns a public relations company. She is meant
to be the hard-as-nails character who shows us her vulnerable side,
but she interferes in other people's lives so much it's a wonder
this obnoxious woman has any friends at all.
</P>
<P>
   Sam, a woman with a Southern belle accent, works as a clerk for
the assistant district attorney, Vince. So far Vince is peripheral,
written in after the NAACP's complaints about the lack of major
black characters this season. His role will become more important,
which doesn't guarantee it will become more credible than anyone
else's.
</P>
<P>
   Sam once dated Vandy, now a bartender and aspiring musician.
Toward the end of the first episode, the show has deteriorated so
much that she actually says: ``It wasn't working, Vandy. We stopped
being good together.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the actors, only Dan Montgomery is natural and likable, as
Russell, a closeted gay soap opera star and Dawnie's roommate. He
worries incessantly about how to have a private life while
preserving his heartthrob public image. Maybe Williamson, who
recently came out himself, simply had more emotion and sympathy to
pour into this character. But Montgomery also gets a lot of credit
for making us wonder why Russell seems the only human in the midst
of these Barbie and Ken figures.
</P>
<P>
   A later episode in which the friends go on dates confirms the
worst fears. Some shows grow on you; ``Wasteland'' grows more
off-putting as it goes along.

BUSH CUSHIONS CRITICISM OF GOP'S RECORD ON SOCIAL ISSUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
tried to assuage the hurt feelings of some Republican congressional
leaders Wednesday by softening his criticism of the GOP's record on
social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush angered some in Congress on Tuesday by saying his party put
too much emphasis on economic growth at the expense of human need.
Last week he criticized a congressional Republican plan to slow
down the payment of earned income tax credits as an effort to
balance the budget ``on the backs of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday the Texas governor said his remarks had been
intended to outline how the Republican Party often is
``mischaracterized'' as lacking compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was making the case that our philosophy is changing America,
but often times people only hear the stale numbers of economic news
we talk about, often times people only hear gloom-and-doom
scenario,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking from my heart, and I hope the Republican Party
appreciates it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that it was a Republican Congress that relaxed
federal regulations on the states to allow for state-by-state
welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Republican Congress that freed states to make the
right decisions when it comes to welfare reforms,'' Bush said.
``The Republican Congress deserves great credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   If nominated and elected president, Bush said he looks ``forward
to working in a constructive, reform-minded way with the Congress.
I hope, I hope there is a Republican speaker and a Republican
majority leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he does not believe it was any one thing or any one
election that gave the Republican Party its image of lacking
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, '88 was a great election and '92 stunk,'' Bush said,
joking about the presidential elections that his father won and
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much presidential elections as its an attitude
that's crept into people's minds, that somehow if you are a
conservative you don't care about people,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush again refused to be drawn too far into
the criticism of presidential rival Patrick Buchanan, who has been
criticized for statements he made about Hitler in a new book. As he
did last week, Bush said he hopes Buchanan stays in the Republican
Party rather than jumping to the Reform Party so GOP voters can
``reject'' Buchanan's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to whipping him,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Though declining a direct attack on Buchanan, Bush said: ``I
decry racism and I decry anti-Semitism''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned in New York on Wednesday along with Gov. George
Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. They toured a
welfare-to-work training facility and a firefighters memorial
service and ate lunch in Little Italy in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Bush referred to Giuliani as the ``future senator,'' a reference
to his expected race for the Senate against first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The trip completed a three-day swing through the Empire State
for Bush. He held a series of receptions and galas for people who
had contributed more than $2 million for his campaign. And Bush
came away optimistic that he can win New York in both the
Republican primary next March and in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a chance to win New York in 2000. I believe that
because this Republican Party is unified,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican presidential candidate has carried the state since
Ronald Reagan in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a former owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, joked
to one New York audience about the Rangers 8-0 loss Monday to the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've greeted me a little more warmly than the Yankees
greeted the Rangers,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   As a crowd of television cameras crushed in on Bush in Little
Italy, he shook hands and gave some of the older women friendly
kisses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he gave me a kiss, I'd vote for him any day of the
week,'' said a frosted-haired Patricia Walls, who gave her age as
39. ``I'm not a political person, but I like this man.''

SWEET AND SOUR ROMANCE FEELS CONTRIVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use  Friday, Oct. 8  by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Taking the tried-and-true movie concept of ``meet
cute'' and standing it on its ear, director Sydney Pollack has some
pretty interesting aspirations for his latest movie, ``Random
Hearts,'' but his good intentions are mostly lost in a
fundamentally ridiculous construct.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers assume that the audience will root for its
unlikely lovers, who meet courtesy of a double whammy _ a tragedy
and a betrayal. The movie's deliberate pace, along with some rather
strained attempts to build romance out of disaster, winds up
sabotaging its aims, however, reducing ``Random Hearts'' to a
rather high-minded adult misfire.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Ford stars as Dutch Van Den Broeck, a taciturn
internal-affairs sergeant in the Washington, D.C., police force.
He's married, comfortable, respected. One night, waiting for his
wife to join him for dinner, Dutch hears of an airliner crash in
the Chesapeake Bay. He gives no thought to it until he checks his
messages and learns that his wife might have been on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, Dutch learns that not only was his wife on the
plane, she was traveling as the ``wife'' of another man. Both died
in the crash. Ever the investigator, Dutch tracks down the man's
widow, a well-bred congresswoman from New Hampshire, Kay Chandler
(Kristin Scott Thomas). Dutch wants to learn as much as he can
about why his wife strayed and, equally important, why he didn't
have a clue. ``I get paid to know who's lying,'' Dutch says. He's
tortured by his ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler is in the middle of a re-election campaign and wants
nothing to do with Dutch or his discoveries. She's afraid of how
the revelations might play on the evening news and is protective of
her teen-age daughter (Kate Mara, in a nicely finessed turn). It
doesn't take long for Dutch to wear her down, however, and they
soon begin a love affair that has Dutch asking pointedly, ``Are you
sorry the plane went down?''
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, written by frequent Pollack collaborator Kurt
Luedtke (``Out of Africa,'' ``Absence of Malice'') and based on
Warren Adler's 1984 best seller, takes its sweet time arriving at
the emotional core of its story, wandering off needlessly into a
sorry subplot involving a crooked cop Dutch is investigating. But
when it stays on track, ``Random Hearts'' possesses a brutal
honesty about the gut-wrenching devastation felt by those betrayed
by their spouses. The film makes you feel their pain.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, it's curious that Pollack chose to give the
movie a high-end, glossy romantic sheen, a look common to most of
his work, including his last effort with Ford, ``Sabrina.'' Ford,
in fact, has become Pollack's de facto stand-in for Robert Redford
(Pollack and Redford teamed for six movies, including ``Out of
Africa'' and ``The Way We Were''), playing his part with the same
remote impassivity that characterized Redford's work.
</P>
<P>
   Ford doesn't quite pull it off, although he makes clear the
inner demons that drive his character's painful (and ultimately
impossible) quest.
</P>
<P>
   That Dutch's personal mission should include a furtive romance
is what eventually makes ``Random Hearts'' feel like a fake. While
it's certainly possible to make lemonade out of lemons, this
sweet-and-sour romance tries to be all things and winds up being
not quite satisfying in the process. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
The film: ``Random Hearts'' (R; brief violence, sexuality and
language). &QL;

DESIGN NOTEBOOK: ROOMS WITH THAT SLEPT-IN LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crumpled dish towels dry on an exposed radiator, paint flakes
off a windowsill and electrical cords snake their way to a low
table decked with dirty cups and saucers. Scattered crumbs and
coffee scum are clearly visible.
</P>
<P>
   A gritty scene set in a prison cell in the television drama
``Oz''? No, it's the latest sales catalog, available in Britain and
elsewhere abroad, from Habitat, a home furnishings chain owned by
Ikea.
</P>
<P>
   With its models in wrinkled clothes face down on a pile of
pillows, seemingly passed out in an unmade bed or rubbing the sleep
from their eyes, Habitat is firing the first salvo in a radical
image makeover. Call it the Morning After Look: take two aspirin
and call a cleaning lady as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, where the catalog has already sold a million copies,
20 percent more than last year, some people are scratching their
heads. ``Habitat does heroin chic for the home?'' asked Simon Mills
in The Evening Standard, a London newspaper, referring to fashion's
recent dalliance with hard-core realism.
</P>
<P>
   A Habitat spokeswoman, Berna Sermet, leapt to the defense.
``Habitat did not consciously produce a catalog to reflect a trend
in untidiness, but to display beautiful products within realistic
homes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the position of every scattered pistachio shell
was calibrated by a battalion of stylists. (The absence of any
cigarette butts or even wineglasses underscores how carefully this
vision of authenticity was edited). The social realism of the
Habitat catalog is just as artificial as the latest trendy pad in
Wallpaper, where even the flower petals seemed fixed in styling
gel.
</P>
<P>
   Defining the boundary between what's real and what's really real
has become a favorite parlor game on the culture scene. In the
movie ``American Beauty,'' zombie suburbanites anesthetized by the
good life finally break out and live an even better good life
(complete with feet on the sofa), suffering only a few violent
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The Morning After Look may not be catching people literally in
bed, but at least there are signs of life in these pages. Karrie
Jacobs, the editor of the forthcoming American magazine Dwell,
considers it a welcome change and hopes to incorporate a sense of
realism in her own magazine. There is something unsettling about
the way homes are usually shown in magazines and catalogs, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't people in these photographs ever eat anything but
perfectly arranged fruit?'' she asked. ``Don't they ever buy
packaged goods? Their homes all look like they were photographed
shortly after a neutron bomb hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nest magazine, a design guide for idiosyncratic aesthetes, has
already carved out a niche for its own brand of highly stylized
realism. In the spring issue, a living room is shown with four cat
litter boxes under a coffee table, plastic bowls brimming with
kibble under the stereo and a protective blue plastic cover on the
sofa. The cats themselves lurk on the sofa, a radio and a battered
table.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Holtzman, Nest's editor, said he wasn't so interested in
the home's realism but of the decorative patterning expressed by a
pack of cats loose in a room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obsessed with the presentation of atmosphere and
surface,'' Holtzman said. ``That's where the realism of photography
should be focused, not on the butts in the ashtray.'' Nonetheless,
the reader gets the message: enter this room at your own risk.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Ewen, author of ``All Consuming Images'' (Basic Books),
described the look of dishabille as ``a real break with suburbia
and the sense of home as a place of leisure.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the ideal consumers to respond to this aesthetic
of the undone are new media moguls and computer technocrats with
plenty of money but no interest in ever leaving the office. The
Morning After, apparently, follows a night spent staring at a
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``These images address people who don't view their homes as the
centerpiece of their lives, people for whom home life is a
necessary inconvenience on their way to work,'' Ewen said.
</P>
<P>
   The perfected image of life presented in magazines like Martha
Stewart Living may be losing its cachet. Getting the attitude right
has taken priority over getting the right sofa.
</P>
<P>
   The creative team at Habitat came up with the catalog's look by
combing through back issues of the catalog to find the groovy
images of real life that Terence Conran formulated in the 1970s to
sell the same molded plastics and ladder-back dining chairs that
are popular today and are once again in the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Terence, who founded Habitat and sold it to Ikea, said he
warned the company against selling mood. ``They told me that they
wanted to recreate what I had done many years ago, and I said:
`Listen, you've got it all wrong. What we were trying to do was
just be optimistic. Just show the products!'''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Terence is hardly immune to setting a little tone. When the
new Conran's catalog is issued next month and shoppers come across
two half-empty glasses and a bottle of Heineken beer on the kitchen
table, they should remember that it's not attitude _ it's real
life.

`VISITOR FROM THE LIVING': A MAN WHO SAW EVIL, AND PREFERRED NOT TO
FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review. This film
is being shown as part of the New York Film Festival.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``A Visitor from the Living,'' a 65-minute
documentary by Claude Lanzmann, is a transfixing addendum to this
filmmaker's ``Shoah.'' Filmed in 1979, it essentially consists of a
single conversation between Lanzmann and the elderly,
distinguished-looking Maurice Rossel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944 Rossel was a Swiss member of an International Red Cross
inspection party that was sent to view the Theresienstadt
concentration camp in what is now the Czech Republic. Rossel was to
understand what he could about a sanitized, spruced-up detention
camp that was to real camps what Disney World is to real life.
</P>
<P>
   Rossel tells how he came to do this in patient, measured
fashion, with only the occasional interruption. (At one point, he
matter-of-factly shoos a small child out of the room, commenting,
``Sorry, can't have him coughing on camera.'')
</P>
<P>
   He speaks of brazenly visiting Auschwitz as a form of espionage,
of chatting with German officers there about bobsledding in the
Alps as he tried to perform a reconnaissance mission. Gradually,
Lanzmann leads him into a discussion of Theresienstadt, which
appeared to be a much higher order of concentration camp. It had a
bandstand, an orchestra and park benches. It passed Rossel's
inspection with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
   This documentary gains intensity as Rossel begins to repeat his
idea that the Jews at Theresienstadt were privileged characters,
wealthy enough to be given VIP treatment by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   And it gradually becomes clear that Rossel found these Jews
appalling, complaining of ``that passivity, that sterility that I
couldn't stomach.'' Lanzmann points out that if the residents
behaved unnaturally while their camp was being inspected that was
perhaps understandable. After all, the camp boasted attractive,
fake children's facilities even though abortion was mandatory for
its Jewish inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Although he eventually presents Rossel as someone who sanctioned
a terrible lie, Lanzmann is not one to play ``Gotcha!'' with such
sobering subject matter. He expresses a consideration for Rossel's
feelings in the film's opening credits, and he does not violate
that on camera.
</P>
<P>
   But he quietly dissects the consequences of a ghastly deception,
one in which 5,000 inmates turn out to have been killed just before
the visit so the place would not look too crowded. This strong,
troubling film does not overemphasize such details. It doesn't have
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Visitor from the Living'' is being shown Thursday night as
part of the 37th New York Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:

 &HT;    SIX BILLION HUMANS TUESDAY; CAN THE WORLD HANDLE BILLIONS MORE?
 &HT;    With POPULATION-DATE and POPULATION-DATA for release Sunday,
Oct. 10.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Earth officially becomes a planet inhabited by
6 billion human beings Tuesday, an event that would have gone
unnoticed but for a blizzard of press conferences and news releases
trumpeting the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Why isn't such a milestone more obvious? The main reason is that
the 6 billionth person, whether he or she is born in China or
Topeka or Togatabu, will arrive in the midst of unprecedented
global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly available clean drinking water, better sanitation,
more abundant crops, and life-saving antibiotics and vaccines have
put the world in a position to feed, clothe and care for 6 billion
people with little noticeable stress. Life expectancy is higher and
infant mortality lower than ever in history.
</P>
<P>
   However, by the end of this week, we will have been joined by a
million more people, and in 14 years another billion.
</P>
<P>
   If the planet is to comfortably accommodate a projected
population of 7 billion by 2013, several key trends will have to be
adjusted, according to some experts.
</P>
<P>
   One trend suggests that the steady increase in irrigated
cropland over the past 30 years is about to come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our irrigation base is showing numerous signs of
vulnerability, just as we are about to become even more dependent
on it,'' says Sandra Postel, director of the Global Water Policy
Project of Amherst, Mass. Problems such as land salting, silt and
the simple fact that only so much water is available water are
``rearing their ugly heads,'' she says in the book, ``Pillar of
Sand.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2025, the world must find additional irrigation water
equivalent to the annual flow of 110 Colorado Rivers, she
estimates, to maintain current per capita food output.
</P>
<P>
   There are several other worrisome indications: that the
expansion of available cropland is reaching its limits, that grain
harvests are starting to decline, and that some of the world's most
productive fisheries are being harvested at the maximum sustainable
level.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the list the unpredictable effects of climate change and
the inability of countries with rapidly rising populations to cope
with such problems as disease and famine _ an effect often called
``demographic fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, says Lester Brown, president of the natural
resources research center Worldwatch Institute, the world is
unlikely ever to reach a population of 10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as world population continues to climb, it is becoming
clear that the several billion additional people projected for the
next half century are not likely to materialize,'' Brown and
Worldwatch researcher Brian Halweil wrote recently in the
institute's magazine World-Watch.(cq)
</P>
<P>
   ``What is not clear is how the growth will be curtailed.
Unfortunately, in some countries, a slowing of growth is taking
place only partly because of success in bringing birth rates down,
and increasingly because of conditions that are raising death
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic example is the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan
Africa. While developed countries such as the United States are
able to keep the incidence of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, at
around 1 percent of adults, the infection rate in Zimbabwe is
around 26 percent of the adult population. In Botswana, it is 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In such countries, life expectancy is not rising but falling
rapidly, down to age 44 in Zimbabwe and 47 in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rapid population growth in many of these countries during
the last several decades has had a terrible impact on national
budgets,'' said Halweil. ``There has been an inability to put in
hospitals and generally develop, while trying to educate growing
numbers of children, create jobs and deal with deforestation and
soil erosion and that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The arithmetic of emerging resource shortages is not
difficult,'' he and Brown write in the World-Watch article. ``The
mystery is not in the numbers, but in our failure to do what is
needed to prevent such threats from spiraling out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts are more confident that the same human ingenuity
that improved crop yields and discovered antibiotics and vaccines
will have the world ready for 7 billion people, and more, when the
time comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can see is growing wealth around the world, increased
caloric intake, increased life expectancy, increased per-capita
wealth,'' said Jerry Taylor, director of natural resource studies
for the Cato Institute, a Washington research center that opposes
most government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are increasingly conquering death around the world,'' he
added. ``A century ago, human life expectancy was about 30 years.
Now it's 60 or 70 years. People are not starving to death. They are
getting better food and they are living longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they are living better, Taylor said, people are having
fewer children.
</P>
<P>
   And even though population continues to grow, the world can
accommodate a lot more people, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor worked with the late Julian Simon, a Cato researcher and
University of Maryland professor, in compiling Simon's writings in
a new book, ``Hoodwinking the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Simon argues that ``the current gloom and doom
about an environmental crisis is all wrong on the scientific
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   It has always been wrong, he says, and it is wrong now. But
journalists, ignorant of statistics and science, gather data in
ways that lead to inaccurate conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians misuse statistics in the service of their own policy
goals, he said. Eventually, ``psychological and cultural
mechanisms'' make people more receptive to bad than to good news.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, Taylor says, is that only about one-third of the
earth's land mass is developed and with additional wealth, there is
plenty of room left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The globe is becoming wealthier and it can take a lot more
people,'' he said.

 &HT;    HOW OCT. 12 BECAME THE DAY OF SIX BILLION
 &HT;    150&AMP;add. With POPULATION. For release Sunday, Oct. 10.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Day of Six Billion will be observed around the
world on Tuesday, Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Why that day? The United Nations Population Fund puts it this
way: ``On 12 October 1999, six billion people will be alive in the
world, an addition of a billion in only 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a different agency, the U.N. Population Division, the
demographers whose calculations were used to choose Oct. 12 give a
more guarded answer: The milestone will be reached ``around that
date.''
</P>
<P>
   How close? Six billion was reached back in June, according to
their high-growth projections. It won't be reached until next
February, according to their low-growth projections. They used
their middle projections to choose Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to have one number and one date,'' said U.N.
demographer Thomas Buettner. ``We know, of course, that the date is
an approximation, a symbol, used rightfully to create awareness
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 world population figures are the most recent numbers
solid enough to be described as ``estimates'' rather than
``projections.'' Every two years, U.N. demographers polish the 1995
numbers and revise their projections for each year after that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they added together their middle projections of the
1995 estimates for 228 countries and said the 6 billion mark would
be reached this year on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, they pushed the date back to Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Fresh census data lowered the 1995 estimates for some
countries. Use of lower birth rates and higher AIDS death rates
slowed down the projections for the years after 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Their middle projection then showed that on June 30, 1999, the
world would be about 22 million short of the six-billion mark.
</P>
<P>
   But if the population continued to grow by roughly 214,000 a
day, it would reach six billion 104 days later, on Oct. 12.

   ``Technically, at about 2 p.m., if you want to be totally
over-precise,'' Buettner joked.
</P>
<P>
   In which time zone? ``In any time zone,'' Buettner said. ``The
date is based on simplifications that assume that the time is the
same for every person everywhere in the world.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Don't make a museum out of me,'' the poet Allen
Ginsberg admonished his staff in his final days. ``When you die,
you die.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Two years after his death, Ginsberg's estate is
carrying out his wishes and auctioning off his belongings, Thursday
at Sotheby's in Manhattan. While his literary archives remain
intact at Stanford University, souvenirs of literary and social
currents that have swept the nation since the 1950s are up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The auction also includes unpublished writings and personal
items from the estates of Ginsberg's fellow Beats Jack Kerouac,
William S. Burroughs and Neal Cassady and from friends like Lucien
Carr, Gregory Corso, Keith Haring and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. They
are expected to bring around $500,000, with Ginsberg's share going
to his companion, Peter Orlovsky, and the five children of
Ginsberg's brother, Eugene Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   While some items may end up under lock and key in institutions,
most are likely to be snatched up for safekeeping by the disparate
souls who found common ground in their admiration for Ginsberg.
</P>
<P>
   At a Beat poetry reading at Sotheby's on Sunday night, a
cross-section of Ginsberg's followers gathered to sip a liqueur
reminiscent of illegal absinthe and imbibe the words. Afterward
they sifted through his legacy, homing in on objects that might
best summarize his influence. Across the room from where the
historian Ann Douglas held court, Goldie Hawn, the actress,
scurried from case to case with her daughter, Kate Hudson, and Kurt
Russell, the actor, in tow. In a quiet corner, the poet Edward
Sanders tapped out an elegy to his departed friends on Kerouac's
conga drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other poet in our time has been memorialized to the extent
of Ginsberg,'' said the writer John Tytell, whose recent book,
``Paradise Outlaws,'' chronicles the Beat generation with his
essays and photographs by his wife, Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ginsberg is the present-day incarnation of Walt Whitman,'' he
said. ``It will never die down because it is connected to the
antimaterialist tradition in American letters. Ginsberg carries
that on.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the objects that pass through Sotheby's doors,
Ginsberg's belongings are a tattered lot, well worn from their
owner's handling. But as the embodiment of a man who inspired
America to howl at the middle class, they could be considered
priceless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harmonium is the one item that's truly an extension of
Allen,'' said Bob Rosenthal, Ginsberg's secretary and the estate's
trustee. ``People sigh and say, `Oh, not the harmonium,' when they
hear it's up for sale. He played it at all of his poetry readings
since the 1960s. People say the harmonium changed their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Also weighted with historical import is Richard Avedon's
photograph of a naked Orlovsky and Ginsberg, which helped galvanize
the gay pride movement when it was plastered around New York and
San Francisco in the early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   The auction may begin to define the dollar value of Kerouac's
drawings and paintings, the first to be sold publicly. Other
belongings offer insights into the workings of a mind, like the 19
unpublished letters by Cassady, the muse behind the Beat generation
and a central character in Kerouac's ``On the Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others are valuable primarily for the sentiment attached
to them: the private photographs of the Beats in far-flung locales;
two organs on which Ginsberg composed musical accompaniments to
William Blake's ``Songs of Innocence and Experience''; the poem
written by Ferlinghetti upon learning of Ginsberg's terminal
cancer; the desk of Ginsberg's father, a high school English
teacher and poet, which his son later took as his own.
</P>
<P>
   Even after their deaths, the words of the Beats reverberate.
Ginsberg's masterpiece ``Howl'' is among the most widely read and
translated poems of the 20th century. ``On the Road'' sells more
than 90,000 copies a year worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, ``Deliberate Prose,'' a collection of Ginsberg's
essays from the last three decades, and ``Last Words: The Final
Journals of William S. Burroughs'' are expected to land in
bookstores. In a posthumous nod to the grandfather of the movement,
Grove Press will publish ``The Complete Naked Lunch,'' a revised
edition of Burroughs' landmark work featuring about 15 percent more
of the original manuscript, once thought to be lost. Edited by
James Grauerholz, Burroughs' companion and manager, and the
biographer Barry Miles, the work is scheduled for release in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his complaints about cults of personality, Ginsberg
would be delighted at the attention, Tytell said. ``Ginsberg is
like Warhol, Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio,'' he said. ``Ginsberg
was always eager to be known, even now, even afterwards.''

McCAIN URGES GOP CANDIDATES TO JOIN FIGHT FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCEBy GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain called on Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and other Republican presidential candidates Wednesday to join
in the fight for campaign finance reform as the Senate prepares to
take up his proposal next week banning so-called ``soft money''
contributions to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has made his proposal the centerpiece of his
presidential bid, made the appeal in a letter to Bush and the six
other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that he needs ``all the help we can get,'' the
Arizona Republican said at a speech before the Committee for
Economic Development that it was time for other GOP candidates who
have embraced the call for ending the influence of soft money in
national campaigns to back up their words with action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm calling on them to put into action, fundamentally, what
they've stated,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain singled out Bush as the candidate most capable of
ensuring passage of an overhaul of finance laws because of the
support Bush's candidacy has on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Bush, McCain wrote: ``If even half of the
members of Congress who endorsed your candidacy were to honor your
request, (the ban on soft money donations) would pass with votes to
spare.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials said they were flattered that McCain
recognizes Bush's ability to influence others on important issues.
But they were noncommittal in their response.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has gone on record against soft money contributions to the
parties. But his objections to soft money centers on corporate,
union and other special interest donations, not on contributions
from individuals. The McCain legislation would ban unlimited
contributions to the parties from individuals, as well as those
from unions, corporations and other special interests.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan measure, sponsored by McCain and Sen. Russell
Feingold, D-Wis., was killed in the Senate last year. But passage
of a similar measure in the House last year and again just a few
weeks ago by an overwhelming majority has revived the issue in the
Senate. McCain's focus on it as he travels around the country
campaigning has also given it a higher profile with the American
people, who, according to recent polls, are in favor of overhauling
the laws that now govern how money is raised and spent by political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill still faces tough odds in the Senate;
however, where Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., say they have enough votes to continue
to filibuster the measure.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold plan to offer a stripped-down version of the
bill that was filibustered last year. Since then, they have dropped
several controversial provisions, including one that would have
imposed strict limitations on so-called negative ``issue ads.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said issue ads, normally used by anonymous groups to
mount an attack on a candidate in the closing days of a campaign,
are a major concern. But he said the soft money contributions,
which allow special interests and the wealthy to circumvent the
federal limits on donations to individual candidates, is more
important.
</P>
<P>
   By dropping the issue ad provisions, he and Feingold hope to
attract more support.
</P>
<P>
   In his appeal to Bush, McCain wrote that Republicans have an
obligation to reform ``a campaign financing system that is
perceived by the public as selling political speech to the highest
bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of conservative reform,'' McCain wrote. ``The
obligation falls on us to urge the removal of the greatest
impediment to other reforms that we both support and are important
to our country's progress.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that without removing the financial influence of
special interests over politicians, it will be nearly impossible to
make significant changes in tax laws, education, the judicial
system, defense and numerous other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you support these reforms,'' McCain wrote to Bush and
the other candidates. ``I believe that campaign finance reform is
the first reform and the gateway through which each of them must
pass.''

COURT EXAMINES HAWAIIAN NATIVES' SPECIAL RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case mixing history, race and the
Constitution, the Supreme Court grappled Wednesday with a Hawaii
law that bars whites and other groups from voting for trustees who
oversee a fund that benefits Hawaiians whose ancestors date back to
the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case about ballot box discrimination, clear and
simple,'' said Theodore Olson, an attorney for Harold Rice, a white
rancher from Honolulu who challenged the law.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are elections held by the quasi-state Office of
Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), established in 1978 to run a $300 million
trust that distributes money to the islands' estimated 200,000
residents of original Hawaiian descent. The office oversees various
economic, social, health and education programs.
</P>
<P>
   The state's law says only residents whose ancestors were living
in Hawaii before 1778 _ when the English explorer and navigator,
Capt. James Cook, became the first westerner to visit there _ can
serve on the board of nine trustees or vote in OHA elections.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the state's population have some original
Hawaiian blood, according to the OHA.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, a fifth-generation Hawaiian, sued, claiming that the
elections violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee that all citizens
must have ``equal protection of the laws'' and the 15th Amendment's
rule that the right to vote cannot be denied on account of race or
color. But his lawsuit was rejected in 1997 by a federal district
court and a year later by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen political interest groups and constituencies
are closely watching the case. The Clinton administration, which
formally apologized in 1993 for the annexation of Hawaii in 1898,
and several states have argued for Hawaii's law. But some civil
rights and pro-Indian groups as well as conservatives such as
former appellate judge and unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee
Robert Bork have publicly called for the eradication of OHA's
voting restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   While no other state program resembles the Hawaii trust, the
case raises broader questions about making race a condition of
eligibility for public benefits. The justices could structure a
narrow decision specific to Hawaii, but they also could produce a
ruling that would call into question the legality of federal and
other state programs benefiting American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right to vote is the bedrock of a democratic society,''
Olson told the court during Wednesday's arguments.
</P>
<P>
   But John Roberts, a Washington, D.C., attorney representing
Hawaii, argued that the state enjoyed a special trust relationship
with the federal government that justifies the voting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the voting restriction is not based on race but on
whether a voter is a beneficiary of the trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Rice was not denied the right to vote because he's
white,'' Roberts told the court. ``He was denied because he does
not receive any of the trust's money or other benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Several justices questioned Robert's assertion that the Hawaii
law had nothing to do with race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Oklahoma set up a program for children of descendants of
ranchers who lived in the state before 1900 that sent them to
special schools, we'd all know that it was meant for white kids and
wouldn't be allowed,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia said: ``Saying this is anything other
than a racial classification is simply word games.''
</P>
<P>
   Representing the administration, Justice Department lawyer Edwin
Kneedler said the law was allowed under Constitution because
Congress and the state of Hawaii treat native Hawaiians the same as
American Indians, who are permitted to control assets given to them
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must allow the government to treat Hawaiians as just
another tribe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to rule on the case by late June.

AFTER A LOTTO COMPLAINTS, TEXAS COMMISSION DROPS PLAN TO CHANGE
GAME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Unwilling to gamble with an unpopular proposal,
the Texas Lottery Commission announced Wednesday that it was
scrubbing a plan that would have increased Lotto jackpots but made
winning the on-line game more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single message we have heard loud and clear ... is, `Don't
mess with Lotto Texas.' I want to assure the public and all of our
players that message has not been ignored,'' said Linda Cloud, the
commission's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   She said the proposed changes, which were designed to boost
lagging ticket sales, were being pulled down. She said commission
officials would try to find a more acceptable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud also said that the commission may have to lower the
minimum Lotto jackpot from $4 million to $3 million because the $4
million payout wasn't generating enough ticket sales to pay for
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing about the Lotto game is that it is
jackpot-driven, and if you can't build the jackpot, that's what
deters your players. They want to play for the bigger jackpot,''
Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, lottery officials recently unveiled a plan
that would have increased Lotto jackpots by increasing the number
of balls in the twice-weekly drawings from 50 to 54.
</P>
<P>
   That would have increased the odds of winning the jackpot from
the current 1 in 15.8 million to 1 in 25.8 million because players
would have had to correctly choose six numbers from 1 to 54 rather
than six numbers from 1 to 50.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery commission believed the proposal not only would have
sparked more interest in the game but also would have generated an
additional $20 million a year in revenue for the state, which gets
32 percent of lottery sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission was swamped with protests from players, who
objected to making the game more difficult to win.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud said the commission received more than 1,000 letters,
e-mails and verbal responses from the public, most of which opposed
the changes. Only four people testified at a public hearing on the
plan last week in Austin, but all four spoke against it.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud said she believed there was ``widespread confusion and
misunderstanding'' about the proposal but was yielding to public
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   She said the commission was canceling public hearings that had
been scheduled for later this month in Houston and other cities.
Instead, the commission will arrange future ``town-hall meetings''
for a ``meaningful, one-on-one dialogue with players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help us learn first-hand what our players want or
don't want, and how together we can continue to make the Texas
Lottery the No. 1 lottery in the country,'' Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery director said the minimum $4 million Lotto jackpot
needed to generate $6.7 million in ticket sales to pay for itself.
Recent sales for that size jackpot have been running at about $4
million, which requires the commission to dip into its prize
reserves, which it cannot afford to do indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Lowering the minimum jackpot ``may be something we have no
choice about,'' Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   Total lottery sales, including the on-line and scratch-off
games, slumped to $2.57 billion during the fiscal year that ended
Aug. 31, a drop of 16 percent. Officials put much of the blame on a
1995 law that forced a reduction in game prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature repealed that law last spring, and lottery
officials responded with several new scratch-off games with better
winning odds.
</P>
<P>
   The state comptroller's office has forecast an increase in
lottery sales to $3.35 billion this fiscal year. Cloud said she
believed that estimate was based on the level of lottery sales
before the Legislature reduced the prize payout four years ago.

 &HT;    Fortune ranks most powerful businesswomen
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet has changed the landscape of American business in
still another unexpected way _ by elevating more women to the top
levels of management, Fortune (Oct. 25) reports.
</P>
<P>
   Carly Fiorina, who ranks first on the magazine's ``50 most
powerful women in American business'' list for the second straight
year, is an example.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 she headed the core division at Lucent Technologies.
This year she made history by becoming chief executive of
Hewlett-Packard, the first female to hold that position at one of
America's 20 biggest corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's Power 50 is remarkable for the fact that newcomers
make up one-third of the list _ half of them in tech-related jobs,
showing once again the Internet's limitless capacity for creating
power, opportunity and wealth,'' Fortune says.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the top five of Fortune's list after Fiorina are Heidi
Miller, chief financial officer of Citigroup; Mary Meeker, managing
director, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter; Shelly Lazarus, chairman and
chief executive officer, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather; and Meg Whitman,
president and chief executive officer, eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetic surgery at Forbes
</P>
<P>
   A Forbes (Oct. 18) by any other look is still a Forbes, as its
redesigned format shows.
</P>
<P>
   It's the magazine's first redesign in 10 years and leads with a
cover story on cable TV titan John Malone, the largest individual
shareholder of AT&AMP;T. He may be about to lock horns with AT&AMP;T
Chairman Michael Armstrong over the flagging performance of AT&AMP;T
stock, the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   As for what's new at Forbes, Editor William Baldwin says it's
``more visual,'' and its various departments will always be in a
consistent order of appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Chill out, mom
</P>
<P>
   Working Mother (November) tried to settle the home vs. career
conflict for working moms by asking their children what they think.
A survey of more than 1,000 kids and 600 parents by the Families
and Work Institute in New York found that a majority of the kids
felt they had ``ample time with their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Other reassuring results show that working has little to do
with how children view their parents and that the majority of kids
think their working mothers are doing a great job,'' the magazine
says.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning
</P>
<P>
   Business Week (Oct. 11) profiles Ford's chief executive officer,
Jacques Nasser, who is ``off to a jackrabbit start in his quest to
transform the stodgy giant into a consumer-oriented powerhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of blue-collar work may be near as more businesses move
from making things to marketing services and other intangibles, The
Futurist (October) says. Researchers say the growing disparity
between high-skill, high-wage workers and low-skill, low-wage
workers ``may have serious implications for social cohesion in many
advanced nations.''

DEATH TOLL RISES IN TRAIN CRASH IN BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The death toll from Tuesday's train crash in London,
Britain's worst in more than four decades, rose to at least 70 on
Wednesday, police said. An intercity express hit a three-car
commuter train that apparently ran a red light, investigators
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of 100 more people remained unclear, according to a
police spokesman, Andy Trotter.
</P>
<P>
   And the crash rekindled a passionate debate over the safety of
Britain's trains since the formerly state-owned system was sold in
May 1996 to private companies, which have been accused by union
officials of skimping on safety equipment in their pursuit of
profit.
</P>
<P>
   In a rending twist for relatives of the dead, rescue officials
said the remains of many bodies are still not recovered,
incinerated in the burned shell of a first-class buffet car at the
front of the express.
</P>
<P>
   One official described the 48-seat carriage as ``knee-deep in
ash'' from a devastating fire that erupted almost immediately after
the express, heading into London from western England with 500
travelers, hit the smaller train, which was heading out of London
at 8:11 a.m., the height of the morning rush-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the dead may never be identified or even recovered,
Trotter said. ``We do not believe, given the devastation caused by
the fire, that it will be possible to recover any more bodies from
the train,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The stricken carriage, which has not yet been searched, lay
lopsidedly along the track Wednesday night, covered in drab gray
tarpaulins. Rescue officials said they may begin a detailed search
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Thompson, an officer of the British Transport Police, said
that both trains were carrying diesel fuel and that when they
collided, ``it was a fireball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the seats are gone, everything is gone,'' Thompson said.
``It's just a shell.''
</P>
<P>
   One survivor, Brendon Bentley, a 24-year-old New Zealander who
works as an accountant, was on the commuter train.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember just a big surge and everyone being knocked down
and then bits of seat and everything coming from over my shoulders
and then just darkness,'' he said from his bed at St. Mary's
Hospital, where he is being treated for damage to his spleen and a
broken wrist.
</P>
<P>
   When the fire began, he said, `'I could see the flames and there
were some people trapped underneath the seats. We had to try and
get over them and try to give them a hand, but we couldn't. So then
the first priority was just to get off the carriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Trotter told reporters at the crash site, near Ladbroke Grove,
that the death toll was ``70-plus,'' with a further 100 people who
`'might have been on that train'' and were not satisfactorily
accounted for. Of the 70 people known to have boarded the express,
he said, 28 bodies had been recovered but not positively
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Police are basing their calculations on accounts from friends
and relatives who have identified 70 people who definitely boarded
one of the trains and have not been heard from since. Trotter said
the other 100 were people whose travel arrangements were unclear or
who may have survived the crash without informing police.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's worst crash before Tuesday's was in 1957, when 90
people died in a collision between a commuter train and an express
in southeast London. Since then, though safety devices have
proliferated in many parts of Europe, British railroad operators
have shied from installing them.
</P>
<P>
   British labor leaders say several accidents could have been
avoided if rail operators had invested in a safety system called
Automatic Train Protection, which automatically stops trains at red
signals.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent such accident occurred two years ago, on the
same stretch of track, when another Great Western train slammed
into a freight train, killing seven people. The company was fined
$2.5 million after acknowledging inadequate safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know if the railways were in public ownership, ATP
would have been installed in trains by 1994 or 1995,'' said Mick
Rix, a spokesman for the rail drivers' union. ``I think the public,
rightly, is now making a clear demand that safety must be put
before cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument became louder when union officials disclosed
Wednesday that a signal near the site of the crash _ Signal 109 _
had been cited in eight incidents over six years when train drivers
complained that they could not see th lights because of power
cables and gantries.
</P>
<P>
   Under private ownership, Britain's rail service is divided among
the train operators and Railtrack, which owns the tracks, stations
and signaling system. The companies are profitable, especially
Railtrack, but the profits have been accompanied by growing worries
about safety.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said Wednesday night, for
instance, that there had been 600 incidents of trains running red
signals in the past 12 months. ``I want complete assurance that the
industry is doing enough to reduce the dangers,'' he told reporters
as he announced plans for an inquiry into rail safety.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies involved in the accident _ Railtrack and the
two operators, Thames Trains and First Great Western _ said in a
statement that the Great Western express had been ``authorized to
proceed under green lights'' and that ``the signals concerned were
in full working order.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigations will now concentrate on the behavior of the
Thames turbo train following reports that it had passed a signal at
danger,'' the statement said. It also said the workings of Signal
109 would be examined.
</P>
<P>
   Thames Trains said its driver had been driving for two months
after 11 months of training.

HIGH COURT HEARS CASE ON ANCESTRY-BASED VOTING RIGHTS IN HAWAII 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Harold F. Rice is a native of Hawaii, but he is not
a ``Native Hawaiian'' or even a ``Hawaiian'' under the law of a
state that reserves those terms for descendants of the people
living on the islands in 1778, when British Capt. James Cook and
his crew arrived.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Rice is barred from voting for the trustees of the
Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a state agency that dispenses millions
of dollars a year on behalf of ``Hawaiians,'' the roughly 20
percent of the state's population that can claim at least one
indigenous ancestor, and Native Hawaiians, a considerably smaller
group with at least 50 percent Native blood. Under Hawaii's
constitution, only the members of these groups, as beneficiaries of
the agency's largesse, may vote for its leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, whose Caucasian ancestors arrived in Hawaii in 1831,
brought an unusual discrimination case before the U.S. Supreme
Court on Wednesday, asking the justices to find him _ and, by
extension, some 80 percent of Hawaii's population _ the victims of
unconstitutional racial discrimination and to open the agency's
elections to all voters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case of ballot box racial discrimination plain and
simple,'' Theodore Olson, Rice's lawyer, told the court. Olson
maintained that the limitation violates both the 14th Amendment's
guarantee of equal protection and the 15th Amendment's promise that
the right to vote shall not be denied ``on account of race, color,
or previous condition of servitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's lawyer, John G. Roberts Jr., tried to persuade the
justices that this was not a case about race but rather about a
``distinct and unique indigenous group'' for which Congress and the
Hawaii state government have assumed a special obligation tied not
to race but to history. Rice, Roberts said, ``was not denied the
right to vote on account of race'' but because ``Congress has
singled out Hawaiians as the beneficiaries of a trust relationship
just like its relationship with American Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supported Hawaii in the case. Deputy
Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler told the justices that the
structure of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs reflected not a concern
with race but a ``historic continuity to the sovereign nation that
existed at the time of European contact.''
</P>
<P>
   But persuading the justices was an uphill battle. ``There are a
lot of groups like that, with their own continuity, their own
history, who might even have been aggrieved,'' Justice Antonin
Scalia objected.
</P>
<P>
   By their questions and comments, it was clear that race remained
the lens through which the justices viewed this case, Rice vs.
Cayetano, No. 98-818, making it quite likely that they will strike
down the voting restriction. By the end of the argument, the only
real question appeared to be what path the court might take toward
that end, and what impact such a decision would have.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the court's approach, a decision for Rice might be
limited to the particularities of Hawaii, or might produce a
decision casting doubt on numerous special benefits that now exist
in federal and state law for Native Americans, or might even say
something generally about official policies that take account of
race.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``What are the ramifications of the position you are arguing?''
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked Rice's lawyer, Olson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's impossible for me to say,'' Olson replied. He said the
narrowest ground of decision would be to strike down the
restriction as a violation of the 15th Amendment right to vote,
adding that he was unaware of any other state or federal law that
conditioned the right to vote on membership in a racial group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't mean to suggest that if you win, there won't be a
lot of litigation,'' said Justice John Paul Stevens, and Olson
conceded the point.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court in Honolulu and the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco both rejected Rice's position,
with the appeals court concluding last year that ``the voting
restriction is not primarily racial, but legal or political.''
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit said that elections for the agency's trustees
were like elections for special-purpose irrigation and land-use
districts, which the Supreme Court has ruled may be
constitutionally limited to landowners within the district.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court's decision also relied on the fact that the
Office of Hawaiian Affairs administers and dispenses the revenue
from a trust consisting of land that was set aside for public
purposes beginning with Hawaii's annexation to the United States in
1898. At statehood in 1959, the ``betterment of the conditions of
Native Hawaiians'' became one of the purposes of the trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why you can't say that only beneficiaries of the
trust can vote for the trustees,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer told
Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Olson replied that ``trust is an arbitrary term'' that could not
justify discrimination in voting.
</P>
<P>
   Most justices appeared unreceptive to the state's effort to
anchor Hawaii's special provisions for its natives in the body of
Indian law, under which many special provisions for Native
Americans have been upheld. Scalia said that Indian law, based on
the concept of tribal sovereignty, was irrelevant to Hawaii, where
the natives were never organized into tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg disagreed. ``But Hawaii was a sovereign kingdom, and
the United States had a large hand in destroying that
sovereignty,'' she said, adding: ``The analogy seems to me quite
strong.''

   GROZNY, Russia _ Russian forces have expanded their operation in
Chechnya, moving more troops in from the west, after seizing
control of the entire northern part of the republic, Chechen
commanders here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen fighters have withdrawn from north of the Terek River,
the last fighters pulling out of the village of Naurskaya just
before dawn Wednesday, said Apti Batalov, chief of the presidential
administration in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bombarded the village heavily last night. The men
probably withdrew to save the village from complete destruction,''
he said. Another Chechen commander, who asked to remain anonymous,
said that Russian units had nearly encircled the Chechens who
decided to escape rather than be trapped.
</P>
<P>
   The men left at 4 a.m. after mining the approaches to the
village , and slipped away across a gas pipeline suspended above
the Terek River, he said. The northwestern district above the
Terek, known as Shelkovskaya, has also been abandoned, and the
bridges mined, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the Chechen retreat came as little surprise to
commanders based in Grozny. It was widely expected and seemed
preferable to expending ammunition and even losing a large number
of men at this stage, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Although seizing the land north of the Terek appears to have
been one of their main aims, Russian forces immediately pushed on
with their offensive, moving troops in from Ingushetia, well south
of the Terek.
</P>
<P>
   Batalov said Russian troops occupied high ground above the
settlement of Goragorsk, some 15 miles west of Grozny, the capital.
They also moved in on the village of Bamut, in the far southwestern
corner of Chechnya, crossing in from positions in Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have only advanced a few miles into Chechnya from
the west, but Batalov said he expected them to try to storm Bamut,
after bombarding it Tuesday night. ``It will probably start soon,''
he said. He agreed that the Russians may be aiming to create a
buffer zone around the edges of Chechnya, to enforce a tight
economic and security blockade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of the commanders in Grozny rule out the possibility of
Russian troops trying to storm Grozny. A few suggest that they
might let the Russian troops in and then hit their positions once
they are established.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can then surround them and fight them much more easily, as
we did in August 1996,'' said Salamgir Gabatayev, a commander who
fought in the last battle for Grozny when Chechen fighters trapped
thousands of Russian troops in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Few civilian residents are waiting to see what will happen. They
were leaving the city in droves again Wednesday, in cars and trucks
piled high with baggage and furniture, heading out west to
Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   A triple line of cars stretched back two miles at the border.
Prices in Grozny have risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Shelling could be heard from the direction of Goragorsk to the
north. Chechen officials reported more shelling in two villages
north of Grozny, Znamenskoye, where seven people were reported
killed Wednesday morning, and Chervlyonnaya, where fighting was
reported.
</P>
<P>
   One spark for the latest exodus was the news that 40 people,
mostly women and children, were killed when their bus was hit by a
Russian shell near Chervlyonnaya on Tuesday. Chechen fighters who
came to their rescue were also killed when a second volley of
rockets hit the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pervading nervousness, Chechens celebrated the
shooting down of up to three Russian ground attack jets. A wing of
one of the planes, shot down Monday, was put on display in central
Grozny and drew a crowd who tore off fragments as souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen government has introduced martial law, ordering all
men of fighting age to report to their local army command point,
and for all factories and enterprises to assist the war effort with
supplies and food.

HINDU NATIONALISTS LEAD AS COUNTING OF 350 MILLION BALLOTS BEGINS
IN INDIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The colossal job of counting more than 350
million ballots in India's national elections got under way
Wednesday, and partial results showed that the Hindu
nationalist-led coalition had taken a lead against the alliance
headed by the Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
   Most political analysts said it was likely that the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and the more than 20 other
parties that have joined the alliance it heads would emerge with a
majority. The last coalition government, also led by the BJP,
toppled this spring, just 13 tumultuous months into a five-year
term, when its most temperamental partner pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party, led by Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow
who inherited the mantle of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, was trailing
badly. But Mrs. Gandhi herself, who was seeking a seat in
Parliament for the first time, won from a poor, rural district in
the southern state of Karnataka. Her opponent, the BJP stalwart
Shushma Swaraj, had portrayed herself as the native Indian battling
the ``foreigner,'' Mrs. Gandhi, but that theme failed to sway the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   All across India, people crowded around their television sets to
watch the early results of the third national election in three
years. Almost 6 out of 10 adults voted across the nation, the
world's biggest democracy, despite the wearying frequency of
elections that seem only to produce more unstable governments.
</P>
<P>
   The state television network, which reaches the humblest mud
huts in the remotest villages, kept a continually updated tally of
results rolling across the bottom of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In central New Delhi, just a short walk from Parliament, people
pulled off the road to gaze at a huge board where men regularly
climbed a ladder to update the vote tallies. After losing the city
badly in state elections, the Hindu nationalists swept every seat
in Delhi, even defeating Manmohan Singh, the sober Congress Party
economist who was thought to be a possible candidate for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   S.N. Chanchal, a retired teacher who had watched the returns all
afternoon on television walked over after dinner to look at the
board. J.K. Bhatia, a survey engineer, stopped on his way home from
work. ``We're very pleased,'' Bhatia said. ``We want a stable
government. There should not be elections every year. It's a waste
of time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from clear just how stable a new government will
be, even if the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition wins a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as poll workers were still opening the locks on metal
boxes and laboriously hand counting paper ballots, two of the
partners were speaking out against a decision made by the BJP-led
coalition government that has ruled as a caretaker government since
April. They objected to a decision the government made Tuesday to
raise the controlled price of diesel fuel 40 percent in response to
a 60 percent increase in international prices of diesel.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, 73, looked chipper
and rested this evening and voiced confidence that the alliance he
leads will have the votes to form a government. The lower house has
543 elected members and it takes 272 to form a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   As of 12:30 a.m. India time, the Hindu nationalist-led alliance
had won 107 seats and was leading in 179 more, for a total of 286.
Vajpayee, leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, won his
parliamentary seat from Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar
Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party and its allies had won 51 seats and were
leading in 83 others, for a total of 134. Other parties had won 11
seats and were leading in 93. There were no results yet in the
remaining seats.
</P>
<P>
   The vote counting will be over by Friday, election officials
said.

ISRAEL HAS SHIFTED TO LOWER-RISK TACTICS IN SOUTHERN LEBANON

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The operational nature of the chronic, low-level
warfare in southern Lebanon has changed markedly over the past two
months as both Israeli and Shiite Muslim guerrillas look ahead to
the Israeli troop withdrawal pledged by Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has increased its bombardment of suspected guerrilla
targets in response to an intensification of attacks by Party of
God (Hezbollah) forces, military officials say. By Wednesday
afternoon, for instance, Israeli planes had carried out six air
strikes within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has also scaled back deployment of ground troops with the
specific aim of avoiding casualties, even if it means foregoing
attacks that would inflict damage on the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual admission Wednesday, Army Chief of Staff Shaul
Mofaz acknowledged a new reticence to take risks, saying he
preferred to ``keep our losses down'' and ``kill fewer Hezbollah
fighters'' if it meant protecting more Israelis soldiers from
danger.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli military officials also said they have been able to
reduce the use of ground troops because the accuracy of their
weapon systems has improved with new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are really doing is introducing technologies that
partially substitute for the physical presence of soldiers,'' said
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneeh in an interview. ``The bottom
line is that it has improved the efficiency of our presence in
southern Lebanon. We can stave off the guerrillas from our border
with a lower price.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether this amounts to a tailored strategy of
preparation for Barak's promise to pull out of southern Lebanon by
next summer. Some military experts suggested Wednesday that it
could represent nothing more than the latest tactical shift in a
21-year-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult not to see this as a shift of tactics geared
to a political goal. It is undeniable that the Israeli army, like
it or not, is facing a nine-month deadline for withdrawal as Barak
moves to extricate Israel from an unpopular and seemingly
unwinnable fight.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barak's pledge to bring home the boys was a centerpiece of his
campaign, and some believe it catapulted him to his overwhelming
victory in May. But he did make the pledge on the assumption that
he would quickly renew a dialogue with Syria, which effectively
controls Lebanon and holds sway over the guerrillas. And that
renewal has yet to happen, at least openly. (Back-channel
conversations through third parties, including the Americans, have
taken place.)
</P>
<P>
   But for political reasons, Barak seems to consider himself bound
to withdraw anyway, even without Syria's help. Last week, when Sneh
suggested that the deadline need not be rigid, Barak sent out a
pager message to Israeli reporters within 25 minutes, distancing
himself from the comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Defense Forces did not fulfill a request Wednesday
to release full statistics on air strikes. But Yediot Ahronot, one
of Israel's top three newspapers, reported Tuesday that the air
force had conducted 100 sorties in Lebanon in the past month. The
paper called it a record number, and said the bombing has
intensified since June, when Israel, in retaliation for rockets
fired at northern settlements, conducted its most severe
bombardment of Lebanon since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also quoted senior officers in Lebanon who said that
neither Israeli troops nor special units had been sent on ambushes
or offensives deep inside Lebanon ``for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   In describing the army's current approach, Sneh said: ``The
policy is very prudent, not in the sense of cautious, but clever.
We are not going toward danger. When there is something efficient,
we do it. And we have had some nice successes destroying the
artillery of the Hezbollah in the last couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel first dispatched troops to Lebanon in 1978 to attack
Palestinian guerrillas. Since 1985 it has occupied a 9-mile-deep
border zone in southern Lebanon to protect its northern towns from
attack. But the steady loss of Israeli soldiers and the poor
prospects of an end to the conflict have embittered many Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has lost 13 soldiers in Lebanon so far this year. In
1998, 23 died in the conflict, and in 1997, 39 were killed, not
including 73 who died in a helicopter collision.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Shlomo Brom, who recently published a study on
Israel's engagement in Lebanon for the Tel Aviv University Jaffe
Center for Strategic Studies, said the army is indeed bettering its
ability to use aerial force, particularly by becoming quicker to
locate guerrilla strongholds and retaliate. But he said: ``I'm
afraid it's not the end of the story. Hezbollah will now look for
tactics that will make it less vulnerable to airborne attacks, and
then we're back to the drawing board.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``There is no silver bullet that will allow us to
withdraw to the international border and have everything be OK.
Prime Minister Barak is a very intelligent person with vast
military experience, and I can't imagine he's thinking in such
simplistic terms.'' &QL;

CALIFORNIA DEVELOPER SUES TO STOP APARTMENT FORECLOSURES IN
HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif.) 
 
By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Beleaguered California developer Alfred Antonini,
indicted last month by a Houston grand jury on charges of money
laundering and threatening an employee, has filed a lawsuit to try
to stop the foreclosure of a local apartment complex he owns.
</P>
<P>
   Antonini, 53, of Hayward, Calif., says in the state district
court suit he filed earlier this week that two associates have
conspired to try to fraudulently take away two Houston apartment
complexes from Antonini worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The associates denied any wrongdoing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Antonini sold one of the apartment complexes, the 432-unit
Natchez House Apartments in southwest Houston, this spring to Gary
Gates of Rosenberg for $4.5 million. Antonini contends in the
lawsuit that Gates, through his company Gatesco, also had promised
to buy the 340-unit Woodland Forest Apartments in southwest Houston
and give Antonini one-third ownership in both complexes.
</P>
<P>
   Both facilities were in bankruptcy protection earlier this year
because Antonini owed millions to lender Ireland Family Limited
Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said the total sales price of both complexes was to
be $7.8 million, with the understanding that Antonini would pay off
the debts at the complexes in return for part ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But the sale of Woodland Forest Apartments never materialized,
and lender Ireland Family Limited Partnership planned to foreclose
on the complex this week because it was owed more than $2 million
on the property, said John Quinlan, a part-owner of the limited
partnership who also represents it as an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Quinlan and Gates would both have
received one-third ownership of the two complexes if the sale of
both had gone through, but they conspired to prevent the sale of
the second complex in order to deprive Antonini of ownership in
either one.
</P>
<P>
   Antonini's lawsuit asked a judge to prevent the foreclosure of
Woodland Forest Apartments. He is seeking unspecified actual and
punitive damages from Gates and Quinlan, and their respective
companies.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge John Devine refused Monday to issue a
temporary restraining order preventing the foreclosure of Woodland
Forest Apartments.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Antonini sought bankruptcy protection for the
complex in California court, preventing foreclosure until the
bankruptcy issues are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Antonini could not be reached for comment. His attorney Jess
Mason said that during the negotiations, Gates told Antonini that
another partner would be the ``money man'' but refused to disclose
his identity. He said Antonini repeatedly asked it the third
partner was Quinlan, but Gates told him no.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked at his (Quinlan's) involvement and tried to
work things out,'' Mason said. ``There was a squeeze play going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinlan said he will fight Antonini's bankruptcy filing in
California because the issue has already been resolved in a Houston
federal court. Mason said the California filing is proper.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have said Antonini, 53, was involved in two
check-kiting schemes involving nearly $24 million and in illegal
real estate and bank transactions. Antonini's wife, Alva J.
Antonini, 52, and James G. Lomonaco, 51, were also indicted. All
three have entered pleas of not guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge
Calvin Botley in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the three used computers and
``hand-drawn ledgers'' to artificially inflate bank accounts,
including accounts in Houston banks, ``with the goal of gaining
interest-free loans.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also alleges that the three threatened a former
employee who knew of the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The three are accused of conspiracy, money laundering, bank
fraud and using the mail to make extortion threats in a federal
indictment returned last week. &QL;

 &HT;    BellSouth CEO reassures employess
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATANTA _ A day after conceding defeat in the bidding for Sprint,
BellSouth's top executive sent a message to 90,000 employees
offering an explanation, reassurance and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message Wednesday, Chairman and Chief Executive F.
Duane Ackerman said the company was justified in reaching for
Sprint. But he argued that coming up short was not a sign that the
company was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth remains strong and profitable, with a vibrant future,
he wrote. ``We have the resources to compete against anyone ... I
want you to know that we are still committed to our strategies for
growing our business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the frantic, but failed bid for Sprint,
Ackerman's only other public statement was a terse, two-sentence
release Tuesday. That statement acknowledged that BellSouth's
eleventh-hour, $100 billion bid had been trumped Monday by MCI
WorldCom, which threw $115 billion on the table and won the nod
from Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   A BellSouth merger with Sprint was seen as providing instant
credibility as a national player in all manner of
telecommunications services. But Ackerman reminded employees the
company still has a solid base in the Southeast, a growing wireless
business, promising investments in Latin America and a solid
Internet unit. Ackerman said: ``We have the tools we need to
compete ... except one, long distance.''
</P>
<P>
   That lack of long-distance apparently proved a hurdle in making
BellSouth's case. Company bargainers were frustrated in the past
few days to find that naysayers at Sprint could cite the problem of
forming a combination while BellSouth was still banned from
long-distance in its region.
</P>
<P>
   At least the merger of MCI WorldCom and Sprint adds ammunition
to the argument of the regional Bells that they should be granted
entry. Ackerman said he expects the Federal Communications
Commission to approve long-distance for BellSouth early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Once the company has regulatory approval, Ackerman said, the
BellSouth alliance with Qwest Communications will provide a solid
start into long-distance voice and data. And while BellSouth will
weigh other acquisitions, there is no urgency, he wrote. ``We don't
have to merge or acquire another company to increase shareholder
value. While this merger may have accelerated our growth
strategies, we can accomplish the same thing by forming alliances
with other companies.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has been criticized both for rushing to bid for
Sprint, but also for staying aloof while merger mania swept the
industry. A series of huge combinations has turned BellSouth from
the largest regional Bell to second-smallest. Federal regulators
Wednesday approved SBC Communications' purchase of Ameritech, which
makes that company twice the size of BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Ackerman defended the decision to make a run at
Sprint, a decision made as MCI WorldCom approached an agreement
with Sprint. BellSouth lost, but its bids forced MCI WorldCom to
pay an estimated $13 billion more than planned. And Ackerman argued
in effect that nothing has changed since financial analysts
endorsed BellSouth as a solid investment among the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Paine Webber recently wrote BellSouth ``is the

 &HT;    Cinnabon set to make first Caribbean foray
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cinnabon continues to expand its presence overseas
with a deal to open 18 bakeries in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, with franchisee Cinnamon Rolls Caribbean Inc., marks
the brand's first entry into the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of interest overseas,'' said David McDougall,
director of operations. He said further deals may be possible with
Cinnamon Rolls Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnabon has looked overseas for much of its expansion efforts
since it was acquired by Atlanta-based AFC Enterprises last
October. Previously, the company had decided not to focus on
franchising. That was revived under AFC, which is a major franchise
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a two-pronged development strategy,'' McDougall said.
He estimates overseas bakery openings represent half of the
company's growth.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last year, the company has signed agreements for more
than 300 Cinnabon units to be built in 20 additional countries.
Overall, Cinnabon operates and franchises 411 retail cinnamon roll
bakeries in 39 states, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   AFC also owns Churchs Chicken, Popeyes Chicken &AMP; Biscuits,
Seattle's Best Coffee and Torrefazione Italia Coffee. AFC, which
had 1998 sales of $1.8 billion, has more than 3,300 restaurants,
bakeries and cafes in 25 countries.

   DNA-SOLVING-CRIMES (Chicago) _ In a novel legal gambit that
stretches the law to match the developing science of DNA, a
prosecutor in Wisconsin has filed rape and kidnapping charges
against a defendant who has no name. John Doe is known only by
semen samples from three rapes. The case shows how hopeful
prosecutors are that DNA can solve old crimes, even when no suspect
is known. But it also illustrates some of the legal and practical
issues that surround the burgeoning science, particularly whether
it will render irrelevant the notion of a statute of limitations.

<P>
   BUSH-CAMPAIGN-ASSESS (Washington) _ These are uneasy days for
Republicans on Capitol Hill. Once again they are locked in a
chaotic, down-to-the-wire budget battle with President Clinton.
They have been forced into a debate over managed health care
legislation that offends the anti-regulatory sensibilities of many
Republicans. And now the party's front-running presidential
candidate seems to be defining his own credentials as a
``compassionate conservative'' by distancing himself from them. By

   RUSSIA-YELTSIN-FAMILY (Omsk, Russia) _ Leonid Dyachenko,
son-in-law of President Boris Yeltsin and husband of Yeltsin's
daughter and right-hand strategist, Tatiyana Dyachenko, was once so
anonymous that even prying reporters were unsure of his first name.
But Dyachenko turns out to have a colorful life indeed. He is a
participant, if not a key figure, in a network of politically
blessed companies that ship Siberian oil products to Ukraine and to
eastern Europe. The disclosure of his dealings is at the least
embarrassing to the Kremlin. At worst, it could plunge the Yeltsin
family into a corruption sinkhole over which, so far, they have
managed only to teeter. By Michael Wines. 1,300 words.

MASSACRE OF ISRAELI-ARABS SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN CLASSROOMS,
OFFICIAL URGES
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Originally slugged ISRAEL-LESSON) 
(js) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Urging Israeli teachers to face a dark chapter in
their country's past, Education Minister Yossi Sarid has
recommended that a massacre of Israeli Arabs 43 years ago this
month be marked for the first time in the nation's classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The request to commemorate the killings of 47 Arab villagers by
Israeli border policemen at the village of Kafr Kassem on October
29, 1956, was made in a letter sent by Sarid on Tuesday to civics
teachers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not seek to hide and obscure, we do not seek to cover up
the shame, but to deal with it openly and honestly,'' Sarid, a
former civics teacher and the leader of the leftist Meretz party,
wrote to the teachers. ``Whoever is sure of himself and his path
will not hesitate to expose his flaws as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarid's message does not mean that the Israeli government is
taking responsibility for the killings, as Arab leaders of the
village have demanded. But the letter was the latest sign of a more
critical examination of Israeli history that has filtered down from
academic circles to the media and the schools, setting off a lively
national debate.
</P>
<P>
   New high school textbooks introduced this year challenge
traditional Israeli historical accounts, acknowledging the
expulsion of Arabs during Israel's war of independence in 1948 and
questioning depictions of Israeli fighters as outnumbered by the
Arabs. An Israeli television history series aired last year to mark
the country's 50th anniversary included scenes of expulsion and
Palestinian perspectives on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Sarid wrote that the purpose of marking the massacre was to
teach Israeli children that illegal orders must be refused.
</P>
<P>
   At Kafr Kassem, border policemen under orders to shoot to kill
curfew-breakers fired on villagers returning from their fields,
killing men, women and children. Eight of the policemen were tried
and convicted, despite their claims that they were merely following
orders. However, their sentences were later reduced, and none
served more than three-and-a-half years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Sarid quoted from the verdict, which asserted that soldiers must
refuse a ``patently illegal order'' that carries a ``black flag''
of criminality.
</P>
<P>
   Citing another verdict against a soldier who beat a man to death
in the Gaza Strip in 1988 during the Palestinian uprising, Sarid
noted that ``good soldiers, `the best of our youth', have carried
out patently illegal orders.'' Such behavior was the result of
``educational neglect,'' Sarid asserted. ``We do not want to
descend, God forbid, to crimes born of blind obedience,'' Sarid
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Precisely those who are proud as we are of the
rebirth of Israel and totally identify with it, precisely those who
like us see military service as a national and personal mission of
unparalleled importance, it is precisely we who must remember and
commemorate the Kafr Kassem massacre _ and this year, for the first
time, in our educational system _ to insure that our pupils will
know how to listen and discern an illegal order, to keep their eyes
open and identify the black flag.''
</P>
<P>
   The school commemoration would also send an unequivocal and long
overdue message to Israel's Arab citizens, Sarid's letter said.
``We are ashamed of what happened in Kafr Kassem,'' he wrote.
``Your pain is our disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   The first official gesture of sympathy was made last year by the
rightist government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, when
Moshe Katzav, a cabinet minister responsible for Israeli Arab
affairs, went to Kafr Kassem to attend its annual commemoration of
the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Sami Issam, the head of the village council in Kafr Kassem,
welcomed Sarid's letter but cautioned that the issue could not be
laid to rest until the Israeli government either accepted
responsibility for the killings or appointed a commission of
inquiry into the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that this will be a first courageous step to finally
bring the truth to light, so that we won't have to go on living
with this for many more years to come,'' Issa said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Yossi Beilin told Issa on Tuesday that Israel
could not take responsibility for the massacre, saying that the
government at the time did not order the shootings.

 &HT;    Wrestling has crushing appeal
 &HT;    By Amy Kincheloe
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Waco, Texas
</P>
<P>
   It's Thursday night and many of the neighborhood children, 7 to
13 years old, have gathered at Tyler Meek's home to watch another
installment of the professional wrestling program ``Smackdown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool,'' said 8-year-old Tyler. ``I watch it whenever it
comes on _ Monday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler, whose bedroom walls sport pictures of stars from the
World Wrestling Federation and whose closet is full of wrestling
T-shirts, is not alone in his love for this form of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   As wrestling's popularity among adult Americans has increased in
the past couple of years, spurred by the WWF's increasingly
provocative shows, so has wrestling's popularity increased among
children. And despite the protests by wrestling promoters that they
aren't trying to appeal to children, children do find the shows
appealing, as they do the accompanying merchandise of T-shirts,
action figures and so on.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nielsen Media Research, which compiles television
ratings, on a typical Monday night, 7 million homes are tuned in to
the two most popular wrestling shows. And about 4 million of those
viewers are younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   David White, a men's fashion sales associate at Kmart Super
Center, said he has definitely noticed that more customers seem to
be interested in wrestling, especially children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first thing they run to,'' White said of the
store's pro-wrestling clothing and toy sections. ``They love it.
The little kids go crazy over it. `Star Wars' has nothing on
wrestling.''
</P>
<P>
   But White said he personally isn't fond of wrestling. ``I find
it boring. I think it's a lot of hype on something that's so
overrated and over-exaggerated. Wrestling promotes violence, to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   How the depiction of violence affects children is a subject of
debate in the child-development field.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Robinson, a professor of educational psychology at Baylor
University, said he understands why children like wrestling, but he
doesn't think that's such a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's popular with children because the wrestlers are like live
cartoons _ muscular and painted faces,'' Robinson said. ``It's a
very exciting event to see with all the action, music and flashing
lights. It has to do with the cartoon mentality with children and
they get to see real, live people getting hit over the head with
chairs without being hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can be a bad message to send to kids. The message being
said is you can have major violence and not get hurt,'' he said.
``Kids try to emulate these things and could possibly be hurting
others because they're trying out what they see.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case in at least two cases across the country this
year, police believe.
</P>
<P>
   In August, a 4-year-old boy in Warner Robins, Ga., kicked and
beat a toddler to death while a wrestling video played on the TV,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect the child was acting out from watching a wrestling
video,'' said Capt. Jerry Stewart of the Houston County sheriff's
office in Middle Georgia. The video was of the WWF's ``Summer
Slam'' event, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-month-old died of a fractured skull and suffered liver
damage and other injuries, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old, along with the 15-month-old and five other
youngsters, were watching the video with their baby sitter, Stewart
said. The baby sitter told police he put the 15-month-old to sleep
in another room, then left the older children watching the video
while he went to a neighborhood store for 10 to 15 minutes. The
4-year-old struck the toddler with a hard plastic toy and kicked
him off the bed, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Atlanta psychologists said violent videos can provoke
children to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between fantasy and reality is not that clear
at age 4,'' said Steve Garber of the Behavioral Institute of
Atlanta. ``Children this age still believe in Santa Claus and the
Easter bunny.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Cathy Blusiewicz said some wrestling programs are
powerful enough to influence even teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wrestlers are portrayed as heroes if they're successful in
knocking someone out,'' Blusiewicz said. ``It's really a
glorification of violent behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   She said such programs can mislead youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't get that this is entertainment,'' she said. ``Until
puberty, and that can be age 14 or 15, children take things very
literally. They don't recognize window dressing or media hype.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, a 7-year-old Texas boy accidentally killed his
3-year-old brother after watching wrestling on television. The
older boy, asked to demonstrate what he'd done, backed up about 10
feet and ran toward a police detective who was holding a
toddler-sized doll. The boy forcefully stiff-armed the doll in the
neck, knocking it backward. The 3-year-old died of brain injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Tyler Meek's house, the 8-year-old was asked if he would
ever try out any of the moves he saw on wrestling shows. His reply:
``No-o-o! That would hurt!''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's father, Ken Grubbs, watches professional wrestling with
his son as a part of their ``together'' time. He says that because
they watch it together, he has made sure Tyler understands it's not
real.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entertaining,'' Grubbs said. ``To me it's like a soap
opera _ one day it's one thing, and the next day it's something
else. Everyone at work talks about what they saw the night
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubbs says the violence is not an issue for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guns on wrestling, nobody dies on wrestling,
except for accidents, and, unless you're watching pay-per-view, you
don't see blood,'' Grubbs said. ``There's blood, sex and violence
on the other channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Valentine, head of UPN, the network that broadcasts ``WWF
Smackdown,'' and Vince McMahon, the WWF's head honcho, don't agree
with the volence label, even though the show has a TV-14 rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe there is anything sexist or violent about
WWF,'' Valentine said. ``There's no one getting knifed on WWF.
There is no gun going off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're Sunday school compared to what action/adventure shows
do,'' McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   But what Grubbs does have a problem with is the scantily clad
women who often accompany the wrestlers into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the female women come out and start taking half their
clothes off, I change the channel, because in my mind he doesn't
need to see that,'' Grubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as Tyler's wrestling viewing is supervised, Grubbs
said he will continue to let him watch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think wrestling has dirtied his mind,'' Grubbs said.
``If you know what your kids are watching and you're watching it
with them, then there's nothing wrong with it. I don't think it's
what they watch or what they read; it's how they're raised. I take
my kids to church and I raise them right, and as long as he gets
good grades, doesn't miss school and keeps his room clean, then he
can watch wrestling and wear the shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Robinson called Grubbs' supervision policy a good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good practice for parents to be aware of what their
children are watching,'' he said. ``It's also beneficial to discuss
what they're seeing.''

OPPOSITION LEADER VOWS TO BRING DOWN MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The faltering campaign to oust Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic is at another turning point, with an
aggrieved and angry Vuk Draskovic, a prominent politician who has
held himself aloof from two weeks of rallies, moving closer toward
engaged opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic and his powerful wife, Danica, believe he was the
target of an assassination attempt in a car accident on Sunday in
which her brother and three bodyguards died. Draskovic runs
Serbia's largest opposition party and Studio B, the Belgrade city
television station.
</P>
<P>
   While the details of the accident are murky, a truck traveling
in the other direction on a two-lane road suddenly swerved directly
into the car in which Draskovic was riding, pushing it off the
road, and a trailing car of bodyguards was hit head-on,
incinerating everyone inside.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the driver of the truck has not been found by the police
_ nor, apparently, did the truck carry license plates.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, at the funeral of his three bodyguards, Draskovic
called the government he recently served ``an empire of evil, which
allows nothing to grow in Serbia, which every day creates death,
and will itself be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the funeral on Tuesday of his brother-in-law, Veselin
Boskovic, an influential figure in the business of Belgrade city
government and in the financing of Draskovic's Serbian Renewal
Movement, Draskovic made it clear that he believes the Milosevic
regime ordered the attempt on his life.
</P>
<P>
   In ringing, poetically cadenced words during his eulogy,
Draskovic made it very difficult to return to any kind of
partnership with the ruling coalition. He said his own life was
saved by a miracle, and then he cursed the regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them be damned, those evil people, those devils, who for
the last 10 years have built their happiness only on the misery of
others, who have killed so many people, who have taken so much
blood, who have destroyed so many countries, who are producing only
hatred. For how long? How long?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question lies, to some great extent, in
Draskovic's own hands.
</P>
<P>
   He heads the largest opposition party, which controls the
Belgrade city government, and more people came to the funeral of
Boskovic than to the nightly rally in downtown Belgrade of the
Alliance for Change, dominated by a Draskovic rival, Zoran
Djindjic, of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Draskovic's virtues or vices, he is considered capable
of bringing significantly larger numbers of people out onto the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   So if the accident was an assassination attempt, though the
government has denied this, it backfired. And if it was simply an
accident _ which few ordinary Serbs, trained in Byzantine
conspiracies, any longer believe _ Milosevic may have a much harder
time keeping the country stable this winter, let alone keeping his
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who had entered the federal government in January and
remained a deputy prime minister until he was dismissed toward the
end of NATO's bombing war, is now considered a somewhat corrupt
figure, enveloped by power and fearful of losing it, dependent on
the political support of Milosevic's party in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has stayed aloof from the dwindling rallies of the
Alliance for Change, saying that they are senseless, will not bring
down Milosevic and are wasting energy. In part, he is hoping that
Djindjic will fail, but he also believes that only early, free and
fair elections will take down the Milosevic regime _ not street
protests against a government with all the instruments of power and
repression at its disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic and his party are engaged in a roundtable with other
opposition parties to settle on conditions for a free election _
which Milosevic appears in no mood to grant. And Draskovic has said
that he might call his followers on to the streets this month to
demand early elections, if the regime refuses to hold them.
</P>
<P>
   For all his new entanglements, nicer suits and better haircuts,
Draskovic is at heart a rabblerouser and street politician, and his
wife is the more radical and aggressive of the couple. And the loss
of her beloved brother _ however corrupt his own reputation may
have been _ has sent her into a paroxysm of grief and rage,
according to family friends.
</P>
<P>
   They say that both the Draskovics are so angry and talking in
such a radical fashion that aides are trying to keep them from
making political decisions so soon after the deaths of Boskovic and
the three bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   At least one local branch of the party has already reacted to
the car accident by joining the Alliance rally in the eastern
Serbian town of Bor. Some party flags were displayed at the rally
in Krusevac. The party leadership, Draskovic aides say, cannot wait
too long before giving guidance to its followers, who are eager
themselves for action.

   Changes continue with the WCW, which appears ready to break its
ties with Sturgis, S.D., for its ``Road Wild'' pay-per-view.
They're apparently not making enough money to continue having the
matches at the motorcycle rally.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF won a battle with Playboy over the use of the name Sable
and has withdrawn the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fallouts of Taz's move to the WWF is what ECW will do
for a training site for future wrestlers. Taz owns and currently
trains up-and-coming wrestlers for ECW at his facility in
Philadelphia. Chances are that ECW will continue to use the
facility. Also, Taz will be wrestling in ECW for most of the rest
of 1999 before making his switch.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura is rumored to be returning to the WWF one more
time to referee ``Wrestlemania 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Former ECW valet Kimona Wanalaya has reportedly been looking for
work from the WWF and may show up soon. The WWF is also looking to
boost its women's division with the addition of Madusa, who was
recently released by the WCW.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Michaels is expected to do a guest referee spot with FMW
in Japan with the WWF's blessings. But the WWF is also looking to
break its contract with the Heartbreak Kid, since they are paying
him wrestling money and he will probably never wrestle again after
back surgery this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the WWF injury front, Ken Shamrock had an MRI on his injured
neck. Shamrock actually broke his neck in high school and has
aggravated an old injury. A quick return to the ring is termed
``very questionable'' by WWF's Jim Ross. Also, the Undertaker is
expected to be out of the ring for at least six weeks to let a
groin tear heal. And Brian Christopher should return from his torn
ACL in the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports are that Bill Busch has saved the WCW $4 million
since taking over the reins last month. Of course, the low ratings
of ``Fall Brawl'' won't help bring any money into the WCW coffers.
Injured Scott Steiner and AWOL Scott Hall have been put on notice.
If they don't return to the ring soon, the free meal they have been
living on will be gone. Hall should return in November when he is
to reform the Outsiders with Kevin Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Fit Finley was backstage at ``Nitro'' in Atlanta recently. He
had a brace on his leg that was injured in July and is just now
regaining some feeling below his knee. He is slated for more
surgery, but his career is in jeopardy at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Twins Ron and Don Harris, a.k.a. DOA, will return to ECW after
losing their gimmick with the WWF.

   ATLANTA _ On Monday night, the World Wrestling Federation makes
its return to World Championship Wrestling's back yard for the
first time in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   WWF's live weekly show ``Raw is War'' will be broadcast from the
Georgia Dome in Atlanta, just a few miles from the WCW
headquarters, Monday night at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge is a third-generation wrestler who played on
a national championship college football team. Here comes The Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The climb to the top of the WWF has been brisk and a little
bumpy for the wrestler formerly known as Rocky Maiva. The son of
WWF star Rocky Johnson and the grandson of longtime wrestling star
High Chief Peter Maiva, Duane Johnson took a natural step when his
professional football career did not pan out. He turned to the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   ``That helped me because I was always kept very close to the
industry. Sometimes more than I should've been, getting involved in
some things that I shouldn't have been as a kid,'' Rock said. ``I
was very familar with the intricacy of the business, which made the
jump from football to wrestling a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   What wasn't easy was giving up football. Rock was a USA Today
high school All-American and signed with the most powerful college
football team at the time, the Miami Hurricanes. After four seasons
as a part-time starter, he was not drafted by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Rock signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football
League and was gone before the year was over.
</P>
<P>
   So he turned his back on football and signed a development deal
with the WWF, working for a smaller organization until he debuted
in the big-time in 1996 against the Brooklyn Brawler. When he
started with the WWF, he was Rocky Maiva _ a baby-face rising star.
</P>
<P>
   A knee injury in 1997 left him on the shelf for months, but it
also opened a door.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.R. was the first one to come to me and ask me how I felt
about turning heel,'' Rock said, referring to WWF announcer and
dealmaker Jim Ross. ``I said I loved that idea because I always
felt I was born to be that anyway. So from there, the character
kind of exploded on the scene and they gave me a lot of freedom
creatively to say things that they didn't necessarily like.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the Rock's long list of catch-phrases that separate him
from other wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Do you smell what the Rock is cooking?' came from an
interview and I said something like, `Do you smell what the Rock is
cooking,' and snap, it took off.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock's catch-phrases even led to the naming of the newest WWF
television show, ``Smackdown,'' a term the Rock regularly uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get so caught up in your life and everything is moving a
hundred miles an hour it's like being in the eye of the
hurricane,'' Rock said. ``But it's great to have a show like
`Smackdown.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, the Rock, who's on the short list of People
magazine's sexiest people of 1999, wouldn't mind being an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to one day, I've had a lot of offers but who knows,''
Rock said. ``Right now I want to do my thing in the WWF and
hopefully go down as one of if not the best ever. Who knows where
the road of life will take me, but sure I'd like to do that and
maybe someday I'll be thanking the Academy for the Oscar.''

A `WASTELAND' OF SEX, SEX AND MORE SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because we are bored and watch TV, we are eavesdropping as a
graduate student named Dawnie chats with an anthropology professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 25, actually 26 today, and profoundly lost as a human
being,'' Dawnie (Marisa Coughlan) tells him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent my entire life in school, my parents still support
me, relationships baffle me and I am acutely self-aware, to the
point where I'm clueless and slightly suicidal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you represent today's generation,'' the prof says, more as
a comment than a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   This baffled, acutely self-aware, clueless and slightly suicidal
generation happens to be in control of the tube these days. Most
television shows are made for the Dawnie demographic, and that
certainly includes ``Wasteland,'' premiering Thursday night on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasteland''? Let's scratch the ABC nomenclature and call it by
its rightful name: ``Below the Waistland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Below the Waistland'' is about sex and single, impossibly
attractive twentysomethings in big, bad, super-glam New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The show occasionally makes head feints and little jive moves to
indicate an interest in something else, but Disney is selling sex.
Buy the large size and you can come back for a free refill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Below the Waistland'' is on opposite ``Frasier,'' in the heart
of NBC's high-flying Thursday schedule. Quick, more sex.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Williamson, who has maybe lost a little zip on his
fastball, is the show's creator and producer. Williamson's vaunted
oeuvre includes ``Dawson's Creek'' on the WB. This show presumably
represents his mature period.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson packages heavy breathing about as well as anyone this
side of the skinny old master himself, Aaron Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   And look what he's given us here: Dawnie (Coughlan), a drop-dead
gorgeous virgin; Sam (Rebecca Gayheart), a drop-dead gorgeous grunt
working in the Manhattan district attorney's office; Russell (Dan
Montgomery), a drop-dead gorgeous actor and closeted homosexual;
Vandy (Eddie Mills), a drop-dead awful musician and bartender; Ty
(Brad Rowe), Dawnie's drop-dead gorgeous ex-boyfriend, and Jesse
(Sasha Alexander), a drop-kick brassy publicist who wears a cell
phone on her ear.
</P>
<P>
   Getting right to the virgin, Williamson is obviously going to
make much of this ``Below the Waistland'' freak of nature.
</P>
<P>
   The show _ the series, actually _ begins with Dawnie being hit
upon by a self-assured jerk in a bar. She gives him a look that's
maybe a teensy bit virginal, but pretty gosh-darned knowing and not
all that baffled or clueless.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, she tells him, let's get it on. Find a bedroom, forget the
preliminaries and cut straight to the copulation, and ``we should
do it fast because I do have dinner plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she informs the guy that she's a virgin and, well, he'd
better be the best ever at what he's proposing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it bluntly,'' she says, ``you better rock my world.''
</P>
<P>
   He dissolves, of course, into a puddle of flaccid anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't the case about 45 minutes later, when Lowe's Ty
wants to revive his college-years affair with Dawnie.
</P>
<P>
   At her apartment, they do a little song-and-dance routine that
involves lip-synching and pelvic thrusts. (Ah, the mating rituals
of the profoundly lost!)
</P>
<P>
   Then she's got him lying on the couch, pours wine on his bare
chest and licks it dry. (And the acutely self-aware!) Good time to
tell him she's a virgin, and she does.
</P>
<P>
   But Ty's no shrinking violator, so it's off to the bedroom.
Where they grind a bit on the bed until ... nothing happens. (And
the baffled!)
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much your first installment of ``Below the
Waistland.'' By the November sweeps, the whole cast should be
slightly suicidal.

JAPANESE AUTHORITIES TAKE ACTION AGAINST FUEL-REPROCESSING PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The police seized records Wednesday from the company
that runs the fuel-reprocessing plant where Japan's worst nuclear
accident occurred last week. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, vowing to
make his country ``once again feel secure,'' visited the site
later.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done before, Obuchi acknowledged his government's slow
response to the accident on Thursday in Tokaimura, 80 miles
northeast of Tokyo. More than 50 people were exposed to radiation
in the accident, in which workers who were violating standard
operating procedures set off a chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours before Obuchi arrived by helicopter in Tokaimura, 200
police officers raided the factory and were shown on television as
they took bundles of administrative records and other documents.
The officers wore prominent yellow radiation-detecting armbands.
</P>
<P>
   Officials told the Kyodo news agency that the government had
decided to revoke the operating license of the plant, which is run
by the JCO Co., a subsidiary of the Sumitomo Metals Mining Co. JCO
offices here were also searched.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent closing would deprive Japan of 40 percent the
uranium that it uses to fuel nuclear power plants. Officials said
companies that operated nuclear reactors would be encouraged to
reach contracts with overseas suppliers to make up for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to forcing more than 300,000 people to remain
indoors overnight and causing the removal of many others, the
accident heightened fears about the accident-prone nuclear-energy
program. Pledging new regulations, Obuchi said, ``With the measures
currently in place alone, accidents like that will not be
prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they would seek to let the government order
evacuations in nuclear accidents. The government was castigated by
local authorities, who said they were left alone in organizing the
emergency response to the crisis.

BUCHANAN STILL UNDECIDED ABOUT REFORM PARTY 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Pat Buchanan, who has been flirting with the Reform
Party for several weeks, came to where that political movement was
born this week, but said Wednesday he is still undecided whether to
seek its nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with the Republican Party through the worst crisis
of the last 30 years,'' said the former aide to Presidents Richard
Nixon and Ronald Reagan. ``That's not an easy thing to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   A failure in two previous attempts to win the Republican party's
nomination, Buchanan came to Dallas for a Tuesday night fund-raiser
and book signing Wednesday. While in Dallas, he met with Reform
Party Chairman Russell Verney to discuss a possible party switch.
</P>
<P>
   At an impromptu press conference at Borders Books, Buchanan said
Verney explained ``the bumps and hurdles'' in the road to the
party's nomination. Ross Perot, the Dallas billionaire who founded
the Reform Party and has not ruled out another run for the
presidency under its banner, did not attend the luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he will decide by the end of the month whether to
make the switch or run in the Republican primary, where Gov. George
W. Bush, with a campaign nest egg of more than $50 million, is
considered the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has urged Buchanan to stay in the Republican Party. Judging
from the crowd that surrounded Buchanan in Dallas, Bush's fears
that a strong third-party candidate would siphon more votes from
the Republicans than the Democrats appeared to be well founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick and tired of Bush and (Vice President Al) Gore
telling me what they think I want to hear,'' said Lee Pepper, who
works for a computer data company in Dallas. He described himself
as a disgruntled Republican who would follow Buchanan to the Reform
Party.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 people showed up to buy and have autographed
copies of Buchanan's book, ``A Republic, Not An Empire,'' and most
of those interviewed fell into the same category: Republicans who
could be swayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem,'' said Jim Gordon, who works for Blockbuster
Video. ``Here we are a year away from the election and George W.
Bush is already nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan appeals to him, he said, because, ``He would be
president of the United States, not the world. That pretty well
sums it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The book the Buchanan supporters came to purchase spells out the
candidate's isolationist views in ways that have led some
high-ranking Republicans, such as Arizona Sen. John McCain, also a
presidential candidate, to invite him to leave the party.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Buchanan argues that Adolf Hitler was no threat to
the United States after 1940 and had the United States and Britain
not made a commitment to Poland, ``the first great blows of
Hitler's war machine would have fallen on Stalin's empire.''
Fascism would have destroyed communism, he argues, and Americans
would have been spared World War II.
</P>
<P>
   His critics, especially Republican Party regulars, have blasted
him for those opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Buchanan was invited to speak at the North Texas Oil
and Gas Association meetings in Dallas and Wichita Falls, but the
events were canceled when no one registered in Dallas and only
eight signed up in Wichita Falls. The controversial passages in the
book offended many members of the industry group, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The book buyers in Dallas, however, were unmoved by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read it yet,'' said Fritz Schaner, ``but it sounds
like those things were taken out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read it,'' said Wes Anderson, standing in line behind
him, ``and it was taken out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan reveled in the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his reception in Dallas, he smiled and said, ``The
attention is partly because of the controversy in the book and
partly because I may switch to the Reform Party.''

TERRY HANLEY, 41; WAS DRUMMER FOR THE NEATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terry Hanley, former drummer for the Boston band the Neats, died
Monday in Colorado after a fall from his fourth-floor apartment
balcony. He was 41.
</P>
<P>
   The Neats, a new wave and later blues-based rock band, played a
prominent role in the local music scene from 1979 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hanley, who relocated to the Denver area after the band's
breakup, came to Boston from Pittsburgh with friend and guitarist
Phil Caruso. They had met while attending Kent State University and
came here to study at the Boston Architecture Center in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   That education was short-lived, however, as the Neats took off
the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just spoken to him three weeks ago, for the first time
in three years,'' Caruso said from Pittsburgh, where he lives and
works. ``He sounded great; he was happy with his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hanley, who had worked as a cook at the Rat while in Boston,
lived in Aurora, a Denver suburb, and was working for Sky Chef, an
airline food service company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something about him; people really loved him, and a
lot of people watched over him,'' Caruso said. ``He was a pro and
fun to be around. He held it together, and was smart as a whip
despite (his problems).''
</P>
<P>
   Hanley had battled alcoholism for years. At the time of his
death, the percentage of alcohol in his blood was 0.243, according
to a spokeswoman for the Arapohoe County coroner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Another former bandmate, singer-guitarist Eric Martin, said:
``When he was on, he was an incredibly sharp, and such a character.
He had a lot of pain inside, he had a lot of trouble, but he never
missed a gig.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hanley, who was divorced, leaves a son, Tom Henry.

MCCAIN URGES RIVALS TO SUPPORT CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John McCain of Arizona dared his fellow
Republican presidential contenders Wednesday to demonstrate their
commitment to campaign finance reform by supporting his bill to ban
``soft money'' from the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off a two-week stretch in which he hopes that campaign
finance, one of his signature issues, will command national
attention, McCain called the current system an ``incumbency
protection racket.'' He challenged Texas Governor George W. Bush,
in particular, to make good on his stated opposition to the use of
soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to debate the legislation next week; a
similar version passed in the House in September. Current campaign
law allows corporations, unions and individuals to contribute
unlimited amounts of cash to political parties. McCain has
sponsored the Senate bill with Senator Russell Feingold, a Democrat
from Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even half of the members of Congress who have endorsed your
candidacy were to honor your request, McCain-Feingold would pass
with votes to spare,'' McCain wrote Bush. ``I ask that you send a
letter to the Republican congressional leadership, urging them to
vote for passage of the McCain-Feingold legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Bush's presidential campaign did not immediately
respond to McCain's challenge. If Bush does not join McCain's
crusade, the senator intends to take the governor to task on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is ``one fax away from making a big difference'' in the
congressional debate over campaign reform, said McCain adviser Mike
Murphy. ``Otherwise, we will take it to New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said, ``Like
thousands of Americans who write to us, we are glad Senator McCain
has recognized Governor Bush's leadership ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said Bush has already taken the lead on the issue of
campaign finance reform by becoming the first presidential
candidate in either party to post a daily list of campaign
contributions on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not spare the Democrats in his remarks Wednesday.
``The scandal in Washington in 1996 wasn't Monica Lewinsky,'' he
said, but rather the steps that President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore took to raise money for the Democratic ticket.
``The president treated the Lincoln Bedroom like it was Motel 6 and
he was the bellhop.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain released his letter at a lunchtime appearance before the
Committee for Economic Development, a group of corporate leaders
from some of the nation's biggest companies who have declared their
opposition to soft money. McCain and Feingold hailed the business
leaders, many of whom have joined the crusade because they are
tired of being pressured for big donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call it pressure, call it extortion, call it blackmail,''
Feingold told the group. ``The soft money system is a stain on our
politics and our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold have gotten a majority of their fellow
senators to support campaign finance legislation in the past, but
have failed to get the three-fifths margin needed to stop a
filibuster by their opponents. By focusing on soft money and
calling attention to the vote, they hope to overcome that 60-vote
hurdle in the next two weeks.

HARVARD FUNDRAISING SETS RECORD $1.25M-A-DAY PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harvard University has broken all records in higher
education philanthropy, raking in $2.35 billion, or a staggering
$1.25 million a day, in its five-year fundraising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With three months still to go before the campaign officially
ends, the money raised as of Wednesday exceeds the goal Harvard set
in 1994, which in itself was the most ambitious amount ever
attempted by any university, and one even many within Harvard
doubted it could meet.
</P>
<P>
   But with the money in hand, Harvard and higher education
watchers characterized this as merely the new price of maintaining
a prestigious national university, an amount top schools will be
expected to raise if they want to stay on top -- in some ways, not
so much a record as a new norm.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford was the first to raise $1 billion in 1991, but since
then, many institutions have followed suit, with Yale raising $1.6
billion, Duke now in a $1.5 billion campaign, and Columbia
University aiming for $2.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   With the public angry over rising tuitions and the federal
government cutting back on funds to university hospitals and
research, officials say universities will have to rely more and
more on fundraising _ donations at Harvard will pay for 28 percent
of the operating budget, up from 18 percent a decade ago. Schools
have become more aggressive in their fundraising methods,
consciously going after more women, younger alumni, and donors who
did not attend the school, all of whom contributed in unprecedented
and unexpected amounts to the Harvard campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what all major universities believe they need to do, this
needs to be seen in that context,'' said President Neil L.
Rudenstine, after announcing the new record to a gathering of major
donors at the Harvard Club here. ``Given that the pace of change is
so fast, and the fields in which it is happening are so expensive,
given the needs of society and what it demands from universities
and colleges _ we're spending at unprecedented levels in higher
education. The world isn't going to stop, and the university either
has to accept the challenge or fall behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rudenstine and others were trying Wednesday to deflect
attention from the sheer amount of money, realizing that amid
public revolt over high tuitions and salaries for star faculty,
it's not necessarily a good thing for a university to be seen as so
rich. With its endowment already at $14.4 billion, Harvard is the
second-wealthiest not-for-profit in the world, behind only the
Catholic church. And it has been criticized for not spending enough
of that endowment, especially on improvements to undergraduate
education and financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Officials took pains to note that the largest amount of money
raised during the campaign _ $230 million _ is going toward
increasing financial aid to undergraduate and graduate students.
The money allowed Harvard to increase its average annual financial
aid package by $2,000 last year. The size of the average
scholarship grant _ money that does not have to be repaid _ has
increased from $11,700 to $17,200 because of money raised during
the campaign. The campaign has also allowed for loan forgiveness
programs for law students entering the public sector, and financial
aid for 70 percent of the masters degree candidates at the Graduate
School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Fundraising will also go to 90 professorships across the
university's nine schools, with 25 of those slots going toward
shrinking class sizes at Harvard College. Another $65 million has
gone to renovating undergraduate dormitories, $55 million to
renovations to Widener library, and other large gifts to a new
dining hall and student commons. An additional $150 million to $200
million will be spent on new interdisciplinary science programs for
undergraduates. And Harvard has also spent $20 million in making up
federal cuts to its teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The money spent under the new campaign also reflects the new
kinds of features students applying to college are expecting, even
demanding. When the campaign started five years ago, the university
was poorly wired for the Internet, now, every course has a Web
site, and email has become a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to just send students to the library for an
assignment, we don't do that anymore,'' Rudenstine said. ``Parents
don't expect their children to come to Harvard and use the same
equipment we had five years ago. We're just expected to be in a
state of constant renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not, officials insisted, simply the rich getting richer.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, I see responsibility, I don't see
wealth,'' said Jeremy Knowles, dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences. ``If Harvard stood still it would remain quite impressive
for some years, but it would not be long before the edges became
frayed, before the students felt that elsewhere was more desirable,
before the faculty felt there was better opportunity for
scholarship elsewhere. Standing still is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Knowles and other senior administrators said Wednesday
they recognize that the new fundraising record will likely increase
pressure to do even more on financial aid and prevent an increase
in tuition, which is still rising faster than inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The original campaign goal of $2.1 billion was six times what
Harvard had attempted to raise in previous fundraising drives. But
it was significant in several other ways, as well.
</P>
<P>
   For one, more money came from women. In the early stages of the
campaign, officials met with women in seven cities to ask why women
did not traditionally contribute to Harvard, which has had co-ed
classrooms since World War II. Two years ago, the campaign started
a women's matching fund, setting aside $15 million to match, dollar
for dollar, any donation over $25,000 from a woman. Donors matched
that money within 60 days, and then matched an additional $4
million within another month, with 231 total women contributing
more than $25,000. Overall, 29 percent of donors were women.
</P>
<P>
   Donations poured in from the West Coast for the first time, for
a total of $190 million. Alumni abroad also contributed in
unprecedented amounts, with about 50 giving gifts of more than $1
million. The campaign included 480 gifts of more than $1 million,
making up 72 percent of the total raised.

 &HT;    CAUSE OF DISASTROUS TRAIN WRECK, MAGNITUDE OF DEATH TOLL
BECOMING CLEARER: Number may climb above 70
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As investigators tried to piece together the cause of
one of Britain's worst rail tragedies, officials said Wednesday
that the death toll may rise above 70.
</P>
<P>
   Another 100 people were reported missing late Wednesday as
officials tried to determine which commuters who started out for
London Tuesday morning never made it home. Parking lots and decks
at stops on the line from in Cheltenham to London held dozens of
cars apparently left by crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   One car near the front of the London-bound Great Western train
that may have been full of passengers was a burned out shell.
Investigators found little inside it Wednesday besides ``ashes and
debris.'' The temperature in the car was estimated to reach 1,800
degrees within seconds of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The confirmed death count stood at 28 late Wednesday. Another 40
people remained in area hospitals, many of them suffering severe
burns.
</P>
<P>
   As police and forensic specialists continued to examine the
crash site, at least some clues to what may have caused the
accident began to surface. The outbound Thames train ran through a
red light and crossed into the path of the much bigger Greater
Western train, which had a green light, according to a statement
issued Wednesday by the two train operators as well as Railtrack,
the company that owns the track and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The Thames train, westbound for nearby Bedwyn, had just pulled
out of Paddington Station when the two collided. Reports indicated
both trains were traveling about 60 mph when they collided and
burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the train driver's union said the signal on the
Thames train's approach was notoriously difficult for train
operators to see. The train companies said they were studying the
signal. Trains have passed through the red light there at least
eight times since 1993, the union said.
</P>
<P>
   Thames Trains earlier said its driver had been working for two
months after completing 11 months of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   One of two data recorders from the Thames train was reported
found. However, officials said the Great Western train probably was
not equipped with the device known as a ``black box.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, a mechanical digger was demolishing a small
building near the site of the crash where authorities want to erect
a 1,000-ton crane to begin removing the mangled cars. The crane is
expected to begin its work Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a long and laborious task,'' said Deputy
Assistant Police Commissioner Andy Trotter.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the destruction was so complete, officials are
struggling to determine how many people perished in the crash.
Dental records, jewelry and other personal belongings that may have
survived the crash and fire are thought to be the only way many of
the bodies will be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they had confirmed that at least 70 people boarded
the trains. Additionally. another 100 people have been reported
missing by friends and relatives. A special telephone center at New
Scotland Yard is trying to determine how many of the missing were
aboard train.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were only just grasping the magnitude of the
accident a day after it occurred. ``Yesterday's train crash was a
terrible tragedy, the scale of which is only just becoming
apparent,'' Trotter told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A somber British Prime Minister Tony Blair seemed moved by his
visit to victims at St. Mary's Hospital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly has been the most appallingly dreadful tragedy,''
Blair said. ``I think we have to brace ourselves now for an even
higher death toll. Our hearts and our sympathies and our
condolences go out to the families of those who have died and the
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles also paid a private visit to the wards of St.
Mary's. ``These terrible occasions often bring the best out of
people and I hear wonderful stories about passengers helping other
passengers, rescuing them,'' the prince of Wales told reporters as
he left the hospital. ``I have nothing but the deepest sympathies
for them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's accident was Britain's worst rail crash since December
1988, when three trains collided outside London's Clapham Junction,
killing 35 people.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, search teams clad in white plastic coveralls
probed the charred and mangled Great Western car that had been
shrouded by tarpaulins. The burned-out car was so damaged that
officials worried they will be unable to discern the human remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing inside but ash and debris,'' said Tony
Thompson, the superintendent of the British Transport Police,
during a news conference earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Goodall, managing director of Demon Internet, was one of
the few to escape the Great Western car. Goodall told reporters
that as many as 50 passengers could have been in the car at the
moment of impact. He estimated that only five got out.
</P>
<P>
   Goodall said the train's operator was still semi-conscious but
``looking in a very bad way'' after the horrific collision. ``I
went over to him to try and get him out, but he was wedged in what
remained of the cab,'' he told Channel 4 News.
</P>
<P>
   On impact, the lights went out and the carriage seemed to catch
fire even before it stopped, he said. ``It was completely dark, it
was getting hot, although some of the windows had opened and there
was air coming in, the carriage was already full of smoke before I
was able to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ``full of sympathy'' for the families of the
dead. ``I know it was 20 minutes between my wife hearing of the
accident and hearing my voice at the end of a mobile phone,'' he
said. ``For those people who did not receive that call I have the
most extraordinary sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   The trains collided two miles from busy Paddington Station at
8:11 a.m. (local time) Tuesday sending smoke and flames into the
sky over a west London neighborhood. The accident occurred on the
same rail line as 1997 crash that killed seven, and prompted
concerns about the safety of the city's aging rail system.
</P>
<P>
   Train drivers on Wednesday threatened a possible strike unless
rail companies respond positively within seven days to demands for
a package of improved safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not tolerate any more unsafe working practices and we
will not tolerate our members, or the public, being put at risk,''
said Mick Rix, a leader or the drivers' union. ``Failure to respond
within seven days will bring the train companies into dispute with
this union.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is demanding the installation nationwide of a
fail-safe automatic train protection system as well as in-cab
radios. The sophisticated, but expensive, automatic train
protection system is fitted on only a few British lines. Its
network-wide installation could cost as much as $1.6 billion, the
primary obstacle to its construction.
</P>
<P>
   Among the flowers left on a rail bridge overlooking the scene of
the disaster was a bouquet bearing a card dedicated to one of the
engineers. It began ``For Dear Brian,'' and was signed, ``God bless
you, Gerald and Maureen.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, it read: ``Today is the saddest day of my life when my
brother was taken away from us. . . . My only wish is that he never
suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   The engineer's last name has not yet been released by the rail
company because his body has not been officially identified.

   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore's campaign chairman Tony
Coelho wired a Portuguese bank $119,000 to pay off a personal loan
connected to his controversial role in last year's world's fair,
his lawyer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho repaid the balance of the original $300,000 loan ``out of
his own personal funds,'' his attorney Stanley Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   The funds were sent after publication of a U.S. State Department
inspector general report which sharply questioned lavish spending
and improper financial arrangements made by Coelho, who served as
U.S. commissioner general at the Lisbon, Portugal, Expo '98.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the U.S. participation, Coelho had taken out a loan
from the Banco Espirito Santo to pay for a stainless steel and
blue-tile wave-shaped sculpture to commemorate
Portuguese-Americans. Coelho founded the Luso American Wave
Foundation to raise the funds to repay the loan. Donors were
promised that their names would be inscribed on the sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general report disclosed last weekend that the
loan was not yet repaid and that the government might be held
liable if it was unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   The loan has been criticized by the private watchdog group, the
Center for Public Integrity, which first announced that Coelho had
not listed the liability on his June 1998 public financial
disclosure form required for his temporary, non-paid post for the
world's fair.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's disclosure form, which indicated an income of $1.7
million, should have listed the loan if it was made by May 10 of
that year to comply with federal ethics law.
</P>
<P>
   Brand, who had earlier confirmed that Coelho owed $109,000 on
the loan, said he had been unable to obtain his client's loan
documents and could not confirm details, including the date on the
bank note. The State Department's inspector general office also
declined Wednesday to give the date, although its audit report
indicates that the bank forgave a $10,000 interest payment as of
June 23.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Center for Public Ethics said Wednesday that it
had dispatched an emissary to inspect the ``wave'' sculpture, which
is still standing in Lisbon, and the inspection revealed that no
names had been inscribed on it. An official Internet site for Expo
'98 (http://www.usexpo98.org) continues to post a notice inviting
the public to join the foundation and make donations.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has apparently gone out of business. The
toll-free number offered on the Internet has been transferred to a
photographer's office. Efforts to reach the foundation officers on
Wednesday evening were unsuccessful.

GALILEE DRIES UP; ISRAELI AGRICULTURE HIT HARD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CAPERNAUM, Israel _ On the bone-dry banks of the Galilee,
ancient stones of a harbor believed to date to the time of Jesus
have surfaced as a result of record low water levels brought on by
one of the worst droughts in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of what was an ancient fishing port may prove not
only a significant finding for historians and archeologists, but
for Israeli water experts as well. Some experts see it as proof
that the Galilee once held much less water than it does today.
</P>
<P>
   That belief was part of a calculated risk by Israeli water
commissioner Meir Ben Meir to continue pumping from the lake even
after it had receded past the ``red line'' _ a water level at which
it has long been believed the lake could begin to suffer
irreversible ecological damage. On Tuesday, the fresh-water lake
hit its lowest level since records were first kept in the early
1920s, according to Ben &UR;  &LR; Meir.
</P>
<P>
   ``No damage,'' he insisted, ``has been done to the lake so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the discovery of the ancient harbor, he added,
``These finds show that already four times during the last 2,000
years the level of the lake was lower than now. The problem is that
in hydrology the only data you have is from the past, there is no
data about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli environmentalists fear the continued siphoning of
the Galilee could lead to ecological disaster. They say the
evidence of the ancient ports is a shaky argument in favor of
lowering the water levels beyond the red line established about 30
years ago by Israel's top hydrologists and scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are beginning to take serious risks,'' said Hillel
Shuval, a professor of environmental studies at Hebrew University
of Jerusalem. ``There are salt water springs under the lake, and if
the level goes too low it could altar the salinity of the lake. The
potential is there for irreversable damage to the lake and its
ecology, so they should tread very lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has cut back dramatically on the amount of water it has
pumped from the Galilee this year. Normally, 200 million cubic
meters a year are pumped from the lake. But this year Israel has
pumped approximately 60 million cubic meters, a conservation effort
that has hit the politically powerful Israeli agricultural sector
hard.
</P>
<P>
   In a region where scarce water resources form the undercurrent
of politics, the precipitous drop of the Galilee's water line is
also straining Israeli-Jordanian relations. During the long summer
drought, Jordan protested Israel's plan to cut back on the water
quota for Jordan under the terms of the 1994 peace agreement signed
by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   In that agreement, Israel committed to supplying 50 million
cubic meters per year of the Galilee's water to Jordan. The
document made no provision for years of drought. But three months
ago Israel announced it would only pump approximately 30 million
cubic meters, citing the drought as a reason. The Jordanians are
insisting that the Israelis live up to the agreement, and at least
for now Israeli officials privately say they will do their best to
provide the remaining 20 million cubic meters of water sometime
after the rainy season replenishes the lake. But they are not
making any promises.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Hebrew-language newspaper Ha'aretz cautioned
against violating the agreement with Jordan because of the
political discord it will engender at a fragile moment in the peace
process. In an editorial, the newspaper also said the dangerously
low levels of the lake highlighted the need for a regional plan for
water conservation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But for the historians and archeologists, the drought has
produced a kind of bitter fruit, revealing new evidence of the
ancient ports.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key findings is in Capernaum on the northern shore of
the Galilee. There, on land once covered water, lay a parched plain
of cracked mud and rocks. And on this dried bank, near the holy
site where it is believed Jesus had his ministry for many years, is
an outcropping of rocks that once formed a foundation for a harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Mendel Nun, who has lived on the lake for 60 years and has
become its resident historian, revealed the findings in the August
issue of the Biblical Archaeological Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew the harbors must be there,'' Nun wrote, ``but
we had no idea we would find so many remains.''

WHEN THE COMMERCIAL THEATER MOVES IN ON NONPROFITS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ ``Martin Guerre,'' the British musical that has
returned more often than, well, Martin Guerre, finally had its
American premiere here on Sept. 29. It was the fourth opening for
the show, counting its first one in London's West End in 1996, and
a climactic night for Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg,
who first brought the idea to the producer Cameron Mackintosh a
full seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been as long as it took Martin Guerre to go to war and
come back,'' said Schonberg, who wrote the score. The show _ based
on the often-told true story of the 16th-century Frenchman who,
left for dead on the battlefield, returns home to find his identity
has been assumed by his friend and fellow soldier _ has been
streamlined, reordered and rewritten by its persistent creators.
Forty percent of the current material was not in the original,
Mackintosh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' said Boublil, co-writer of the book and lyrics.
``That's the show they get.'' The creators sounded relieved, but in
the theater world ``Martin Guerre'' has been perceived as something
of an obsession for its legendary producer. Mackintosh, who, as the
man behind the musicals ``Cats,'' ``The Phantom of the Opera,''
``Les Miserables'' and ``Miss Saigon'' (the last two written by
Boublil and Schonberg), is perhaps the world's most successful
theater producer. ``Martin Guerre'' has yet to garner the same
acclaim; it was revised and re-opened in mid-run in London, then
revamped and re-opened at the Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds.
</P>
<P>
   That version, the first to be praised by critics, is the one
Mackintosh has brought here to the venerable Guthrie Theater, one
of the nation's leading nonprofit houses, where the opening of
``Martin Guerre'' is a striking anomaly. Even though the show has
been trimmed down considerably, this is a theater that has
historically focused on classic drama on its thrust stage.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Martin Guerre,'' the Guthrie has joined the lengthening
list of nonprofit regional theaters to collaborate on expensive
productions with commercial producers. Never in its 36-year history
has the theater given its subscribers a show with the glamour and
extravagance of this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really blowing our audiences away,'' said David
Hawkanson, the Guthrie's managing director, ``is that it's like
having a 100-piece orchestra in your den.''
</P>
<P>
   But does a 100-piece orchestra belong in your den? The arrival
of ``Martin Guerre'' has further obscured the increasingly murky
distinction between nonprofit and commercial theater enterprises
and stirs, with particular vigor, the debate over whether
collaborations between the two entities are appropriate or even
desirable.
</P>
<P>
   The show is headed for Broadway in the spring, though it does
not yet have a theater, which is one reason the top officers of the
Shubert Organization and Jujamcyn Theaters, leading theater owners
in New York, made the trip out here for opening night.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the second musical Mackintosh brings to Broadway this
season: the Stephen Sondheim revue, ``Putting It Together,'' which
he has been nurturing since 1991, is to open next month at the
Ethel Barrymore Theater, starring Carol Burnett, in an incarnation
that was developed in collaboration with the Mark Taper Forum, the
nonprofit house in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over here, this seems to be my year for nonprofit theater,''
said Mackintosh, still chubbily boyish at 52, explaining that the
simultaneous arrival of the two shows is only a coincidence, and
that his partnerships with nonprofits are nothing unusual for him;
he has been working with state-subsidized theaters in England for
more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he has clung so tenaciously to ``Martin Guerre,'' he
responded with only a hint of exasperation. ``My tenacity with this
show is no different than my tenacity with any show,'' he said.
``I'll keep going until I feel there's no more to be done. It's
just that `Martin Guerre' had to be developed in the public eye.
The fact of the matter was the show I put on in London wasn't
finished. It was still a work in progress, and at every stage it
has gotten better. People forget that `The Music Man' took 12 years
to get together. `Guys and Dolls' had 10 or 12 different
librettos.''
</P>
<P>
   Though economy-size by comparison to ``Ragtime'' and ``The Lion
King,'' Broadway's current eight-figure extravaganzas, and even by
Mackintosh's own long-running hits, ``Martin Guerre,'' with a cast
of 24 and a set designed by John Napier (who landed the helicopter
onstage in ``Miss Saigon''), cost $2.1 million to stage here. That
is about two and a half times the budget of an average Guthrie
show. Mackintosh paid for just over half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Guerre,'' with Hugh Panaro in the title role, received
a mostly positive review in The Minneapolis Star-Tribune (``Though
the musical will engage the intellect only slightly, it speaks
loudly, earnestly and passionately to the heart'') and a more
skeptical one in Variety. But in any case, ticket sales have been
brisk for its seven-week run at the Guthrie, where the excitement
of a Broadway-style production has seemingly justified the
financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the argument goes, collaborations such as this one work
to the benefit of both partners. The economics of mounting a
musical for Broadway are so forbidding that for a commercial
producer, trying out a show in a nonprofit house where costs are
more modest is a way of preparing it for the make or break scrutiny
of critics in New York and audiences who will judge it with their
wallets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to be the only way to go,'' said Hal Luftig, a
producer working on a musical version of the film ``Thoroughly
Modern Millie.'' ``We're going to try and do what Cameron is doing,
start it in a regional house.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the resources a commercial producer can
provide for a nonprofit enable the theater to put on a more
elaborate production, giving its local audience a taste of opulent
show business that the theater could otherwise not afford. And
bigger, it need be said, does sometimes mean better.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the participating theater generally shares in
profits gleaned by the show after it moves on, a powerful
inducement for institutions that are perennially scratching for
funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade or so, the new musicals ``Big River'' and
``The Who's Tommy'' and the revival of ``How to Succeed in Business
Without Really Trying'' all had successful premieres at the La
Jolla Playhouse in California, partly financed by commercial
producers, before their turns on Broadway. The new musical ``Jane
Eyre'' recently completed its run there, selling out 62
performances, and its producers are currently seeking additional
financing _ and a theater _ to open it in New York.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, such collaborations strike many as
antithetical _ or at least threatening _ to the very nature of
regional nonprofit theater, a movement that took hold nationally in
the 1950s and 1960s largely as a revolt against the commercially
driven enterprise that American theater art, as exemplified by
Broadway, had become. (The Guthrie, founded by the director Tyrone
Guthrie in 1963, was among the movement's seminal institutions.)
</P>
<P>
   These days, few in the theater object to collaborations on
principle (current economics make it difficult to support such
rigid church-and-state separation), but the issue remains one of
control. When a commercial producer with an eye on profit-making
contributes to a production in a nonprofit house, who is making the
artistic decisions? Whose interests are a priority? The theater,
which is devoted to its local audience and which has a history and
an artistic vision to uphold? Or the commercial producer, whose
main concern is generating momentum for a long run elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you get somebody else calling the shots about how
the work evolves, somebody with an eye on the brass ring, you've
molested the enterprise,'' said Zelda Fichandler, the founding
director of Arena Stage in Washington and its artistic director
from 1950 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Control is always a difficult proposition to sort out, made more
complicated recently as commercial partners have escalated their
financial involvement. Five years ago, Lincoln Center Theater put
on a revival of ``Carousel'' with Mackintosh; last year it staged
the new musical ``Parade,'' with Livent, the Canadian company then
being run by Garth Drabinsky, Mackintosh's equal in showmanship if
not financial acumen. (Livent went bankrupt just before the opening
of ``Parade,'' embroiling Drabinsky in allegations of fiscal
misdeeds. ``Carousel'' was originally at the Royal National Theater
in London, a nonprofit theater; Mackintosh maintained the
commercial rights.)
</P>
<P>
   Both shows were produced at Lincoln Center for about $5 million
apiece, and the collaborators split the costs. Contractually, in
both cases, said Bernard Gersten, the theater's executive producer,
``we were in control of the production.'' But in both cases, the
directors (Nicholas Hytner and Harold Prince, respectively) were
chosen and the productions designed and developed by the commercial
partner. None of those involved are known as shrinking violets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's in control on paper is clear and who's in control in
fact is not so clear,'' Gersten said. ``That's when the 400-pound
gorillas come into play.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Disney company opened its new musical,
``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida,'' at the Alliance Theater
Company in Atlanta, Alliance's artistic director, Kenny Leon, in
two separate interviews with The New York Times, said, first, that
he had no influence over the production, and then that he did.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the actual case, the initial production was a critical
failure but, for Alliance, a financial success, and it maintains a
share of the show, which, in a revised incarnation (it is now
called simply ``Aida''), is scheduled to open at a commercial
theater in Chicago in December, before moving to Broadway in
February.
</P>
<P>
   For years, commercial theater and nonprofit theater existed in
entirely separate orbits. That began to change in 1967, when Arena
Stage in Washington put on ``The Great White Hope'' and the
producer Herman Levin bought the rights from the playwright Howard
Sackler and moved the production _ its stars James Earl Jones and
Jane Alexander included _ to Broadway the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed the American theater because it changed the flow of
material,'' said Ms. Fichandler, who now heads the graduate acting
department at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. ``Up
until that time,'' she said of regional theaters, ``we were little
outposts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fichandler said, it was such a new and startling development
that she neglected to maintain any rights to the show, the largest
the Arena had ever put on up to that point. As a result, Arena lost
money on its own production and received nothing from the show's
long run on Broadway. In retrospect, she said, she was terribly
naive. ``My focus was so on the thing itself that I hadn't attended
to the theater properly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the move of ``The Great White Hope,'' the New York
Shakespeare Festival accepted $50,000 from the producer Michael
Butler and moved its production of ``Hair'' to a disco near Times
Square; Butler subsequently moved the show to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the Shakespeare Festival entered the commercial arena
on its own, moving its musical version of ``Two Gentlemen of
Verona'' from Central Park to the St. James Theater on Broadway.
Most famously, the festival produced ``A Chorus Line,'' whose
15-year Broadway run, ending in 1990, poured a nearly $39 million
bounty into the theater's coffers, supporting less commercially
viable works on its downtown stages for years and providing a
pot-of-gold model for nonprofit theaters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   A recent example, ``The Civil War,'' the Frank Wildhorn musical
that flopped on Broadway last season, was developed by the Alley
Theater in Houston (with financial help from Pace Theatricals, the
tour-organizing company). Productions of the show in New York and
on the road were already part of the plan during development.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, several varieties of theatrical
partnerships have evolved; commercial producers keep close tabs on
work being developed in regional theaters (as they do on shows in
London), with an eye toward moving them. In recent years, such
Tony-winning plays as ``Angels in America,'' ``The Kentucky Cycle''
and ``Death of a Salesman'' were developed in one or more regional
theaters before producers attempted to mount them commercially.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most rewarding way, and the most creative,'' said
Gordon Davidson, the artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum in
Los Angeles, which helped develop ``Angels in America'' and ``The
Kentucky Cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   But that has rarely happened with musicals because they are
often too expensive for regional theaters to develop on their own.
Musicals have also grown too expensive for commercial producers to
finance alone; the old system of getting a show on its feet in
Boston or New Haven in a pre-Broadway run has almost entirely
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the most common strategy today makes use of what is
known as ``enhancement money''; that is, a commercial producer
helps finance a musical in a regional house in exchange for the
rights to produce it when the local run is complete.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of influence exerted by the commercial partner over
the theater's production is, at that point, up for grabs. Or, put
more kindly, a matter for the partnership to work out. ``It's not
the dollar amount of the enhancement that determines the policies
behind doing these productions,'' said Terrence Dwyer, the managing
director of the La Jolla Playhouse, who said the enhancement money
the theater had received ranged between $400,000 and $1 million,
but was never more than half of a show's total cost. ``Whether it's
$50 or $2 million is irrelevant. The key thing is, are
not-for-profits doing these things for the right reasons? Do they
serve your audience and your mission? And do you maintain the
character and the integrity of the institution during the
process?''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Martin Guerre,'' both Mackintosh and the
theater's artistic director, Joe Dowling, say the show and the
theater are a good match. The Guthrie, which has an auditorium
seating 1,300 and about 30,000 subscribers, is on the verge of a
capital campaign for a new building that would house three
different auditoriums and allow the theater to expand its mandate
by developing new works and engaging more frequently in
co-productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been expanding our programming the last two or three
years,'' said Dowling, the former head of the Abbey Theater in
Dublin who took over in 1996 from the Guthrie's previous artistic
director Garland Wright, who died last year. ``I've been accused of
being populist, and I say, `Guilty as charged.' But no one's going
to tell me that Cameron lacks esthetic values, and the notion that
we're selling out to commerce is a faulty one. If Boublil and
Schonberg had offered me their new musical, would I have taken it?
Of course. Could we have afforded it on our own? No.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the entire story. At the show's last major
opening in England, at the Yorkshire Playhouse, a nonprofit theater
in Leeds (``If there's a British equivalent to the Guthrie, that's
it,'' Dowling said), critics admired it as a triumphant turnaround
from the show that many had judged bloated and confusing in London.
Trimmed down, rewritten, its story clarified and songs replaced, it
had also been completely restaged by two young Irishmen, Conall
Morrison, the director, and David Bolger, the choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling had worked with Morrison in Dublin. ``When I heard
Cameron was going to do another `Martin Guerre' with those two
guys, I was very excited,'' Dowling said. ``I immediately called
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackintosh said he was attracted to the Guthrie because of its
resemblance to the theater in Leeds and because he felt the
Minneapolis audience would be appreciative; the Guthrie, after all,
he said, attracts theatergoers from hundreds of miles around. And
though staging the show in a nonprofit house keeps costs down (by
union contract, actors are paid less in nonprofit houses than in
commercial ones), it isn't exactly a money-saving venture for him.
</P>
<P>
   Before Broadway, the show will be moving from Minneapolis to
engagements in Detroit, Washington, Seattle and Los Angeles, and it
will have to be restaged, at a cost of some $2 million, Mackintosh
estimated, for the proscenium houses there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe really wanted to do this,'' Mackintosh said. ``Even before
he saw it. He smelled it would be good for his theater. It's a
cousin of `The Crucible,' a cousin of Shakespeare. And it has the
added bonus of a really terrific score. Why shouldn't it be on a
stage like this?''
</P>
<P>
   The most complicated hardware for the set _ which includes a
steel wall resembling wood that seems, at one point, to be consumed
by fire _ and the Broadway-style lighting and sound machinery were
brought over from England. The Guthrie made the costumes and the
props and participated in casting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some tensions,'' Dowling said, ``in terms of
what we can afford. Their natural instinct is to add people and
ours is to cut them. They think of the long-term life of the work
and we're focused on the next seven weeks. There's a difference in
culture there. But there's been no difference in how we approach
the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Mackintosh added, the issue over whether such
collaborations are appropriate is an artificial and particularly
American one. ``I just think there's so little good material out
there anyway,'' he said, ``that the best people, in whatever
sphere, have to get together to put on a show in the best possible
circumstances.''

 &HT;    Oil measurements debated at Koch trial
 &HT;    By Fred Cohen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ Both sides expressed optimism Wednesday as
testimony continued in U.S. District Court in William Koch's
multimillion dollar case against the giant oil company run by two
of his brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Koch alleges Wichita, Kan.-based Koch Industries systematically
shortchanged the federal government and Indian tribes of royalties
by failing to pay for all the oil it bought from producers with
leases on their land.
</P>
<P>
   William, the only Koch brother at the trial, said Wednesday
morning he thought the case was going ``exceptionally well'' and
that the company's own documents were the strongest evidence
against it.
</P>
<P>
   The company, in a written statement, said, ``We categorically
deny that the thousands of people who measured oil for Koch were
involved in a scheme to steal oil. The fact is that our record of
measurement accuracy was very good _ within fractions of a percent
_ and our customers chose us, over and over, despite the many other
options open to them and even after Bill (William) Koch first began
making these claims 11 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early stages of a trial now expected to last eight to 12
weeks, the six jurors and two alternates have heard several former
Koch employees say they routinely put down altered measurements on
paperwork from which producers were paid.
</P>
<P>
   Continuation of the testimony of Jack Crossen took up most of
the morning. Company lawyers showed him _ and the jury _ numerous
``run tickets'' that he had not altered in ways he had said he
routinely did. Run tickets are the paperwork showing the
measurements used in calculating the amount of oil in a tank.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for William Koch then introduced other run tickets that
had been altered according to what Crossen had said was his
standard procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Two other former ``gaugers'' _ workers who take the measurements
of oil in a tank for the buyer _ also said they routinely altered
run tickets for Koch Industries. But their testimony was not
entirely favorable to William Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Although Koch has alleged that the policy of cheating sellers
was known at all levels of the company, two former gaugers for Koch
Industries said they were told to alter measurements by other
gaugers. In some cases, the specific instructions were
inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Both former employees said they were unaware of any written
company policy and neither had received any formal training from
the company on how to conduct and record measurements during the
time in question.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, both of the other witnesses said they had
worked as gaugers for other oil companies, which did not require
them to record adjusted measurements on their run slips. Koch
Industries says it is sometimes necessary to adjust for variables
to avoid paying for more oil than it receives.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by Koch Industries lawyer Mark Grossman
of Tulsa, Crossen said he sometimes bought oil kept in tanks with
excessive sediment or other problems to accommodate producers and
prevent them from selling their oil to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you write down measurements exactly as you observe them (in
such cases), Koch is going to lose, aren't they?'' Grossman asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could, yes,'' Crossen replied.
</P>
<P>
   William Koch, who brought the case on behalf of the United
States of America under a whistle-blower law, denied he is out to
ruin Koch Industries. He has sued the company numerous times since
he was fired after trying to take over its leadership from his
brother Charles in 1980. William Koch's twin brother David of Palm
Beach and New York is the company's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of history behind this case and the parties
involved,'' the company's statement said, ``but it's now up to a
court and a jury to evaluate the facts here. And when that's said
and done, we're confident our integrity will be affirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   William Koch called company executives ``crooks,'' but said the
litigation ``is a small part of my life.'' With a younger wife, six
children and his own business, he said, ``I've got my hands full in
Palm Beach.''

HOUSE OKS HEALTH INSURANCE TAX-BREAK MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House, opening a fractious debate over the
future of the nation's health care system, Wednesday passed a
measure Republican leaders said would expand access to medical
coverage for 44 million uninsured individuals. President Clinton
denounced the bill as part of an ``11th-hour gimmick'' to kill
patients' rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a massive lobbying and advertising blitz, the House voted
227-205 to provide $48 billion over 10 years in new
health-insurance tax breaks for several categories of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The action came on the eve of Thursday's scheduled vote on a
sweeping patients' rights bill that would broadly expand
regulations on health maintenance organizations and grant patients
the new right to sue their providers for damages resulting from
poor care or denied treatment.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, under fire for opposing the patients' rights
measure, said the tax breaks would make medical coverage more
affordable and accessible without driving up costs by increasing
patients' rights to sue their providers.
</P>
<P>
   With polls ranking health care as a top concern among voters,
both parties scrambled for the high ground in the volatile buildup
to Thursday's showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans want to spend more time in ambulances and less time
with ambulance chasers,'' said Representative Bill Archer, a Texas
Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
on the House floor. ``And they want to spend more time in front of
doctors and not in front of judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, backed by a bipartisan group of House members pressing
for the broader patients' rights bill, said the tax-break measure
was part of an effort by GOP leaders and insurance lobbyists to
devise ``some procedural way to tie everything up in knots'' and
kill the patients' rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules crafted by Republican leaders, the patients' rights
bill, if it passes Thursday, would be appended to the tax-break
measure. The package then would be used by House negotiators in a
conference with the Senate to produce final legislation to send to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the tax-break bill proposes no offsets for its $48 billion
cost, which, critics said, would prompt the Senate to reject the
entire package out of fear they would need to pay for the breaks
with Social Security funds. The Senate has passed a version of the
patients' rights bill that would give consumers the right to sue if
they are covered by federal programs but not HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a travesty,'' Clinton said of the House action. ``It's
the sort of thing they did to kill common-sense gun legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the lack of offsets in the tax-break bill could drain
support from Democrats for the patients' rights bill, seriously
jeopardizing its chances of passing the House.
</P>
<P>
   Under the GOP-sponsored rules, the patients' rights measure also
would die if any of three less sweeping substitute measures
receives more support in preliminary votes Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The votes are not going to be there to pass this,'' warned
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House
Democratic leader, of the patients' rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP tax-break measure would provide full deductions for
taxpayers who pay more than 50 percent of their health insurance
and long-term care premiums. The self-employed would receive full
deductions for health insurance in 2001, two years earlier than
current law allows. And individuals who care for elderly family
members in their homes would receive an additional exemption of
$2,750.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the proposal would expand medical savings accounts
and permit small businesses to buy health insurance under federal
rules rather than state regulations. Large businesses already are
permitted to avoid the state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats, citing a Joint Tax Committee study requested by
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, also said the $48 billion measure would
add only 160,000 families to the ranks of the insured, at an
average annual cost of $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to talk about wasting money, trust the Republicans to
do it,'' said Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat and
senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Stark and others also argued that the proposed tax breaks would
favor ``the wealthy and the healthy'' at the expense of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders disputed the assertions and said the bill
would achieve its purpose of broadening access to health care in an
era when the number of uninsured continues to grow despite a
booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody says that is unfair, then they have a warped sense
of what's fair in this country,'' said Representative Porter J.
Goss, a Florida Republican who is a senor member of the House Rules
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Only five Republicans opposed the measure Wednesday, including
two physicians who played key roles in pressuring GOP leaders to
permit a vote on the patients' rights bill: Representatives Charlie
Norwood of Georgia and Greg Ganske of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Every New England Republican voted for the tax-break measure, as
did all but one Democrat from the region: Representative James H.
Maloney of Connecticut. In all, 11 Democrats voted for the
GOP-sponsored measure.

CLINTON APPEARS ABOUT TO LOSE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a feverish campaign by the White House, a
global nuclear test-ban treaty appears doomed, depriving President
Clinton of a critical success on a foreign policy issue he had
hoped would highlight his presidential legacy.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Wednesday whether the treaty would go down with a
bang _ meaning the Senate would vote it down on the floor next week
_ or a whimper, with the Senate agreeing to delay the vote on the
condition Clinton not raise it again before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, both opponents and backers of the test ban agree,
the president has almost certainly lost the fight to ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a document he called ``the
longest-sought, hardest fought prize in arms control history'' when
he picked up a pen used by President John F. Kennedy and signed the
treaty three years ago at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes him look weak to the rest of the world. It makes him
look like he is not really in charge of US foreign policy,'' said
Lawrence Korb, a former Reagan administration official who is now a
scholar with the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important for Clinton's foreign policy legacy that
he gets the test ban treaty passed,'' said Douglas Brinkley, a
professor of history and director of the Eisenhower Center at the
University of New Orleans. The failure to get the 67 Senate votes
needed to ratify the treaty ``really shows he is a complete
lame-duck president,'' Brinkley said.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, which would ban underground and above-ground nuclear
wepoans testing, would not damage the United States strategically,
supporters say, since the nation already operates under a voluntary
1992 moritorium on testing.
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopes that US ratification of the treaty would
encourage other nations to sign it. But failing to OK the document
would deprive the United States of moral authority to complain if
other countries conduct nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have something of a no-man's land,'' Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen, the only Republican cabinet member,
told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the treaty worry that current technology is not
sophisticated enough to monitor other nations' compliance with the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But a substantial part of the fight against the treaty is
political, Democrats on Capitol Hill say, because Senate
Republicans are determined to deprive the president of any foreign
policy success in his final months in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Republicans just want to embarrass Clinton,''
Brinkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republicans, ``some of them have legitimate kinds of
concerns, but others would deny the president a success on the
agreement,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a member of the Armed
Services Committee. Kennedy and Senator John F. Kerry, both
Democrats, back the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   A defeat on the Senate floor would be especially dramatic,
marking the first time a foreign policy treaty was killed since the
League of Nations was voted down during the Woodrow Wilson
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders, whom the White House accused of
rushing the vote to the floor, suggested they would cancel the
vote, but only if Clinton promised not to bring it up again during
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, wisdom dictates that we pull back and give this
more careful scrutiny,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island
Democrat who supports the treaty. ``We're now looking for a
face-saving solution. It's intensely partisan. . . . The
Republicans' hope is to deny the president any kind of credible
success on issues important to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Senate majority leader Trent Lott, John
Czwartacki, said, ``The president has been looking for a way out.
There's an easy way, and a hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were not willing to budge on the demand that
Clinton pass the issue on to the next president, Czwartacki said,
but Senate Democrats were still hopeful they could convince the GOP
to hold a vote next year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House continued its aggressive lobbying campaign.
Cohen called Republican senators at home, and Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright put in a call to wavering Senator Olympia
Snowe, Republican of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hosted a dinner for on-the-fence senators at the White
House Tuesday night, and gathered prominent scientists there to
argue the treaty's merits.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton indicated he would be willing to accept some delay in
the vote but vowed to continue fighting for ratification if the
vote goes ahead as scheduled, next Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two long years of inaction, one week is very little time
for considered action,'' Clinton told reporters in the Rose Garden,
referring to the two years the treaty has been languishing in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jesse Helms,
Republican of North Carolina, said, ``We're ready to vote'' and
insisted Clinton not be given extra time to lobby for ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are ``trying to dictate the terms of their own
surrender,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   A delay until the next administration would still be a loss for
Clinton. With post-impeachment animosity still strong between the
White House and congressional Republicans, it is not likely,
political analysts say, that Clinton will be able to make his mark
with a domestic policy initiative.
</P>
<P>
   A failure to pass the treaty ``sort of puts the period at the
end of the foreign policy sentence of Clinton's history,'' said Dan
Doure, deputy director of political and military studies at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a few foreign policy successes, Doure said, ``It's been
a dramatic failure.''

NFL OWNERS SING PRAISES OF NEW HOUSTON OWNER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN McCLAIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After voting 29-0-2 to award the 32nd franchise to
Houston, NFL owners talked about how impressed they were with the
$700 million expansion fee, the solid financial plan for what will
be the league's only retractable-roof stadium, the $195 million in
public money, and the combined efforts of the city's political and
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But every owner agreed that the most impressive thing about
Houston's expansion bid was owner Bob McNair, who showed remarkable
patience and perseverance during a process that was often
frustrating and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you how I feel about Bob,'' said Dallas Cowboys
owner Jerry Jones, who lobbied hard to get the expansion franchise
for Houston. ``I would have carried him piggyback across the desert
to have him as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd have gone another way, I don't think it would have
been very smart. Bob's got the potential to be one of our best
owners in a city where we had to be.``
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and St. Louis abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who considered buying the Miami Dolphins and Minnesota
Vikings and looked into failed expansion bids in St. Louis and
Baltimore, spent the last 2 1/2 years trying to get a team for
Houston to replace the Oilers. The owners liked his low-key style,
his deep pockets and the way he played their game while the Los
Angeles situation played out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been in this league, I haven't seen anyone who
worked the room better than Bob, and I'm not just talking about
today,'' Jones said. ``Whenever he would appear at a league
functions or a league meeting, he would always give (owners) a
comfortable feeling about him.
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay called
McNair and praised his efforts to win the expansion team for
Houston. Irsay said McNair could count on his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just picking a city _ we're picking a partner,''
Irsay said. ``I've been impressed with Bob, and I'm glad he got the
team. He respects what the NFL was built on and what's made us the
most successful sports league. And that means a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You worry about some owners coming into the league thinking
they're going to change the landscape. But we should want people
with vision and creativity, people who respect the virtues we got
from our founding fathers. Bob's that kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing I like about Bob is that he's a sportsman first
and a businessman second.``
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota owner Red McCombs, who resides in San Antonio,
promised to support McNair and Houston weeks ago. McCombs has the
worst lease in the NFL and wants a new stadium. The Twin Cities
media has speculated for months that if he doesn't get a new
stadium McCombs would move to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McCombs' only legitimate threat would be to move to San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob's an excellent choice, and all of Texas is excited to have
a team back in Houston, which is one of the great football
markets,'' McCombs said. ``Speaking for the Vikings, we're
delighted to have the expansion issue over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it ($700 million expansion fee) really played
any role. We had a long time to study the proposals, and we
understood the issues. There were no questions left as far as
Houston is concerned.``
</P>
<P>
   Oakland owner Al Davis has been coming to Houston since the
Oilers' inaugural season of 1960, the same year McNair moved to
Houston. Davis was an assistant coach on Sid Gillman's Los Angeles
Chargers staff. The Oilers beat the Chargers in the first two AFL
championship games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got so many fond memories of Houston,'' Davis said. Davis
was voted commissioner of the AFL in Houston. Two of his greatest
players, quarterback/kicker George Blanda and running back Billy
Cannon, began their careers with the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real happy for Houston,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh owner Dan Rooney, whose father, Art Rooney, founded
the Steelers, knows more about Houston fans than any of his
partners. Since the late 1970s, the Oilers considered the Steelers
their No. 1 rival. Rooney witnessed more sold-out crowds in the
Astrodome than any owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great for Houston and the league,'' Rooney said.
``We're (Steelers) excited about it. We had some of our greatest
games against the Oilers. We both had tremendous teams in the late
'70s, and we were two of the best teams in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who'll ever forget that AFC Championship Game (after the 1979
season)? I think it was one of the greatest games of all time. You
guys in Houston still believe he (Mike Renfro) made the catch,
don't you?``
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans owner Tom Benson, a member of the expansion
committee that voted 14-0 to recommend Houston to the rest of the
owners, has studied Houston's proposal carefully.
</P>
<P>
   I pushed hard for this recommendation and have always believed
that Houston is not only good for the NFL but also good for the New
Orleans Saints as it strengthens our region in the South,'' Benson
said. ``Houston has brought to the table not only a great owner in
Robert McNair, but a serious commitment from the city as well as
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Houston ownership group will spend in excess of $850
million to get this franchise off of the ground. The city and state
will outlay nearly $900 million in public funding, infrastructure,
land, a new light rail system and exhibit hall. That breathtaking
number is an acknowledgment by government leaders of the positive
energy and economic impact generated by a hometown NFL club.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an ownership group comes together with local and state
government to the tune of $1.75 billion to bring the NFL to a city,
it demonstrates the many positives of having an NFL team in your
city.``
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt was a co-founder of the AFL
with Bud Adams. Hunt is a Dallas resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great for Houston and the state of Texas,'' Hunt said.
``Texas is the second-biggest state in terms of population, and it
deserves to have more than one team. I'm so pleased that we've got
Bob McNair. He's worked so hard. He's a good person and an
accomplished businessman.``
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen has been a McNair fan for more
than a year, but he also pushed hard to help Los Angeles get the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob's going to be a great owner,'' Bowlen said. ``Looking at
the economics of Houston's situation, where they stood as far as
their stadium and what they were willing to pay, you didn't have
that in Los Angeles. I feel bad for Los Angeles because a lot of
people worked hard to put a team there, but I'm sure happy about
Houston.``

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, countries in northern Europe and
North America have been enacting regulations to reduce smokestack
emissions of sulfur in an effort to curb acid rain and its harmful
effect on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In what researchers say is the first comprehensive look at the
effect of those reductions on rivers and lakes, an international
team of scientists plans to report on Thursday that they have found
a nearly universal decrease on both continents in the levels of
sulfates _ the major acidifying pollutant deposited by acid rain in
surface water.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reductions in sulfates, however, the researchers did
not see a decrease in overall acidity, the sign of true recovery,
in all regions. In Europe and in one region of North America that
includes Quebec and Vermont, researchers did see the expected trend
toward decreasing levels of acidity. In four regions in North
America from Maine to the Midwest, however, they did not.
</P>
<P>
   The message for policy makers, scientists said, is that the path
to recovery from acid rain is not going to be as simple or as quick
as scientists had thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that we reduced sulfate deposition and acid
rain,'' said Dr. Gary Lovett, an ecologist at the Institute of
Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y., praising the quality of the
study, which is being published in Thursday's edition of the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sobering news that this hasn't given us the recovery that
we might have hoped for,'' Lovett said. ``It's going to promote
rethinking of our acid rain policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Schindler, a freshwater ecologist at the University of
Alberta in Edmonton, called the list of authors of the study a
``who's who in acid rain research.'' He said the research ``clearly
indicates that if we want sufficient recovery from a wide variety
of lakes to support fisheries, we're going to have to take another
pretty large cut'' out of sulfur dioxides, the sulfur emissions
caused by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas that produce
acidifying sulfates.
</P>
<P>
   But other researchers said it was still unclear whether recovery
would indeed require further reductions in emissions or simply more
time, or both. The researchers who were interviewed agreed,
however, that any further decreases in emissions would speed
eventual recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bailey, vice president of environment at the Edison
Electric Institute in Washington, which represents electric
utilities _ a major producer of sulfur emissions _ viewed the
results more optimistically and noted that the Clean Air Act
required further reductions in emissions beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme appears to be that things are getting better,''
Bailey said, ``and things are going to continue to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, researchers studying the effect of acid rain on
lakes and rivers had confined their studies to more limited
geographic areas, coming up with what were often conflicting and
confusing results as to how surface waters were responding in
general.
</P>
<P>
   In what researchers say is the broadest geographic study to
date, 23 scientists compared data from about 200 sites across
northern Europe and North America. The data were gathered by the
International Cooperative Program on Assessment and Monitoring of
Acidification of Rivers and Lakes, a system of regular monitoring
carried out by national agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of little dots,'' said Dr. Michael
Oppenheimer, chief scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund.
``They've connected them all up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, researchers reported that the reason many
regions in North America were not recovering despite declines in
sulfates was that important compounds known as base cations _
substances like calcium and magnesium, which counteract the
acidifying effects of sulfates _ were also declining.
</P>
<P>
   Any gains to lakes in sulfate declines, the researchers said,
were overwhelmed by an accompanying rapid decline in base cations,
leading to an overall lack of change in acidity in these lakes and
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say it is still not known why base cations are in
short supply and how quickly they will be replenished. But
researchers suspect that the decline is a result of years of acid
rain leaching these compounds out of the soil at a faster rate than
they are replaced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A major source of base cations is the breakdown of rocks in
soil. The researchers note that three of the regions in North
America where recovery was expected but not seen and where there
were large decreases in base cations _ south-central Ontario,
midwestern North America and the Adirondack and Catskill mountains
in upstate New York _ are close to significant sources of sulfur
emissions and acid rain, which could have exacerbated the losses of
these crucial compounds over the years. Researchers also say
climate may affect levels of base cations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as simple as turn something off, get something else
to happen,'' said Dr. Steve Kahl, director of the Water Research
Institute at the University of Maine in Orono and an author on the
report. ``This is an overwhelming conclusion. We can't just make a
policy implementation and walk away and assume that we've fixed the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say little is known about what, if any, biological
recovery has occurred. Testing water chemistry, they note, is much
simpler and faster than accounting for changes in the presence or
number of many different kinds of animals and plants. But the
scientists who were interviewed agreed that biological recovery
would be much longer in coming.
</P>
<P>
   Schindler said that in experimentally acidified lakes in which
plants, fish, crustaceans and other life had disappeared, some
species returned within days when the lakes were later allowed to
recover, while others still have not returned after more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been creating acid rain for a long time,'' Lovett said.
``It may take a long time to recover from its effects.''

   ANGRY PRESIDENT BLASTS HOUSE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   By Bob Deans
</P>
<P>
   Cox Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Political squabbling between the White House and
Capitol Hill erupted into open hostility Wednesday, when an angry
President Clinton accused House Republicans of selling out to the
powerful health insurance industry to try to kill proposed consumer
protections.
</P>
<P>
   After accusing Senate Republicans of playing politics with
national security policy and discriminating against minority
judicial appointments _ charges he reiterated on Wednesday _
Clinton turned his furor toward the Republican leadership in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   He said his House foes cooked up a legislative scheme ``in the
dead of the night'' Tuesday to tack on rules and amendments
amounting to ``poison pills'' that ``practically guarantee'' the
defeat of a bill that Clinton contends would strengthen consumers
in their dealing with large health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a travesty,'' Clinton told reporters, charging that
the Republican leadership in the House had ``blatantly put special
interests ahead of the interests of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke as though the White House had given up on the
prospects for passage of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was supposed to be the day the American people have long
waited for, the day a bipartisan majority passed a strong patients'
bill of rights,'' said Clinton. ``But, unfortunately, as a result
of an 11th hour appeal by the insurance industry lobbyists, which
all of you reported on yesterday, once again it appears that the
will of the American people will be thwarted.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, was even more blunt,
suggesting that insurance lobbists had influenced House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Il., by each contributing $1,000 to his political
action committee at a breakfast Tuesday morning on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sat down over bacon and eggs and they hatched a plan to
make sure that the majority of Americans were thwarted in their
belief that they should have more rights in dealing with their
HMOs,'' said Lockhart, referring to health care plans offered by
health maintainence organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was suggesting that Hastert, was bought off at
the breakfast, Lockhart replied: ``I'm suggesting that it was
probably a pretty productive meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has denied that the donations affected his decision to
oppose the proposals, contained in legislation sponsored by Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., and Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga. The House is
scheduled to vote on the measure today.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's broadside marked a sharp escalation in what has been
an increasingly contentious season for Clinton and the
Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats and Republicans have
accused each other of political posturing on issues to position
themselves for the presidential and Congressional elections next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several weeks, Clinton has vetoed the Republicans'
$792 billion tax cut plan and haggled publicly over Congressional
spending proposals on programs ranging from education to health
care.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Clinton launched a full-court press to try to counter
Republican opposition in the Senate to the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, which would ban the testing of nuclear weapons in the
United States and 153 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday he railed against the Senate for quashing his
nomination of Ronnie White to the federal district court in
Missouri. The Senate's Republican majority rejected White, the
first African-American to sit of the Missouri Supreme Court, in a
straight party-line vote, 54-45, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing White House reporters in the Rose Garden, Clinton
called White's defeat, ``a disgraceful act of partisan politics.''
The move, said Clinton, ``is adding credence to the perceptions
that they treat minority and women judicial nominees unfairly and
unequally.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans claimed that White had shown insufficient support
for the death penalty during his career, a charge the White House
went to pains to refute.
</P>
<P>
   The White House press office put out a statement saying that, as
a justice on the Missouri State Supreme Court, White had affirmed
the imposition of the death penalty in ``almost 70 percent of the
cases that came before him,'' and that he acted in unanimity with
the rest of the court in 10 of the 18 instances in which he voted
against imposing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton still trying to persuade Senate Republicans to back
the nuclear test ban treaty _ he held an East Room event Wednesday
to appeal again for its ratification _ and many of the spending
bills for the fiscal year that began last Friday still being
negotiated, the air of mounting discord between the White House and
Capitol Hill bodes poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart insisted that Clinton stands ready to deal with his
Republican antagonists, but he made no effort to sugarcoat the
animosity that broke out into the open on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Said Lockhart, ``The president is upset.''

 &HT;    Joint account latest duel item in Gingrich divorce
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As promised, Newt Gingrich kept the pressure on his
estranged wife Wednesday by asking a judge to force her to turn
over money he says she's hoarding.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich asked
a judge to give his wife Marianne 14 days to transfer the money to
a joint account the couple agreed to set up last month until their
divorce is final. The motion threatens a contempt action if
Marianne Gingrich continues to stall.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said Marianne Gingrich still
owes the joint account tens of thousands of dollars, by his
estimation. So far she has deposited only several thousand, Evans
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who has signed a sworn statement saying his wife
controls most of their money, has turned over about $35,000 he has
been paid for sitting on several boards.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, could not be reached
for comment Wednesday, but he has previously denied the
allegations. The CPA managing the account for the Gingriches said
both sides have acted in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's motion was among several filed by Gingrich this week
in an effort to take the offensive against his wife, who has
aggressively sought to question him about personal and financial
matters outside their marriage. Marianne Gingrich also wants to
depose Callista Bisek, a congressional aide with whom the former
U.S. House speaker has a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Gingrich's new attack stance will continue through
the week. Coming motions will probe financial aspects of the
divorce case. Next week, Gingrich's motions will focus on what part
Marianne Gingrich played in the breakdown of the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a most enlightening week,'' Evans predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's latest motion centers on a Sept. 10 agreement he and
his wife signed that was supposed to temporarily resolve monetary
issues between the divorcing couple. Marianne Gingrich had accused
her husband of attempting to transfer money before filing his July
29 divorce petition. Gingrich had responded by saying his wife
depleted a substantial portion of the accounts she controlled.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ensuing agreement, ``All existing amounts as
well as any accumulated compensation earned since the parties'
separation, irrespective of location, in any account of any kind
... shall be transferred immediately into the account.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's motion accuses Marianne Gingrich of waiting 20 days
to begin transferring her portion of the assets.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the CPA managing the joint account, says some of
Gingrich's speech money is still tied up in a business he and his
wife own together. Cohen expects to get that money once the
necessary transfer paperwork is completed.

 &HT;    TUTU URGES U.S. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID TO SOUTH AFRICA'S
GROWING ECONOMY
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu called on the United States
to increase its financial support of South Africa during a speech
at the National Press Club on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the United States gives Israel $3.5 billion annually
in foreign aid, Tutu said South Africa needs similar assistance as
it struggles to right its economy eight years after abolishing
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give South Africa $2 billion for the next five years,'' Tutu
told a luncheon crowd at the National Press Club here. ``Here is a
chance to help a country become a vibrant economy. When South
Africa prospers, it will be the engine driving the economy of the
continent''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, chairman of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission and a visiting professor of theology at Emory University
in Atlanta, sprinkled some humor into his speech on how the country
has fared in a post-apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tremendous privilege to come to places such as this
where we were once asking for help,'' said Tutu, whose impassioned
pleas and sermons helped end apartheid in South Africa. ``You gave
help. We accomplished the goal. We are free''
</P>
<P>
   Many had predicted that bloodshed would accompany the transition
to a democratic society, and that black South Africans would not
remain committed to reconciliation once in power, Tutu recalled.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which granted amnesty for
politically motivated crimes as long as full disclosure was made by
the perpetrators, was a particular source of concern.
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 Nobel Peace laureate remarked with glee that the nation
has not collapsed under black leadership and that it is doing
better than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our banks work,'' he said, alluding to the financial crises
that have plagued other nations such as Russia. ``We have a
horrendous legacy but also remarkable achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   While crime, high unemployment levels, and incidents of
corruption remain, there is little chance of regression into some
of the horrific abuses that occurred under apartheid, Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
   Thabo Mbeki, president of South Africa, though not as
``flamboyant'' as international icon Nelson Mandela _ ``he is
actually quite British'' in dress _ exhibits the same commitment to
reconciliation among South Africans and rebuilding its economy,
Tutu said. Mbeki is the second president elected since the end of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Tutu has suggested that the United States
consider forming its own Truth and Reconciliation Commission on
slavery. The archbishop said that while he did not want to
interfere in other nation's affairs, a similar commission might be
a useful endeavor for the United States to explore as a route to
racial healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to say that it's an infallible formula,'' Tutu said,
adding that certain factors must be in place for it to be
successful _ one, leaders must be ready to take risks; and two, the
people must realize that their opponents are potential friends, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Tutu was named the second winner of the
Sydney Peace Prize by the Sydney University Peace Foundation.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAN PEDRO DE ATACAMA, Chile _ ``If you build it, they will
come,'' the mysterious voice urged a farmer in the movie ``Field of
Dreams'' to build a baseball diamond to lure legendary players back
to life. A similar story of faith is occurring in the world's
driest region at the base of the Andes. Last October, explora,
which insists on its lower-case ``e,'' opened a five-star, $20
million luxury hotel in the Atacama desert in hopes of attracting
wealthy tourists to the remote, high-altitude town (2,443 meters
above sea level) of San Pedro de Atacama.
 &HT;    ``Nobody in Chile has ever understood what we are doing,'' says
German del Sol, the architect of the two-hotel chain. ``Every
Santiago tourist company said we would go broke in a year.''
 &HT;    Del Sol is referring to the company's first venture: a $7
million, 30-room structure that opened in 1993 in the windswept
Patagonia national park of Torres del Paine. It now has an annual
occupancy rate of 45 percent _ in an area that averages 11 percent
_ with reservations into the year 2002.
 &HT;    In fact, the Atacama hotel has gotten off to a propitious start,
attracting scores of tourists from the United States, Spain,
Brazil, Germany and France. In recent months, it has been featured
on the Discovery Channel and in such prestigious U.S. publications
as Conde Nast Traveler, which recently placed it on its 1999 ``Hot
List'' of world hotels, the only pick from Latin America.
 &HT;    Explora executives are pinning their hopes on the popularity of
eco-tourism, the largest growing segment of the tourist trade. In
Atacama, they see an eco gold mine in salt lakes, hot springs,
craters, snow-capped volcanoes, steaming geysers, pre-Incan ruins
and sand dunes rising many meters high. Wildlife includes
flamingos, guanacos, vicuna and an Andean rabbit called a vizcacha.
``The hotel is not the star, the destination is,'' del Sol insists.
 &HT;    Del Sol, who recently left explora because of ``creative
differences'' with the hotel's owner, juice tycoon Pedro Ibanez,
founded the business in 1989 to bring five-star accommodations to
Chile's most isolated regions. It took Del Sol five years to finish
the Patagonia hotel and two years to build the 52-room Atacama
hotel, which he says captures the ``spirit of the desert.'' He used
bricks made of volcanic rock, converted cisterns into swimming
pools and surrounded the structure with typical Atacama adobe
walls. Shepherds crisscross the hotel's 17 hectares herding their
sheep and llamas.
 &HT;    But make no mistake: The hotel is aimed at attracting
high-powered business types who yearn to escape their busy lives to
revel in nature. The Atacama Hotel is a tad more expensive than its
Patagonia counterpart, with a double room fetching $1,296 per
person for three nights ($1,858 single) and $2,441 for a week
($3,534 single). This includes full board and daily guided
explorations by jeep, horse, mountain bike or hiking.
 &HT;    ``The hotel has great potential as an executive retreat,'' says
Tim Vanderhoof, an adventure-travel consultant for the North
Carolina-based Al Fresco Corporation, who recently toured the area
along with 25 other American travel agents and consultants. Ann
Marie Cowchok, a Washington D.C.-based sales manager for LanChile
Airlines, agrees: ``Explora is for people who have been to a lot of
places [and want something different but still want luxury.''
Luxury abounds in the middle of this desert: French chef, Jacuzzi
tubs, saunas, masseuse, bed linens from Barcelona and Chilean wine
from a private vineyard.
 &HT;    Hector Ochoa, owner of the San Pedro de Atacama-based Ochoa
Turismo travel agency, believes such extravagance may be for naught
since the city's already-anemic tourism has tailed off in recent
years, amounting to only 4,000 visitors in 1998. ``The yearly costs
of operating any kind of hotel here are enormous,'' Ochoa says.
 &HT;    Indeed, Sao Pedro de Atacama has never been a tourist mecca,
even for Chileans. ``The typical Chilean would rather go to Europe
than see his own country,'' admits Marianne Carey, explora's
communications director.
 &HT;    Instead, Atacama tourism draws a small but steady stream of U.S.
and European backpackers, who discovered San Pedro de Atacama _ a
town of 2,000 inhabitants _ in the late 1970s. Founded by Spanish
conquistadores in 1557, the 34,000-acre oasis is characterized by
dusty streets, cheap inns and restaurants, and an archeology
museum. The life's work of a Belgian priest named Gustavo Le Paige,
who died in 1980, the museum's 500,000 artifacts include Incan gold
ornaments and a 1,300-year-old mummy, well-preserved in the
desert's dry soil.
 &HT;    While explora waits to see if its desert gamble pays off, it is
planning two more outback hotels: one on Chiloe Island in Chile's
southern lake district and another on Easter Island, a Chilean
possession located 2,274 miles from the mainland and known for its
mysterious stone figures built by an ancient Polynesian culture.
``We don't care about developed areas,'' explora Director Antonio
Rollan says. ``We look only for unique places.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, del Sol has found new backers and is busy drawing up
plans to build six explora-type hotels in the next 10 years. These
include ventures in Cuzco, Peru, Bolivia's Beni Amazon region and
Easter Island, where he could wind up competing for upscale
tourists with his ex-partners.

 &HT;    SAN PEDRO DE ATACAMA, Chile _ ``If you build it, they will
come,'' the mysterious voice urged a farmer in the movie ``Field of
Dreams'' to build a baseball diamond to lure legendary players back
to life. A similar story of faith is occurring in the world's
driest region at the base of the Andes. Last October, explora,
which insists on its lower-case ``e,'' opened a five-star, $20
million luxury hotel in the Atacama desert in hopes of attracting
wealthy tourists to the remote, high-altitude town (2,443 meters
above sea level) of San Pedro de Atacama.
 &HT;    ``Nobody in Chile has ever understood what we are doing,'' says
German del Sol, the architect of the two-hotel chain. ``Every
Santiago tourist company said we would go broke in a year.''
 &HT;    Del Sol is referring to the company's first venture: a $7
million, 30-room structure that opened in 1993 in the windswept
Patagonia national park of Torres del Paine. It now has an annual
occupancy rate of 45 percent _ in an area that averages 11 percent
_ with reservations into the year 2002.
 &HT;    In fact, the Atacama hotel has gotten off to a propitious start,
attracting scores of tourists from the United States, Spain,
Brazil, Germany and France. In recent months, it has been featured
on the Discovery Channel and in such prestigious U.S. publications
as Conde Nast Traveler, which recently placed it on its 1999 ``Hot
List'' of world hotels, the only pick from Latin America.
 &HT;    Explora executives are pinning their hopes on the popularity of
eco-tourism, the largest growing segment of the tourist trade. In
Atacama, they see an eco gold mine in salt lakes, hot springs,
craters, snow-capped volcanoes, steaming geysers, pre-Incan ruins
and sand dunes rising many meters high. Wildlife includes
flamingos, guanacos, vicuna and an Andean rabbit called a vizcacha.
``The hotel is not the star, the destination is,'' del Sol insists.
 &HT;    Del Sol, who recently left explora because of ``creative
differences'' with the hotel's owner, juice tycoon Pedro Ibanez,
founded the business in 1989 to bring five-star accommodations to
Chile's most isolated regions. It took Del Sol five years to finish
the Patagonia hotel and two years to build the 52-room Atacama
hotel, which he says captures the ``spirit of the desert.'' He used
bricks made of volcanic rock, converted cisterns into swimming
pools and surrounded the structure with typical Atacama adobe
walls. Shepherds crisscross the hotel's 17 hectares herding their
sheep and llamas.
 &HT;    But make no mistake: The hotel is aimed at attracting
high-powered business types who yearn to escape their busy lives to
revel in nature. The Atacama Hotel is a tad more expensive than its
Patagonia counterpart, with a double room fetching $1,296 per
person for three nights ($1,858 single) and $2,441 for a week
($3,534 single). This includes full board and daily guided
explorations by jeep, horse, mountain bike or hiking.
 &HT;    ``The hotel has great potential as an executive retreat,'' says
Tim Vanderhoof, an adventure-travel consultant for the North
Carolina-based Al Fresco Corporation, who recently toured the area
along with 25 other American travel agents and consultants. Ann
Marie Cowchok, a Washington D.C.-based sales manager for LanChile
Airlines, agrees: ``Explora is for people who have been to a lot of
places [and want something different but still want luxury.''
Luxury abounds in the middle of this desert: French chef, Jacuzzi
tubs, saunas, masseuse, bed linens from Barcelona and Chilean wine
from a private vineyard.
 &HT;    Hector Ochoa, owner of te San Pedro de Atacama-based Ochoa
Turismo travel agency, believes such extravagance may be for naught
since the city's already-anemic tourism has tailed off in recent
years, amounting to only 4,000 visitors in 1998. ``The yearly costs
of operating any kind of hotel here are enormous,'' Ochoa says.
 &HT;    Indeed, Sao Pedro de Atacama has never been a tourist mecca,
even for Chileans. ``The typical Chilean would rather go to Europe
than see his own country,'' admits Marianne Carey, explora's
communications director.
 &HT;    Instead, Atacama tourism draws a small but steady stream of U.S.
and European backpackers, who discovered San Pedro de Atacama _ a
town of 2,000 inhabitants _ in the late 1970s. Founded by Spanish
conquistadores in 1557, the 34,000-acre oasis is characterized by
dusty streets, cheap inns and restaurants, and an archeology
museum. The life's work of a Belgian priest named Gustavo Le Paige,
who died in 1980, the museum's 500,000 artifacts include Incan gold
ornaments and a 1,300-year-old mummy, well-preserved in the
desert's dry soil.
 &HT;    While explora waits to see if its desert gamble pays off, it is
planning two more outback hotels: one on Chiloe Island in Chile's
southern lake district and another on Easter Island, a Chilean
possession located 2,274 miles from the mainland and known for its
mysterious stone figures built by an ancient Polynesian culture.
``We don't care about developed areas,'' explora Director Antonio
Rollan says. ``We look only for unique places.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, del Sol has found new backers and is busy drawing up
plans to build six explora-type hotels in the next 10 years. These
include ventures in Cuzco, Peru, Bolivia's Beni Amazon region and
Easter Island, where he could wind up competing for upscale
tourists with his ex-partners.

 &HT;    TUTU URGES U.S. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID TO SOUTH AFRICA'S
GROWING ECONOMY
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu called on the United States
to increase its financial support of South Africa during a speech
at the National Press Club on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the United States gives Israel $3.5 billion annually
in foreign aid, Tutu said South Africa needs similar assistance as
it struggles to right its economy eight years after abolishing
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give South Africa $2 billion for the next five years,'' Tutu
told a luncheon crowd at the National Press Club here. ``Here is a
chance to help a country become a vibrant economy. When South
Africa prospers, it will be the engine driving the economy of the
continent''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, chairman of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission and a visiting professor of theology at Emory University
in Atlanta, sprinkled some humor into his speech on how the country
has fared in a post-apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tremendous privilege to come to places such as this
where we were once asking for help,'' said Tutu, whose impassioned
pleas and sermons helped end apartheid in South Africa. ``You gave
help. We accomplished the goal. We are free''
</P>
<P>
   Many had predicted that bloodshed would accompany the transition
to a democratic society, and that black South Africans would not
remain committed to reconciliation once in power, Tutu recalled.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which granted amnesty for
politically motivated crimes as long as full disclosure was made by
the perpetrators, was a particular source of concern.
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 Nobel Peace laureate remarked with glee that the nation
has not collapsed under black leadership and that it is doing
better than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our banks work,'' he said, alluding to the financial crises
that have plagued other nations such as Russia. ``We have a
horrendous legacy but also remarkable achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   While crime, high unemployment levels, and incidents of
corruption remain, there is little chance of regression into some
of the horrific abuses that occurred under apartheid, Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
   Thabo Mbeki, president of South Africa, though not as
``flamboyant'' as international icon Nelson Mandela _ ``he is
actually quite British'' in dress _ exhibits the same commitment to
reconciliation among South Africans and rebuilding its economy,
Tutu said. Mbeki is the second president elected since the end of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Tutu has suggested that the United States
consider forming its own Truth and Reconciliation Commission on
slavery. The archbishop said that while he did not want to
interfere in other nation's affairs, a similar commission might be
a useful endeavor for the United States to explore as a route to
racial healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to say that it's an infallible formula,'' Tutu said,
adding that certain factors must be in place for it to be
successful _ one, leaders must be ready to take risks; and two, the
people must realize that their opponents are potential friends, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Tutu was named the second winner of the
Sydney Peace Prize by the Sydney University Peace Foundation.

OCEAN SPRAY TO MOUNT INTENSIFIED MARKETING CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking to rebound from a slump, Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc.
said Wednesday it hopes to stimulate demand for its products, which
has been flat, by increasing its advertising budget by nearly 35
percent, from about $34 million to $46 million.
</P>
<P>
   The overall marketing budget, which includes advertising and
distribution of coupons and free samples, will grow to between $75
million and $100 million, a 10 percent to 15 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the increase will go to a new ad campaign with the
theme, ``You know it's good,'' a successor to such Ocean Spray
taglines as ``Crave the wave'' and ``Refreshingly honest.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign's first job is to relaunch a 100-percent juice
line whose debut last year under the brand name of Wellfleet Farms
was a big disappointment. The product will now be known as Ocean
Spray Premium 100% Juices.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of layoffs and management turnover, the marketing
changes arrive as the embattled Lakeville, Mass. cooperative is
reviewing a number of options, from an internal restructuring to
selling all or part of its business.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray reiterated Wednesday that this review is unlikely to
be completed for at least several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   All this turmoil gives the new ad campaign added urgency.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Ocean Spray ad campaigns have consisted largely of
television ads aired during prime time. Now there will be more
emphasis on print and cable television, as Ocean Spray looks to
more precisely target its customers, said Stewart Gallagher, who
took over in February as vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ads, created by Arnold Communications of Boston,
were a ``bit generic,'' he said. New ads, also from Arnold, will
focus on specific products and their health benefits. Ads will also
talk up new products, such as Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice Cocktail
Plus, which is fortified with vitamins and calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Previous ads suggested that Ocean Spray, which also includes
citrus growers in its membership, was a fruit company. New ads
proclaim the cooperative's cranberry heritage.
</P>
<P>
   As cranberry growers approach the midpoint of this year's
harvest, much of the industry is hurting as supply exceeds demand.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 million barrels of cranberries still remain from last
year's North American harvest, said David Farrimond of the US
Department of Agriculture. This year's harvest has been projected
at about 6.4 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cranberry consumption has remained flat, at just over
5 million barrels a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result, Ocean Spray's revenues have stagnated. Chris
Phillips, Ocean Spray's manager of public affairs, said the
revenues for the fiscal year that ended in August will be below the
previous year's $1.48 billion. Precise figures won't be disclosed
for another few weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray doesn't only compete with other cranberry companies;
it also competes with nearly every beverage that can be found on a
supermarket shelf, from bottled water to soft drinks. In many
cases, these rivals have behind them the marketing muscle of a big
conglomerate, such as PepsiCo Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Bottled water may be the hottest beverage category at the
moment. Consumption is up sharply in the last 10 years, said John
Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade journal.
And Americans are drinking nearly seven gallons per year more of
carbonated soft drinks than they did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   But annual consumption of juices and juice drinks rose only from
8.2 gallons per capita in 1988 to 8.7 gallons in 1998, Sicher said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one small juice company reports it is gaining at Ocean
Spray's expense. A few years ago, Wisconsin-based Northland
Cranberries Inc. began marketing a cranberry product as 100-percent
juice: a cranberry beverage sweetened and diluted by other juices.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray's Cranberry Juice Coctail, in contrast, is 27
percent juice; the rest is water and fructose syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Northland has come on strong, eating away at Ocean Spray's
market share, said Northland chief executive John Swendrowski.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ocean Spray countered with the launch of its own
100-percent juice line, Wellfleet Farms. But the line didn't catch
on, despite a big ad campaign and lots of promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Now the line has a new name _ Ocean Spray Premium 100% Juices _
a new label, and a new and even bigger ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clean break'' from last year's campaign, said Sheff
Halsey, the Ocean Spray account director at Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   In Swendrowski's view, a name change and a bigger marketing
budget won't be enough to solve Ocean Spray's problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Ocean Spray's Phillips contends it's a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can change the mix,'' he said. ``We think there's
demand waiting to be tapped.''

   BETHLEHEM, Pa. _ When Christopher Reed left here nine years ago
to study engineering at Penn State, he figured he was gone for
good. A steelworker's son, he had had firsthand experience with the
havoc that the steady decline of Big Steel had wreaked on the
area's job market. ``I figured I'd be in California by now,'' Reed
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed came back when he graduated in 1994, but only to use his
parents' home as a base for job hunting. Five months later, though,
he was working at QED, a Bethlehem company that makes gallium
arsenide wafers for the semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe something like QED existed in my
backyard,'' Reed, a systems engineer, said. ``I just never thought
of this as a high-tech area.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the persistent perception of the Lehigh Valley _
whose economic woes were immortalized by Billy Joel in his angry
1982 ballad ``Allentown'' _ as a place whose time has come and
gone. Just drive through the area, visit its schools, talk to its
entrepreneurs. Lucent Technologies has even gone so far as to put
up a billboard over nearby Route 22 proclaiming, ``Move over,
Silicon Valley, here comes Lehigh Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly an exaggeration. Still, slowly but steadily, a
high-technology phoenix is rising on the steel shards of Easton,
Bethlehem and Allentown, the towns that comprise eastern
Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley. The region's unemployment rate, which
four years ago was 7.7 percent, is now only 3.7 percent, according
to the August data. Some 65 high-technology companies have moved
into the valley or been founded there in the last five years,
representing 38,500 jobs _ or about 12 percent of the area's total
employment. It is a striking example of the extent to which high
technology is transforming some of the most damaged areas of the
Rust Belt's industrial economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting past the stigma of the Billy Joel song,'' said
Thomas Kucharski, president of the Lehigh Valley Economic
Development Corp. ``We're breaking through the perception that this
area is coal and cows, and gray and brown.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey by a state-financed economic agency indicates that
technology companies accounted for 3,500 new jobs in the valley
last year, and are expected to create another 4,000 over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, the communications equipment maker that is the area's
biggest technology employer, has gone from 5,000 jobs in the region
in 1996 to 5,600 today. It will have 5,900 here after it finishes
expanding a plant in nearby Briningsville and completes a $165
million divisional headquarters complex in Allentown in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers include ComputerAid, a computer software developer
with 1,200 employees; AANetcom, a small chip maker founded two
years ago by a former Bell Laboratories scientist; STC
Technologies, a developer of medical products for testing
immune-system problems, which employs 85 people, and Applied
Separations Inc., a producer of advanced biotech laboratory
equipment with 62 employees.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the drawn-out erosion of the steel industry has left its
scars. At its 1950s peak, Bethlehem Steel employed 30,000 people in
a five-mile stretch of steelmaking facilities here. When it closed
its last local plant last year, the work force had dwindled to 800.
Many of the workers found jobs with other local companies, but the
pay was nowhere near the $30 an hour they had made with Big Steel,
let alone the 13 weeks' paid vacation and full package of health
benefits they had garnered.
</P>
<P>
   Steel's demise meant the end of a way of a life. By the early
1980s, for the first time in more than 100 years, sons could no
longer follow fathers into the steelworker's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a noticeable and painful flight of young people from
this entire area,'' recalled Bruce Davis, a former Bethlehem Steel
lawyer who is now in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who returned still feel pangs for the old days.
``I look at the blast furnaces now, and what strikes me most is the
eerie silence,'' said Jeffrey Lowmaster, a 41-year-old former
steelworker who left the Lehigh Valley when he was laid off in
1982, got some technology training, and returned last year to a
technician's job at QED.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. In September, a local theater group used the
skeleton of an old steel mill as the backdrop for a play called
``Steelbound,'' which dramatized how widespread the longing for the
old life was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the plant as a ghost town, flat tracts and rubble where
buildings used to be, was even sadder than the day we closed the
forge,'' said Leonard Christman, a former steelworker who acted in
the play.
</P>
<P>
   But, Christman noted, the play ended with a strong message:
``It's time to stop looking back, and to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, clearly, is what the region is doing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw high, we saw low, and now we're seeing high again,''
said David Hartzell, a 26-year-old steelworker's son who is
director of operations for QED, which employs 70 people.
</P>
<P>
   The change is tangible. Easton is metamorphosing into an art and
tourist center, home to several galleries and two interactive
children's museums. Allentown, which has suffered badly from
middle-class flight to the suburbs, is being reborn as a government
and financial center, with a large dab of high technology.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is Lucent's planned new group
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been adding people for the last few years, and we're
finally ready to put down bricks and mortar,'' said John T.
Dickson, the president of Lucent's $3 billion Microelectronics
Group, the division that makes electronic components here. The
region's drawing cards, Dickson said, include the ``magnificent''
countryside and affordable housing. And Lucent's Route 22 billboard
notwithstanding, Dickson sees benefit in the fact that the Lehigh
Valley does not really rival other high-tech centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't attract good people if we were the only high-tech
company in town,'' he said. ``But it's still harder for our talent
to walk out the door to a new job than it would be in Silicon
Valley.''

GORE CRITICISMS `RIDICULOUS,' BRADLEY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Democratic presidential candidate Bill
Bradley acknowledging he has thrown ``raw meat into a cage of
wolves'' by outlining a detailed health care plan, Wednesday
bristled at criticism of the proposal by Vice President Al Gore,
saying Gore's complaints are ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just wrong,'' Bradley said in an interview, delivering
his first public response to criticism of the plan by Gore. The
vice president said Monday that the former New Jersey senator's
proposal would eliminate Medicaid and threaten the solvency of
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In defending his $65 billion-per-year health care plan, Bradley
underscored the challenge he faces in the coming months as he tries
to outline a series of specific, costly proposals while fending off
attacks about the details.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, shown an article outlining Gore's criticism of his
health care plan, visibly bristled at the vice president's remarks,
saying Gore was misrepresenting the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not taking away anybody's Medicare,'' Bradley said in
the interview. Bradley said he would detail his proposal on
Medicare later this year. In addition, Bradley emphasized that his
plan would provide additional prescription coverage for senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said Gore was misstating his position on Medicaid.
``We're not abolishing it, we're replacing it,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Bradley continued to defend his health care
plan, appearing just up the street from Gore's campaign
headquarters here to promote his proposal at the Manchester
Community Health Center. Bradley met with doctors at the clinic who
told one story after another about the difficulty of finding
treatment for uninsured patients, a setting intended to highlight
the benefits of Bradley's plan to provide insurance for 95 percent
of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also appeared Wednesday night at a Town Meeting in
Bedford attended by about 300 people, many of whom enthusiastically
supported him.
</P>
<P>
   The health care plan is just the first of many detailed family
and health-related proposals that Bradley intends to announce.
Thursday, in a speech in Peterborough, Bradley plans to unveil
plans to help families balance work and home life, including a
``senior corps'' program that would pay senior citizens to mentor
young people.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has devoted considerable time to the first-primary
state, where a series of polls have shown him in a statistical tie
with Gore. It is these New Hampshire polls that convinced Gore last
week to reorganize his campaign, moving the headquarters to
Nashville and challenging Bradley to a series of debates.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley has not agreed to the debates, both Democratic
candidates are scheduled to appear at a ``Town Meeting'' in New
Hampshire later this month. The event is considered by both
campaigns to the most important event so far of the primary, and it
is likely to be attended by hundreds of members of the media.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, Bradley declined to get into an exchange
about Gore, saying he didn't want to engage in what he called
``dart board politics.'' At one point, a reporter asked Bradley to
respond to Gore's comments that the senator had quit the Senate and
had considered leaving the Democratic Party to run as an
Independent candidate. Bradley responded by pretending to be hit
with a dart, then carefully removing it and putting it on the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand what happens in a campaign,'' Bradley said.

 BETHLEHEM, Pa.: Silicon Valley.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The renaissance is most apparent in Bethlehem, once the heart of
the steel district. New eating establishments and boutiques are
replacing ramshackle businesses on 3rd Street, the main drag. And
it is not possible to eat at the Apollo Grill, a trendy new
mid-priced restaurant, without a reservation. ``In the old days, it
would have opened and closed in a week,'' said Bethlehem Mayor
Donald Cunningham, a steelworker's son.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem Steel still makes its world headquarters here, even
though its closest steel mill is now in Steelton, about 100 miles
west. Meanwhile, the old local steelmaking site _ at 1,800 acres
the largest singly-owned ``brownfield,'' or environmentally
problematic site, under redevelopment in the country _ is being
reincarnated.
</P>
<P>
   The company has spent nearly $25 million on cleaning up and
marketing the site, but has priced the parcels low enough so that
they are selling quickly. ``We're not trying to profit from
redevelopment; we'd love it if we break even,'' said Curtis H.
``Hank'' Barnette, the company's chairman since 1992. ``Our goal is
to bring our site back to decent use.''
</P>
<P>
   The new uses include a museum of industry run by the Smithsonian
Institution, an entertainment park with skating rink and swimming
pool, a transportation facility where shipments are switched
between trucks and railcars, a hotel and conference center, and a
commerce center for light manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Barnette said he expected the various operations that occupy the
old steelmaking site to eventually provide 10,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the company has helped finance five industrial parks
on Bethlehem's outskirts that have become homes to some 400 small
businesses, and to a mix of 14,000 technology and non-technology
jobs. A sixth park is under construction now.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all along the valley, dozens of companies with ties
to the fast-growing semiconductor chip industry have sprung up.
Many have been helped along by the state-financed Ben Franklin
Technology Center, an incubator for new companies and a nurturer
for small ones trying to grow big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Ben Franklin's help, we'd have never found financing
to get started,'' said William Weisbecker, a co-founder of QED,
which recently merged with a Welsh company to form a $35 million
multinational called IQE PLC, whose stock trades on the Brussels
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Ben Franklin Center was one of various initiatives promoted
in the early 1980s by Pennsylvania's Republican governor at the
time, Dick Thornburgh. While it was clear that steel was on the way
out, Thornburgh defied the conventional wisdom by refusing to woo
other types of heavy industry with the promise of tax breaks and
land, concentrating instead on luring small companies with growth
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Let's not chase smokestacks, let's turn our
resources into something with a future,''' said Mark Lang, the Ben
Franklin Center's executive director.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   High technology was not an outlandish choice. The first
transistor was manufactured in Allentown in 1951 by Western
Electric, the old AT&AMP;T manufacturing arm, which originally located
in the area because of its proximity to New York and Philadelphia
and to AT&AMP;T's Bell Labs, 60 miles away in Murray Hill, N.J. And
there was Lehigh University. Today, many of the current start-ups
are run by Lehigh alumni.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made sense to set up near a high concentration of technical
talent,'' said John Plunkett, a Lehigh graduate and co-founder of
Millbrook Inc., a new Bethlehem company that provides software to
the insurance industry. Millbrook rents office space from Lehigh,
and employs many Lehigh students as interns.
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh University itself is undergoing a metamorphosis of sorts.
To counter its lingering reputation as a bastion of manufacturing
skills, it is beefing up its liberal arts offerings, and will soon
introduce a bioengineering course. It also is setting its students
up with internships and consulting jobs at local technology
companies. ``Most of our graduates still don't stay in the area,
but we'd like them to,'' said university president Gregory
Farrington.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in Bethlehem's local schools are more dramatic. The
school district was never particularly starved for cash, since
Bethlehem _ unlike Allentown and many other U.S. cities _ has
folded its affluent suburban and inner city schools under the same
district umbrella. But, in the steel-supremacy days, it was not
under pressure to provide a good education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew you could be a high school dropout and have a
middle class lifestyle, that you could lean on a broom and make $15
an hour,'' said Thomas Doliusio, the district superintendent for
the last 13 years. ``Our minimum requirements for graduation were
too minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Three years ago Doliusio began what he calls an
``international benchmarking'' project, to glean educational tips
from Japan and other countries. He has since introduced new ways to
teach English and math, as well as intensified reading skills
programs. He has instituted a stringent code of conduct that has
resulted in the expulsion of 100 children ``whose behavior
interfered with our efficiency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost has been high. ``Many teachers retired, and we've spent
millions to train others,'' he said. ``And we've had to deemphasize
social studies and science and music. But gosh darn it, our kids
will know how to read!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the area's transformation is far from complete. Barnette,
the Bethlehem Steel chairman, figures it will take more than a
decade to complete all of the facilities planned for his shuttered
plants. There are still many rutted, muddy roads on and around the
site.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to Mayor Cunningham, while enough companies have
come in to keep the tax base from declining, ``it's stayed flat
when our expenses have kept going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as he stood at the window of his office and
surveyed the reborn town of Bethlehem, there was an air of
nostalgic wistfulness in Cunningham's voice. ``My job would be a
lot easier,'' he conceded, ``if there were a working steel plant
out there.''

 &HT;    SAN PEDRO DE ATACAMA, Chile _ ``Si lo construyes, vendran,''
decia una voz misteriosa a un granjero en la pelicula ``Field of
Dreams,'' exhortandolo a levantar un terreno de beisbol para
devolver a la vida a jugadores legendarios del pasado.
 &HT;    Una parecida historia de fe ocurre en la region mas seca del
planeta, al pie de los Andes. En octubre pasado, la compania
explora, que insiste en que la e inicial es en minuscula, abrio un
hotel de cinco estrellas y US$20 millones en el desierto de
Atacama, con la esperanza de atraer a turistas adinerados al remoto
poblado de San Pedro de Atacama, a 2.443 metros sobre el nivel del
mar.
 &HT;    ``En Chile nadie ha entendido jamas lo que hacemos,'' dice
German del Sol, arquitecto de la cadena de dos hoteles. ``Todas las
companias turisticas de Santiago decian que nos iriamos a la ruina
en un ano.'' Del Sol se refiere al primer proyecto de la compania:
una estructura de 30 habitaciones y US$7 millones que se inauguro
en 1993, en el parque nacional de Torres del Paine, en los paramos
barridos por el viento de la Patagonia. Ahora tiene un indice de
ocupacion anual del 45 por ciento (en una zona donde el promedio es
del 11 por ciento) con reservaciones hasta el ano 2002.
 &HT;    El hotel de Atacama ha comenzado con buen pie al atraer a
legiones de turistas de Estados Unidos, Espana, Brasil, Alemania y
Francia. En meses recientes se le ha resenado en el Discovery
Channel y en publicaciones norteamericanas como Conde Nast
Traveler, que lo incluyo en su lista de los mejores hoteles del
mundo de 1999, el unico de toda Latinoamerica.
 &HT;    Los ejecutivos de explora basan sus esperanzas en la popularidad
del ecoturismo, el segmento de mas crecimiento en la industria
turistica. En Atacama, ven una mina de oro ecoturistica en los
lagos salados, las aguas termales, los crateres, los volcanes de
cimas nevadas, los geiseres, las ruinas preincaicas y las elevadas
dunas de arena. En la zona abundan los flamencos, guanacos, vicunas
y un tipo de conejo de los Andes llamado vizcacha. ``El hotel no es
la estrella, sino el lugar,'' reitera Del Sol.
 &HT;    El arquitecto, que hace poco dejo su trabajo en explora debido a
``diferencias de creatividad'' con el dueno del hotel, el magnate
de los jugos Pedro Ibanez, fundo el negocio en 1989 con la idea de
llevar la comodidad de las instalaciones de cinco estrellas a las
regiones mas aisladas de Chile.
 &HT;    Del Sol invirtio cinco anos en la construccion del hotel de
Patagonia y dos anos en el de Atacama, que tiene 52 habitaciones y
que, segun el, capta ``el espiritu del desierto.'' Uso ladrillos
hechos de roca volcanica, convirtio cisternas en piscinas y rodeo
la estructura con paredes de adobe, tipicas de la zona de Atacama.
Los pastores cruzan las 17 hectareas del terreno del hotel con sus
rebanos de ovejas y llamas.
 &HT;    Pero no hay que enganarse: el hotel esta dirigido a los altos
ejecutivos que quieren escapar por unos dias del ajetreo cotidiano
y relajarse en contacto con la naturaleza. El hotel de Atacama es
un poco mas caro que el de Patagonia: una habitacion doble cuesta
US$1.296 por persona por tres noches (US$1.858 la sencilla) y
US$2.441 por semana (US$3.534 la sencilla). Ese precio incluye
desayuno y comida y paseos de exploracion con guia a pie, en jeep,
a caballo o en bicicleta.
 &HT;    ``El hotel tiene un gran potencial como retiro para
ejecutivos,'' dice Tim Vanderhoof, consultor de turismo de aventura
de Al Fresco Corporation, de Carolina del Norte, quien
recientemente recorrio la zona con 25 agentes de viajes y asesores
estadounidenses. Ann Marie Cowchok, gerente de ventas de LanChile
en Washington, concuerda: ``explora es para personas que han estado
en muchos lugares y quieren probar algo distinto sin renunciar al
lujo.''
 &HT;    Y el lujo abunda: un chef frances, jacuzzi, sauna, servicio de
masajes, ropa de cama de Barcelona y vino chileno de un vinedo
privado.
 &HT;    Hector Ochoa, dueno de la agencia de viajes Ochoa Turismo, de
San Pedro de Atacama, piensa que ese lujo quiza sea inutil, ya que
el turismo ya anemico de la ciudad ha bajado en los ultimos anos.
En 1998, solo recibieron 4.000 visitantes. ``El costo de operar un
hotel aqui es enorme,'' comenta.
 &HT;    En efecto, San Pedro de Atacama nunca ha sido una meca
turistica, ni siquiera para los chilenos. ``El chileno tipico
prefiere ir a Europa,'' dice Marianne Carey, jefa de comunicaciones
de explora.
 &HT;    En lugar de los chilenos, Atacama atrae a una cantidad pequena
pero constante de norteamericanos y europeos, que descubrieron a
San Pedro de Atacama, una poblacion de 2.000 habitantes, a fines de
los anos 70. Este oasis de unas 14.000 hectareas fundado por los
espanoles en 1557 se distingue por sus calles polvorientas, sus
posadas y restaurantes baratos, y su museo de arqueologia. El
museo, obra de toda la vida de un sacerdote belga llamado Gustavo
Le Paige, que fallecio en 1980, tiene 500.000 artefactos, entre
ellos ornamentos incas de oro y una momia de 1.300 anos
perfectamente conservada.
 &HT;    Explora planea levantar dos hoteles mas en zonas remotas, uno en
la isla de Chiloe, en el sur de Chile, y otro en la isla de Pascua,
una posesion chilena situada a unos 3.600 kilometros del continente
y celebre por sus misteriosas estatuas de piedra, levantadas por
una arcaica cultura polinesia. ``No nos interesan las zonas
urbanizadas,'' dice Antonio Rollan, director de explora. ``Solo
buscamos lugares exclusivos.''
 &HT;    Del Sol ha encontrado nuevo apoyo y planea construir seis
hoteles tipo explora en los 10 anos proximos. Entre los sitios
escogidos para estos hoteles estan el Cuzco, en Peru; la region
amazonica de Beni, en Bolivia, y la isla de Pascua, donde podria
terminar compitiendo con sus ex socios.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An angry Elizabeth Dole is denying rumors, which
her aides say are being spread by the rival camps of Arizona
Senator John McCain and Steve Forbes, that she is about to drop her
historic bid for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Dole is ``outraged'' by reports circulating in New Hampshire
this week that she is running out of money, canceling appearances
and charter flights, and will soon end her campaign, her press
secretary, Kathleen Harrington, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would they do this kind of thing?'' Dole asked when told
of the rumors, Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no truth'' to Dole withdrawing, said Harrington,
noting that the candidate was heading to San Diego Thursday to give
a get-tough-on-drugs speech, doing a weekend of fund-raising in
California and McCain's home state of Arizona, and then campaigning
in Iowa next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am out there running hard, working hard,'' Dole told
reporters after speaking to 600 businesswomen at a fund-raising
lunch in Lexington, Ky. Dole, in the speech, criticized the US
Justice Department for filing a lawsuit against tobacco companies,
seeking to recover billions of dollars that taxpayers have spent on
smoking-related health care.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said that because Dole is running second to Texas
Governor George W. Bush in most national polls, ``it is clearly in
the interest of McCain and Forbes to knock us out'' and be
positioned as the most likely alternative if the GOP front-runner
falters. She also suggested McCain has a gender gap _ he is more
popular with men than women voters _ and would like to see the only
female candidate leave the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's people have been very overt, telling people the Dole
campaign is falling apart,'' said Ari Fleischer, Dole's former
spokesman. ``I think some of these male candidates are frustrated
to be losing to a woman like Elizabeth Dole. So they engage in the
art of discrediting their opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's spokesman, Howard Opinsky, denied his campaign was
spreading rumors about Dole's demise and insisted its focus is only
on the senator. ``This campaign is not about other candidates, it's
about getting out the message of John McCain,'' Opinsky said,
adding that McCain was now besting Dole in polls in New Hampshire,
New York, and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, a Forbes adviser, called it ``a bunch of
nonsense'' that the publisher's campaign would undermine Dole. ``We
feel that this is, by and large, down to a two-person race between
an establishment candidate and the conservative alternative, which
Forbes has become,'' Mueller said. ``I have no idea what Mrs.
Dole's intentions are, but we encourage her to stay in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her denials, some key Republicans still are not
convinced Dole is serious about continuing her presidential
campaign, the first by a Republican woman. They say Dole failed to
capitalize on her third-place finish in the Iowa straw poll in
August and has been unimpressive in raising money, bringing in $1.7
million in the last three months. Dole has not officially declared
her candidacy, either, an event that aides have now pushed back to
November from October.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Rath, a New Hampshire GOP committeeman who is supporting
Bush, said sources close to the Dole campaign _ not those in a
rival camp _ have told him that Dole is running out of money and
will withdraw from the race by the end of the week. According to
Rath, Dole has about $200,000 on hand, not the $850,000 the
campaign reported last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Dole has labored mightily, but there is no easy way to
say it: If you don't have the money, you can't go on,'' said Rath,
who had been an adviser to former Tennessee Governor Lamar
Alexander before he left the GOP race for a lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie McElveen-Hunter, Dole's finance chairman, said the Dole
campaign has close to $850,000 in the bank _ ``though I wish it was
$85 million.'' McElveen-Hunter said she is organizing fund-raising
events through December and into January, a sign that Dole is in
the race, at least through the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McElveen-Hunter acknowledged the perception that Dole is
preparing to drop out of the race makes money-raising harder.
``Nobody wants to give to a candidate they believe is going to pull
out of the race,'' McElveen-Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Dole will be in Phoenix for a fund-raiser and to get the
endorsement of Mayor Skip Rimsza. ``We're going into McCain's
territory, and we aren't ceding it to him,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, a New York pollster, said that because Dole is
well-known and has the celebrity of being the woman candidate, she
does not need to raise as much money as her rivals to stay in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would Dole drop out?'' Zogby said. ``Above and beyond
winning, she wants to make history. . .She won't make history if
she drops out too soon, and if she doesn't compete at least in Iowa
and New Hampshire, the `coulda, woulda, shoulda' questions about
her will never be answered.''

US MOVES AGAINST BIN LADEN WITH UN RESOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Bolstered by Russia's new hard line toward
Osama bin Laden, the United States Wednesday introduced a Security
Council resolution that would seize assets and ground international
flights of Afghanistan's ruling Taliban rebels until the terrorist
leader is turned over to US authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, expected to sail to passage as early as Friday,
could presage more pressure on the Taliban, including a worldwide
weapons embargo, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban officials say the measure will hurt Afghanistan's
people, not their Islamic fundamentalist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, indicted by a US court for masterminding the August
1998 bombing of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that
killed more than 200 people, has been accused by Russian
authorities of funding what they call an Islamic bombing campaign
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   US and Russian intelligence say Bin Laden is being sheltered by
the Afghan Islamic militants, who have controlled most of
Afghanistan since 1996. US officials said the Taliban has rejected
more than 20 requests from Washington to turn over bin Laden or his
associates.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's support of the measure is critical, because it holds an
automatic veto on the 15-member UN council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe terrorism is a threat and the Taliban is violating
all possible decisions of the United Nations,'' Sergei Lavrov,
Russia's UN ambassador, said in brief remarks. ``We support the
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   An air embargo would be devastating to the landlocked country.
Under the resolution, all assets held by the Taliban would be
frozen. The US imposed its own sanctions against flights by the
Taliban-controlled Ariana Afghan airline in August.
</P>
<P>
   Washington decided to extend its sanctions into a worldwide ban
because of Russian support in the effort to stop bin Laden, said a
Western diplomat, who asked not to be named. Britain, France and
China, the other permanent council members, also support the
resolution, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban's designated representative to the United Nations,
Abdul Hakeem Mujhaid, called the resolution strange because it
comes against a group not recognized by the world body. The
international flights now are ``taking the commodities of the
people to Pakistan, and nothing else. This impacts the common
people, the traders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said bin Laden
has been in Chechnya several times, helping that Russian republic
as well as the Dagestan region to break away from Moscow with
financial and material support. The Russians have also accused the
Saudi dissident of being behind apartment building bombings in the
Russian capital last month that left nearly 300 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration believes bin Laden, who fought in
Afghanistan's war against the Soviet Union, is planning more
attacks against Americans or American interests. Last week,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright designated bin Laden's
organization, al-Qa'ida, a foreign terrorist organization, which
gave the US more authority to freeze its assets. Al-Qa'ida's
headquarters is in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the United States said it would seize the Afghan
airline's US assets, estimated at $500 million. Since the Taliban
seized power in Afghanistan the airline's only international
flights have been to Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
Pakistan is the Taliban's chief ally and have not cooperated with
US efforts to bring bin Laden to justice, US officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Like all countries, Pakistan would be bound by the UN sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban denies bid Laden is involved in terrorist activities
and also says it has no extradition treaty with the United States.
Bin Laden is on the FBI's 10-most-wanted list. The United States
has offered a $5 million reward for his arrest.

GORE CRITICIZES BRADLEY RECORD ON FAMILY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Bill Bradley prepares to deliver a major address on work and
families Thursday in Peterborough, N.H., Vice President Gore's
campaign is trying to poke holes in the former New Jersey senator's
legislative record on protecting families.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign highlights the fact that Bradley was the only
Democrat to vote in 1995 against a budget amendment to provide
federal dollars to rural hospitals and health care providers
treating Medicare patients, as to maintain funding for education
and child care in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came on a Democratic amendment _ one among many offered
_ to reduce the Republicans' proposed tax cut by $48 billion to
help pay for rural health care, education, child care and
agriculture. Senator Olympia Snowe, the Maine Republican, joined
with Democrats, while Bradley sided with the Republicans on the
amendment. He ultimately voted with his party against the GOP
budget and tax cut package.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign considers the Bradley vote a sign of weakness
in his record on family issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of this presidential campaign should be on America's
working families, and especially the families of New Hampshire,''
said Douglas Hattaway, Gore's New Hampshire press secretary. ``But
Senator Bradley's voting record differs greatly from his rhetoric
as a presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Wyche, a spokesman for Bradley, said their campaign is not
going to respond to any ``mudslinging.'' He declined to explain why
Bradley broke with Democrats and voted the way he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Senator Bradley said, he's not going to engage in dart
board politics, where you're basically trying to throw darts at
people and hope some of them hit,'' Wyche said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign's effort to chip away at the Bradley record
comes at a time when the vice president has been slipping in the
polls in New Hampshire, and has called for a series of issue-center
debates with his opponent. Gore campaign staffers have been poring
through Bradley's record in recent weeks, looking for issues that
will undermine the former senator's rising support throughout the
first-in-the-nation primary state, as well as nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Bradley cast in October of 1995 occurred at a defining
time for Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Republicans had
recently taken over the Congress and were intent on passing a plan
to balance the budget by 2002 and cut taxes. The bill would have
slashed projected spending by $894 billion and lowered taxes by
$245 billion, according to Congressional Quarterly's Almanac.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, disagreements over the Republicans' budget led to
two vetos by President Clinton and the shutdown of the federal
government on Nov. 14 and again on Dec. 16.

 &HT;    Memphis to elect new mayor
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most colorful mayor's race in Memphis, Tenn.,
history ends today as residents choose between 15 candidates,
including the incumbent, who is the city's first black mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Two-term Mayor Willie Herenton is in the lead, according to a
recent poll in the Memphis Commercial-Appeal, but as many as 37
percent of voters were undecided less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In second place is City Council Chairman Joe Ford, a member of
the most powerful black family in Memphis. His older brother,
Harold Ford Sr., was the first black U.S. congressman from
Tennessee. Harold's son, Harold Ford Jr., now has his father's seat
in Washington. Several other Ford men hold local and state elected
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no historical precedent in Memphis for having two
strong African-American candidates in the mayor's race,'' said
Steven Ethridge, a pollster. Memphis, population 650,000, is more
than 50 percent black. ''The incumbent has substantial support
among the black and the white communities but he may not have
enough of either to win. It's just a very volatile situation here.
It's very unpredictable what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Herenton has spent more than $800,000 on his campaign, a Memphis
record. Ford has spent about $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   All summer and into the fall, Herenton and Ford have slung
enough mud at each other to damn up the Mississippi River flowing
through downtown Memphis. Each has dragged out the other's ancient
arrest records: Ford for drunken driving and assaulting his wife,
and Herenton for rape. Herenton has called Ford unqualified and
immature and Ford has called Herenton inefficient and cold.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the 13 remaining candidates are hoping to benefit
from the fight at the top. Pete Sisson, a well-known white
politician who has the backing of the Republican Party, has said he
can woo voters fed up with the Herenton-Ford feud.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry ''The King'' Lawler, a professional wrestler, is trailing
badly in the polls, but has said he hopes people will think like
this: If former wrestler Jesse Ventura can become governor of
Minnesota, then he can become mayor of Memphis. Lawler was indicted
last month for getting angry at a Memphis airport officer and
running over her foot with his car. He said the timing of the
indictment seemed suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's candidate Pepper Rodgers, former Georgia Tech
football coach and former coach of the now-defunct Memphis
Showboats.
</P>
<P>
   No one's holding out much hope of him being elected, including
Rodgers himself. He admits he didn't make a serious bid for the
city's top job.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout will be a major factor in who wins, since there are so
many candidates and so many people still making up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of people won't make up their minds until they
get in the voting booth,'' Ethridge said.

 &HT;    Patient's bill of rights just won't let go
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Dead on arrival'' was the prognosis last year when
Georgia Republican Charlie Norwood and Michigan Democrat John
Dingell introduced a House bill that would allow patients to sue
the companies that run their managed care plans and name their
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   To some it was effrontery for the Augusta dentist, now in his
third House term, to defy Republican orthodoxy so openly on touchy
issues. With so much insurance company money lined up to stoke the
campaign against it, the Norwood-Dingell measure was an at-risk
bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the patient has proven to be quite robust.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the so-called Patient's Bill of Rights measure awaited a
vote this week with enough votes on paper to give it a majority,
grave concerns were being voiced over its survival. But at this
stage of the treatment, it was clear that simply bludgeoning it to
death, the first strategy employed, wasn't going to work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead President Clinton, who supports the bill, warned
Wednesday from the Rose Garden that it was under threat from a
``poison pill.'' The malady might have been described as a
legislative aneurysm. The bill lacked a cost analysis stating where
the money was going to be raised, and while the bill's sponsors had
one prepared, a rule prohibited them from adding it as an
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   This legislative maneuvering could drive Democrats away from the
bill and affect the vote, expected today, while other procedural
tactics could mean it doesn't come to a vote at all. Whatever its
fate, however, Norwood-Dingell has had a profound effect. At a time
when there aren't many contenders, this bill has had the greatest
impact of any written by a Georgian in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   That became evident Tuesday when House Speaker Dennis Hastert
threw his support to a Republican alternative bill that would allow
a more limited procedure for suing HMOs in federal rather than
state courts.
</P>
<P>
   While expressing regret at having to do so, Hastert became the
first Republican leader to endorse the idea of allowing patients to
sue. A gulf of practical differences separate the two bills, but
the dentist has already won the philosophical ground.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the political ground could be judged by the
keen attention of all the television networks to a breakfast
fund-raiser this week at which insurance lobbyists arrived with
checks for Hastert and others. Not that such scenes aren't common
these days, but the timing made this a photo-op for campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   There was more proof of the impact of Norwood-Dingell in the
debate that was penciled in ahead of the one over patient rights:
the problems of America's uninsured, a subject that has suffered
for attention since the demise of the Clinton health care package.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans divided sharply over the legislation,
which passed on a party-line vote Wednesday. The bill is designed
to make health care more affordable for the uninsured through a
system of tax breaks. But scheduling the debate on this bill in an
attempt to deflect the subject from patient's rights only serves to
focus attention on health care as a larger issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton health care debacle helped to send many in the
Republican majority _including Charlie Norwood _ to Washington. It
also left a host of issues, which the vote on the often battered
but highly resilient Norwood-Dingell bill will only partially
resolve.

 By FRANCES ANDERTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ If one thinks of architecture in Cuba today, it is of
splendid but decaying Colonial buildings floating like the ghosts
of grand dowagers through the movie ``Buena Vista Social Club.'' Or
the freshly primped, restored buildings in Old Havana. Visitors
will also find the capital bursting with 20th-century buildings in
a spirited Cuban fusion of international and tropical styles: Art
Deco movie theaters, streamline Moderne apartments, sassy 1950s
hotels in Morris Lapidus Modern and, crowning them all, the
Expressionist art schools of the '60s, once as ripe as mangoes in
their sensuality and revolutionary spirit.
</P>
<P>
   But where is the attention-seeking new architecture, the kind
that has graced the global architectural stage in the last 20
years? It is mostly nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   The last three decades have seen Cuba's amazing architectural
heritage yield to the utilitarian and architects recede into the
shadows. As Julio Cesar Perez, a professor of design at Jose
Antonio Echeverria City University in Havana, put it, ``There is no
Michael Graves here, no Frank Gehry, no Philip Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no machinery promoting new architects and new
buildings. Architects work for state firms, largely on mundane
tourist structures. The few who work on individual commissions
often do not attach their names publicly to the projects so as not
to call attention to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   With state salaries of roughly $15 a month, Cuba's architects
have had little wherewithal to dream. They can barely afford to
make blueprints or take taxis to the building site, let alone buy
foreign architecture magazines. They must deal with shortages of
materials and poor craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, a generation of Cuban architects pressing
for change say they are scenting the whiff of a renaissance. A
modish new restaurant, A Prado y Neptuno, designed by Roberto
Gottardi, opened early this year in Old Havana. A striking new
hotel, the Packard, fusing a masonry base with a sleek steel roof
and a huge exterior ceramic mural, is to be built nearby, by two
talented young architects, Oscar Garcia, 36, and Teresa Martin, 32.
A remodeling of a bank on swank Fifth Avenue will offer a lively
cocktail of tapering roof, curving elevations and sloping canopies
that echo the Los Angeles school of sculptural design. A
once-influential magazine, Arquitectura Cuba, has restarted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a void between the late '60s and Gottardi's new
restaurant, but now, there is something in the air in the
architectural mood,'' said Emilio Castro, an architect and graphic
artist whose wall designs adorn A Prado y Neptuno.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the state has taken the view that ``we don't want to
insert new buildings into Old Havana until architects develop the
right sensibility,'' said Gina Rey, director of the Group for the
Integral Development of Havana, an urban planning authority. Its
philosophy was ``save first, then bring in the new,'' Ms. Rey
added. But with the approval of the Hotel Packard this week, and a
thumbs up for A Prado y Neptuno in the state newspaper, Granma,
contemporary architecture seems to be getting a government
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of conversations with Emilio Castro and several
other Cuban architects, they explained how over the last 30 years
they saw the role of the architect change from artist-builder to
technician. ``It was not about style; it was about the whole
structure of architectural practice,'' said Eduardo Luis Rodriguez,
editor of Arquitectura Cuba and author of ``Havana Guide: Modern
Architecture, 1925-1965'' ( Princeton Architectural Press in
February).
</P>
<P>
   After Fidel Castro took power in 1959, about two-thirds of
Cuba's architects left the island, said Raul Gonzalez Romero, a
professor at City University and a practicing architect since the
1950s. Those who chose to remain had to quit private practice to
work for the state. In its exuberant early years, the state
commissioned poetic civic structures like the five art schools,
which though decayed are open to the public today, and an ambitious
social building program. Even now, Gonzalez's face lights up as he
describes how in 1961, architecture students were sent into the
field to work with farmers on designing and building an
agricultural cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   But by the late 1960s, a few years after the abrupt termination
of the arts schools (originally commissioned by Fidel Castro and
designed by Ricardo Porro, Vittorio Garatti and Gottardi), the
government ceased to commission artistic civic architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years of mass construction of much needed pre-fabricated
social housing, schools and libraries followed. Architecture
education during this era focused on practical, problem-solving
projects and very little on the art of design. ``We had 40 hours of
instruction in space, form and color in five years,'' Ms. Martin, a
recent architecture graduate, said.
</P>
<P>
   After the opening of Cuba to foreign investment at the end of
the Cold War, a decade of bland international hotels and convention
and shopping centers followed. They now employ 90 percent of Cuba's
architects, Ms. Martin estimated, but the assignments offer little
chance for a personal style.
</P>
<P>
   Many architects still become frustrated and leave. Ana
Karakadze, 25, a Cuban interior designer who worked on hotels in
the tourist sea resort of Varadero before bolting for Miami six
months ago, said she found that ``when you try to be individual''
the state firms that deal with the investors ``start saying no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to do what the foreign people want you to do,'' Ms.
Karakadze added. ``You start feeling like you are a foreigner in
your own country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Karakadze, who now works in Coral Gables, Fla., says she
believes many Cuban architects who have left feel as she does,
``that in Cuba you don't have perspective or hope because you
always have to do what the government says.'' She added, ``Even to
buy doors the government has to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   But others who have stayed are feeling the winds of change. They
point to A Prado y Neptuno on the ground floor of a late
19th-century building on the patrician Paseo del Prado. It was
designed by Gottardi, 73, a gentle Italian who fell in love with
the Socialist ideology of Cuba nearly 40 years ago. He is probably
best known for his design of the School of Dramatic Arts, an
intriguing ``city'' of spare, Louis Kahn-like structures in a
network of slender alleyways reminiscent of his native Venice.
</P>
<P>
   A Prado y Neptuno was the brainchild of Eusebio Leal, famed city
historian and director of the restoration of Old Havana. It is
owned by Habaguanex, the Cuban enterprise that is financing the
restoration of Old Havana _ including a pending remodeling of a
1906 Catalonian Art Nouveau building by Emilio Castro _ with the
profits from its restaurants and hotels. An Italian co-investor,
Arsia International, commissioned Gottardi.
</P>
<P>
   Though modest compared with the groundbreaking art schools, A
Prado y Neptuno offers a modern interior in a historic district.
Dining areas are decked out in a lively eclecticism that Gottardi
says is part of the Cuban tradition. There are Macintosh-inspired
chairs in the dining room, Roy Lichtenstein look-alike panels by
Emilio Castro in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   A mural of Gottardi's favorite designers cheekily places
Philippe Starck, Frank Lloyd Wright, Carlo Scarpa, Charles Rennie
Macintosh and Louis Kahn center stage (it includes his own likeness
as a young man).
</P>
<P>
   Down the road at the corner of Paseo del Prado and Carcel is the
site of the Packard Hotel, by Garcia and Ms. Martin for the state
firm Maceo. The two, who earn $15 a month each no matter how large
the project, still believe themselves to be among the lucky
beneficiaries of a slowly changing system. Garcia said, ``Money is
welcome, but more important is to try to make contemporary
architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the Packard Hotel is the project of a state firm, Garcia's
and Ms. Martin's other project, the Banco Financiero Internacional,
came to them personally from the National Union of Artists and
Writers of Cuba, a state association that includes selected
architects. ( Garcia and Ms. Martin were invited to be members this
week.) The union can hand out plum assignments to favorite
architects.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban and foreign businesses sometimes enter into arrangements
with cultural institutions, like the union. These institutions will
enlist an artist or architect who may get paid an unregulated fee
but does not always attach his or her name publicly to the project.
</P>
<P>
   These arrangements result in the odd situation where architects
of some of the most adventurous new designs are keeping quiet about
their involvement, even concealing the location of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this system of cultural sponsorship, even if architects
often remain anonymous, is countering 30 years of big, bad building
by the Construction Ministry and, Garcia says, letting a few
architects contribute to ``the cultural patrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   One architect took a reporter to see his new building in a town
away from Havana that he asked not to be identified. Suffused in
the peach halo of a rainy sunset was the skeleton, the size of a
large bungalow.
</P>
<P>
   The architect concealed the building's real purpose _ a church,
built with private financing. Rather than go through the process of
trying to get a rare government permit, he called it a residence
and configured it like a house, hoping for a ``change of use''
permit down the line.
</P>
<P>
   The architect has neither signed the drawings nor kept them in
his possession. No, thank you, the project cannot be published in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Perez of the City University says the reason for this
re-emergence of a more confident architectural voice is the 1980s
generation of graduates, who are more questioning than their Cold
War forbears.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is rare in that he has his own office and designs private
houses. ``Designing private residences is kind of rare in Cuba,''
he said, ``because they typify the architecture of capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his hometown, San Antonio de los Banos, outside Havana,
Perez has built a string of houses for friends that are variations
on the traditional Cuban courtyard homes, in poured concrete and
concrete block rather than of stone or brick.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is also part of a group calling for the preservation of
Havana beyond the boundaries of the Old Havana district, especially
of the arts schools, presently disintegrating in a sea of tropical
vegetation. The most optimistic architects still want to pursue
careers in their country.
</P>
<P>
   Gottardi lives in a crumbling concrete slab building from the
early 1970s. His small apartment is lined with architecture books,
pictures of his wife, who is a dancer, and Che Guevara. He said
that while the lack of maintenance of his buildings is frustrating,
creatively, he is satisfied in Cuba. ``There are many things that
are not about consumerism,'' he said, adding, ``I need other things
that I find here.''
</P>
<P>
   On a warm September evening, Gottardi was having drinks at Prado
y Neptuno with Garcia and Ms. Martin, his former students, in front
of a green and purple neon installation that celebrates the
enganadora, a famous cha-cha that begins with the line ``A Prado y
Neptuno.'' They must raise their voices to compete with that of
Fidel Castro, delivering a speech on the loud overhead television.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, a part of the dollar economy of Havana, is at an
intersection of the city that sees grand, patched-together,
pre-revolution Chevrolets and post-revolution Ladas parade by in
the daytime. Tonight, in their place, are shiny European, Korean
and Japanese compact cars, the property of Cuban officials, or
those who have been granted permission to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   For architects like Gottardi, Garcia and Ms. Martin, it is a
place where their power, perhaps even their blood, is seeping back
into architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to find a space in the culture,'' Garcia said.

TREASURY PRICES WAIT FOR FRIDAY'S EMPLOYMENT REPORT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury prices were little changed Wednesday as
investors failed to follow through on early buying. Market
participants wound up instead focusing on the employment report
coming on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The oversold condition of the market could have been a factor
behind Wednesday's early bounce in prices as some investors sought
attractive yields, which are hovering near two-month highs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the decision by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday to
leave short-term interest rates unchanged helped ease some fears
about inflation. However, the central bank's indication that it is
leaning toward an increase in the future is also keeping economic
data squarely in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Ablin, president of Colonial Asset Management Inc. in
Jacksonville, Fla., said investor sentiment traditionally played a
large role in trading, ``and it's that sentiment that has pushed
the limit on the low side of prices over the past few days, a
definite negative for bonds. However, near term, it has become a
positive because investors probably have oversold, and that leaves
some buying opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 2/32, to 99 13/32.
Its yield was unchanged at 6.17 percent. A two-year note, on the
other hand, slipped 2/ 32, to 99 22/32. Its yield rose to 5.79
percent from 5.76 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the underlying concern is with wages and labor and
consumer spending,'' Ablin said. ``People are spending at a faster
clip than they are earning, which is a concern for the Fed. I don't
see much happening between now and Friday, when the September
employment report is released.'' He said a big number would hurt
bonds and was not so sure a low number would change the negative
psychology of the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect a gain of 225,000 jobs, with the unemployment
rate at 4.3 percent, up from 4.2 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the
fixed-income department at the J.W. Genesis Financial Corp., Boca
Raton, Fla., said the employment data had the potential to give the
Fed the impetus to raise rates even before its next meeting, which
is on Nov. 16. ``Yesterday, the Fed issued its
bias-toward-tightening warning, and in my opinion it will indeed
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the trading was thin, with some hedge-fund selling,'' he
added. ``But in reality, market participants were basically in a
wait-and-see mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Treasury auctioned $7 billion of 29{-year
Treasury inflation-indexed securities, or the reopening of the 3~
percent 30-year inflation-indexed bond originally issued April 15,
1999. The auction itself was on the weak side as the bid-to-cover,
an indication of demand, came in at 1.92 to 1. Traders said the
bonds were awarded with a high yield of 4.138 percent.

 &HT;    Bradley makes Internet integral to his campaign
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaking to a group of Iowa farmers last month,
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley drew a round of chuckles over a
seemingly offhand remark about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Technology was moving so quickly, Bradley said, that no
self-respecting politician could run for president today without an
Internet site. ``By the way,'' he added, ``mine is
www.billbradley.com.''
</P>
<P>
   The aside was anything but casual. Since he launched his uphill
battle for the Democratic nomination last December, Bradley has
followed a deliberate strategy of linking his Web site to his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is paying off. Last week, Bradley reported that he
raised $650,000 from his Web site through Sept. 30. Although that
is only a fraction of the $18.4 million Bradley has taken in, it
far surpasses anything raised online by other presidential
contenders, including Vice President Gore, who has fashioned
himself as the technology candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dramatic breakthrough,'' said Don Goff, professor
of information and telecommunications studies at the University of
Maryland. ``Bradley has definitely been very aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   While online fund-raising won't replace the $1,000-per-person
dinners that have become the lifeblood of federal and state
elections today, Bradley's success is the latest indication of how
the Internet is broadening the reach of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of the $650,000 Bradley has raised came from
donors who billed their credit cards online, just as if they were
ordering merchandise from an online store. The others downloaded a
form and mailed in a check.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Reed, Bradley's Internet consultant, said the campaign
hasn't analyzed what sort of people are giving. But Reed said she
believes the donors follow the demographics of the Internet,
meaning younger, technology-savvy users who are comfortable
supplying personal and financial information over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that our donors are by and large not traditional
Democratic donors,'' said Reed, who developed the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign Web site. ``These are not the usual suspects that get
invited to Democratic fund-raisers at $1,000 a pop.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1 percent of those visiting Bradley's Web site wind up
making a contribution, and about 12 percent fill out some type of
personal information that the campaign uses to build a nationwide
volunteer base.
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley's visibility increases, so do the donations.
Bradley's online contributions for the month of September, for
example, almost exceeded what he raised in the preceding five
months.
</P>
<P>
   September marked the beginning of a high-profile media blitz for
the candidate, who returned to his native Crystal City, Mo., for a
fall kickoff speech.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,600 people logged on to Bradley's site in September,
making contributions of $203,232, for an average donation of about
$129, according to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Bradley has sought to publicize his Web site
every chance he gets. The site address appears on all the podiums
that he speaks from, and no audience is too big or too small for
Bradley to let slip a mention of it, as he did with farmers in
Ottumwa, Iowa, last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he's on national television and can manage to work
it in on television in an unobtrusive way, he does,'' said Reed.
The site costs about $18,000 a month to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was also the first presidential candidate to petition
the Federal Election Commission to receive federal matching
contributions from credit card payments, which the FEC had banned.
The FEC approved the request this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done well is integrate the Web site and the
Internet strategy into the strategy of the campaign, which has the
effect of increasing traffic, which has the effect of bringing in
money,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the top fund-raiser of the 2000
campaign with more than $56 million, has raised only about $100,000
from his Web site, www.georgewbush.com, since he launched his
presidential bid in March, according to spokeswoman Mindy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has delivered several major speeches on the Internet,
has also invested heavily in his Web site, www.algore- 2000.com. So
far, Gore has raised about $115,000 from online contributions,
according to campaign spokeswoman Kiki Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus around the Web has been far more organizational,''
said Moore, noting that Gore has raised more money from small
donors than Bradley. ``We have not relied on the Web to get our
lower dollar contributors.''

SPORTS COLUMN: PATIENCE SAVES PETTITTE AND YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Pettitte pitches for the Yankees on Thursday
night, entrusted with the responsibility of sending the Texas
Rangers home knowing the odds of their winning this division series
equate to Elizabeth Dole's chances of pulling out the Republican
presidential nomination against George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That Pettitte is the Game 2 starter is, granted, due to Joe
Torre's reluctance to pitch him in Texas. That Pettitte is still a
Yankee and is throwing in the post-season at all is more a tribute
to the way the Yankees have operated since their mid-1990s
renaissance following 15 years of Let's Make A Deal. Who would have
believed a mere half-dozen years ago that in George Steinbrenner's
eruptive world, the organization's watch word, indeed its governing
principle, would be patience?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything I learned from Joe Torre, it's that you
have to trust people, and that a track record is something you can
trust,'' General Manager Brian Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   We can all still visualize Steinbrenner's ranting at the
television or into his telephone, and lighting fire to the trading
card of those failing under pressure. But let's be fair; it has
been awhile since a Yankee has been given the Jim Beattie or Bobby
Meacham treatment, fallen through the trap door to Columbus, or
been forever banished from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Winning two World Series in three years and more games than any
team in history last season has had something to do with becalming
the Boss. But so have self-assured men such as Torre and Cashman,
and Buck Showalter and Bob Watson before them.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had good reason to worry about Pettitte's declining
performance and financial considerations about coming arbitration
for the pitcher who had the second-most victories combined in the
major leagues the three seasons past. As Pettitte struggled and
this season's trade deadline approached, Torre's two cents said it
was the wrong time to pass judgment on a 27-year-old only months
removed from seven-and-a-third shutout innings in the clinching
game of the 1998 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees came to the logical conclusion that Pettitte was
worth more to them than what they could get for him. Steinbrenner
began most of his justifications with lines like, ``The manager
assures me ...''
</P>
<P>
   Besides paying a good buck, he is still quite adept at passing
it. Whatever. Torre stayed with his sensitive left-hander, who
pitched reliably, if not formidably, in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy for me to be supportive of him because I never
played in the post-season and I always respected the guy who would
go out there and perform,'' Torre said. ``He bottomed out in a game
at Chicago, but once he had two good starts under his belt, it just
became a mind game and he had his confidence back.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer interested in trading theories about the hows and
whys, Pettitte said, ``The first half of this season seems like
last year.'' He takes the ball Thursday night and tries to reward
the Yankees for their patience, the way Bernie Williams did in Game
1 on Tuesday night with six runs batted in and a sliding catch that
prevented two Texas runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees might have jettisoned Williams, too, when he refused
to sign before the 1998 season for less than half of what he
eventually would get. The popular notion blowing hard through New
York then was that the Yankees couldn't let their center fielder
take a free-agent hike and get nothing in return. How ridiculous
that position seems now, not to mention last November's brainstorm
to pollute the clubhouse with Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitches that Aaron Sele threw with two strikes on him, 95
percent of the hitters swing at those,'' said Doug Melvin, the
Rangers' general manager, who as the Yankees' director of scouting
signed Williams for $15,000 in 1985. ``The thing I admire about
Bernie is his patience at the plate. Great patience.''
</P>
<P>
   On that score, Williams is not alone in the lineup. A team once
embodied by an impetuous man in a turtleneck knit is hailed now for
its intelligent hitters who torture pitchers deep into the count.
By a manager who strikes a dugout pose so relaxed you occasionally
wonder if he's indifferent, or asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Patience is more than a virtue, it's virtually the essential
staple of this sport. These Yankees did not panic earlier this
season when left field looked bare, or when the second baseman
couldn't throw the ball, or when their division lead wasn't very
big. These Yankees tend to bank on track record, on trust. That's
no guarantee they will win the World Series, or even Game 2
Thursday night. Only that they have given themselves their very
best shot. &QL;

 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Money magazine named San Francisco the best big city in the
country to live in. The magazine, which is apparently geared toward
readers with moolah to spare, said the city has good air quality,
first-rate museums, sports and the most restaurants per resident of
any city in the country. The story also mentioned a ``wide range of
recreational opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the latest edition of National Geographic Traveler
magazine _ whose editors are more moved by poetry than quantities
of menus and racketball courts _ includes San Francisco in the 50
Places of a Lifetime listed in its ``World's Greatest
Destinations'' issue. Writes  &UR; George Leonard &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometime after midnight, you are awakened from a deep sleep by
the sensation that your house has been jarred by something
shockingly heavy. A second later, the familiar motion begins. ...
Crescendo becomes diminuendo. You start breathing again. You lie
there in the stillness, and it seems the moon is drifting ghostly
music down the starlit sky into the room, turning the bureau, the
chair, the mirror a pale silver. The sounds of the city float in to
blend with the moonlight's silent song.''

 &HT;    Paper shredders remain key issue in suit against Coca-Cola
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Were documents destroyed or weren't they?
</P>
<P>
   And if so, did they contain relevant information in the racial
discrimination suit against Coca-Cola?
</P>
<P>
   Those two questions are at the heart of a fiercely contested
dispute between the lawyers for both sides, with the plaintiffs'
attorneys firing the latest shot Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The issue goes to the very core of each side's credibility. In
fact, each side already has asked the federal judge in the case to
punish its opponent for making misleading statements to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which denies it has discriminated against
African-American employees, insists it has not shredded relevant
documents in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' attorneys, however, said in another legal filing
Wednesday that Coca-Cola's own documents, including internal memos
and an invoice, show the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ The company planned to place a ``heavy duty, commercial
strength'' paper shredder in a special room it was organizing to
collect data for the suit.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company ``specifically planned to shred a large volume of
paper with this machine.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The company's litigation department ``purchased shredders
almost immediately after plaintiffs filed their class-action
claims'' on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   _ The litigation department has in fact shredded material
connected to the suit. The plaintiffs added, however, that they do
not know if relevant material was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, the company has targeted numerous documents for
destruction. In this case, plaintiffs' attorneys alleged, the
information would not be destroyed by shredding, but by
disintegration in a confidential refuse disposal system.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola emphatically disputes these contentions, arguing that
the plaintiffs' attorneys are deliberately misinterpreting what the
documents show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is completely irresponsible of plaintiffs' counsel,''
company spokesman Ben Deutsch said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, there has never been a shredder in our data
collection room, and our evidence strongly supports that,'' Deutsch
said. ``Secondly, and most importantly, we have never destroyed any
discoverable documents or data, period.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also said:
</P>
<P>
   _ It set up the data room to compile a huge volume of employment
information that the plaintiffs are legally entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   _ While the company said it once considered the idea of using
shredders in that room, it also said it immediately vetoed that
idea. Instead, the company said, it decided to discard miscopies
and extra copies of confidential documents in special refuse bins.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company also said those bins have never been emptied of
those documents, so the information has never been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company also said one of its attorneys purchased a
shredder for his office. But, the attorney said he has never
shredded any ``documentation to which plaintiffs in this litigation
would even arguably be entitled.'' The lawyer said he is using the
shredder to ``dispose of duplicate copies of correspondence to and
from our outside counsel, drafts of pleadings and other court
papers submitted in this case, and privileged internal litigation
strategy memoranda.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this issue would have been a considerably smaller one
had the company mentioned at an earlier opportunity that it once
considered using shredders in its data room and that one of its
attorneys purchased a shredder for his office.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the plaintiffs raised the shredding issue with the
court after receiving an anonymous June 14 letter saying there were
shredders in ``a document destruction room.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, a company attorney wrote a June 23 letter to U.S.
District Judge Richard Story saying that there are no shredders in
the room and that no data are being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch said that letter was a ``full and accurate response'' to
the issue the plaintiffs' attorneys raised at the time. But the
plaintiffs disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly troubling is Coca-Cola's failure to reveal its
purchase and use of a shredder in response to the anonymous
letter,'' plaintiffs' attorneys wrote Wednesday. It was only after
they continued to pursue the matter did that information come out,
the plaintiffs said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge will now weigh all this conflicting information before
ruling on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Four current and former employees allege that Coca-Cola has
discriminated against African-American employees in pay, promotions
and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status to represent
1,500 other black salaried employees in the United States.

NFL AWARDS HOUSTON, NOT LOS ANGELES, 32ND FRANCHISE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Photo available on the NYT database) 
(Eds.: Optional trim and ending included) 
 
By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The National Football League awarded its 32nd
franchise to businessman Bob McNair on Wednesday, agreeing to
return to Houston in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a record $700 million transaction, the NFL agreed to
McNair's stipulation that Houston get the first available Super
Bowl, likely in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners, tired of debating expansion for more than two years,
chose a firm deal in Houston over a speculative one in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for Houston and I hope a great day for
football,'' McNair, founder of Cogen Technologies Inc., said upon
winning the franchise. ``Houston is in the hotbed of football, as
you all know. And Texas is a great area for football.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just delighted that we're able to bring the NFL back to
Houston,'' he said. ``We're going to have a world-class stadium.``
</P>
<P>
   League owners voted 29-0-2 to award McNair the franchise, with
the St. Louis Rams and Arizona Cardinals abstaining, during a short
meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The owners initially courted Los Angeles because it has about
three times as many television viewers as Houston. Last March, they
voted 29-2 to award Los Angeles the franchise, provided it could
come up with a satisfactory ownership team and stadium deal.
</P>
<P>
   But with no public money forthcoming, neither developer Ed Roski
nor Hollywood deal maker Michael Ovitz could complete a firm
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The owners said McNair's offer _ the highest ever made for any
U.S. sports team and at least $150 million more than the bids by
Roski or Ovitz _ was a major factor in the rapid conclusion of the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put up the biggest price there has ever been, that did the
job,'' said Tennessee Titans owner Bud Adams, who initially held
out for $1 billion but eventually supported McNair. Adams moved the
Houston Oilers to Tennessee after the 1996 season and later changed
the name to Titans.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who 18 months ago thought the fee might be as low as
$400 million, said he made the $700 million offer to distinguish it
from any of the vague proposals from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Steve Patterson, executive vice president of
McNair's Houston NFL Holdings, ``If you're in a heavyweight bout,
you can't outpoint the champion, you have to knock him out.``
</P>
<P>
   But owners and league officials said other considerations put
Houston ahead of Los Angeles. McNair was able to promise the city
would use public financing to help build a state-of-the-art stadium
and the ownership team would be of a quality that Los Angeles had
not shown it could match, said NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue praised Houston's plans for a retractable-roof
stadium, allowing games to be played in comfort whatever the
weather. Coupled with anticipated improvements at the Astrodomain
Complex and a rail linking downtown with the complex, Houston
likely could get several Super Bowls in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue also said Houston's fan base appears to be stronger
than Los Angeles', an indication the city can sell out more games
and avoid the television blackouts the league loathes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the overall sense that (Houston) was virtually certain
to be a guaranteed success and that we didn't have that kind of
pulse in Los Angeles,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Owners also complimented McNair, lauding the patience and
perseverance he has shown in the two-year process. They also said
he is a visionary businessman who can help the league find new ways
to market the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob's such a class act, and Houston's a great football town,''
said Expansion Committee Co-Chairman Bob Kraft, owner of the New
England Patriots. ``It's a first-class stadium. The ownership and
stadium speak volumes about the future of the NFL.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McNair, at a Houston press conference with Mayor Lee Brown,
said, ``It's especially pleasing to me for us to win this victory
because I don't think Houston's been shown the proper respect in
this process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to bite our tongue a few times and be very patient. But
we felt like that we would prevail in the end and that we had the
best opportunity for the NFL, and the proposal that we submitted to
them was clearly superior to any others.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners said there was little discussion in the Wednesday meeting
about Houston's bid, especially after Tagliabue had been unable to
get Ovitz into a bidding war the night before. Instead, the owners'
hourlong talk Wednesday centered on how to restructure a 32-team
league.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed to begin the 2002 season with eight divisions, four
each in the American Football and National Football Conferences.
The exact alignment is to be determined later, but one current AFC
team will have to move to the NFC. Each conference now has three
divisions, one with six teams and the others with five.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said a decision will be made later about the makeup of
the eight divisions, but the Houston franchise will play in the AFC
and the Cowboys will remain in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Cleveland Browns owner Al Lerner, who paid his $470
million franchise upon receipt of the 31st expansion franchise last
year, McNair will have five years to pay the $700 million. He will
make $150 million payments every Jan. 15 from 2000 until 2005, then
a final $100 million Jan. 15, 2004.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, 2002, McNair will begin collecting television and
marketing revenues, giving him almost three years of earnings to
help pay the franchise fee.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's fee is the highest for a professional franchise in this
country. In May, Daniel Snyder paid $800 million for the Washington
Redskins, but in that deal he got $50 million in cash and a stadium
valued at $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he realized he was paying a premium, but he expects
the team to earn a profit after the start-up years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly more than I ever anticipated,'' McNair said.
``But I think that we can have a successful football operation and
if I didn't think we could do that, I would not submit that bid.
But I think it raised . . . the expectations to a new level.``
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the decision was based
more on the league wanting to expand rather than owners splitting
an expansion fee. He noted that team owners will give up about $1
billion in revenue to McNair in his first 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to have 32 teams to create a competitive balance,
and we needed to be in Houston,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Other terms of the deal:
</P>
<P>
   _ McNair's team will get the first pick in the 2002 NFL draft
and an additional pick in each round during 2002 and 2003 drafts.
The arrangement is the same as Cleveland's.
</P>
<P>
   _ The league will waive a requirement that he share 34 percent
of permanent seat license sales with the other franchise owners.
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he now must set up an office to sell at least 75 of
the proposed 110 luxury suites at the stadium by mid-January, a
requirement set by the NFL. The marketing office will also begin
selling Personal Seat Licenses, which are expected to provide $50
million toward stadium construction and design.
</P>
<P>
   A phone line already has been established for fans seeking to
get on a priority list for season tickets. Requests to be placed on
the list will be accepted beginning at 9 a.m. today. The number is
1-877-635-2002.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston NFL Holdings will eventually seek community input for a
team name and colors. McNair said he doesn't have one in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to have a name that is reflective of the area of
the country that we represent, and we will go through that process
and ask our fans to help out with our selection,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the Oilers name ``has been retired, like the
jersey of a great player.``

 &HT;    OUTDATED APPROACHES SEEN TO TWENTY-FIRST CENTUIRY WAR THREATS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. defense establishment is responding to
rapidly changing 21st century threats with outdated Cold War
concepts, according to an expert on non-standard defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a conference on chemical and biological threats,
Robert Carnes, former director of the Marine Corps' ``Deep
Futures'' combat planning progam, warned that defense planners and
weapons developers continue to rely more heavily on ideas that were
relevant to the nation-against-nation struggles of the past than on
military realities ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was sponsored by Jane's Information Group, the
London-based publisher of books and periodicals on military
technology. Particpants, who paid over $800 each to attend,
consisted primarily of officials of the U.S. Secret Service, the
Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Department intelligence
agencies and other federal departments.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, Texas, police Detective Jim Neilson and hazardous
materials Fire Chief David Fiero were among a handful of local
public safety officials to at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are returning to the state that existed in the pre-1600s,
when wars were fought over race or religion or within countries,''
said Carnes, now a research associate professor at Georgetown
University School of Medicine. Europe is ``replete'' with
circumstances leading to such warfare, he said, but military
establishments continue to prepare as if planning to fight a war
against another country.
</P>
<P>
   He also warned that developers of the technology on which
federal, state and local officials must depend in cases of
terrorist attacks with chemical or biological weapons are still too
wedded to outdated concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the threat and what are we trying to achieve?'' he
asked. ``The threat could be stolen phosgene gas or anhydrous
ammonia or some guy in his basement, stirring up a biological
agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Phosgene was a nerve gas used during World War I and is now used
as a commercial feeder chemical. More than 3.2 billion pounds will
be produced legally in the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
   Anhydrous amonia is the fertilizer ingedient used to manufacture
the bomb that blew up the federal office building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson said he thought the Austin fire and police departments
were somewhat unusual among U.S. cities in the advance cooperation
they have undertaken to prepare for a potential chemical or
biological terrorist incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can jointly get together the equipment and procedures
worked out in advance, we won't end up at some disaster, trying to
decide who does what, `` said Neilson, who said he works out of the
police department bomb squad.

 &HT;    ANGRY PRESIDENT BLASTS HOUSE REPUBLICANS
 &HT;    Eds: Adds graf 16-19 with Lott comments.
 &HT;    400&AMP;add.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Political squabbling between the White House and
Capitol Hill erupted into open hostility Wednesday when an angry
President Clinton accused House Republicans of selling out to the
health insurance industry to try to kill proposed consumer
protections.
</P>
<P>
   After accusing Senate Republicans of playing politics with
national security policy and discriminating against minority
judicial appointments, Clinton turned his furor toward the
Republican leadership in the House.
</P>
<P>
   He said his House foes cooked up a legislative scheme ``in the
dead of the night'' Tuesday to tack on rules and amendments
amounting to ``poison pills'' that ``practically guarantee'' the
defeat of a bill that Clinton contends would strengthen consumers
in their dealing with large health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a travesty,'' Clinton told reporters, charging that
the Republican leadership in the House had ``blatantly put special
interests ahead of the interests of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke as though the White House had given up on the
prospects for passage of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was supposed to be the day the American people have long
waited for, the day a bipartisan majority passed a strong patients'
bill of rights,'' said Clinton. ``But, unfortunately, as a result
of an 11th-hour appeal by the insurance industry lobbyists, which
all of you reported on yesterday, once again it appears that the
will of the American people will be thwarted.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, was even more blunt,
suggesting that insurance lobbists had influenced House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., with $1,000 contributions to his political
action committee at a breakfast Tuesday morning on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sat down over bacon and eggs and they hatched a plan to
make sure that the majority of Americans were thwarted in their
belief that they should have more rights in dealing with their
HMOs,'' said Lockhart, referring to health care plans offered by
health maintainence organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was suggesting that Hastert was bought off at
the breakfast, Lockhart replied: ``I'm suggesting that it was
probably a pretty productive meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has denied that the donations affected his decision to
oppose the proposals, contained in legislation sponsored by Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., and Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga. The House is
scheduled to vote on the measure Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's broadside marked a sharp escalation in what has been
an increasingly contentious season for Clinton and the
Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats and Republicans have
accused each other of political posturing on issues to position
themselves for the presidential and congressional elections next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several weeks, Clinton has vetoed the Republicans'
$792 billion tax cut plan and haggled publicly over congressional
spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton launched a full-court press to try to counter
Republican opposition in the Senate to the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, which would ban the testing of nuclear weapons in the
United States and 153 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, he railed against the Senate for quashing his
nomination of Ronnie White to the federal district court in
Missouri. The Senate's Republican majority rejected White, the
first African-American to sit of the Missouri Supreme Court, in a
straight party-line vote, 54-45, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing White House reporters in the Rose Garden, Clinton
called White's defeat ``a disgraceful act of partisan politics.''
The move, said Clinton, ``is adding credence to the perceptions
that they treat minority and women judicial nominees unfairly and
unequally.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks, echoing a written statement Clinton put out the day
before, drew a swift retort from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton should be ashamed of his accusation that
Judge Ronnie White was rejected by the Senate because of his
race,'' Lott said in a prepared statement. ``These are baseless
accusations which I deeply resent. The president has impugned the
integrity of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott went on to blast White's record on the bench, saying police
in Missouri and nationwide opposed the nomination and that White's
record ``was so bad that his was the first judicial nomination in
the 6 1/2 years of the Clinton presidency rejected by the full
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the Senate's fairness, Lott said the body has
confirmed 21 judicial nominees this year, ``including four women,
one African American and four Hispanic candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans claimed that White had shown insufficient support
for the death penalty during his career, a charge the White House
went to pains to refute.
</P>
<P>
   The White House press office put out a statement saying that as
a justice on the Missouri State Supreme Court, White had affirmed
the imposition of the death penalty in ``almost 70 percent of the
cases that came before him,'' and that he acted in unanimity with
the rest of the court in 10 of the 18 instances in which he voted
against imposing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton still trying to persuade Senate Republicans to back
the nuclear test ban treaty _ he held an East Room event Wednesday
to appeal again for its ratification _ and many of the spending
bills for the fiscal year that began last Friday still being
negotiated, the air of mounting discord between the White House and
Capitol Hill bodes poorly for its prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart insisted that Clinton stands ready to deal with his
Republican antagonists, but he made no effort to sugar-coat the
animosity that broke out into the open on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Said Lockhart, ``The president is upset.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the measure of corporate America's financial
health is its ability and willingness to increase dividends to
shareholders, then you might think the country is in a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. reports that 117 companies announced
dividend increases in September, 10 fewer than had raised their
payouts a year earlier. It was the 15th consecutive month that the
number of dividend increases was down year-over-year.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, such a long string of relative bad news is not
extraordinary, even though you might expect that more and more
companies would raise dividends every year simply because the
number of stocks traded rises every year.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual is that the economy is doing so well even while
companies are growing more reluctant to raise their dividends. This
is the seventh such streak of at least 15 months since S&AMP;P began
counting dividend increases back in 1955. In all but one of the six
previous runs, there was a recession in the period. Recessions, of
course, usually mean sharp falloffs in corporate profits. So a
dearth of dividend increases in such periods should be expected.
</P>
<P>
   The exception _ the time when companies cut back on dividend
increases even as the economy continued to grow _ is the most
interesting case, with perhaps the most relevance to the current
situation. From August 1966 through March 1968, there was a string
of 21 months in which the number of dividend increases kept
falling.
</P>
<P>
   That came during the longest expansion in American history,
which began in 1961 and ended in 1969. The current expansion is the
second longest, and will take over the top spot if, as seems
likely, no recession starts by February.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the late-1960s market, memorably called ``the go-go
years'' by the business writer John Brooks, bears more than a
passing resemblance to this one. The stock market had been going up
steadily for the better part of two decades, amid increasing public
participation and interest. Mutual fund managers became media stars
as their funds soared through the purchase of small technology
stocks that zoomed in price. There was a huge wave of mergers, many
financed by issuing highly valued stock.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, however, the good days were nearing an end. It was not
just that a recession hit at the end of 1969. It was that the stock
market was also entering a long period of poor returns that would
lead to widespread public rejection of stocks as an investment
vehicle. While the major indexes would move to marginal new highs
the next few years, the big gains were over. Fourteen years after
1968, in 1982, stock prices were still below the 1968 highs.
</P>
<P>
   There are differences, of course. An important one now is the
spread of stock options as a major form of compensation for
corporate executives. Option holders benefit from price rises in
the stocks of their companies, but not from dividends that are paid
while they hold the options. That provides an incentive for
companies to hold down dividends and, instead, distribute money to
shareholders by repurchasing stock. Such stock repurchases are
popular and many companies have borrowed money to buy back stock.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is that dividends are now far lower than they
were in 1968, at least as a percentage of the price of stocks. In
1968, the dividend yield on the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500
stocks when the index peaked was 2.8 percent. That was, in fact, a
very low figure by historical standards. But now the yield is about
1.3 percent, well below half that level.
</P>
<P>
   Dividends can go so low because investors do not care much about
them. It is capital gains that have made them rich, and it is the
pursuit of capital gains that drives stock investments now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies love this flexibility, not being tied into a fixed
dividend that may be a struggle to pay,'' said Arnold Kaufman, the
editor of Standard &AMP; Poor's Outlook, a newsletter that tracks
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, companies have always loved such flexibility. What is
different is that investors have gradually come to believe that
payouts are unimportant, and so have not fought very hard for
higher payouts. ``It is working quite well for everyone involved,
except for those poor people who have come to depend on dividends
for living expenses,'' commented Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   After 1968, as it became clear that capital losses were also
possible, investors came to value dividends, and the pressure grew
on companies to pay them. By the time the stock market hit bottom
in 1974, the dividend yield on the S&AMP;P 500 was up to 5.8 percent.
Part of the reason was that dividends had risen since 1968, but
most of the change reflected a fall in stock prices.

LIBERTARIANS BEGIN A PRESIDENTIAL DRAFT MOVEMENT FOR NEW MEXICO'S
GOVERNOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Minn, N.M.)    By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Embracing Gov. Gary E. Johnson's support of
legalizing drugs as a symbol of his political independence, a local
group announced Wednesday that it was starting a campaign to draft
him as the Libertarian Party candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   That the New Mexico governor is an unwavering Republican who has
already rejected the overture, saying he has no interest, has not
deterred the group's efforts to get his name on the ballot in all
50 states in time for next year's elections. Members of the group
said papers would be filed with the Federal Election Commission on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping he'll change his mind,'' Ashley Gauthier, an
Albuquerque lawyer and Republican-turned-Libertarian, said at a
news conference here, where she and others praised Johnson for
reducing taxes, promoting alternatives in public education and
challenging the Clinton administration to abandon its current drug
policies _ all favorite Libertarian positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the governor would be a good candidate,'' she added.
``Maybe he just doesn't realize how much the public supports him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Winter, a spokesman for the Libertarian Party, which is
based in Washington, said: ``The national office has to remain
neutral, but we understand the benefits of a high elected official
running for president. He would bring the party credibility it has
not had before.''
</P>
<P>
   While Reform Party candidates have enjoyed moderate success in
recent years, including the election of Jesse Ventura as governor
of Minnesota last November, no Libertarian has ever made much of an
impact at state or national levels. The party has run candidates
for president since 1972, but with negligible effect. Ed Clark, a
California lawyer, made the best showing when he won 921,199 votes
in 1980. Ronald Reagan, in a landslide victory over president Jimmy
Carter, won 43.8 million votes that year to Carter's 35.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot, the leading alternative candidate in the last two
presidential elections, carried the Reform banner and finished a
distant third, winning 19.7 million votes in 1992 and 8 million
four years later. The Libertarian candidate each year was well
behind that.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a 46-year-old triathlete who has acknowledged using
drugs in his youth, has insisted that his political life will end
when his second term expires in 2002. A former businessman who
never held public office before he was first elected in 1994, he
says he wants to climb mountains, not seek another office.
</P>
<P>
   But even by turning down the offer to run for president, the
governor has elevated the Libertarian profile through his campaign
to change tactics in fighting drugs by legalizing them, a strategy
that Libertarians have embraced for years. Speaking forcefully on
the issue for the last two months, Johnson made his case again
Wednesday in a speech at the Cato Institute, a research
organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, Libertarians favor shrinking the size and cost
of government and eliminating regulations that restrict free trade
and personal choices. More members of the party tend to be former
Republicans than former Democrats, and the party says it now has
active organizations in all 50 states and more than 300 party
members serving in elected positions in 36 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do consider it very flattering,'' Johnson said by telephone
before his speech, referring to the draft movement. ``But I'm a
Republican, and I'm not going to run for president.''
</P>
<P>
   If third-party candidates remain little more than outlets for
the disenfranchised and frustrated at the national level, they have
attained more serious status, especially the Green Party, here in
New Mexico. Johnson owes his political ascension in part to the
success of a Green candidate, Roberto Mondragon, in 1994.
Mondragon, a former Democrat, won 10 percent of the votes, enabling
Johnson to defeat the incumbent governor, Bruce King, a Democrat,
by 50 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Heather A. Wilson, a freshman Republican from Albuquerque,
also won because of a Green Party candidate. Last year she defeated
Phillip J. Maloof, a Democrat, by six percentage points while the
Green candidate, Robert L. Anderson, won 10 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Six Greens hold public office in New Mexico, including City
Council members in Sante Fe and Silver City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greens got their biggest boost ever in 1994,'' said F.
Chris Garcia, a political scientist at the University of New
Mexico. ``That was their biggest splash, and the ripples continue
to roll across New Mexico. It gave people the idea, `We can do
something,' although in almost all cases they have kept Democrats
from winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Johnson runs under the Libertarian banner or not, the
party plans to choose its presidential nominee at a convention next
summer in Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New Mexico, Libertarians are busy registering voters.
They need about 1,000 more to qualify as a major state party, which
would guarantee that Libertarian candidates would be listed on
state and local ballots.

FOUR ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH YOGURT SHOP SLAYINGS IN 1991

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nearly eight years after the crime stunned the
city, four men were arrested Wednesday in connection with one of
Austin's most painful memories _ the gruesome murders of four
teen-age girls during a 1991 yogurt shop robbery that netted $50.
</P>
<P>
   All four suspects were charged with capital murder in the
slayings of Eliza Hope Thomas, 17; Amy Ayers, 13; Jennifer
Harbison, 17, and her sister, Sarah, 15.
</P>
<P>
   Still calling it an unfinished investigation, officials shared
few details about the arrests or precisely what led them to the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   However, affidavits said one of the suspects, who was not
identified by police because he was a juvenile at the time of the
murders, first told authorities about their involvement eight days
after the grisly slayings, but police assumed he was lying.
</P>
<P>
   A second suspect also was not identified in the affidavits
because he was a juvenile when the crimes were committed Dec. 6,
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Although not identified by police, prosecutors identified them
in a detention hearing as Maurice Pierce, 24, and Forrest Wellborn,
23.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was arrested in the Dallas suburb of Lewisville and
Wellborn was picked up in Lockhart, about 30 miles south of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Pending indictment, both of the then-juveniles were placed in
the Travis County Jail in lieu of bonds of $1 million and $1.5
million. A judge will decide later whether to certify them for
trial as adults. If convicted as adults, their maximum sentence
would be life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Facing possible death sentences are two men who were 17 at the
time of the killings. Police said they arrested former Austin
resident Robert Burns Springsteen Jr., 26, in Charleston, W. Va.,
and Michael James Scott, 26, in Buda, about 20 miles south of
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, who were held without bond, provided police with
written statements last month confessing their guilt, according to
the arrest warrants filed in Travis County district court with the
juvenile's names blotted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the confession,'' the affidavit stated, ``Michael Scott
admits that he and (blank) Rob Springsteen and (blank) had planned
the robbery that evening and went in when the business was open to
case the place and unlock the back door.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went back after it was closed and while (blank) waited in
the car as a lookout, the others went inside the unlocked back
door, stole money from the store and shot and killed all 4 &UR;  &LR; of the
girls inside.''
</P>
<P>
   It continued: ``In his confession, Michael Scott gave details of
the crime that should have been known only by the killers,
including the items used as ligatures on the victims and placement
of the victims' bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, the affidavit by an Austin police detective said that
when Springsteen was interrogated Sept. 15 in West Virginia, he
``confirmed that he was carrying a semiautomatic handgun of the
same caliber as the shell casing that had been found at the
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   All four of the girls had been bound, gagged and shot twice in
the head before their bodies were nearly incinerated in a fire that
was deliberately set to conceal the crimes, police said. At least
one of the girls was sexually assaulted before being slain, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The brutality of the case spread panic through the city, still
associated with Charles Whitman's 1966 sniper attack from the
University of Texas tower that left 16 dead and 31 wounded. And 10
months later, the public got a sense of relief when two Mexican
citizens were arrested in Mexico City and supposedly confessed to
the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   However, the men were never charged and claimed they were
coerced into making false admissions. They remain incarcerated on
other charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that passed, family members won a $12 million civil
judgment against the shop owners and others for failing to provide
a safe workplace for the two victims who worked in the shop.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victim's parents became an outspoken critic of
workplace safety laws, while others tried to move on by moving away
from Austin to as far away as Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably has been no single event in our community that
has made us feel less like a sleepy college town than the murders
of those four young girls,'' said Mayor Kirk Watson.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we all asked how could something horrific, so
unexplainable, happen here. And no one could answer the question,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For eight years, we've all waited for the word that our police
department is close to a point of solving a crime that has haunted
our very souls, that they've been able to identify and arrest
suspects that they allege are responsible for one of the most
heinous crimes that our community has ever experienced. Today, we
finally get to hear those words,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Police Chief Sam Knee: ``That is what this case is about _
bringing to justice four individuals for the brutal murder of four
little girls.''
</P>
<P>
   He hailed the investigative team work shown by his department,
state and federal prosecutors, the Texas Rangers and the U.S.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all taken it personally, just as this entire community
has taken it personally,'' said Travis County District Attorney
Ronnie Earle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knee said the arrests resulted from a fresh look at the case
that was made possible by a downturn in Austin homicides, freeing
up investigators to re-examine old leads.
</P>
<P>
   One of those leads resulted from a simple arrest that occurred
Dec. 14, 1991, at a mall close to the yogurt shop, which never
reopened after the murders.
</P>
<P>
   According to the arrest warrants, one of the then-juveniles was
arrested at the mall that day for unlawfully carrying a weapon _ a
.22-caliber revolver that was in the waistband of his pants. Since
police knew that was the kind of gun used in the quadruple homicide
the previous week, detectives questioned the teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``During that questioning, (blank) told them that his gun had
been used in the murders, but that he had loaned it to (blank) that
night and (blank) had it at the time of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Blank) also told detectives details of what occurred inside
the yogurt shop during the murders, but said (blank) had just told
(blank) those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police questioned (blank) and decided that (blank) had not
done the murders and assumed that (blank) was lying and had just
made up the whole story about his gun being used,'' the detective's
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what happened to the gun or whether
it was tested at the time.

WANTED FOR RAPE: JOHN DOE, WHO IS KNOWN ONLY BY HIS DNA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Ohio, Ill., Calif., Ala., Va., Fla.)  (bl) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a novel legal gambit that stretches the law to
match the developing science of DNA, a prosecutor in Wisconsin has
filed rape and kidnapping charges against a defendant who has no
name. John Doe is known only by his DNA code, extracted from semen
samples from three rapes, samples which have been tested after six
years of storage in a police property room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that one person raped these three women,'' said the
prosecutor, Norman Gahn, assistant district attorney for Milwaukee
County. ``We just don't know who that person is. We will catch
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's strategy is an attempt to keep the six-year
time limit for bringing a charge from running out in the only one
of the three cases where that has not already happened. A warrant
must identify the person to be arrested, and this one names ``John
Doe, unknown male with matching deoxyribonucleic acid profile.''
The warrant, signed by a judge in September, will keep the statute
of limitations from expiring, which in this case would otherwise
happen in November. Now, every month, an FBI computer will compare
the numbers that describe John Doe's DNA with thousands of samples
from felons and crime scene evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The case reveals several gaps between the law and science. Can a
person be identified on a warrant by biometric evidence, such as a
DNA code or fingerprint, or is a more traditional behavioral
identification required, such as a name and date of birth? And is
the legal concept of a statute of limitations relevant in an age of
DNA testing of old evidence? Legal experts said the case would be
challenged, but has merit.
</P>
<P>
   The case also reveals the promise and limitations of the
national DNA databank, which is one year old this month.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention has focused on the promise. The FBI says the DNA
databank has helped solve 583 cases, such as the serial rapist in
Washington, D.C., linked with a serial rapist in Florida. Police
routinely collect DNA evidence not only in rape cases but from
saliva on beer cans left behind by a burglar, from sweat on a
baseball bat used in a beating, from blood on a bullet that passed
through a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Less attention has been paid to the holes in the system. Only 18
of 50 states are hooked into the FBI databank, known as the
Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), while the rest are working on
the technology and the funding. The databank is still far smaller
than the FBI's fingerprint bank. State crime labs are far behind in
their work. Much DNA evidence that is collected is never analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 180,000 rape kits _ evidence from only one type of
crime _ sit unexamined on shelves in police departments across the
nation, according to a new survey of police agencies commissioned
by the National Commission for the Future of DNA Evidence. These
flat rectangular boxes include blood vials, swabs of semen, a lock
of hair, and fingernail scrapings _ evidence collected from rape
victims in a humiliating ritual.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   New York City alone has 12,000 unexamined rape kits, and is
trying to reduce the backlog by contracting with private
laboratories. It has stopped destroying untested kits after five
years, but other police departments continue the practice.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the technology to solve these crimes, and we're not
doing it'' said Christopher Asplen, executive director of the DNA
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Many police departments still use DNA evidence as they have used
fingerprints and tire tracks, to rule a suspect in or out. But the
new DNA databanks make the evidence useful for matching cases to
convicted offenders, or to other cases in which a suspect may be
known.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the police agencies in the survey reported
that they test all or nearly all samples for DNA. About one-third
of the agencies test less often. And about one-quarter weren't
sure.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cities vary widely in their use of DNA testing. In Cleveland,
``We only do DNA testing when there's an identifiable suspect,''
said Lt. Edward Thiery, spokesman for the Cleveland Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, ``We now submit every sample for testing, but we
still have a backlog of untested samples,'' said Pat Camden,
spokesman for the Chicago Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the police department buys a new, 40-foot
refrigerated trailer truck every six months, just to hold DNA
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Los Angeles Police Department, right now, if you didn't
have a suspect in custody and a court date, that thing is not going
to get analyzed, whatever it is,'' Maria Foster, a detective
supervisor, told the DNA commission. ``When you got a court date,
when you go to trial, then it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The three DNA samples that identified a serial rapist in
Milwaukee were collected in 1993. In each case, on the city's north
side, a man grabbed a woman from behind, told her that he had a
knife, took her to a quiet place, raped her, and demanded money,
police said. After she reported the crime, vaginal and cervical
swabs of semen were collected at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The samples waited at the police evidence room, along with 2,300
other unexamined rape kits. To test them all would have swamped the
state crime lab, which already has a backlog.
</P>
<P>
   So Detective Lori Gaglione and her colleagues in the city's
Sensitive Crimes Unit winnowed down to the best cases, based mostly
on human factors, such as the availability of victims and
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   From the 53 samples that were tested, one case matched a
convicted rapist in Minnesota. Another matched a convicted rapist
elsewhere in Wisconsin, allowing charges to be filed only eight
hours before the statute of limitations expired.
</P>
<P>
   And the three samples were found to match each other.
</P>
<P>
   The law in Wisconsin, as in other states, requires that a
warrant identify the accused. If the name is not known, the law
allows identification ``by any description by which the person to
be arrested can be identified with reasonable certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My argument is going to be that genetic code goes well beyond
reasonable certainty,'' Gahn said. ``We're pushing the envelope as
far as we can. It does something for the victim of the sexual
assaullt, to know that someone cares and to know that we're out
there working on the case.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The forensic science supervisor in the state crime lab, Dirk
Janssen, said that the probability of randomly selecting an
unrelated individual who would have a DNA profile matching the
three samples would be approximately 1 in 7.25 billion _ more than
the world's population _ in the U.S. Caucasian population, and 1 in
1.96 billion in the African-American population.
</P>
<P>
   Such a John Doe warrant has been used at least one other time,
in a Kansas case in 1991. No one was caught, so the issue has not
been tested.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant appears to have merit, said Myrna Raeder, a
professor of law at Southwestern University in Los Angeles and the
former head of the criminal section of the American Bar
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not frivolous,'' Professor Raeder said. ``It's clearly
novel and therefore courts are really going to have to struggle
with the intention of the statute and whether the clear meaning of
the statute would cover this.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As in most states, only people convicted of sexual offenses in
Wisconsin are required to give samples for DNA testing. The
Legislature is on the verge of expanding that to all felony
offenses, as Alabama and Virginia have done. In addition, the
Legislature is considering eliminating the statute of limitations
in cases of rape, as Florida has done.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Doe warrants are most commonly used when the accused is know
by an alias or by a physical description. The Milwaukee case,
however, used only DNA information.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hope that someday, perhaps even 20 years from now, a
man will leave a cigarette behind at another rape, or cut himself
on broken glass at a burglary. His saliva or blood will be tested,
its DNA catalogued and entered in the FBI databank.
</P>
<P>
   And he will be charged with raping and kidnapping a woman in
Milwaukee on Nov. 9, 1993.

TAPES REVEAL NIXON'S USE OF ANTI-SEMITIC REMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The release of the latest batch of conversations
secretly taped by President Nixon depict him again as
un-self-consciously anti-Semitic, informing his aides at one point
that the communist conspiracy against the United States was made up
entirely of Jews except for Whitaker Chambers and Alger Hiss.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes also show the depth of his anger against The New York
Times for its publication in 1971 of the Pentagon Papers, the
government's secret history of activities that led to America's
involvement in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's anti-Semitism and his anger at The Times came together
when he demanded that no one in the White House provide any
information to the newspaper's Washington bureau, which was headed
at the time by Max Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give them anything,'' he tells his staff. ``And because
of that damned Jew Frankel all the time _ he's bad, you know. Don't
give him anything.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Frankel, who retired as executive editor of The
Times and now writes a column for the Times Sunday Magazine, said
of Nixon's comment: ``It's a vulgarity that puts me in very good
company. Almost a badge of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Frankel added that after Nixon left office and was trying
rehabilitate his image he wrote letters complementing Times
editorials and invited Frankel and other editors to his home for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of what is in the tapes has been depicted before as a
result of court decisions that made the recordings available to the
public through the National Archives.
</P>
<P>
   The latest batch of tapes consists of 445 hours of conversations
from February through July 1971, a period that includes publication
of the Pentagon Papers by The Times and the Supreme Court decision
upholding the newspaper's right to publish them.
</P>
<P>
   One person the White House suspected of supplying the Pentagon
Papers was Daniel Ellsberg, the Defense Department analyst.
Speaking of Ellsberg, Nixon says: ``Incidentally, I hope to God,
he's not Jewish, is he?''
</P>
<P>
   Another, unidentified voice, answers, ``I'm sure he is.
Ellsberg?''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon then says: ``I hope not, I hope not,'' adding, ``It's a
bad thing for us.'' The president then turned the conversation to
people targeted in investigations against communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only two non-Jews in the communist conspiracy,'' he said,
``were Chambers and Hiss. Many felt that Hiss was. He could have
been a half, but he was not by religion. The only two non-Jews.
Every other one was a Jew. And it raised hell with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Alger Hiss, a high-ranking State Department official, was
convicted of perjury for denying that he was a communist, and
Nixon's early reputation was built on his determination to get Hiss
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace Foundation in Yorba
Linda, Calif., issued a statement declaring that the president was
not anti-Semitic. Noting that he had many Jewish advisers, it said,
``The president's words about the Jewish community on these tapes
show that his basic sense of compassion and support for these
communities tends to coexist with terminology from an earlier
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The library added that Nixon appointed many Jews to high
positions in his administration and was a strong supporter of
Israel. ``The actions of the president, as well as the substantial
documentary record of the Nixon administration, should always be
kept in mind when evaluating his words on the White House tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes provide additional evidence that Nixon, who in public
criticized people who used foul language, used similar language in
private.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, 1971, Nixon again showed his penchant for singling
out Jews when an aide said Judge Murray I. Gurfein had been
assigned the case brought by the Nixon administration to halt
publication of the Pentagon Papers by The Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Gurfein fine,'' Nixon says. ``He's a Jew, a liberal.
But I think tough. I think tough. But he may be sucking up to the
liberal left. In New York, you just can't tell what happens to
those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon also wondered out loud whether Leslie Gelb, who had been
the director of policy planning at the Defense Department and was
then a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, had put copies
of the Pentagon papers in a safe at Brookings.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to his aide H.R. Haldeman, Nixon says: ``My point is,
Bob, my point is, we have got, we have here now, this, this is a
very bad situation, this guy is a radical that did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Haldeman suggests that it was Ellsberg.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon responds, ``Yeah, well, we don't know who the hell it is,
but maybe it's him, or maybe it's Gelb, one of the two, either's a
radical.'' He added, ``Somebody's got to go to jail for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelb, who was later a reporter and then an editor for The Times
and is now president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said
Wednesday that Nixon's mistrust of him was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no Pentagon Papers,'' Gelb said.

NFL GOES BACK TO HOUSTON FOR $700 MILLION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The value of professional sports teams took another
dramatic boost Wednesday when the National Football League approved
Robert McNair's $700 million bid for an expansion franchise in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's purchase of the franchise will be the most expensive in
American sports history, and the approval ended for now rival
efforts to win a new NFL franchise for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   League officials also voted to realign from six divisions _ five
with five teams and one with six _ into eight divisions of four
teams each. While no details were given, the realignment may
resolve some of the league's geographical anomalies. The new
Houston franchise will begin play in 2002. It seems likely that the
realignment will occur then, too, but league officials did not say
when realignment would take place.
</P>
<P>
   As an expansion fee, the $700 million sum is staggering, because
McNair's team has no past, no players, no name, no logo, no fan
clubs. Only six years ago, Jacksonville and Carolina paid $140
million expansion fees. Last year, Alfred Lerner paid $530 million
for the renascent Cleveland Browns franchise, which has revived the
team's history, colors and fan base. The Redskins were sold to a
group led by Daniel Snyder in May for $805 million, but $160
million is earmarked to pay the debt on the team's privately owned
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awful lot of money,'' McNair said after the 29-to-2
vote here by the league's owners. ``But we've got a tremendous
product in NFL football, and a stadium that'll knock your socks
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston team will play in a planned $310 million stadium to
be built next to the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McNair, an energy billionaire, said his offer ``went
higher than any reasonable person would go.'' But Wednesday, as he
carried a football after his bit was approved, he said, ``I'm more
than happy with the number.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair's bid knocked two Los Angeles rivals out of the running.
Groups led by Michael Ovitz, the talent manager, and Eli Broad, a
financial-services billionaire, competed, sometimes rancorously, to
return a team to the city for the first time since the Raiders left
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 700 million shocked the league,'' Ovitz said. ``I couldn't
compete with that. I went in there feeling very good, and I'm
incredibly disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the $195 million public investment McNair had
obtained for his proposed stadium gave him an insurmountable
advantage in the bidding. Ovitz said that he and his partner, Ron
Burkle, a billionaire financier, could not raise their proposed
expansion fee above $550 million. By choosing Houston, the league
went with the 11th largest television market, with 1.7 million
households over Los Angeles, the No. 2 market, with 5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance,'' said Paul Tagliabue, the NFL commissioner,
``Houston was superior.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair's franchise, which has not been named, will replace the
Oilers, who left in 1996 for Tennessee and who now play in
Nashville as the Titans. The Oilers' name was retired with the
move.
</P>
<P>
   The skyrocketing prices of NFL teams are attributable to the new
eight-year, $17.6 billion network television contracts signed by
the league early last year and the financial strength provided by
new stadiums awash in revenues from luxury suites, club seats,
personal-seat licenses and naming rights.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's new stadium will have nearly 75,000 seats, 110 luxury
suites and 7,700 club seats. In recent weeks, McNair became more
confident that the team would sell enough suites, club seats and
40,000 seat licenses (fees for the right to purchase season
tickets) to justify a $700 million bid. The league sweetened the
deal by guaranteeing a Super Bowl in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Burguieres, vice chairman of McNair's holding company,
the McNair Group, said, ``Seven-hundred million was the only number
the league would do the deal at, but of course, it would have been
better at $600 million.''
</P>
<P>
   At $700 million, McNair said, ``We knew we differentiated
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this says is that if you get the ultimate stadium
situation, this is what you'll pay,'' said Michael Ozanian, a
sports valuation expert at Forbes magazine.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's fee guarantees that each of the NFL's 31 teams will
receive $33.3 million. McNair and his partners will pay their fee
in installments of $150 million on Jan. 15 of the next four years,
and $100 million on Jan. 15, 2004.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, 62, can well afford the team. He recently sold his four
co-generation energy plants in New York and New Jersey for $1.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The road to approving McNair was paved Tuesday night when he
answered the 14-man expansion committee's lingering questions while
Tagliabue told Ovitz and Ed Roski Jr., Broad's partner, that they
were out of the running. ``I said 24 votes for L.A. was not
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The league had tried desperately since March to fashion a
fundable stadium plan in Los Angeles with the Ovitz and Broad
groups. The league had focused heavily on a renovation plan for the
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. But last month, when the Coliseum
project proved too expensive, the league flirted briefly with
Ovitz's hope for a stadium at the Hollywood Park race track in
suburban Inglewood. But that short effort proved too little, too
late. &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE MONEY MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The George W. juggernaut rolled through New York this
week, with the candidate taking some brilliantly aimed shots at his
own party, brokering an end (at least temporarily) to the nasty
feud between Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
visiting a black church upstate and a black school in Harlem,
making an educational policy speech at the right-leaning Manhattan
Institute, and visiting for more than an hour with Cardinal John
O'Connor, who has not been well.
</P>
<P>
   That's the high-profile stuff, and Bush is very good at it. But
his real strength, his genius, is raising money. At that, he's a
wizard. He has taken the art of presidential fund-raising to
heights never before seen.
</P>
<P>
   A fund-raiser Tuesday evening at the Sheraton New York Hotel
featured food that was unappetizing, an even worse band (a
five-piece combo struggling with Gershwin one moment and Motown the
next) and Giuliani and Pataki forcing themselves to say, in effect,
``I love you, man.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter. The floor of the Imperial Ballroom was packed,
mostly with men in suits. Bush spoke and he was charming. The
evening was short. The take was $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   In just seven or eight months, Bush has raised nearly $60
million, a figure that astounds most political observers. ``No
one's ever seen money like this,'' said Charles Lewis, who heads
the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity. ``People can't even
comprehend it, the amounts are so large.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, said: ``He's wrapping up the nomination simply by virtue
of the money he's been able to collect. He's sucked the oxygen out
of the air for all of the other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing illegal or improper about Bush raising such
awesome amounts of cash. He is doing the same thing other
politicians do, just on a larger scale. But the fact that one
candidate can raise so much money is deeply troubling to those who
believe that big money in politics concentrates power in too few
hands and thus undermines the very idea of participatory democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming influence of money in politics is excluding
from public service those men and women who are qualified but are
not independently wealthy and are unable or unwilling to raise what
often are obscene amounts of campaign cash. It has made raising
money an obsession for those who hold or seek major office. And it
has profoundly discouraged millions of ordinary Americans who
believe their voices are never heard because the politicians are
too busy dancing to the music of the big contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Said Makinson: ``The average American understands that politics
these days is more of a spectator sport than a participatory
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his aides have noted, with some justification, that his
campaign receives money from a wide cross-section of the public,
including individuals of ordinary means. But it is also fair to
point out that tens of thousands of individuals have given Bush the
maximum $1,000 you can contribute to a presidential candidate. That
is a lot of money, especially when you consider that in many cases
a husband gives $1,000, a wife gives $1,000, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Makinson put the matter in perspective when he pointed out that
less than one-tenth of 1 percent of all Americans contribute that
kind of money to a candidate or party.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said 96 percent of Americans do not contribute any money
at all, ``not a dime,'' to politicians at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   So whether the candidate is George W. Bush or Bill Clinton or
Bob Dole or Al Gore, the big money comes from the nation's elite.
</P>
<P>
   What is both unusual and significant about the Bush campaign is
that Bush's ability to raise such prodigious amounts of cash
enabled him to thumb his nose at the post-Watergate campaign
finance reforms. Bush has decided not to accept Federal matching
funds and therefore will not have to abide by state spending limits
during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush funding surge, as thrilling as it must be for the
Governor and his supporters, is pulling the entire nation in the
wrong direction. The true spirit of democracy cannot survive where
cash is king. There were no poor people in the ballroom of the
Sheraton on Tuesday night, just a bad band and big bucks.

ONCE AGAIN IN PUBLIC EYE, THATCHER ACTS AS CONSERVATIVE LIGHTNING
ROD
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKPOOL, England _ The posters announcing Wednesday night's
talk at the Conservative party conference by former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher announced, ``She's back.'' But the Tories learned
with a mixture of delight and dismay that she never really went
away.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in her signature kingfisher blue dress and with her
famous silvery coif as rigidly in place as her traditional
convictions, she swept into Blackpool and took up the Conservative
center stage as if she had never left it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week her longstanding behind-the-scenes agitation
had become public, with portrayals of her having aggressively
sabotaged her immediate successor, former Prime Minister John
Major, and disparaging the beleaguered current leader of the party,
William Hague, in belittling comments to Conservative friends and
office holders.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night she arrived at this gathering of the party
faithful and, with Hague smiling nervously beside her, she gave a
clear warning on her arrival here that she was still smarting from
her banishment from office by Tory rivals, after a decade in power.
``I'm told I have to be careful what I say,'' she declared. ``I
don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove her point, she strode purposefully into the midst
of the party's touchiest issue, Britain's relationship with Europe,
and trod underfoot Hague's attempts to craft a calibrated position
keeping Britain distant from the continent but not hostile to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are quite the best country in Europe,'' she declared. ``In
my lifetime all the problems have come from mainland Europe, and
all the solutions have come from the English-speaking nations
across the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For years she has been a largely invisible figure in Britain,
spending much of her time lecturing abroad, particularly in the
United States and Japan, and meeting quietly with her old
associates in the party and government in her townhouse on a leafy
square in the Belgravia section of London. At recent party
conferences she has been a well received but silent guest, an
ornament from the Tory past rather than an oracle for the
Conservative future.
</P>
<P>
   But when she entered the cavernous Winter Garden hall on
Wednesday morning, delegates greeted her rapturously and the
conference chairman Brian Hanson exulted, ``She has lost none of
that marvelous Maggie magic.''
</P>
<P>
   For the assembled Tories, it was a feel-good moment, a reminder
of the pleasures of rule and certainty rather than the unhappiness
of the current powerlessness and drift. The Daily Telegraph, the
voice of Conservatism, whose editor Charles Moore is writing her
official biography, proclaimed wishfully on its front page: ``Hague
Takes the Thatcher Way Forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Hague is actually trying to take the party forward was
outlined in a 60-point fresh start proposal that he has spent the
week trying to make the centerpiece of the conference. ``Fresh
start?'' Lady Thatcher said when asked her attitude about the
manifesto. ``What's wrong with the old one? We did rather well with
it.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night she made her first speech within a party
conference since her anguished departure from 10 Downing Street in
1990, and the cause for which she broke silence _ at a rally to
protest British treatment of Gen. Augusto Pinochet _ was not one
the party necessarily wanted to focus on as it fights to win back
the support of the British public. Pinochet, the former Chilean
dictator, was arrested in London a year ago and faces extradition
to Spain on torture charges.
</P>
<P>
   She praised Pinochet as Britain's ally in South America during
the Falkland Islands war in 1982 and called Britain's current
treatment of him as ``callous and unjust.''
</P>
<P>
   The event drew an overflow audience and upstaged Hague, who is
trying to direct delegates' enthusiasms towards the future rather
than the unhappy recent Conservative past. Asked on her arrival
here about front-page reports that she habitually referred to the
untested 38-year-old leader as ``wee Willie'' and faulted him for
not being sufficiently anti-Europe, she waved off reporters,
saying, ``I support him absolutely _ I think he's terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   On another matter that has put her back in daily news coverage,
she said that she had not read the serialization in The Times of
London of a memoir by Major in which he calls her duplicitous and
headstrong, possessing ``warrior characteristics'' that he labels
``profoundly un-Conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other new Conservative kiss- and-tell books, one by Norman
Lamont, the Treasury head whom Major fired in 1994, and the other
by the late Judith Chaplin, a former private secretary to Major,
have created a climate of recrimination and score-settling at the
annual party gathering that has vastly complicated Hague's job of
unifying the Tories. Lord Lamont shared the stage with Lady
Thatcher at Wednesday night's pro-Pinochet rally.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Major has gone on vacation with his wife rather than come to the
conference, but he left behind enough spiteful comments to attract
more attention in Blackpool than his presence would have.
Throughout his seven years in office, Major wrote, Lady Thatcher
was ``in relentless opposition, behaving in a way that was unique
in our party's history.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sensitive and divisive issue of Britain's relationship
with Europe, Major portrayed his predecessor as unable ``to keep
the two sides of her personality bolted together.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing a frustration in print that he always disguised in
public, he wrote: ``It can be a terrible error to argue straight
from your emotional bedrock, but the prime minister was beginning
to do so. Like a shorting circuit she flickered and crackled.
Intermittently the lamp of European statesmanship still glowed;
then -fssst! _ a shower of vivid commentary would light up Margaret
who attracted the last-ditch Englander. And it all came crashing
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The dueling biographies and put-downs have served to throw a
untimely, revealing light on a dark corner in Conservative Central
Office where the party had hoped to hide the conflicted Tory
administration that went down to defeat two years ago at the hands
of the newly united and reformed Labor party. Labor held its
conference in Bournemouth last week, a ruthlessly stage-managed
affair without a contrary voice, an affair that reminded people of
nothing more than the customarily harmonious, polite and tidy Tory
conventions of old.
</P>
<P>
   The war over Europe has returned with all the poisonous
consequences for the political health of the Conservatives, long
the mightiest political party in Europe but now a weakened force
with approval of only 25 percent of the British public, down from
the 31 percent it polled in the humiliating 1997 election.
</P>
<P>
   While some delegates were feting the return of their outspoken
heroine, other officials rushed in to dissociate the party with her
attack on Europe. She was ``fabulous'' but suffered from a habit of
``shooting from the hip.'' said former Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind. Her comments ``create the impression that Britain and
British opinion are somehow prejudiced and anti-European,'' Rifkind
said.
</P>
<P>
   The intra-party battle over Europe was already joined before
Lady Thatcher's arrival. On Tuesday, the party formally proposed
that Conservatives go beyond their pledge to keep Britain out of
the single currency and seek to renegotiate the European Union's
founding Treaty of Rome. The Conservatives want individual nations
to be able to opt out of rules made in Brussels that they do not
like.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkind called the new policy ``extremely foolish'' and Kenneth
Clarke, the former chancellor of the exchequer and the man who
leads all Tory popularity polls, damned the stance as a ``cloak''
for the real aim of withdrawing Britain entirely from the European
Union. That is a position Lady Thatcher is known to favor.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Heseltine, a former deputy prime minister and the man
who forced Lady Thatcher's 1990 resignation, called the party's
skeptical approach to Europe ``barking mad.'' Anti-European Tories
drowned out the meeting he addressed and threw peanuts into the
gathering.

RATIFY THE TEST BAN TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senate ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
should be a straightforward step toward the goal of halting the
proliferation of nuclear weapons. That goal has been pursued in the
past by Republican and Democratic administrations alike. But their
wise efforts to prevent nations from developing or modernizing
nuclear arsenals are today imperiled by partisan squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States ceased its own test explosions in 1992
and can maintain its nuclear weapons stockpile through simulated
tests, ratification of the Test Ban Treaty should be seen as a
low-cost way to enhance a basic element of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan politics should not have been allowed to endanger
ratification. The fault lies not only with Republican leaders who
prevented a ratification vote for two years and then abruptly
called for a vote next week knowing that supporters of the treaty
now lack the votes to ratify. President Clinton is equally to
blame. He wasted the past two years, failing to use his bully
pulpit to rally support for a treaty that deserves wholehearted
bipartisan backing.
</P>
<P>
   The sole argument against the treaty with any merit is that it
cannot guarantee detection of low-yield underground tests. Once the
treaty enters into force, however, 300 new monitoring stations
would be deployed worldwide, making it harder than ever to conduct
clandestine nuclear explosions. Those who worry about verification
of treaty violations should not allow the unattainable perfect to
become the enemy of the attainable good.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate fails to ratify the test ban, Russia and China
would surely do the same, India would not honor its recent pledge
to sign the treaty, and Pakistan would follow suit. A calamitous
chain reaction could be expected. India would doubtless resume
testing, and so would Pakistan. China would come under pressure to
modernize its nuclear deterrent. Russia would be tempted to test
low-yield warheads to compensate for the weakness of Russia's
conventional military. Nothing could be more inimical to America's
national security interests.

 &HT;    Analysts to gather at Dell's autumn meeting
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. plays host to almost 200
analysts at the Four Seasons hotel today in a fall rite designed to
display the company's confidence that it will play a growing role
in an Internet-driven industry.
</P>
<P>
   Executives are expected to outline plans for services aimed at
helping customers expand their use of the Internet from e-commerce
to day-to-day operations such as product design and employee
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a consensus among analysts that Dell is doing
many things right, this year has been a disappointment for many
investors and company management because of the stock's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Dell closed down $0.50 Wednesday at $43.31 1/4 on the Nasdaq
stock exchange. That is 20 percent off the all-time high closing
price of $54.31 1/4 set Feb. 2. While the company continues to lead
the industry in growth and profitability, the closest the stock has
gotten to the February high is $49.56 1/4 on Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   It's a notable departure for a stock that has been one of this
decade's top performers.
</P>
<P>
   This year is the first time since 1994 that Dell's board of
directors did not declare a stock split in the second half of the
year. The last split, Dell's seventh in six years, was March 5.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say they're cautious about the stock's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Dube of Wasserstein Perella Securities in New York said
wide quarter-to-quarter variations in growth make it hard to
forecast what Dell's revenue will be. Sales growth ranged from 5
percent in the first quarter of last year to 11 percent in the most
recent quarter, which ended July 30. ``What investors are trying to
figure out is what is the annualized revenue growth we should
expect from Dell,'' Dube said.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Mazzucchelli of Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York, who
rates the stock a ``buy,'' said Dell is expensive based on its
price-earnings ratio of 68. By comparison, shares of IBM, a much
bigger and more diverse computer-systems company, are trading at a
P/E ratio of just more than 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people still think it's in nose-bleed territory,
relative to its peers,'' Mazzucchelli said.
</P>
<P>
   While sophisticated institutional investors such as pension
plans have been concerned for several years about the premium they
paid for Dell, they continued to buy it because of its gravity-
defying performance.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in February, when the company reported revenue
growth of 38.4 percent. While still high for a company whose annual
sales were more than $18 billion, it marked the first time in eight
quarters that revenue growth slipped below 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock hasn't been able to rebuild the momentum in an
industry undergoing sometimes rapid declines in prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not seen the institutional money flow back in,'' said
Ashok Kumar of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis.

SOME HOUSE REPUBLICANS CHAFE AT BUSH'S CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C, Calif., Con)  (Political Memo; see also BUSH-CAMPAIGN) 
(rk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ These are uncomfortable days for Republicans on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Once again they are locked in a chaotic, down-to-the-wire budget
battle with President Clinton. They have been forced by Democrats
into an uncomfortable debate over managed health care. And now the
party's front-running presidential candidate seems to be defining
his own credentials as a ``compassionate conservative'' by
distancing himself from them.
</P>
<P>
   The unease is so palpable, said Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., that
when he came onto the House floor Wednesday morning for the first
vote of the day, another Republican walked up to him and said, ``if
Bush keeps going at the rate he's going at, he'll guarantee his
presidency and a Democrat controlled House.'' Sanford, added,
``Then the follow up was, `I guess you can't blame him. He's
probably reading the same poll numbers we are.'''
</P>
<P>
   This was not how Republicans expected things to be. When Speaker
Dennis Hastert this year replaced the fiery and polarizing Newt
Gingrich, Republicans said they had a few simple and pragmatic
goals that recognized the limits of their very tenuous majority:
They would be more disciplined and less confrontational. They would
concentrate on basics like passing spending bills on time. And they
would ride Bush's coattails next year to keep control of the House
and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be harder to do if Bush, who has now criticized
fellow Republicans twice in the span of a week, continues to take a
page from President Clinton, who defined himself as a ``New
Democrat'' by standing far apart from congressional Democrats.
Clinton's 1996 political strategist, Dick Morris, called it
``triangulation'' because Clinton tried to stand equally distant
from Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Clinton has done by triangulating has taken the spirit
out of the Democratic party,'' Rep. Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C, said
Wednesday, making clear his own irritation with Bush. ``That's not
the model to govern well.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush Wednesday was far more conciliatory than in recent
days, praising Republicans in Congress for measures such as the
1996 overhaul of the welfare law and saying he hoped and planned if
elected to work with a Republican speaker and a Republican House.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Republicans' problems result inevitably from the
balance of power in Congress. The House is virtually split in two,
making it nearly ungovernable. And in the Senate, the Republicans
hold 55 seats _ five short of the 60 they would need to cut off
debate each time the Democrats embark on another filibuster against
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And the Democrats, fervent about taking back the House, are
fighting the Republicans at every turn. With the help of
like-minded Republican moderates, they have successfully pushed
onto the agenda issues that they believe favor them _ gun control,
campaign finance overhaul and regulation of health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When half the Congress wants to rock the boat, the boat is
going to rock,'' said Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., arguing that
Republicans were not to blame for the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also the case that on the fiscal issues that they have
made their priority the Republicans have lurched from idea to idea.
They have not found a way to meet their basic promise to cut taxes,
remain within the spending limits of the 1997 bipartisan balanced
budget agreement and avoid dipping into Social Security trust fund
money to pay for the governments operations.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer they proudly passed a large $792 billion tax cut
and there was some talk of a grand compromise with Clinton in which
Republicans would win a somewhat smaller tax cut in exchange for
enacting a new Medicare prescription drug program the president
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But in September, Republican leaders abruptly said they would
not sit down with the president to negotiate a smaller tax cut once
Clinton vetoed their measure. Nor had they passed the 13 annual
spending bills on time by the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.
Instead the government was kept running for three more weeks with
temporary legislation.
</P>
<P>
   As the fiscal debate goes into its final weeks, Republicans are
hoping to win politically by portraying themselves as the ones
cutting spending enough to avoid eating into the Social Security
surplus. (Usually it is the Democrats who campaign on protecting
Social Security.)
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans themselves have yet to figure out how to hold
the line on spending and not spend billions of dollars from the
Social Security surplus. One idea House leaders had was to save
$8.7 billion next year by paying a tax credit to the working poor
on a monthly basis instead of a lump sum payment. That strategem is
what prompted Bush last week to shock House Republicans by calling
that an effort to ``balance the budget on the backs of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is now denying he wants confrontation with congressional
Republicans, there are political imperatives that still seem bound
to pull them apart. Many House Republicans, in particular, believe
they win elections by appealing to their most hardcore conservative
base. Bush, with his commanding lead over other Republican
candidates in the polls, is by contrast fashioning his
``compassionate conservatism'' to appeal to the independents and
moderates that he would need in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans were hopeful Wednesday that Bush might actually
help their own prospects of keeping control of the House by
occasionally criticizing them. ``The American people need to know
that George Bush needs to stand up to a Republican Congress if he
doesn't agree with us,''said Rep. Christopher Shays, a moderate
Connecticut Republican. ``If they think he will fall under our
spell, there will be less of an inclination to have both him and a
Republican Congress and one of us will have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were angrily predicting that Bush would hurt himself and
them too _ pointing to an outpouring of criticism from conservative
figures like Rush Limbaugh, Paul Weyrich, and Pat Robertson, the
Christian Coalition leader who all but endorsed Bush last week.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats _ who long had to grapple with Clinton's own efforts
to distance himself from them _ were enjoying the Republican
divisions. Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader even
sent a letter to Bush asking him to ``steer House Republicans
toward the mainstream'' on other issues before Congress.
``Unfortunately, your allies in the Republican leadership just
don't get it _ compassion isn't at the top of their agenda,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But the amusement was tempered for some by the memory of how
Clinton's definition of himself as a New Democrat led to his
election and re-election. ``Remember the end result,'' said Rep.
Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn. ``The last guy who triangulated won.''

COMMENTARY: THOSE CHINESE AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Chinese Embassy here sent two of its senior
commercial ministers to Capitol Hill last week to impugn the
testimony of a Chinese citizen now resident in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Jianwei Ding worked for a subsidiary of Cofco, the agricultural
giant that also runs the big Chinese Cultural Center in Phoenix. He
came to the House Reform and Oversight Committee with a charge that
his former boss, Ning Yu _ now named Elizabeth Mann _ had a
gift-giving relationship with the man who gives out visas at the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Our State Department yanked out our visa-giver, but Ding's
internal whistle-blowing did not sit well with his company's
officers. They won a lawsuit against him and seek his deportation
home, where his clues to kickbacks can be squelched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The embassy officials kept insisting that `this bad man is a
small potato,' '' reports James Wilson, chief counsel to Dan
Burton's committee, ``but then pointed out, almost as a threat,
that the company imports 18 million tons of corn and barley from
the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   China has registered not a peep of protest to Congress about
inquiries into corrupt dealings in money and politics by Clinton
friends Charlie Trie, Johnny Chung and John Huang. But curiously,
Ding upsets them greatly, and the People's Republic is spending
bundles on lawyer's fees to get our Immigration officials to reject
asylum. (Over to you, Tony Lewis.)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of John Huang, who was the Indonesian Riady family's
money man at the Commerce Department and the DNC: President Clinton
had good news for James Riady when he greeted him last month in
Auckland. Reno Justice let Huang off with a fine and probation for
his millions in illegal fund-raising. Now Janet Reno won't let the
committee immunize him to get his testimony about higher-ups,
pretending a ``continuing espionage investigation'' exists.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Charlie Tre, Little Rock's man in Beijing? Over in
the Senate, Fred Thompson's Oversight Committee heard from four FBI
agents assigned to the task force Reno used to block independent
investigation of ``the Asian connection'' with the 1996 Clinton
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI witnesses revealed that the cover-up crew at Reno
Justice knew of the systematic destruction of subpoenaed evidence
by Trie's assistant _ and refused for four months to allow agents
to obtain a search warrant to seize remaining documents.
</P>
<P>
   After a lawful Senate subpoena to Justice for the lead FBI
agent's notebook detailing this obstruction, 27 pages of Roberta
Parker's notebook were destroyed inside Reno Justice. That's a
federal crime. Reno shrugged this scandal over to Marshall Jarrett,
her in-house shoo-fly who can be trusted never to find the perp in
their midst.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents have testified how Justice deliberately impeded lines
of inquiry into the White House. Senator Thompson, now deposing
Justice witnesses, says: ``Theirs was a hapless, incompetent,
possibly corrupt investigation into Asian fund-raising. We're going
into this now more deeply than Justice is.''
</P>
<P>
   China's contributions to Clinton went hand in hand with its
espionage. Looking into that end is a new Senate task force headed
by Arlen Specter, former Intelligence Committee chairman. He's
interested in the technical transfers of ballistic-missile data by
Loral and Hughes, companies headed by two big Clinton fund-raisers
and trade influencers.
</P>
<P>
   Today Senate Judiciary will vote to arm Specter's newly
recruited team of serious investigators with subpoenas on Justice
officials to find out what went into Reno's cozy plea bargains with
Trie, Huang and Chung _ and why no espionage counts were included
in the prosecution of Peter Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In closed hearings next week, Specter's group will examine the
inspectors general of the CIA and the Department of Energy, and
customs officials critical of the dangerous sale of secrets.
``Nobody's peeled back the covers,'' says the former Pennsylvania
prosecutor. ``I'm determined to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will. Maybe Thompson and Burton will flip over rocks as
well. If Justice's stone wall cracks, Americans might yet discover
the connection between unpunished Chinese illegal contributions and
unpublished stories of Chinese espionage.

`SNL' FILM TRIES HARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Friday, Oct. 8  by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 STARS 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Molly Shannon's Mary Katherine Gallagher is the
most lovable clod to grace ``Saturday Night Live'' in a month of,
well, Saturdays. The spectacularly ungainly Catholic schoolgirl is
such a poignant comic creation _ ever aboil with misdirected
neediness, engaging (if gross) quirks and repressed everything _
that she wins your heart with each panty-exposing pratfall.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing for ``Superstar'' that Mary Katherine
generates so much laughing good will, since little else about the
movie does. As ``SNL'' knockoffs go, this one tried somewhat harder
than usual to tell a coherent and engaging story. But it fails at
that about as thoroughly as ``A Night at the Roxbury,'' or any of
the others that didn't bother trying, have.
</P>
<P>
   The clumsiest member of St. Monica High's cheerleading squad,
Mary Katherine lives with her wheelchair-dependent, show-biz-hating
grandmother (a more or less wasted Glynis Johns) and dreams of
being kissed like they do it in Hollywood movies. This, of course,
is not a dream shared by any of her male classmates, so she's
reduced to practicing liplocks on a sturdy old oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   But luck comes Mary's way, sort of. Catholic Teen magazine
sponsors a talent contest at St. Monica's. The first prize is a
chance to appear in a real movie (albeit one of those nonexistent
ones with positive moral values) but, more importantly to Mary's
fevered mind, it's a chance to get the school hunk's attention _
provided, of course, that she can dredge up any talent to show.
</P>
<P>
   Will Ferrell, Shannon's clever ``SNL'' co-star, plays the
lusted-after, self-regarding Sky. Elaine Hendrix is Evian, Sky's
pretty girlfriend and a dedicated Mary tormentor. Harland Williams
does something akin to a Gomer-Pyle-in-biker-leather number as the
silent school rebel, Slater. And MTV fixture Emmy Laybourne is
Mary's sister in gawkiness, Helen.
</P>
<P>
   The director, former ``Kids in the Hall'' member Bruce
McCulloch, brings a little more comic zip to these proceedings than
he did to his moribund feature debut, ``Dog Park.'' Most of that is
provided by Shannon's abundant energy and sweet neuroticism, but a
few conceptual flourishes _ a supermodel daydream, Ferrell's
manifestation as a laid-back Jesus _ are also pulled off well.
</P>
<P>
   That last bit may stir complaints from those who don't like to
see religion spoofed. But it's about as critical of Catholicism as
this film gets _ and is really quite benign compared to the
derisive humor that parochial school graduates from George Carlin
to playwright Christopher Durang typically devise.
</P>
<P>
   The fathers and sisters in ``Superstar'' are mainly just
bewildered by Mary Katherine's behavior, a trait they'd probably
share with any other teacher on the planet. &QL;

REPUBLICANS URGE CLINTON TO ISSUE WRITTEN REQUEST TO DELAY TREATY
VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a mounting battle of wills, Republicans demanded
Wednesday that President Clinton issue a written request to
withdraw the global nuclear test ban treaty from the Senate
calendar and to refrain from another vote during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton indicated a willingness to postpone the vote, but the
White House rejected a written capitulation. Instead, the president
suggested Senate Republicans were sending dangerous signals
throughout the world that other nations were free to continue
atomic testing.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides stepped up their confrontation as each tried to
place the onus for the treaty's demise on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plans to open debate Friday and vote Tuesday, perhaps
Wednesday, on the two-year-old treaty that likely will fall far
short of the 67 votes needed for ratification. All 45 Democrats and
two of 55 Republicans have expressed support for it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said supporters of the treaty ``are hoping to
dictate the terms of their own surrender. They want us to say
something like this: `OK, let's call it a draw.' And I say to them,
that ain't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms, joined by other key Senate Republicans, said the only way
he would allow the treaty to be withdrawn from the Senate calendar
is if Clinton requests in writing that the vote be postponed and
that it not be considered during the rest of his presidency.
Otherwise, Helms said he would force a vote on the treaty, and it
will be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the decision, you see, is the president's, and the
president's alone,'' Helms said during a rare news conference with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The administration expressed dismay that partisan politics was
playing a role in the treaty consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of debating (the treaty) should be dictated by the
national security interests of the United States, not the political
calendar,'' said White House spokesman David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of any plans for the president to send a letter,
whatsoever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents contend the United States lacks the ability to detect
low-level atomic tests and worry about the reliability of the
United States' current nuclear stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters contend the treaty would be verifiable because it
calls for on-site inspections and 321 monitoring stations around
the world. They also contend that current technology allows for the
computer simulation of the U.S. stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., met throughout the day in an attempt to
fashion some compromise that would allow the vote, and the certain
defeat, to be postponed. But a compromise that allowed both sides
to save face proved elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're comfortable going forward with the vote,'' said John
Czwartacki, Lott's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, early in the day, suggested he was open to a delay.
``After two long years of inaction, one week is very little time
for considered action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Senate process, with
its rushed vote, was inadequate for such an important issue. But he
said the Senate leadership, not Clinton, controlled the Senate
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also said the administration continued to prepare for a
vote next week. ``We're going to work as hard as we can between now
and next Tuesday to get as many votes as we can,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued lobbying for the treaty, surrounding himself
with Nobel Prize winners and former military leaders who endorse
the treaty. But he also acknowledged the uphill fight, saying ``I
thank the senators who are here with us today, and pray that they
can swell their ranks by next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the best way to stop nuclear proliferation is to
stop nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vote, therefore, to ratify is a vote to increase the
protections of our people and the world from nuclear war. By
contrast, a vote against it risks a much more dangerous future,''
Clinton said. He suggested those nations with nuclear power were
watching the current debate ``with some measure of bewilderment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said to ``walk away'' from the treaty would mean a ``green
light to all these other countries in the world.'' The United
States has operated under a self-imposed moratorium since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, and Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., a member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, promoted a letter from six former
Republican secretaries of defense who oppose the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Helms, they contended the treaty would mean
``confidence in the reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile
would inevitably decline, thereby reducing the credibility of
America's nuclear deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Defeat of the treaty would be a major political setback for
Clinton who pushed other nations to adopt the test ban. His was the
first of 154 signatures on the treaty. More than 40 nations have
ratified it.

<P>
   INCIRLIK AIR BASE, Turkey _ American fighter jets patrolling
northern Iraq have an innovative new weapon to use against
President Saddam Hussein: concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of killing civilians when F-15s and F16s strike inside
Iraq, the Air Force has begun filling 2,000-pound, laser-guided
bombs with concrete instead of explosives and dropping them on
sensitive military targets near populated areas, American military
officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   A concrete bomb, the use of which has not previously been
disclosed, can still destroy a target, but it does not have what
military officials call ``the explosive arc'' of regular munitions.
And so its use minimizes the risk that explosive bomb fragments
will kill or wound innocent Iraqis who might be nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can stub your toe,'' Lt. Col. Michael S. Waters, a
spokesman for the American operation here in this base near the
Mediterranean, said of the concrete. ``But there's no chance of
collateral damage,'' he added, using the military's euphemism for
civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it useful against military targets Iraq has
positioned in residential neighborhoods in what American officials
believe is Saddam's main objective in stepping up skirmishing over
the ``no flight'' zones over northern and southern Iraq: to foment
international sympathy by publicizing civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete bombs are also an apt symbol of a low-level war
against Iraq that is dictated as much by political and diplomatic
sensitivities as by any strategic or military concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become the longest sustained military operation
since Vietnam, for more than nine months now Iraqi forces have
routinely fired on the American and British jets that patrol the
no-flight zones, and the American and British crews have routinely
struck back in what they say is self-defense. But it is a
deliberately low-key war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we're conducting this is kept within the parameters of
political acceptability,'' said a senior Clinton administration
official in Washington. ``We don't want things to go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And so pilots here at Incirlik (pronounced in-JER-lick) fly into
combat with strict rules about what, when, where and how they may
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish government, wary of public sentiment about repeated
airstrikes against a neighboring country, limits the number of days
the jets can fly and prohibits operations at night. The U.S.
European Command, which oversees operations here, has put northern
Iraq's most significant military targets off limits, fearing
international outrage over what could be seen as an escalation of
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the pilots must avoid mistakes that could play into
Saddam's hands. ``It's between none and minimal collateral damage
that we'll accept,'' said Maj. Hugh Hanlon, an F-16CJ pilot with
the 55th Fighter Squadron at Shaw Air Force in Georgia, who is
stationed here.
</P>
<P>
   The result is something of a standoff. The American and British
forces have struck more than five times the number of targets
attacked during four days of intensive air and missile attacks
against Iraq last December's more intensive raids and flown more
than three-quarters as many combat missions as NATO pilots did
during 78 days of bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis say nearly 200 people, including many civilians, have
been killed in the airstrikes this year. American officials say
that claim is exaggerated but they acknowledge that the strikes
have caused some deaths.
</P>
<P>
   American military commanders say the airstrikes have inflicted
severe damage to Iraq's air defenses in the north. But they have
not yet hit Iraqi forces hard enough to persuade the government to
stop challenging the patrols in the no-flight zones.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders here and at the Pentagon say the strikes will end as
soon as Iraq stops firing on the patrols, even though they
acknowledge that Iraq has the ability to continue resisting at the
current level for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reached a stalemate,'' said Group Capt. Graham P. Dixon,
commander of the 200 British troops and six aircraft involved in
the operations at Incirlik. ``I'm not sure there can be a way
around this as long as Saddam Hussein is in power. I personally see
this as a long-term proposition, not a short-term one.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies created the no-flight zones
after the Persian Gulf war in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds in the
north and Shiite Muslims in the south from repression by Iraqi
forces. Officials in Washington say the zones remain an important
part of the Clinton administration's broad effort to isolate
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq never accepted the validity of the zones, but American and
allied jets patrolled them largely unmolested for more than seven
years. Then last December, the United States and Britain carried
out four days of attacks to punish Saddam for refusing to allow the
United Nations to continue inspections of his nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq then declared the zones a violation of its sovereignty, and
its forces began challenging virtually every patrol, firing
antiaircraft weapons, launching surface-to-air missiles and sending
MIG jets darting into the zones.
</P>
<P>
   While American officials decline to discuss their tactics in
depth, including how or how long they have been using the concrete
bombs, they do offer a stunning list of statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, they say, American and British patrols have
flown nearly 16,000 sorties and dropped 550 bombs against 135
targets in southern Iraq. Here at Incirlik, they have flown more
than 11,000 combat or combat-support sorties and dropped more than
1,100 bombs against more than 250 targets, including strikes on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Those targets have included more than 150 antiaircraft artillery
batteries, 30 radar or communication centers and 22 buildings used
as command centers, said Brig. Gen. David A. Deptula, the Air Force
commander here until last week.
</P>
<P>
   As in Yugoslavia, the air war has been decidedly one-sided.
Iraqi forces have yet to hit an American or British aircraft,
American officials said. According to American intelligence
reports, Iraq has withdrawn its most sophisticated weapons, like
Soviet-era surface-air-missiles, from the no-flight zones in recent
months to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not stopped Iraq from firing back with antiaircraft
artillery. That still poses a threat, though much less of one
since, the pilots and commanders say, the jets flying into northern
Iraq stay above 20,000 feet _ high enough that they are less likely
to be hit.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has also positioned its remaining antiaircraft batteries in
residential neighborhoods in or near the northern Iraqi cities like
Mosul and Tall'Afar.
</P>
<P>
   Deptula said that after American jets destroyed Iraq's main
air-defense command center south of Mosul, the Iraqis recently
moved their headquarters to the nearby historic ruins of Nineveh,
the ancient capital of Assyria built in the seventh century B.C.
While the general declined to discuss future targets, presumably
that one would be off limits.
</P>
<P>
   An American government official with access to the intelligence
reports said the Iraq's tactics had significantly diminished its
chances of hitting an aircraft, but were still accomplishing
Saddam's goal of drawing attention to the patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to provoke us to do something, but he's trying to
do it in such a way he doesn't lose assets,'' the official said.
``The ultimate intention of what Saddam Hussein is trying to do in
the `no fly' zones is not military.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactics on both sides _ including the concrete bombs _ have
turned the conflict into an odd cat-and-mouse game.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has about 50 aircraft involved in the
operation, from fighter jets to combat support. When they fly, they
take off in one long, loud procession, accompanied by a
communication plane, an RC-135 reconnaissance jet and KC-135 aerial
refueling tankers, as well as British tankers and Jaguars that
photograph potential targets.
</P>
<P>
   Once they reach the border, about an hour away, only the fighter
jets enter Iraq. The others fly over the khaki-colored mountains of
eastern Turkey out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday's mission pilots reported seeing 57 mm antiaircraft
fire, bursting in distinctive gray puffs 15,000 to 18,000 feet up,
well beneath the jets. An hour later they spotted the bursts again.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots and commanders here say they try to respond. But from
more than 20,000 feet, it is often impossible to see an artillery
battery _ no larger than a truck and often hiding in orchards or
towns _ and in those cases they attack other targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't exactly identify where the threat was,'' an F-15
pilot said of Sunday's skirmish, speaking on the condition that he
only be identified by his rank and nickname, Lt. Col. V.Q.
</P>
<P>
   Under their rules of engagement agreed on by the United States,
Britain and Turkey, the pilots most often strike at parts of Iraq's
air defenses, including radio towers, radar stations and command
centers that, according to the Pentagon, coordinate the Iraqi
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sunday the F-16Cs and F-15s attacked separate targets
at a communications center that they had decided to attack in
advance if threatened.
</P>
<P>
   France and Russia have criticized the strikes, and there are
signs the strategy hampers U.N. Security Council negotiations over
creating a new weapons inspection program in Iraq. A senior defense
official said the Russians had tried to condition their support of
new inspections on an end to the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission has not changed,'' Deptula said. ``The only thing
that has changed is the threat, and we are employing ordinance to
respond to that threat. But the larger question of the efficacy of
the no-flight zones is a political one.''

REVENGE EXECUTED WITH FLAIR IN `THE LIMEY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tight, energetic and filled to overflowing with a
grab bag of visual stylistic tricks, ``The Limey'' is a solid
revenge movie done with fabulous flair. Director Steven Soderbergh,
coming off last year's acclaimed ``Out of Sight,'' has fashioned
another winner, creating a fish-out-of-water story that works
wonderfully as a subtle showcase for the acting of Terence Stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Stamp plays the title character, a career criminal who is more
or less an extension of the thief he played 32 years ago in Ken
Loach's ``Poor Cow.'' The Limey (Wilson to his acquaintances _ the
man has no friends) has flown to Los Angeles to investigate the
death of his estranged daughter. Police reports say she died in a
car crash, but Wilson suspects something more sinister.
</P>
<P>
   A howlingly funny confrontation with some low-rent hoods reveals
a name _ Valentine (Peter Fonda), a record producer who was
romantically involved with Wilson's daughter. ``Tell him I'm
coming!'' Wilson shouts, clearly enunciating each word in his
Cockney accent. ``Tell ... him ... I'm ... coming!''
</P>
<P>
   And that's all you really need to know about this lively film's
minimalist plot. What distinguishes ``The Limey'' from dozens of
other similarly themed movies is its singular style and marvelously
expressive acting. Soderbergh plays with reality in much the same
way he did in ``Out of Sight'' and past films, running the same
scene from different angles, moving back and forth in time, always
explaining, expanding and elaborating on his characters'
motivations.
</P>
<P>
   Take Wilson's first meeting with Valentine at the latter's
insanely ostentatious home in the Hollywood Hills. (``You could see
the sea out there _ if you could see it,'' Valentine says to a
guest, in one the movie's many comical jabs at Los Angeles.)
Wilson's first instinct is to kill Valentine immediately. So we see
him do just that. Then the movie returns to the party (leaving
Wilson's fantasy) before moving into another dream sequence and,
once again, back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   These crazy collages of make-believe and real life can be a bit
much at times, but, for the most part, they creatively reveal the
haunted psyche of the film's protagonist. Soderbergh even inserts
shots of a young Stamp from ``Poor Cow.'' It could have been a
gimmick in less-accomplished hands, but here it helps explain
Wilson's love for his daughter and the regrets he has about their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting Soderbergh's masterful visual style is some nice
acting from both Stamp and Fonda, both of whom riff on their 1960s
personas to fine effect. Stamp can play rage with the best of them,
and he also fills in the cracks of his character with a tormented
sense of grief and remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda's Valentine no longer feels the pangs of conscience,
having sold out his idealism long ago for the pursuit of pleasure.
You sense the loss in Fonda's performance, even as we watch his
character obsessively groom his teeth. Lesley Ann Warren, Luis
Guzman, Amelia Heinle and Barry Newman fill out a strong supporting
cast.
</P>
<P>
   It's these ambiguities, as well as the film's vigorous
storytelling, that makes ``The Limey'' such smart fun. The movie is
proof positive that revenge can indeed be sweet. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ask June Shockency, a sergeant-at-arms in
California's Republican Party, what she thinks of Elizabeth Dole,
and her face brightens: ``intelligent, outgoing, warm,'' she says.
But ask Mrs. Shockency about Mrs. Dole's message the last time she
heard her speak, and there is a pause. ``I really can't remember,''
she finally says.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, Mrs. Dole surprised campaign watchers, many of
whom had declared her presidential bid a model of lost
opportunities, by placing a strong third in the Iowa straw poll.
And since then, she has crisscrossed the country, drawing
enthusiastic crowds familiar with the Dole name and intrigued by
the first woman to make a viable bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, her campaign remains something of a puzzle
to outsiders. Although national polls show her running second to
George W. Bush, she has been able to raise only about a tenth of
the money he has collected.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, her campaign has lost three top advisers, including
two spokesmen who left in the last month. The personnel changes
have lent her campaign an air of turmoil, turning routine matters
like obtaining her schedule into exercises in tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   Recent days have seen a wave of speculation that her
fund-raising problems would soon force her to drop out of the race.
And even avid supporters have taken to touting Mrs. Dole as a fine
choice _ for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard go for us,'' Tom Daffron, Mrs. Dole's
campaign manager, said recently with some understatement. ``There's
no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest challenge these days is turning the
curiosity of voters like Mrs. Shockency into support. And in a
series of campaign appearances over the past couple of weeks, many
voters seemed intrigued by her candidacy, but few declared outright
that they would vote for her.
</P>
<P>
   Known for carefully rehearsing speeches down to her trademark
catch in the throat, Mrs. Dole cuts an equally meticulous figure
before voters and donors, with outfits matched down to the polish
on her fingernails. She couches her pitch in a heavy dose of
Southern charm, still carrying the lilt of her native Salisbury,
N.C., and speaks of restoring the values of an earlier era.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we worked to eliminate the federal deficit,'' she said
in a recent address, ``we have done little to eliminate the deficit
that exists in our basis American values: honesty, integrity,
personal responsibility, civility, and respect for our fellow
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Her staff adamantly rejects speculation the she might be the
next Republican to drop out of the race. And until recently her
aides have maintained that Mrs. Dole was deliberately holding off
on taking policy stands so early in the primary race and focusing
instead on building a broad base of support.
</P>
<P>
   But wounded by the speculation, she appears ready to strike a
newly aggressive stance. On Thursday she will outline a tough
anti-drug policy at the Mexican border, and on Friday she will
strike at the home state of Sen. John McCain, with a fund-raising
luncheon in Phoenix. ``I'm out there running hard, working hard,''
she said Wednesday in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   With Republican Party faithful lining up behind Bush of Texas,
Mrs. Dole's strategy aims to stay in the race as the strongest
alternative should Bush fall, gathering in Republicans,
particularly women, who have traditionally remained outside the
political process. ``Her strength is her grass roots appeal,'' said
Kathleen Harrington, deputy campaign manager for Mrs. Dole.
</P>
<P>
   When asked their impressions, people say they look favorably
upon Mrs. Dole, a former president of the American Red Cross, whose
husband was the party's presidential candidate in 1996. But surveys
of voter intentions show her steadily slipping behind the Bush
juggernaut. One recent nationwide survey, by CNN-Gallup-USA Today,
shows Bush with 62 percent support among Republican voters, and
Mrs. Dole with 10 percent, down from 16 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican hopefuls remain in the single digits, but some,
like McCain have been gaining visibility, buoyed by an aggressive
campaign and a newly published memoir. McCain, who sat out the Iowa
straw poll, raised $3 million in the last three months, while Mrs.
Dole's fund-raisers, raised half that much during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole has so far avoided the thrust and parry of battle with
other candidates. Famous for her meticulous planning, she shies
away from press conferences or interviews with reporters she does
not know, and she has remained largely absent from the
rough-and-tumble political talk show circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's back in the pack and she's going to have to do something
to get noticed,'' said Martin P. Wattenberg, a political science
professor specializing in presidential politics at the University
of California at Irvine. Mrs. Dole, he said, ``has to have a catch,
and it has to be something more than `I'm a woman.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In her speeches, Mrs. Dole always acknowledges the historic
nature of her candidacy, but says she does not want people voting
for her because of her gender. She advocates building up the
country's nuclear defense, tighter border surveillance to stop
drugs from Mexico, and increasing local control over schools. She
supports the use of school vouchers, which would allow parents of
children in failing public schools using public funds to switch
their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole reminds voters that polls show her a consistent second
behind Bush, capable of beating either Al Gore or Bill Bradley in a
two-way race, and she sells herself as an experienced hand at
government who advocates traditional values. Her heaviest applause
comes when Mrs. Dole discusses an issue that actually has little to
do with the presidency: discipline in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed,'' said Frank Long, a training technologist at
Carolina Eastman, a chemical company in Columbia, S.C., where Mrs.
Dole spoke to about 200 workers last week. But Long said he wanted
to hear other candidates before deciding his vote.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, speaking to the Christian Coalition in Washington,
Mrs. Dole delivered her call for old-fashioned values with more
steel than ever before. She said that while America enjoyed a
budget surplus, it was suffering a deficit in moral values, and she
called for posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong that our children are not allowed a silent moment
of prayer in school, that a constitutional amendment is necessary
to ensure a child's right to pray,'' she told the Coalition. ``And
it is right that we protect the sanctity of life, that we replace
abortion with adoption, require parental notification, and that we
continue the ban on federal funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides say that Mrs. Dole has strong ideas about the
type and pace of campaign that she wants to run. She insists any
important communication from her staff come to her in writing.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   A strategy paper from her campaign, disclosed to The New York
Times by a person close to her campaign, says a ``shooting war''
against the front-runner is far better left to Steve Forbes, while
Mrs. Dole should focus on doing well in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Winning Iowa's primary would give Mrs. Dole a 15 to 20 point
``bounce'' to bolster her showing in New Hampshire a week later and
build momentum going into South Carolina, staffers say. After
August's straw poll in Iowa, Mrs. Dole surged from fourth to second
place among New Hampshire voters, said Ms. Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We captured that bounce,'' Ms. Harrington said, ``and we've
been able to translate it into organizational strength in South
Carolina.'' While Republican governors across the nation have
already rallied behind Bush, the early primary states have
Democratic governors, another advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Sinclair, a political scientist at the University of
California at Los Angeles, said a cautious campaign so early made
some sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have rivals and the media hitting the candidates if they
don't say anything, and if they say the wrong thing, they can
easily get killed before the public ever starts paying attention,''
Ms. Sinclair said. ``You've got to at least be able to arrive at
the point where people pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign watchers, though, said that with the race coalescing so
quickly, Mrs. Dole should aim for greater visibility now, not
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strategy of ambiguity is more common when candidates have
reason to believe people already like them,'' said Larry Bartels,
author of ``Presidential Primaries and the Dynamics of Public
Choice.'' ``It's hard to get people's attention without saying
something more substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest Mrs. Dole has not appeared hungry enough for the
job. ``She doesn't want to go for the brass ring,'' said Frank J.
Luntz, a Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   After some early gaffes discussing issues like abortion and drug
control, Mrs. Dole has shunned press conferences, opting instead
for brief appearances before reporters, usually after her speeches.
These typically end when an unwelcome question pops up. Mrs. Dole
glances at her nearest aide, who instantly announces, ``Okay. Last
question.''
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, her aides said she was too busy to discuss
her campaign with a reporter from The New York Times, agreeing only
at the last minute _ but then making herself unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   At fund-raising dinners, Mrs. Dole tells donors that she could
obviously not hope to match Bush in fund raising, but requires just
enough to stay in the race. Daffron noted that Mrs. Dole and Bush
shared similar bases of support. When one rises in popularity, the
other falls. ``To the extent that he stumbles, we are the
alternative,'' Daffron said.
</P>
<P>
   One campaign official appeared perplexed that Bush emerged
unscathed after questions arose about whether he used cocaine as a
young man, and his service in the Texas Air National Guard during
the Vietnam War. ``He so far just seems to be a Teflon candidate,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, including those throwing the $500-a-plate dinners
for Mrs. Dole, increasingly speak of her as a potential candidate
for vice president. As the last guests sauntered out of Richard and
Pamela Scurry's penthouse on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan recently,
Scurry said he knew it was a ``long shot'' to bet on Mrs. Dole
becoming the next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``But vice president?'' he asked. ``I don't think that's a long
shot at all.'' This month's Mirabella, a woman's magazine,
headlined it's story on Mrs. Dole's bid, ``Vice Can Be Nice.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as strategists are quick to point out this year, even vice
takes work.

 &HT;    Bush says GOP has been misunderstood
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George W. Bush on Wednesday softened his rebuke
of the Republican Party, telling an audience at a welfare-to-work
center that the party isn't bad, just misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said often times our party has been mischaracterized,'' Bush
said the day after he lambasted Republicans for focusing too much
on the economy and not enough on social issues. ``I was making the
case that the conservative philosophy is a compassionate philosophy
... I'm talking from my heart and I hope the Republican Party
appreciates it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a gentler tone than Bush used Tuesday, when he diverged
from the topic of education policy to offer his critique of the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, my party has focused on the national economy, to
the exclusion of all else, speaking a sterile language of rates and
numbers,'' Bush said during a speech before a conservative think
tank. ``Too often, my party has confused the need for limited
government with a disdain for government itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) said Bush's criticism of the
Republican Party was well-taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is too much occupation with what is happening to the Dow
and the GDP and those things are critically important because they
affect real people and real families,'' he said. ``But a government
has got to have more as a policy than just a high GDP. I thought it
was very appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP presidential front-runner has repeatedly called for a
new conservative face, one that shows as much interest in the poor
as it does in the economy. His rhetoric sharpened last Thursday
when he criticized House Congressional Republicans over their plan
to save $8 billion by stretching into monthly payments a lump sum
tax credit for the poor. Stunned House Republicans reacted
bitterly, and the leadership ditched the idea Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said Bush was right to criticize the tax credit scheme. He
said Senate Republicans had rejected the plan as ``phoney savings''
in a closed meeting last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to define what he believes,'' Gramm said. ``I applaud
the fact that when people in Congress, Republicans or Democrats,
have a bad idea he needs to stand up and say something ... I think
it was the right thing to do and a good move politically, too, to
show he's willing to take on the Republican Congress and say when
they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from House Republican leaders was muted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media is trying to create a story where there is no
story,'' said Emily Miller, spokeswoman for House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay. ``He is looking forward to a George W. Bush presidency and
all the things they can get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas government professor, said
the Bush team is employing the strategy that worked for President
Bill Clinton _ jettisoning the extremes of his party in favor of
broader appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's feeling safe and trending toward a general election
strategy to go to the center,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy angered some conservative leaders Wednesday _ and
left others feeling pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson said Bush's call for a
gentler Republican party could ``alienate the core conservatives of
the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has not written off the party's right wing. He appeared
before the Home School Legal Defense Association and the Christian
Coalition recently in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Michael P. Farris, president of the Home School Legal Defense
Association, echoed other conservatives Wednesday when he said that
while they may not agree with everything Bush has to say, they know
he's their best ticket to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   `George W. Bush is more like Ronald Reagan than his father,
Farris said. ``That doesn't mean he's all the way to Reagan on
political philosophy, but he's close enough for many of us.''

   ``A lot of people were saying, `John's going to duck Randy,'''
Olerud said. ``I wasn't in the lineup and Cito came up and said his
reason for not playing me was Randy can sometimes get a little wild
up and in to left-handers and he didn't want to take a chance on me
getting hurt, but if I really wanted to get in there he'd put me in
there. I said, `Well, I'm not going to beg to hit against that
guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most left-handed hitters want no part of the left-handed
Johnson, so Cito Gaston, the Blue Jays' manager, was doing Olerud a
favor. In the first game of the division playoff series between the
Mets and the Arizona Diamondbacks on Tuesday night, Bobby Valentine
left only two left-handed batters in the Mets' lineup, Olerud and
Robin Ventura. The results were unexpected and stunning.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud and Ventura each rapped two hits against Johnson, giving
them four hits in eight times at bat. The Mets' right-handed
hitters collected 4 hits in 24 at-bats against the wicked
left-hander. Olerud singled and hit a home run, a two-run shot in
the third inning. Ventura lashed a double, and his second hit, a
single, triggered the ninth-inning burst that Edgardo Alfonzo
climaxed with a game-winning grand slam off Bobby Chouinard.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching performance was not vintage Johnson. He struck out
11, but he was responsible for seven of the eight runs the Mets
scored. His often menacing style did not intimidate the Mets, whose
survival in this three-of-five-game series was said to be linked
directly to what Johnson would do to them. Now that they have shown
what they can do to him, the Mets don't necessarily have to face
him again.
</P>
<P>
   Buck Showalter, the Arizona manager, has said that Johnson would
pitch the fifth game. What if there is a chance that the series
could end in four games? Would he pitch the fourth game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd do anything to win for this team,'' Johnson said. ``And to
have an opportunity to win a game in the playoffs is all I've ever
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the winning pitcher twice in the 1995 division
series against the Yankees, once as a starter, once in relief. He
has not been the winning pitcher in a post-season game since. He
lost to Cleveland in that year's league championship series, lost
twice to Baltimore in the 1997 division series, twice to San Diego
in the division series last year while pitching for Houston, and
now once to the Mets. No other pitcher has suffered six successive
post-season defeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely something getting a win off him,'' Olerud
said, ``because he's such a dominating pitcher and such a tough guy
getting runs off.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud's home run was the first by a left-handed batter against
Johnson in two years. In fact, of the 199 home runs that Johnson
had allowed in his career only 10 had been struck by left-handers.
So Olerud was asked to explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain myself,'' the soft-spoken first baseman said.
``I don't say this very often, but I definitely have to give the
glory to Jesus Christ because he's got such good stuff _ good
fastball, good slider _ that you just have to be ready to pull the
trigger quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his time at bat in the third inning, Olerud related, he
was looking for a slider and Johnson threw fastballs. ``Then,''
Olerud said, ``I got two strikes on me, so I've got to look for a
fastball and he throws the slider and I'm out in front, but somehow
I got the barrel of the bat on the ball and got enough of it to go
out of the ball park.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this game, Olerud had batted only five times against
Johnson and had no hits; Ventura had had 6 hits in 34 at-bats for a
.176 average. During this season, left-handers batted only .103
against Johnson and had nearly four times as many strikeouts, 35,
as they had hits, 9, in 87 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked a little bit about how we were going to approach
him, that sort of thing, but there's not a whole lot you're going
to tell the other guy,'' Olerud said. ``He's got a good fastball
and if he's throwing the slider over for strikes, that makes him
real tough. You try to get a pitch to hit, try to see the ball as
early as you can and be real quick to the ball. You have to be real
quick with your decision and with swinging the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said he was fortunate this time to get a couple of hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we went in with any special plan,'' the third
baseman said. ``He's just tough on left-handers. You have to hang
in there so long. He gets a good angle on you. I've seen him when
he's just blown teams away. I don't think he was throwing quite
that hard, but I didn't feel very comfortable up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets generally did feel more comfortable at bat than they
had when they were losing some games and struggling to win others
in the past two weeks. In that period they abandoned their pattern
of taking pitches and forcing pitchers to go deeper into the count,
and they gained undesirable results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through that stretch, swinging at a lot of first
pitches, not working the count,'' Ventura said. ``Nobody said this
is what we have to do, but going up there and having a good at-bat
goes hand in hand, making sure you get a good pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he didn't ``make my pitches.'' The ones he referred
to were the ones the Mets hit. &QL;

GORE FEELING INCREASING HEAT FROM BRADLEY IN PACIFIC NORTHWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore, once considered to have a lock
on the Democratic presidential nomination, is facing increasing
pressure in Washington state and the West from his fast-rising
challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign in the Pacific Northwest is showing signs of
catching on as rapidly as in the East, where polls show the former
New York Knicks forward narrowly leading Gore in New Hampshire and
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gore is in serious trouble,'' said Tim Hibbitts, an
independent Portland, Ore.-based pollster. ``I'm not saying Bradley
is going to take away the nomination, but I sense Clinton fatigue
even in the Democratic Party. The irony is that those who may wind
up paying the price are Al Gore and Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Don McDonough, a Seattle-based Democratic pollster, added: ``I
happen to think this is more a Bradley-type state than a Gore-type
state.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Democratic State Committee meeting, former state
Chairwoman Karen Marchioro asked for a show of hands of Gore
supporters, Bradley backers and undecideds. ``It was one-third,
one-third, one third,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The shift toward Bradley represents an earthquake on a political
landscape that Gore has cultivated non-stop. The vice president has
paid 10 visits to Washington since the 1996 election, and will
formally kick off his state campaign with a $1,000-a-plate dinner
at Seattle's Benaroya Hall Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has stood atop the 14,411-foot summit of Mount Rainier,
inspected a flood-caused sinkhole in Shoreline and run a
10-kilometer race against breast cancer. He has attended more than
a dozen fund-raisers, chaired a salmon forum and spoken at an
election-eve rally last year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bradley has courted the Northwest on deliberately,
deceptively low-key visits. He did not invited TV cameras to film
him playing basketball with Central Area teenagers, nor did he
publicize a Seattle luncheon held the day that the
Bradley-for-president committee officially came into existence.
</P>
<P>
   But he has won converts with what former Washington Rep. Al
Swift describes as ``a marvelous, old-shoe style. He is non-puffed
up. He projects a relaxed quality which contrasts well with vice
president's stiffer personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had an hourlong talk with Seattle Mayor Paul Schell when
he visited Seattle on a bookselling tour last fall. In April,
Schell became the first big-city mayor to support Bradley for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Schell felt some heat at the time. Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., a
Gore intimate, insisted that Schell put in a call to the vice
president and explain reasons for endorsing his rival.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the mayor said Wednesday, ``I don't feel at all alone.
We have a real race now.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a political scientist to understand why
increasing numbers of Democrats would give Bradley a serious look.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats want to hold onto the White House. And while this
state's top officials are in Gore's camp, officeholders lower on
the totem pole _ particularly in competitive districts _ are
sensing they should offer a fresh face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have major problems with Gore, I just ... want to
win,'' said state Rep. Dave Anderson, D-Langley, a Bradley backer.
``Bill Bradley has a lot of fresh ideas we really need. And there's
a combination of disgust and malaise around Clinton's presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   A few prominent Northwest Democrats are speaking up along
similar lines.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is ``perceived correctly as a consummate Washington, D.C.,
insider'' and Bradley ``doesn't have to carry that baggage,'' said
Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, who has made no endorsement in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Former four-term Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus is more outspoken,
saying Gore would be a ``disaster'' for Democratic candidates
sharing the ballot in Western states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Al Gore carrying anything west of the Mississippi
River with the possible exception of California, which is a land
unto itself,'' Andrus said. ``In the Rocky Mountain West, he won't
even make a respectable showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley would do quite well, particularly against young
Bush,'' Andrus added. ``Many young Republican businessmen like him.
Bradley is a clear fresh face without smudges.''
</P>
<P>
   The view is vigorously disputed by Dicks, who has been lining up
endorsements from fellow House members. He predicts that Gore will
come out fighting and lay to rest the campaign malaise long before
voters go to the polls 13 months from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd do fine, he'd carry both Washington and Oregon,'' Dicks
said. ``He is an outstanding debater, who will do extremely well in
upcoming forums with Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Dicks see any signs of ``Clinton fatigue'' in the
Northwest, citing the region's pace-setting job growth over the
past seven years, and the president's hands-on involvement in
issues from Boeing jet sales to forest policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the fatigue factor, Gore can still bring formidable
strengths to a one-on-one showdown with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   He has the backing of party leaders and interest groups. The
invitation to Gore's Benaroya Hall fund-raiser bears the names of
Gov. Gary Locke, Sen. Patty Murray, three members of Congress, five
state elected officials and State Democratic Chairman Paul Berendt.
The state's most powerful union, the Boeing Machinists, is set to
formally endorse the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also is anything but reluctant about showing its
support for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle political consultant Cathy Allen has come out for
Bradley, saying the former senator ``gives us a chance with
undecided, only-presidential-year voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen says she has been ``bugged mercilessly'' for her stand. As
she departed a recent White House conference, Allen was followed to
the car by presidential counselor Ann Lewis, making the quiet
argument that she should reconsider and back Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Swift, who is neutral in the race, warns against ``writing off
Gore. ... He has been in our state a lot. He knows a lot about
Northwest issues, I would suspect more than Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is far less organized, although he has broken through
with endorsements ranging from 14 Democratic state legislators to
business leaders. The host committee for his April Seattle
fund-raiser bore such names as Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz,
developer David Sabey, new Seattle Mariners Chairman Howard
Lincoln, Chris Larson of Microsoft, and former Burlington Northern
executive Gerald Grinstein.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest has smiled on reformist insurgents, dating back to
the 1968 anti-war candidacy of Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy. In
1992, Washington's precinct caucuses went for ex-Sen. Paul Tsongas
and former California Gov. Jerry Brown, with Clinton finishing a
weak fourth. Gary Hart upset former Vice President Walter Mondale
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley is picking up good vibes on both sides of the
mountain,'' said former Washington Gov. Mike Lowry, who divides his
time between Renton and Kettle Falls. ``He is raising the right
issues. He is a person with credibility.''

 &HT;    E-commerce hot topic at Fall Internet World
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five years ago, Intel Corp.'s only Web presence was a
bare-bones site boasting little more than company propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Five years from now, Intel will not only get all of its profits
off of Internet sales, but the Web will define the No. 1
chipmaker's business, predicted Chief Executive Craig Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, no one will single out Internet companies any
more because everyone will be doing all their business over the
Net,'' Barrett said Wednesday at Fall Internet World 1999, held
through Friday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. ``Either
get in this process or get left behind, because competition is only
a mouse click away.''
</P>
<P>
   To a crowd of representatives from both small startups and major
market leaders, Barrett tagged business-to-business e-commerce as a
lucrative opportunity for growth _ and he made it clear Intel will
jump in quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, customers buy roughly $1 billion worth of Intel
processors over the Internet each month _ at sites ranging from
Intel's own to those of major computer makers, Barrett said. Within
one year, he said, Intel will sell almost all its processors
online.
</P>
<P>
   With e-commerce firmly entrenched in the Internet arena, most of
the 600 companies exhibiting at Internet World are vying to be the
technology that powers those sales portals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In e-commerce, there's a lot that goes into a transaction, and
that can be a huge cost for companies,'' said David Munaretto of
the Association of Internet Professionals trade group. ``We're
seeing a lot of companies trying to get online with the big
companies and handle their reliability, transaction volumes and
even inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest eye-catchers at Internet World was an army of
actors in Santa Claus suits hired by an Austin, Texas, Internet
software company that makes software that can be used by Internet
retailers to create gift registries.
</P>
<P>
   Ivebeengood.com, a subsidiary of Austin-based Trilogy Software
Inc., is hoping the Santas will help raise awareness of its product
in advance of what is expected to be a record year for holiday
sales over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet software companies dominated the exhibit hall at
Internet World.
</P>
<P>
   CyberCash Inc., for example, showed off software aimed at
security and speeding up transactions, while ComAlliance Inc.
pitched software used to adjust and monitor a Web company's
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Austin-based Pervasive Software Inc. used its booth to debut
Tango 2000, a software suite that helps companies monitor activity
on their Web sites. Balancing Barrett's emphasis on businesses,
Oracle Corp. Chief Executive Larry Ellison used his afternoon
keynote to some of the almost 50,000 Internet World attendees to
predict the Internet's impact on all computer users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll move from personal computing to network computing, all
via the Internet,'' Ellison said. ``It will be the new model for
computing. Everything will mirror the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for online storage of both applications and data,
making Web browsers the only software tool users need on their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to underscore the ease of Web-based computing, Ellison
took a series of familiar potshots at rival Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the company's operating systems for making computing
too complex, and criticized it for loading PCs with software that
requires costly and often troublesome upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all the programmers out there: Build for the Web, not for
Windows,'' Ellison urged. ``That's the future.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Oracle is preparing to debut a $150 network
computer _ essentially a plastic shell equipped only with a modem
and a Web browser _ and of course, a basic operating system by
Linux, the upstart alternative to Microsoft's Windows.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS _ She has a lived-in laugh, a deep, rueful chuckle
made of good times and bum times, of cigarettes and singing and
long, hard nights on the road. Somewhere around the first sip of
the second cocktail in her elegant old living room, it dawns on a
visitor just what a life Rosemary Clooney has lived.
</P>
<P>
   For 46 years, she has made her home in this rambling house,
where George and Ira Gershwin wrote their last song, ``Love Is Here
to Stay.'' The silver frames that line her bookshelves and piano
hold photographs of Marlene Dietrich, John F. Kennedy and her
movie-star nephew, George, who started his Hollywood career as a
gofer and chore boy here. When she talks about Bing and Bob, Dean
and Frank, they are not legends, but friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did Bing's radio show, always, and later we did a 15-minute
daily show, five days a week that we taped in this room,'' she
said. ``We would sit around the table sort of like this, and then
they'd set up the microphones, and we'd break out some Scotch.''
They would circle their own lines, but not read them in advance, so
that when they performed the scripts, it was always spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   Spontaneous is Ms. Clooney's default mode. At 71, she is a
survivor of a swinging era whose greats are almost all gone. She
still sings the old songs the way they were meant to be sung, and
she tells priceless stories of watching the fights on television
with Crosby and his date for the night, the young Grace Kelly, in
sweater set and pearls. But Ms. Clooney is no nostalgia act. She is
the spiritual godmother to younger singers like Linda Ronstadt, and
she has just recorded a duet of ``The Boy From Ipanema'' with Diana
Krall, the hot young jazz pianist and singer, to be released next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   It was not quite twilight, and Ms. Clooney and her husband,
Dante DiPaolo, a dapper Hollywood hoofer she fell in love with
nearly 50 years ago at Paramount studios and then jilted to marry
Jose Ferrer, were sitting at a needlepoint chess table Ms. Clooney
had made for Ferrer between nightclub shows at the Waldorf-Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't take it with him,'' Ms. Clooney said dryly of the
man she married and divorced twice and with whom she had five
children. Ferrer's smiling picture still hangs in a prominent place
in her den.
</P>
<P>
   As the day's last minivans full of stargazing tourists glided by
the crape myrtle tree in the front yard, the conversation drifted
gently over the past. But the evening was actually a rare lull
before Ms. Clooney would plunge headlong into the future again.
</P>
<P>
   First would be a trip to her hometown of Maysville, Ky., just
down the river from Cincinnati, to raise money to rebuild the
theater where her first film, ``The Stars Are Singing,'' had its
premiere in 1953. Then there would be a two-week stint, through
Oct. 16, as the opening act at her friend Michael Feinstein's new
150-seat supper club at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan. ``And we
have the power of the pencil!'' Ms. Clooney said of their ability
to sign for their drinks and food, with the glee of one who knows
too well what it's like to cook on a hotel hot plate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, next month, comes the publication of ``Girl Singer''
(Doubleday) her new memoir, co-written with Joan Barthel, along
with a compilation album of career hits, reissued by her longtime
label, Concord Jazz, and a book tour that is to include an
appearance on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clooney's first autobiography, ``This for Remembrance''
(Playboy Press, 1977), was made into a television movie starring
Sondra Locke, with Ms. Clooney dubbing the vocals. The book is out
of print, and badly out of date, since it was published just as she
was beginning a tentative comeback, with Crosby's help, after a
nervous breakdown, years of addiction to prescription drugs and
one-night stands in suburban Holiday Inns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then a lot has happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, too. As a child, Ms. Clooney was passed to
relatives by her divorced, dysfunctional parents, and started
singing on the radio in Cincinnati. At 18, with her sister, Betty,
she went on the road with Tony Pastor's big band. ``Come On-a My
House,'' an improbable fake Armenian folk song with a hokey
harpsichord accompaniment and words by William Saroyan, made her a
solo star at 23. She then made five movies in quick succession,
including ``White Christmas,'' with Bing Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage to Ferrer produced five children in five years.
(Bob Hope called it ``Vatican Roulette,'' and after the third one,
he and Crosby gave her track shoes and starting blocks; Tennessee
Ernie Ford insisted, ``You've got to find out what's causing
this.'') But Ferrer, 16 years her senior, was an incorrigible
womanizer, as she learned on their honeymoon. They split up for
good in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   A heartbreaking and ill-fated affair with the arranger Nelson
Riddle, the rise of rock 'n' roll and her own growing dependence on
a rainbow arsenal of uppers and downers left Ms. Clooney on the
edge. When her friend Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 as
she waited to greet him at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, she
snapped. Weeks later, convinced Kennedy was still alive, she
stormed off a stage in Reno and drove her white Cadillac covered
with flower decals up the wrong side of a mountain road to Lake
Tahoe in the dark, yelling, ``That's one for you, God!'' every time
an oncoming car veered out of her way. That got her placed in the
locked ward of Cedars-Sinai Hospital with other severely depressed
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confused at first,'' Ms. Clooney said. ``Not confused,''
she amended. ``I was crazy. But Phil Silvers was there, and he was
walking up and down the halls, really nervous, highly charged, and
I thought, `Well, this is just pretend, you know.''' Her sense of
unreality was heightened by the fact that one of the therapists on
the ward was Betsy Drake, who had been married to Cary Grant. ``Who
could take that seriously?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was serious enough: Ms. Clooney was in therapy for the next
eight years, kicked her drug habit, and began to rebuild
relationships with her children, then 8 to 13, who had been largely
raised by Ms. Clooney's mother _ a bitter twist, since her mother
had abandoned Rosemary and her younger sister, Betty, when they
were young.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She never really reconciled with her mother before she died in
1973. It was only a few weeks later that she became reacquainted
with DiPaolo. As she was stopped at a traffic light in Beverly
Hills in her Corvette convertible, he pulled up in his Thunderbird
and called out, ``Rosella!'' She had not laid eyes on him in 20
years, but she invited him to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later he moved in, becoming her road manager and
indispensable man. Two years ago, tired of explaining their
domestic arrangements to Ms. Clooney's nine grandchildren, they
were married in the church in Maysville where Ms. Clooney was
baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Decades before, when she dropped him for Ferrer, DiPaolo said,
``Oh, I crashed. I mean, I really couldn't understand that at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clooney said gently: ``He was the kindest man that I've ever
known. He was also funny.''
</P>
<P>
   But in those years, Ms. Clooney said, she was too busy running
away from her own insecurities to pick a man like DiPaolo. And her
Hollywood life was heady, in a household that featured butler,
cook, housekeeper, upstairs maid, laundress, secretary, gardener
and pool man, on a block where the neighbors included Jack Benny,
Lucille Ball and James Stewart. There were friendly evenings with
Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, after-dinner coffee with Nat King Cole
at the piano, girl talk with Dietrich and Billie Holiday, nights in
Las Vegas watching Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was happy in a lot of ways,'' Ms. Clooney
said of Sinatra. ``I think that's why the kind of immature things
that Sammy and Dean and Joey Bishop and all those guys did when
they were together. That was the fun that he had that he'd never
had when he was a kid, and he could be in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes now, she said, she sees her nephew George (his father
is her brother, Nick) seeking safety in a somewhat similar
camaraderie. ``I see him hanging with his friends, the guys that
play basketball,'' she said. ``They're his guys, and they have to
go on their golfing trip every year. I see that, and I wonder if
it's the same kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clooney knows the loneliness of fame. In her new book, she
recalls a Christmas Eve party at Humphrey Bogart and Lauren
Bacall's in the mid-'50s. Her own career was on a roll, but she
felt strangely depressed. She caught sight of Spencer Tracy, who
asked what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' she writes. ``I've never been to a party on
Christmas Eve. I guess I'm just homesick.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy said, ``Get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess maybe it was just a couple of burned-out Catholics,''
Ms. Clooney recalled. ``Sometimes I felt way out of my depth, you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, her Christmas Eves are very different, with Champagne and
caviar in her big house on North Roxbury Drive full of family and
friends. Her eldest son, Miguel, is an actor in New York, as is her
youngest, Rafael. Gabriel, married to the singer Debby Boone, is an
artist and Episcopal priest at a Beverly Hills church near her
house. Her older daughter, Maria, raises Arabian horses in the
Santa Ynez Valley near Santa Barbara. Her daughter Monsita is
married to a television executive and raising a family.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clooney has made some concessions to age and knee surgery,
and now sings only one show a night. But she keeps trying new
things and said a new album of Brazilian songs, with the guitarist
John Pizzarelli and featuring the duet with Ms. Krall, was the
hardest music she ever had to learn. She said she'll keep singing
as long as she can stand, and if she can't, she'll sit, as Mabel
Mercer did.
</P>
<P>
   But she has yet to schedule the sessions with a voice coach that
Bob Hope's 90-year-old wife, Dolores, recently gave her as a
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``She still sings, beautifully,'' Ms. Clooney said of her old
friend. ``But I'm too old to take a lesson now.''

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - A visitor to New York City never forgets
the first time he opens the door of a taxi in midtown Manhattan,
gazes at the majestic skyscrapers, then steps out onto a mound of
excreta, which makes a ``gersh'' sound as his foot sinks in. With
the New York Mets in town, fond memories like this are as easily
dredged up as bodies from the East River. Particularily after
reading a nasty story about Phoenix in the ``New York Post.'' The
writer's name was Gersh Kuntzman. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move
in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
POWER PLANT (Undated) - Environmentalists and utility officials
announce a $300 million cleanup of air-pollution from the Mohave
Generating Station in Laughlin, Nev. Unlike the recently completed
cleanup of the Navajo Generating Station, on the other side of the
Grand Canyon, the deregulation of the electric power industry means
there are no guarantees that the plant will be cleaned up. If
Southern California Edison or subsequent owners close the plant,
rather than clean it up, it will mean a loss of coal-mining
royalties for the Hopi and Navajo tribes. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DOLE (Phoenix) - Staff for presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole,
who returns to Arizona Friday to pump up a bit of support, have
come out swinging against John McCain, saying they `refuse to cede`
Arizona to him and are going to have a bit of a rumpus. There is
little sign of that, however. The only public appearance by the
candidate will be a photo-op with Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza. By
KRIS MAYES. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NYREACT (Phoenix) - How are New Yorkers responding to the
Mets/Diamondbacks series? By STAFF. Story will move in the ``A''
and ``S'' categories. &QL;

PARKINSON'S (Phoenix) - Interviews with Parkinson's patients,
doctors, medical ethicists and advocates of fetal tissue research
in light of a judge's order to overturn a ban on such research in
Arizona. Possible reaction from the family of late Arizona
Congressman Morris Udall, who underwent the treatment. By KERRY
FEHR-SNYDER. Story will move in the ``A`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WILSON-COLUMN (Undated) - Sometime not too many years from now, you
or I will be able to roll out of bed, power up our computer and
legally play a few hands of blackjack on a Web site before heading

 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Investors in Brazil are beginning to get
nervous over the future possibility that the government might try
to renegotiate its domestic debt, which has nearly doubled in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility has grown in part because the idea of a debt
renegotiation has been promoted by a rising presidential candidate,
Ciro Gomes, a 41-year-old former finance minister. He has made debt
renegotiation part of a broader economic proposal that, he says,
would encourage long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal would lengthen the maturities and lower the
interest payments on the domestic debt _ the government bonds and
notes that are denominated in the Brazilian currency, the real. By
doing so, Gomes said, he hoped to narrow Brazil's growing budget
deficit. He would also hope to redirect money now fueling profits
at financial institutions that buy high-yielding government bonds
into areas in need such as education, housing and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has attracted a mixture of bemusement, anger and
anxiety among Brazilian financiers, especially since Gomes' rising
popularity makes him one of the main contenders in the presidential
election, to be held in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crazy idea that would cripple the economy, creating
capital flight and bringing back the risk of inflation,'' said
David Gotlib, managing director of Deutsche Bank Asset Management's
Brazilian operations. ``I can only hope the gravity of doing such a
thing will be perceived in time for the proposal to be withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   With the election that far in the future, many things can
obviously happen in the meantime. Still, Gomes' proposal has
generated energetic discussion here over the dynamics of Brazil's
domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
   That debt is different from debt owed by the governments in
advanced economies such as the United States, which are able to
sell bonds with maturities of up to 30 years. Brazil, by contrast,
is only able to sell bonds domestically with maturities up to five
years. The average maturity of all Brazilian government debt is
only about nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for such short maturities is a reluctance by
investors to buy longer-maturing bonds, given a history over the
last couple of decades the national and some state governments
reneging on obligations.
</P>
<P>
   From 1982 to 1990, a period of hyperinflation and economic
crisis, Brazil restructured its domestic debt three times. The last
of these took place by surprise shortly after Fernando Collor de
Mello became president in 1990, and the government froze and then
seized bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil's track record is not particularly stellar in this
regard,'' said Fergus McCormick, a debt analyst at the Duff &AMP;
Phelps Credit Rating Corp..
</P>
<P>
   A country's domestic debt rating is usually higher than the
rating on its foreign debt, or debt owed in foreign currency to
lenders in other countries. But in Brazil's case, Duff &AMP; Phelps
rates its domestic debt B, three notches below its foreign debt
rating of BB.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the financiers' and bond analysts' apprehension reflects
a worrisome growth of Brazilian domestic debt, which is held almost
entirely by Brazilians. In the last two years, the domestic debt
has ballooned to nearly 400 billion reais _ now about $205 billion,
from 210 billion reais. By contrast, the foreign debt grew 13
percent in the same period, to $97.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the near-doubling of the domestic debt load
is the government's reliance on bonds that pay a variable rate of
interest. So when the central bank raised interest rates during the
financial crises in Asia, Russia and earlier this year at home,
debt-servicing costs soared.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's debt makeup is still largely dependent on moves in
interest rates, with more than half of domestic debt linked to the
main overnight-lending rate, now around 19 percent. An additional
26 percent of the debt is linked to the real's value in relation to
the dollar. That means a sharp weakening in the Brazilian currency
would sharply increase the cost of servicing these bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes' debt-restructuring proposal reflects the thinking of
Roberto Mangabeira Unger, a legal theorist who is his principal
adviser. Unger, a Brazilian who has been teaching at Harvard Law
School since 1971, argues that the nature of Brazil's domestic debt
means that it is vulnerable to potential negative developments
abroad, such as a correction on Wall Street or apprehension over
Year 2000 computer problems. Turbulence abroad can spur the
Brazilian central bank to raise rates, which means that the
government's financing costs also rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has made a very dangerous bet by not
considering the eventuality of an internal debt reorganization,''
Unger said in a telephone interview. ``First, it means that almost
the totality of projected federal revenue will be used in servicing
the debt, and second, the commitments to economic opening and
fiscal realism are put at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger's views on government finances and other subjects such as
the possibility of using controls to limit short-term capital flows
have been known for some time. But recently, they have gained
prominence as Gomes, the 2002 presidential aspirant, became
something of a darling in the Brazilian news media after his
separation from his first wife and much-publicized romance with
Patricia Pillar, a soap-opera actress.
</P>
<P>
   Unger began to influence Gomes' thinking when the politician was
a visiting scholar at Harvard in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say that a debt renegotiation would be exceedingly
complex and do more harm than good. Mailson da Nobrega, a former
finance minister, said about 80 percent of Brazil's domestic debt
is indirectly held by the country's middle class, either through
mutual funds, pension funds or insurance policies backed by
government bonds. ``How do you renegotiate with crowds that would
fit into several soccer stadiums?'' he asked rhetorically. ``This
is an idea thought up in a Harvard library, far from Brazilian
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's central bank has said that the debt situation is
improving. For example, in August the government was able to
increase to 11.7 percent the share of debt that is not subject to
variable rates, from 1.2 percent in March. With the authorities
forecasting a decline in interest rates to single-digit rates by
next year, debt-servicing costs should decline as a result.

 &HT;    Buchanan considers cost of joining Reform Party
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS - Pat Buchanan, a presidential candidate in search of a
party, huddled privately Wednesday with Reform Party National
Chairman Russ Verney to discuss the ups and downs of seeking the
support of the political group that Ross Perot built.
</P>
<P>
   The up side is $13 million in federal money the Reform Party
nominee will get. The down side is the cost _ as much as $6 million
_ of getting that nominee on the ballot in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the key factors in the equation Buchanan, now a
Republican, is using to decide what the Reform Party nomination is
worth. But the outspoken conservative sounds interested in
undertaking the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a formidable challenge,'' he said after meeting with
Verney. ``No doubt about it. To get on the ballots in 50 states
with the obstacles and hurdles is difficult. Is it prohibitive? I
didn't get the impression it is prohibitive.''
</P>
<P>
   What is prohibitive for Buchanan at this point are his chances
of winning the GOP nomination. Like all Republican contenders,
Buchanan is being buried by Gov. George W. Bush's massive
fund-raising effort.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan now is packaging himself as a choice he believes
America is seeking. The two major parties don't offer ``a dime's
worth of difference,'' he said _ especially on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, when it comes to foreign policy and using America's
military forces abroad, some of Mr. Bush's advisers make me more
nervous than Mr. Clinton's advisers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On foreign policy and trade policy and immigration policy and
on restoring American sovereignty, I think there is very little
difference between Mr. Bush and what the Democratic Party at the
national level offers America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, that said, Buchanan indicated he is not inclined to mount a
third-party presidential bid if its major effect would be to spoil
some other candidate's chances of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not do this unless I genuinely believed there was a
fighting chance to get in the debates and then come out of those
debates as a real alternative and choice to the American people and
win the presidency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in going in and just trying to muck up an
election by getting on a few ballots,'' he added. ``I can do that
in journalism. If I go for this thing, I'm going for the presidency
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Top Bush advisers don't believe Buchanan would be a shoo-in for
the nomination of the Reform Party, an organization which, to date,
has staked its claim on economic issues, not the social ones
championed by Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan, who shares the Reform Party's stand against NAFTA,
said Wednesday that only ``another gigantic bankroll'' could
prevent him from getting the Reform Party nod if he wants it. New
York real-estate magnate Donald Trump, who has such a bankroll,
might seek the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's potential party switch has drawn questions from the
Reform Party's only major elected official, Minnesota Gov. Jesse
Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Buchanan is certainly direct in many of the issues
he talks on, but I don't think that he fits the role of the Reform
Party today ... because we're very much a centrist party. Fiscally
conservative and socially on the liberal side, and I don't think
Pat fits very well into that,'' Ventura said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said the meeting with Buchanan was an effort to make sure
Buchanan understands the challenge in getting the Reform Party
nomination and then working to get the party's nominee on ballots
across the nation. Laws vary from state to state. The states that
offer the biggest obstacles _ both in terms of number of signatures
needed and time allowed to gather them _ are Texas and North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the Reform Party would have to mount a petition drive
among registered voters who do not vote in next March's major party
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, the party's 1992 and 1996 nominee, was on the ballot
nationwide. In 1996, he spent $12 million of his own money to make
it happen. Verney said the 2000 nominee would have to spend about
$6 million to get on all ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big job,'' said Verney, ``but manageable.''

FCC MOVES TO SET CONDITIONS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS MEGAMERGERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal officials this week began setting the
conditions they will impose on a wave of proposed mergers that
promise to consolidate, blur and redefine the nation's telephone,
cable and broadcasting industries in a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday approved SBC
Communications Inc.'s $72 billion takeover of Ameritech Corp., but
imposed conditions that officials said were intended to force SBC
to be more competitive with other regional and local telephone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the FCC is set to announce new ownership
concentration rules for cable companies that will determine whether
AT&AMP;T can complete its $58 billion acquisition of Mediaone without
shedding any assets.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday, FCC Chairman William Kennard questioned how MCI
Worldcom's $115 billion bid for Sprint Inc. could benefit
consumers, suggesting the companies have to shed Internet
components and long-distance properties to gain regulatory
approval.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials said Wednesday that in drawing the lines on these
deals and a handful of others _ valued at almost $250 billion in
all _ the commission was trying to balance economies of scale,
which could result in lower prices to consumers, against
large-scale consolidations that could result in less competition
and higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly not per se against consolidations,
particularly those that achieve the kinds of economies of scale
that can help consumers,'' Kennard said in an interview Wednesday.
``On the other hand, we are against those consolidations that raise
the barriers to entry by competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue complicating the deliberations of Kennard and the FCC
is the state of local telephone service, which in many pockets of
the nation has remained largely resistant to competition.
</P>
<P>
   In broadly deregulating the industry, the Telecommunications Act
of 1996 required that regional Bell companies that seek to enter
the highly lucrative long-distance business must first establish
that there is true competition in their local service areas. To
promote that provision, the commission required SBC, as part of its
merger with Ameritech, to enter 30 cities outside its region within
18 months or else face fines of more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   SBC chairman Edward Whitacre said in an interview Wednesday that
Texas regulators had notified SBC that it had shown sufficient
local competition to qualify to offer long-distance service in
Texas. Whitacre said he expected SBC would be filing an application
with the FCC in coming weeks to offer long distance to Texas
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an interesting, exciting and great day,'' Whitacre
said. ``We've worked long and hard for this.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC's previous application to the FCC to be allowed to enter the
$80 billion long-distance market have failed. But Whitacre said
that consolidation resulting from the MCI Worldcom-Sprint deal
would place greater pressure on Washington regulators to open the
long-distance market to the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious answer to all this,'' he said, ``is let everybody
do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's action by the FCC means that the seven Baby Bells
originally created by the 1980s breakup of the old American
Telephone &AMP; Telegraph Co. will soon be reduced to four. And if the
MCI Worldcom-Sprint deal is approved, four dominant long distance
carriers will be reduced to two.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard's remarks about the MCI Worldcom and SBC acquisitions
were notable for more than what they said about the deals
themselves. The resulting level of concentration would be stunning,
not only for the telephone industry, but also for the broadcast and
cable industries.
</P>
<P>
   Two other deals now before the FCC _ Viacom's acquisition of CBS
and AT&AMP;T's purchase of the Mediaone cable television company close
on the heels of its purchase of Telecommunications Inc. _ would
break the current caps that were supposed to limit market
domination. In general terms, no more than 30 percent of either
industry can be controlled by one company, and both mergers far
exceed that.
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong expectation that the FCC and the Justice
Department's Antitrust Division will, at the very least, require
some of these deals to be significantly scaled back by requiring
the sale of major components of the companies as a condition of
regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the FCC is set to hand down new cable concentration
rules, and the industry is watching whether the agency will relax
its standards to permit AT&AMP;T to complete the acquisition of
Mediaone.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard and other officials at the FCC also suggested that the
rules under consideration for the cable industry might be different
than those for other industries. That is because a convergence of
telecommunications, computer and broadcasting technologies now
enables cable companies to offer television programs, high-speed
Internet access and telephone services over a single cable.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the aim of the rules to be announced Friday
would be to prevent further consolidation of traditional cable
service _ television _ while encouraging AT&AMP;T and its smaller
competitors to continue to invest heavily in developing networks
capable of offering high-speed Internet and telephone services as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cable industry is both mature and moving into a new
market, trying to compete with the Bells in local telephone and
broad-band telephony,'' Kennard said. ``It's like the Yankees
baseball team deciding that they want to now compete in basketball.
You want them to be competitive. At the same time, you don't want
to give them the ability to totally dominate their traditional
market.''

HOUSE PASSES HEALTH CARE BILL; CLINTON THREATENS TO VETO IT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives passed a bill on
Wednesday creating tax breaks to help millions of people buy health
insurance. But it also took a procedural step that jeopardizes
legislation to define patients' rights and regulate health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and House Democrats cried foul. The White
House said Clinton would veto the bill authorizing new tax breaks
for the purchase of health insurance if the measure reached his
desk in the form approved by the House on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Clinton and House Democrats have demanded a House
debate on legislation to set stringent, enforceable federal
standards for HMOs and insurance companies. They got their wish on
Wednesday. The debate began.
</P>
<P>
   But House Republicans insisted that the House first take up a
separate bill that would create new tax breaks and
insurance-pooling arrangements to help individuals and small
businesses buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the bill, which encourages the use of tax-free
savings accounts to set aside money for routine medical expenses,
could help millions of people without insurance. But the White
House said the bill would cost more than $40 billion over 10 years
and would help fewer than 1 percent of the people who lack
coverage, mainly healthy people with higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual procedural move, the Republican majority voted on
Wednesday to yoke this tax credit bill to whatever patient
protection bill is approved by the House on Thursday. That will
have the effect of draining support from the most popular patient
protection bill, which is backed by many Democrats who oppose the
tax credit bill. Further clouding the chances of a patient
protection bill, Republicans refused to let Democrats include a way
to pay the costs of a bill.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and many Republicans said they wanted a patient
protection bill, to help people denied care by the cost-control
tactics of HMOs. But House Speaker Dennis Hastert said, ``The most
important patient protection is to provide health care coverage for
people who do not now have it.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats said they had enough votes to pass a popular
bipartisan HMO patients' rights bill, drafted by Reps. Charlie
Norwood, R-Ga., and John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said on Wednesday: ``The House leaders concocted a
process filled with enough poison pills and legislative sleights of
hand to practically guarantee the defeat of this bill. This is a
travesty. It's the sort of thing they did to kill common-sense gun
legislation in the aftermath of Littleton.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans rejected the criticism, saying the Democrats wanted
a political issue for next year's elections rather than genuine
protections for patients. Rep. David Dreier of California, who
wrote the rules of debate as chairman of the House Rules Committee,
said Clinton's criticism was ``just preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans cited a new Census Bureau report showing an increase
in the uninsured as evidence that Congress must deal first with
their problems, before worrying about new rights for people who
already have coverage. On Sunday, the bureau reported that the
number of people without health insurance rose last year by
833,000, to a total of 44.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bill to create tax breaks and other incentives for the
purchase of insurance was approved on Wednesday night by a vote of
227 to 205. Voting in favor of the measure were 216 Republicans and
11 Democrats. Five Republicans joined 199 Democrats and 1
independent in opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to vote on Thursday on proposals to
define patients' rights. If one of those bills survives, it would
be merged with the bill intended to expand access to health
insurance. And the package would be sent to the Senate, which
approved a more limited set of patients' rights in July.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, said the merger of the two bills
without a separate vote was ``a very peculiar procedure,'' devised
by Republican leaders to ``derail meaningful regulation of the
managed-care industry.'' The tactic, he said, ``may well doom''
enactment of legislation to define patients' rights.

   As the House today began its long-awaited debate on health care
legislation, some Democrats said they had been outfoxed and
outmaneuvered by House Republican leaders, who have for months
tried to put off debate on the Norwood-Dingell bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark of California, one of the Democrats' leading
experts on health policy, said: ``The Republicans have scored a
procedural victory, no question. They are basically defeating
patient protections through through procedural legerdemain.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats denounced the rules of debate as a Machiavellian
tactic to weaken support for the Norwood-Dingell bill among members
of both parties. And, they conceded, it might work, but the outcome
is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic floor leader,
said that passage of a patients' rights bill was ``severely
endangered'' by the Republican rules of debate, approved on
Wednesday by a party-line vote of 221 to 209.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwood-Dingell bill has a comparatively modest cost, $7
billion over five years. By contrast, the tax breaks for the
uninsured are estimated to cost $47 billion over 10 years. Neither
bill pays for these costs _ a source of grave concern to fiscal
conservatives in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., said Democrats had begun to worry
about the cost of their patients' rights bill ``only at the last
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to cause a loss of federal revenue for this
reason: Health insurance premiums would rise slightly as HMOs and
other health plans provide more care and incur new administrative
costs. Employers would claim larger tax deductions for the cost of
such insurance. Tax collections from employers would decline
slightly, as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they wanted to pay for the cost of their
patients' rights bill, but Republicans refused to allow any
amendment for that purpose. As a result, Gephardt predicted,
``we'll lose a pretty big number of Democrats'' when the House
votes on passage of the patients' rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed on Wednesday includes these measures to help the
uninsured:
</P>
<P>
   _People who do not receive health benefits from their employers
could take a tax deduction for the cost of any health insurance
they purchase on their own. The deduction would take effect
gradually from 2002 to 2007.
</P>
<P>
   _The government would widen access to the tax-free savings
accounts used to pay medical expenses. Congress agreed to test such
``medical savings accounts'' in 1996, but fewer than 60,000 people
have taken advantage of the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   _Trade associations and chambers of commerce could establish
group health plans for their members across the country.
Republicans say these ``association health plans'' would allow
small employers to pool their purchasing power and obtain discounts
similar to those that big employers now get from health insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, under the House bill, people could take a tax
deduction for the premiums on individual insurance covering the
costs of long-term care. And a person who cares for an elderly
relative could take an additional personal exemption. The amount of
the exemption is now set at $2,750.

Rangers batters becoming a national choke joke 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
NEW YORK _ It was an unfair question to ask an honest man.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But these are drastic times, and it's also hunting season, with
everybody now taking yet another October shot at the ``Bambies'' in
the Rangers' batting order.
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, hitting instructor Rudy Jaramillo is an honest
man. Honest and tough. ``Oak Cliff tough,'' as in the section of
Dallas where he grew up and still lives.
</P>
<P>
   So as Jaramillo nursed a $3 cup of coffee in the team's New York
hotel lobby yesterday morning, he didn't seem surprised that an
unfair question was lobbed his way.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a gag-job by his guys? A full-blown choke? Why else does
one of the best, if not the best, regular-season run-production
machines just flat disappear against the Yankees in October?
</P>
<P>
   After a Game 1 shutout here Tuesday night, the Rangers have one
run in the last 42 postseason innings. That, and seven straight
October losses to the Yankees have reduced the Rangers to joke
status in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Choke? Gag?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' answered Jaramillo, but for public
consumption what else could he say?
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly though, it has become a mental thing, and it's my
responsibility to change any negative doubts into positives,''
Jaramillo continued. ``The last thing I want to do is be
overbearing at this point. I keep thinking all it will take is one
breakthrough inning _ put some runs on the board, and then we
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   That wait, of course, now ranks up there with O.J.'s search for
the real killer. Game 2 here tonight is obviously critical for the
Rangers. It doesn't seem to matter who the Yankees pitch, but lefty
Andy Pettitte is up next.
</P>
<P>
   Each hitter will study tapes of past at-bats against Pettitte.
The scouting report will be extensive. But Jaramillo spent four
days preparing the batting order for Game 1 starter Orlando
Hernandez, and well ...
</P>
<P>
   There were two hits, both by Pudge Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy of the Rangers' postseason offensive burial came in
the top of the first in Game 1. This could have been that
breakthrough inning Jaramillo spoke of. The possibility was there.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, however, knew exactly what his escape route would be.
Gene Michael of the New York front office spent most of September
following the Rangers, just as he did in 1998. Hernandez fed off
Michael's scouting report. But with all due respect to Michael that
same scouting report could have been prepared by any Rangers fan.
They've seen it all before.
</P>
<P>
   The key out in the first inning involved Juan Gonzalez. ``He
wouldn't take the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Runners at first and second, one out, and Hernandez never threw
Gonzalez a strike. It was all off-speed stuff on the outside.
Quickly down 0-and-2, the count went to 2-and-2 before Juan swung
weakly and missed a breaking ball that was out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had pitched around left-handed hitter Rusty Greer,
walking him with Rodriguez at second. He wanted Gonzalez, and
fanned him. Hernandez, however, then dodged Rafael Palmeiro. He
gladly gave up the walk to load the bases and get to Todd Zeile,
who struck out, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to Gonzalez. If he lays off those pitches, the bases are
loaded with one out for Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan sees runners on base, and sometimes the desire is so
strong, he loses focus,'' said Jaramillo.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez destroyed the Yankees in the '96 playoff series, but
since then they haven't thrown him an October strike. In the past
four postseason games, he's 1-for-15 with no runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Juan is always a lightning rod for criticism, so in fairness,
it's not just him. It's everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan came back in his next at-bat, drove a ball up the gap,
and if it gets through, that's two RBI, and we wouldn't be having
this conversation,'' said Jaramillo. ``But Bernie \RWilliams, the
center fielder\S makes the great catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd Zeile came back in his next at-bat and drove the ball to
the 399-foot marker. It's caught at the wall. Rafael smoked the
ball twice, and got nothing out of it. Pudge doubled off the wall,
and only the dead air kept that one in the park. We did have good
contact, but with no results.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``no results'' have stretched into four postseason games
over two Octobers. And after Game 1, the Rangers again looked like
a sweep victim waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But \Rtoday\S, I'm gonna show up at the park thinking tonight
is the night,'' said Jaramillo. ``I really believe that. I'm
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   An honest man has spoken. Unfortunately, a case of reality is
also coming in loud and clear.

 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Facing a backlash from some conservative Republicans,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas softened his stern appraisal of the
Republican Party on Wednesday. Only Tuesday he had characterized
the party as too fixated on affluence and not sensitive enough to
people's needs.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in New York City, Bush, the front-runner
for the Republican presidential nomination, suggested that the
party suffered primarily from voters' misperceptions of it, not
from its own mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes, people only hear the sterile numbers and economic
news we talk about, or oftentimes people only hear our
gloom-and-doom scenario,'' he said. ``That's an image that our
party must battle, and we must battle it by making sure people
understand that we care a lot about people.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, in the middle of a formal policy speech
outlining his education proposals, Bush had seemed to find fault
not with what people were hearing, but with what Republicans were
saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, on social issues, my party has painted an image of
America slouching toward Gomorrah,'' Bush said in that speech.
``Too often, my party has focused on the national economy, to the
exclusion of all else _ speaking a sterile language of rates and
numbers. Too often, my party has confused the need for limited
government with a disdain for government itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks drew harsh repsonses from several prominent
conservatives and a few of Bush's opponents for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition,
released a statement saying: ``For his own good, he would be well
advised to avoid statements which tend to alienate the core
conservatives of the Republican Party, which will either drive them
into the arms of Pat Buchanan, to support other candidates or cause
them to stay home on Election Day.'' Only last week, Robertson
lavishly praised Bush at the coalition's convention.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, two of Bush's conservative opponents for the
Republican presidential nomination, Steve Forbes and Gary Bauer,
essentially derided him as a traitor to conservative ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly comes across as being embarrassed by the basic
principles of his party _ more freedom and less government,''
Forbes said Wednesday. ``And if he is apologetic and embarrassed by
his party, why does he seek its nomination?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's recasting of his earlier remarks suggested that while he
is intent on establishing himself as a new breed of Republican _ a
strategy that could pay off handsomely with swing voters down the
road _ he does not want to go too far toward alienating both
conservatives in the party and the very congressional Republicans
he may need to enact legislation if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you hit a dog,'' said one of Bush's advisers, ``you pet
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The adviser added that over the last few days, the Bush campaign
had received calls from congressional Republicans expressing alarm
that Bush was forgetting a promise not to campaign against them.
</P>
<P>
   The chorus of disapproval underscored the risk that Bush seems
to be taking. Although Republican candidates generally veer toward
the right in primaries, Bush is already leaning toward the center.
</P>
<P>
   That may reflect his enormous lead over other Republicans in the
polls and his confidence that he will be the party's nominee. Some
advisers said he was simply articulating his genuine beliefs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush reprimanded fellow Republicans twice in less than a week.
Last Thursday, he said that a House Republicans' spending plan that
would delay payments of the earned income tax credit for
working-class Americans was an attempt to ``balance their budget on
the backs of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush rendered his broader appraisal of the
Republican Party as too negative in its oratory and too focused on
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   That appraisal had been a part of his education speech before he
came out against the House Republicans' spending plan. His stated
opposition to that plan guaranteed that the additional criticism in
the appraisal would draw extra scrutiny, but several advisers said
they were surprised by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Wednesday, Bush made a point of praising
congressional Republicans for several legislative efforts in the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the Republican Congress that freed the states to make
the right decisions when it comes to welfare reform,'' Bush said.
``And the Republican Congress deserves great credit for that.''

 &HT;    Compromise would give F-22 program $1.3 billion
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The controversial F-22 fighter jet program emerged
a winner Wednesday night in the final round of negotiations over
Defense Department spending.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for spending an additional $1.3 billion on
the stealth fighter built by Lockheed Martin Corp. at its Marietta,
Ga., facility. The funds would be in addition to $1.2 billion that
already has won approval, bringing the program's total funding to
$2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I'm delighted, we're not going to break open the
champagne until it is signed by the president,'' said Rep. Bob Barr
(R-Ga.), whose district includes Marietta. ``It does move us steps
closer to protecting this vital program.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives the Air Force $723 million in research and
development funds to buy up to six test planes. An additional $277
million would be set aside for advanced purchase orders to start
buying the first lot of 10 planes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Another $300 million would be added to cover liability costs
associated with contract termination for subcontractors. Any money
not used can go toward the purchase of additional planes.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22 was one of the biggest stumbling blocks in the Defense
Department's spending bill. Final figures for the entire bill,
which is estimated to be upward of $267 billion, were not released
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) said he was pleased that the program
had survived its most aggressive attack in its 15-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way it turned out is the Senate prevailed, and
that's the proper position for our country,'' Cleland said. ``I
think the F-22 will help us win wars and save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   That attack on the F-22 fighter jet was led by Rep. Jerry Lewis
(R-Calif.), chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Committee.
He argued that the $70 billion program was too costly and untested,
and he successfully waged a campaign to eliminate $1.85 billion
from the House version of the spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the debate, Lewis has urged a ``pause'' in production
to bring the plane in line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes a major concession to Lewis in that the
funding used to purchase the planes would not set the production
cycle in motion. Instead, the money would be pooled from research
and development funds for testing the plane. ``We are pleased that
the House and Senate conferees recognized that it is necessary to
delay procurement of the F-22 this year,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) said he intended to keep
an eye on Lewis and his band of critics during next year's budget
deliberations. ``We're now alert to a contingent in the House that
could be trouble,'' Coverdell said. ``I'm pleased that we are
proceeding with six aircraft.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   INCIRLIK AIR BASE, Turkey _ American fighter jets patrolling
northern Iraq have an innovative new weapon to use against
President Saddam Hussein: concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of killing civilians when F-15s and F16s strike inside
Iraq, the Air Force has begun filling 2,000-pound, laser-guided
bombs with concrete instead of explosives and dropping them on
sensitive military targets near populated areas, American military
officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   A concrete bomb, the use of which has not previously been
disclosed, can still destroy a target, but it does not have what
military officials call ``the explosive arc'' of regular munitions.
And so its use minimizes the risk that explosive bomb fragments
will kill or wound innocent Iraqis who might be nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can stub your toe,'' Lt. Col. Michael S. Waters, a
spokesman for the American operation here in this base near the
Mediterranean, said of the concrete. ``But there's no chance of
collateral damage,'' he added, using the military's euphemism for
civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it useful against military targets Iraq has
positioned in residential neighborhoods in what American officials
believe is Saddam's main objective in stepping up skirmishing over
the ``no flight'' zones over northern and southern Iraq: to foment
international sympathy by publicizing civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete bombs are also an apt symbol of a low-level war
against Iraq that is dictated as much by political and diplomatic
sensitivities as by any strategic or military concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become the longest sustained military operation
since Vietnam, for more than nine months now Iraqi forces have
routinely fired on the American and British jets that patrol the
no-flight zones, and the American and British crews have routinely
struck back in what they say is self-defense. But it is a
deliberately low-key war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we're conducting this is kept within the parameters of
political acceptability,'' said a senior Clinton administration
official in Washington. ``We don't want things to go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And so pilots here at Incirlik (pronounced in-JER-lick) fly into
combat with strict rules about what, when, where and how they may
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish government, wary of public sentiment about repeated
airstrikes against a neighboring country, limits the number of days
the jets can fly and prohibits operations at night. The U.S.
European Command, which oversees operations here, has put northern
Iraq's most significant military targets off limits, fearing
international outrage over what could be seen as an escalation of
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the pilots must avoid mistakes that could play into
Saddam's hands. ``It's between none and minimal collateral damage
that we'll accept,'' said Maj. Hugh Hanlon, an F-16CJ pilot with
the 55th Fighter Squadron at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina,
who is stationed here.
</P>
<P>
   The result is something of a standoff. The American and British
forces have struck more than five times the number of targets
attacked during four days of intensive air and missile attacks
against Iraq last December's more intensive raids and flown more
than three-quarters as many combat missions as NATO pilots did
during 78 days of bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis say nearly 200 people, including many civilians, have
been killed in the airstrikes this year. American officials say
that claim is exaggerated but they acknowledge that the strikes
have caused some deaths.
</P>
<P>
   American military commanders say the airstrikes have inflicted
severe damage to Iraq's air defenses in the north. But they have
not yet hit Iraqi forces hard enough to persuade the government to
stop challenging the patrols in the no-flight zones.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders here and at the Pentagon say the strikes will end as
soon as Iraq stops firing on the patrols, even though they
acknowledge that Iraq has the ability to continue resisting at the
current level for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reached a stalemate,'' said Group Capt. Graham P. Dixon,
commander of the 200 British troops and six aircraft involved in
the operations at Incirlik. ``I'm not sure there can be a way
around this as long as Saddam Hussein is in power. I personally see
this as a long-term proposition, not a short-term one.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies created the no-flight zones
after the Persian Gulf war in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds in the
north and Shiite Muslims in the south from repression by Iraqi
forces. Officials in Washington say the zones remain an important
part of the Clinton administration's broad effort to isolate
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq never accepted the validity of the zones, but American and
allied jets patrolled them largely unmolested for more than seven
years. Then last December, the United States and Britain carried
out four days of attacks to punish Saddam for refusing to allow the
United Nations to continue inspections of his nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq then declared the zones a violation of its sovereignty, and
its forces began challenging virtually every patrol, firing
antiaircraft weapons, launching surface-to-air missiles and sending
MIG jets darting into the zones.
</P>
<P>
   While American officials decline to discuss their tactics in
depth, including how or how long they have been using the concrete
bombs, they do offer a stunning list of statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, they say, American and British patrols have
flown nearly 16,000 sorties and dropped 550 bombs against 135
targets in southern Iraq. Here at Incirlik, they have flown more
than 11,000 combat or combat-support sorties and dropped more than
1,100 bombs against more than 250 targets, including strikes on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Those targets have included more than 150 antiaircraft artillery
batteries, 30 radar or communication centers and 22 buildings used
as command centers, said Brig. Gen. David A. Deptula, the Air Force
commander here until last week.
</P>
<P>
   As in Yugoslavia, the air war has been decidedly one-sided.
Iraqi forces have yet to hit an American or British aircraft,
American officials said. According to American intelligence
reports, Iraq has withdrawn its most sophisticated weapons, like
Soviet-era surface-air-missiles, from the no-flight zones in recent
months to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not stopped Iraq from firing back with antiaircraft
artillery. That still poses a threat, though much less of one
since, the pilots and commanders say, the jets flying into northern
Iraq stay above 20,000 feet _ high enough that they are less likely
to be hit.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has also positioned its remaining antiaircraft batteries in
residential neighborhoods in or near the northern Iraqi cities like
Mosul and Tall'Afar.
</P>
<P>
   Deptula said that after American jets destroyed Iraq's main
air-defense command center south of Mosul, the Iraqis recently
moved their headquarters to the nearby historic ruins of Nineveh,
the ancient capital of Assyria built in the seventh century B.C.
While the general declined to discuss future targets, presumably
that one would be off limits.
</P>
<P>
   An American government official with access to the intelligence
reports said the Iraq's tactics had significantly diminished its
chances of hitting an aircraft, but were still accomplishing
Saddam's goal of drawing attention to the patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to provoke us to do something, but he's trying to
do it in such a way he doesn't lose assets,'' the official said.
``The ultimate intention of what Saddam Hussein is trying to do in
the `no fly' zones is not military.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactics on both sides _ including the concrete bombs _ have
turned the conflict into an odd cat-and-mouse game.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has about 50 aircraft involved in the
operation, from fighter jets to combat support. When they fly, they
take off in one long, loud procession, accompanied by a
communication plane, an RC-135 reconnaissance jet and KC-135 aerial
refueling tankers, as well as British tankers and Jaguars that
photograph potential targets.
</P>
<P>
   Once they reach the border, about an hour away, only the fighter
jets enter Iraq. The others fly over the khaki-colored mountains of
eastern Turkey out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday's mission pilots reported seeing 57 mm antiaircraft
fire, bursting in distinctive gray puffs 15,000 to 18,000 feet up,
well beneath the jets. An hour later they spotted the bursts again.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots and commanders here say they try to respond. But from
more than 20,000 feet, it is often impossible to see an artillery
battery _ no larger than a truck and often hiding in orchards or
towns _ and in those cases they attack other targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't exactly identify where the threat was,'' an F-15
pilot said of Sunday's skirmish, speaking on the condition that he
only be identified by his rank and nickname, Lt. Col. V.Q.
</P>
<P>
   Under their rules of engagement agreed on by the United States,
Britain and Turkey, the pilots most often strike at parts of Iraq's
air defenses, including radio towers, radar stations and command
centers that, according to the Pentagon, coordinate the Iraqi
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sunday the F-16Cs and F-15s attacked separate targets
at a communications center that they had decided to attack in
advance if threatened.
</P>
<P>
   France and Russia have criticized the strikes, and there are
signs the strategy hampers U.N. Security Council negotiations over
creating a new weapons inspection program in Iraq. A senior defense
official said the Russians had tried to condition their support of
new inspections on an end to the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission has not changed,'' Deptula said. ``The only thing
that has changed is the threat, and we are employing ordinance to
respond to that threat. But the larger question of the efficacy of
the no-flight zones is a political one.''

MERGERS CAN BE A MENTAL BURDEN TO EMPLOYEES, STUDIES SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Published studies of recent mergers and
acquisitions sound cautionary notes about the psychological fallout
on workers.
</P>
<P>
   In an international review by Hewitt Associates of 500 corporate
merger, acquisition and joint venture participants, 69 percent of
U.S. human-resource directors said their biggest difficulty was
meshing corporate cultures.
</P>
<P>
   In that study, only one-fourth of the human-resource executives
said the combined company was ``very successful'' at creating a new
culture. Among the unsuccessful majority, most blamed employees'
fear of change as the chief impediment.
</P>
<P>
   ``While these deals may look good on paper, the fact is that
changes in management, policies and programs can be very
threatening to employees,'' said Pete Sanborn, merger and
acquisition consultant at Hewitt's Connecticut office, when the
report was released in April.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, three-fourths of 65 merged companies admitted
to Hay Group consultants that they had failed to put employees in
the right jobs within the first six months of their merged
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Those mistakes led to subsequent employee turnover and
reassignments. The report was published in February.
</P>
<P>
   In another survey, which was taken by Right Management
Consultants, fewer than a third of 179 merged companies said they
had successfully combined corporate cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies are having a very difficult time with people
issues across the board,'' said the Right report, released in
March. ``On average, only 30 percent of respondents said their
companies had succeeded in areas such as cultural integration,
employee retention or communication.''
</P>
<P>
   The report observed that attainment of financial objectives is
``highly correlated'' to work force issues. Thus, only about 30
percent of merger and acquisition participants are likely to reach
the goals that sparked the combination.
</P>
<P>
   In a September newsletter, compensation and benefits consultants
at Towers Perrin reported that post-merger adoption of common
benefit plans also may cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   When the benefit plans at two companies vary significantly,
equalizing them sometimes alienates employees who had been getting
a better package and, seemingly unfairly, rewards others, the
consultants said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Conference Board, a business research
organization, reported that mergers and acquisitions exacerbated
competitive stress felt by workers.
</P>
<P>
   While merging companies are preoccupied with combining,
competitors frequently step in to capture market share, research
shows.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ These are uncomfortable days for Republicans on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Once again they are locked in a chaotic, down-to-the-wire budget
battle with President Clinton. They have been forced by Democrats
into an uncomfortable debate over managed health care. And now the
party's front-running presidential candidate seems to be defining
his own credentials as a ``compassionate conservative'' by
distancing himself from them.
</P>
<P>
   The unease is so palpable, said Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., that
when he came onto the House floor Wednesday morning for the first
vote of the day, another Republican walked up to him and said, ``if
Bush keeps going at the rate he's going at, he'll guarantee his
presidency and a Democrat controlled House.'' Sanford, added,
``Then the follow up was, `I guess you can't blame him. He's
probably reading the same poll numbers we are.'''
</P>
<P>
   This was not how Republicans expected things to be. When Speaker
Dennis Hastert this year replaced the fiery and polarizing Newt
Gingrich, Republicans said they had a few simple and pragmatic
goals that recognized the limits of their very tenuous majority:
They would be more disciplined and less confrontational. They would
concentrate on basics like passing spending bills on time. And they
would ride Bush's coattails next year to keep control of the House
and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be harder to do if Bush, who has now criticized
fellow Republicans twice in the span of a week, continues to take a
page from President Clinton, who defined himself as a ``New
Democrat'' by standing far apart from congressional Democrats.
Clinton's 1996 political strategist, Dick Morris, called it
``triangulation'' because Clinton tried to stand equally distant
from Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Clinton has done by triangulating has taken the spirit
out of the Democratic party,'' Rep. Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C, said
Wednesday, making clear his own irritation with Bush. ``That's not
the model to govern well.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush Wednesday was far more conciliatory than in recent
days, praising Republicans in Congress for measures such as the
1996 overhaul of the welfare law and saying he hoped and planned if
elected to work with a Republican speaker and a Republican House.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Republicans' problems result inevitably from the
balance of power in Congress. The House is virtually split in two,
making it nearly ungovernable. And in the Senate, the Republicans
hold 55 seats _ five short of the 60 they would need to cut off
debate each time the Democrats embark on another filibuster against
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And the Democrats, fervent about taking back the House, are
fighting the Republicans at every turn. With the help of
like-minded Republican moderates, they have successfully pushed
onto the agenda issues that they believe favor them _ gun control,
campaign finance overhaul and regulation of health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When half the Congrss wants to rock the boat, the boat is
going to rock,'' said Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., arguing that
Republicans were not to blame for the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also the case that on the fiscal issues that they have
made their priority the Republicans have lurched from idea to idea.
They have not found a way to meet their basic promise to cut taxes,
remain within the spending limits of the 1997 bipartisan balanced
budget agreement and avoid dipping into Social Security trust fund
money to pay for the governments operations.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer they proudly passed a large $792 billion tax cut
and there was some talk of a grand compromise with Clinton in which
Republicans would win a somewhat smaller tax cut in exchange for
enacting a new Medicare prescription drug program the president
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But in September, Republican leaders abruptly said they would
not sit down with the president to negotiate a smaller tax cut once
Clinton vetoed their measure. Nor had they passed the 13 annual
spending bills on time by the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.
Instead the government was kept running for three more weeks with
temporary legislation.
</P>
<P>
   As the fiscal debate goes into its final weeks, Republicans are
hoping to win politically by portraying themselves as the ones
cutting spending enough to avoid eating into the Social Security
surplus. (Usually it is the Democrats who campaign on protecting
Social Security.)
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans themselves have yet to figure out how to hold
the line on spending and not spend billions of dollars from the
Social Security surplus. One idea House leaders had was to save
$8.7 billion next year by paying a tax credit to the working poor
on a monthly basis instead of a lump sum payment. That strategem is
what prompted Bush last week to shock House Republicans by calling
that an effort to ``balance the budget on the backs of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is now denying he wants confrontation with congressional
Republicans, there are political imperatives that still seem bound
to pull them apart. Many House Republicans, in particular, believe
they win elections by appealing to their most hardcore conservative
base. Bush, with his commanding lead over other Republican
candidates in the polls, is by contrast fashioning his
``compassionate conservatism'' to appeal to the independents and
moderates that he would need in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans were hopeful Wednesday that Bush might actually
help their own prospects of keeping control of the House by
occasionally criticizing them. ``The American people need to know
that George Bush needs to stand up to a Republican Congress if he
doesn't agree with us,''said Rep. Christopher Shays, a moderate
Connecticut Republican. ``If they think he will fall under our
spell, there will be less of an inclination to have both him and a
Republican Congress and one of us will have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were angrily predicting that Bush would hurt himself and
them too _ pointing to an outpouring of criticism from conservative
figures like Rush Limbaugh, Paul Weyrich, and Pat Robertson, the
Christian Coalition leader who all but endorsed Bush last week.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats _ who long had to grapple with Clinton's own efforts
to distance himself from them _ were enjoying the Republican
divisions. Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader even
sent a letter to Bush asking him to ``steer House Republicans
toward the mainstream'' on other issues before Congress.
``Unfortunately, your allies in the Republican leadership just
don't get it _ compassion isn't at the top of their agenda,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But the amusement was tempered for some by the memory of how
Clinton's definition of himself as a New Democrat led to his
election and re-election. ``Remember the end result,'' said Rep.
Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn. ``The last guy who triangulated won.''

OFFICER TESTIFIES THAT DRUNKEN SINGER WAS KICKING DYING MAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UVALDE, Texas _ Country western singer Johnny Rodriguez was
drunk and repeatedly kicked and cursed a man who was shot and lying
on the kitchen floor of his mother's house, a Sabinal police
officer testified Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony opened Rodriguez's murder trial, and defense
attorney's told the jury the singer will take the witness stand to
give his account of last year's shooting, which they insist was in
self defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody comes into my house. I'll shoot you and I'll shoot
anybody who comes into my house,'' Sabinal Officer Guillermo
``Willie'' Quirova quoted Rodriguez as shouting as he kicked the
mortally wounded man who lay moaning on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriquez, 47, is on trial in the Aug. 29, 1998, slaying of
Israel ``Bosco'' Borrego, 26, a local man with a long criminal
record and a reputation as a hard drinker.
</P>
<P>
   The singer faces up to life in prison if found guilty of killing
Borrego, who died in a Uvalde hospital several hours after he was
shot once in the lower abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Tony Hackebeil, in opening remarks to the
jury, said Rodriguez should be held accountable for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not have good reason to do it,'' the prosecutor told
the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Hackebeil said Borrego was invited by Rodriguez to join drunken
parties that lasted for days at the simple woodframe house. He told
the jury he would call witnesses to show Borrego had been invited
to spend the night at the Rodriguez home on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But the outcome was different when Rodriguez found Borrego in
the kitchen shortly after 4 a.m., making breakfast for himself and
the singer, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny, in his drunken stupor gets mad at him for being in
there, and the rest is history,'' Hackebeil said.
</P>
<P>
   Sabinal Police Chief James ``Red'' Evans testified he observed
an intoxicated Rodriguez in the backseat of Quirova's patrol car
soon after he arrived at the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very irate, belligerent, ballistic,'' Evans replied after
being asked to describe the singer's condition. ``Very out of it,
just screaming and hollering.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Jay Norton told jurors that Rodriguez suspected
Borrego had broken into his home two weeks before the shooting, and
had told him he was not welcome there.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said Rodriguez was staying across the street with
neighbor Carlos Tovar because the sewer system was not working, and
he went to check on the house around 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The door was unlocked, and inside the kitchen Rodriguez saw ``a
shadowy figure, a silhouette,'' Norton said, adding Rodriguez fired
after he recognized Borrego and saw him reach for something.
</P>
<P>
   ``He points (the gun) down at Bosco as he comes and shoots him
one time in the leg, to stop him,'' Norton told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   The defense attorney said Rodriguez had reason to fear Borrego,
and outlined a long criminal history to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   He said the shooting victim had been arrested for beating his
wife, assaulting a 14-year-old niece, for public intoxication, for
driving under the influence, for a rash of burglaries, including
stealing a box of steaks from the Sabinal restaurant where he
worked as a cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``He acted in self-defense. He acted in defense of his
property,'' Norton said of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   He also said a sum of money had been taken from the Rodriguez
home that night, and that it was found on Borrego after the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Quirova, the first officer to arrive at the Rodriguez home, said
Rodriguez was kicking the victim while his neighbor, Tovar, was
trying to pull him off.
</P>
<P>
   He said Rodriguez resisted his efforts to handcuff him, and that
Tovar attempted to keep the officer from reaching a loaded revolver
lying on the kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, who acknowledged being a second cousin of the
victim, said he removed four live rounds and one spent bullet from
the .357-caliber Smith &AMP; Wesson revolver he found on the table. He
said during an arraignment before a magistrate, five more bullets
were found in Rodriguez's pants pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, whose hits such as ``Pass Me By'' (If You're Only
Passing Through) soared into the top 10 on the country charts in
the 1970s, expressed optimism after the first day of his trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it went well,'' he said.

   DIVIDEND INCREASES SLOW EVEN AS ECONOMY SOARS
</P>
<P>
   If the measure of corporate America's financial health is its
ability and willingness to increase dividends to shareholders, then
the country might appear to be in a recession. Standard &AMP; Poor's
reports that 117 companies announced dividend increases in
September, 10 fewer than in the month a year earlier. That was the
15th consecutive month that the number of dividend increases was
down year-over-year. By itself, such a long string of relative bad
news is not extraordinary. What is unusual is that the economy is
doing so well even while companies are growing more reluctant to
raise their dividends.
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORT GROWS FOR SOME TAX BREAKS
</P>
<P>
   Support is growing in Congress for a vast expansion of
retirement tax breaks for business owners, executives and highly
paid workers, moves that Republicans and Democrats alike think
would be popular with voters.
</P>
<P>
   EARNINGS RISE 6.7 PERCENT AT PEPSICO
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico reported a 6.7 percent increase in third-quarter profit
on the strength of higher earnings at its Frito-Lay and Tropicana
units, a performance that beat analysts' estimates by one cent a
share. The announcement sent the stock prices of both Pepsico and
its archrival, Coca-Cola, higher. Shares of Pepsico rose $1.75, or
5.6 percent, to $33.1875. Coke rose $4, to $51.9375.
</P>
<P>
   METABOLIFE POSTS INTERVIEW ON WEB
</P>
<P>
   Metabolife, a diet-product company, posted on the Internet a
complete, unedited videotaped interview between an ABC News
correspondent and the company's chief executive to publicize its
concerns that ABC would broadcast an unfair report on the medical
risks of its popular dietary supplement.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS GAIN AS RATE WORRIES EASE
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose as investors shifted their attention to earnings and
away from the prospect of higher interest rates. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 187.75 points, or 1.81 percent, to
10,588.34. Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 24.05 points, or
1.85 percent, to 1,325.40. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 57.54
points, or 2.06 percent, to 2,857.21.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices were little changed as investors awaited an
employment report expected Friday. The yield on the 30-year issue
was unchanged at 6.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATE STIRRED ON DEBT IN BRAZIL
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Brazil are beginning to get nervous over the
possibility that the government might try to renegotiate its
domestic debt, which has nearly doubled in recent years. The
possibility has grown in part because the idea of a debt
renegotiation has been promoted by a rising presidential candidate,
Ciro Gomes, a 41-year-old former finance minister. He has made debt
renegotiation part of a broader economic plan that he says would
encourage long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   LOSS NARROWS AT ADVANCED MICRO
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro Devices reported a smaller-than-expected
third-quarter loss as sales of its Athlon line of chips
accelerated. Executives said they were on track to achieve their

SPRINT WORKERS EXPECT TO FACE MORE CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sprint Corp. this week dropped an emotional
grenade on its employees.
</P>
<P>
   As word of MCI WorldCom's intended acquisition exploded in
Kansas City, Sprint workers accustomed to constant challenge and
change braced for more.
</P>
<P>
   Those who study the human side of mergers and acquisitions say
recent merger history indicates Sprint workers should:
</P>
<P>
   - Brush up their resumes.
</P>
<P>
   - Get ready for at least two years of roiling management and
benefits changes, assuming the merger is approved.
</P>
<P>
   - Understand they are going to pass through stages of grief for
the loss of their independent, homegrown logo, almost as if a
family member died.
</P>
<P>
   - Be prepared for expected synergies that fail to synergize.
About two-thirds of all mergers do not produce the expected
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Those were among warnings from human-resource and merger
analysts and merger veterans about the psychological or emotional
fallout from mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Headhunters and chaos will come calling,'' predicted Robert
Lamb, author of merger books and professor of management and
finance at New York University's Stern School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the merger is final and has all the approvals, and
certainly afterward, you will have attrition from those plucked by
headhunters on overdrive or from those who are consumed by fear.''
</P>
<P>
   With months of work ahead before the purchase details are
completed, much less approved by regulators, the area's 18,789
Sprint workers are in for a protracted period of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   That uncertainty was fueled by MCI WorldCom President Bernard J.
Ebbers, who was asked Tuesday in New York about staff redundancies
with Sprint. ``Do we have redundancies? Yes,'' Ebbers said, but he
immediately followed that by saying he did not know where they
were.
</P>
<P>
   That lack of specifics _ which will continue for months _ tends
to spread fear throughout a work force, consultants said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Grubb, a Maryland consultant specializing in post-merger
integration, said loyal Sprint employees might be working through
shock, or first-stage grief, because the brand they toiled for was
being consumed by a bigger fish.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Grubb said, that stage is replaced quickly by
second-stage fear or anger about the possibility of losing their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Third-stage reaction commonly involves ``negotiation,'' or
positioning, as workers try to find their place in the new
organization. Gossip, jockeying for power, formation of new
alliances and anointing of new leaders characterize that stage.
</P>
<P>
   The end stage is acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That reality is you've been bought,'' Grubb said. ``Get used
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Merger veterans echo that alert and emphasize the emotional need
for speed in carrying out the details.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Haney, a Kansas City management consultant who specializes
in corporate-culture training, weathered the Merrell Dow
acquisition of Marion Laboratories in the 1980s and, a few years
later, the Hoechst acquisition of Marion Merrell Dow. He said
Sprint workers should expect ``continued pain and uncertainty about
who the new leaders are and what direction they're going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Haney, who held executive positions in sales, marketing and
manufacturing, said his experience showed that the sooner new
management was put in place, the less employee unrest there was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both organizations don't _ maybe can't _ work side by side,''
Haney said. ``Someone always prevails. If, right from the
beginning, new leaders can be put in place to articulate their
vision, it will help. If leadership confusion drags on, employees
lose confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Haney said mergers guaranteed some employee displacement, at
least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to hurt some people, no question about it, so you
might as well get to it quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Haney did what many merger-weary executives have done. He
transferred his skills to self-employment.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Maurer, author of Beyond the Wall of Resistance:
Unconventional Strategies that Build Support for Change, said now
was a good time for Sprint workers at all levels to begin assessing
their career options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't panic,'' Maurer said. ``The regulators are making noises
like the acquisition may never go through. But this presents the
perfect occasion to start looking around, take classes. Investigate
options. Don't chuck your job, but pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurer particularly cautioned Sprint workers against paying too
much attention to rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read the paper. Listen to the news,'' Maurer said. ``Don't
listen to rumors. It will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurer predicted an acquisition would ``be wildly disruptive on
people,'' even for those who kept their jobs and were not asked to
move. Merger and acquisition experience shows they probably will
wrestle with new health insurance plans, new benefit structures,
new supervisors and new policies.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lucas, an outplacement and executive counselor, experienced
the loss of local control that comes with out-of-town ownership
when he was at Drake Beam Morin. Now, at his own executive search
and coaching firm, he works to help others get through job loss and
reassignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is difficult for everyone,'' Lucas said. ``It's human
nature. But it's easier for some than others. I would urge everyone
to look on the positive side and watch for opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to be too Pollyannaish about it, because in
the short run, Sprint may find that it's overstaffed in some areas.
But, in the long run, if growth projections are met, there may be
more opportunities for skilled workers in the telecommunications
field.''
</P>
<P>
   The best bet, Lucas said, is for Sprint workers to use the
coming months to analyze what is important to them and what kinds
of losses they fear. Income stability? Job title? Location of
residence? Turf? Corporate identity?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever bubbles up as a worker's biggest concern should be
addressed through career planning and study of options, he said _
and try not to let the uncertainty overwhelm emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Beyer is proof that mergers and acquisitions may cause
tumultuous job changes, but that it is possible to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Beyer, appointed in April by Gov. Bill Graves as secretary of
human resources for the state of Kansas, survived two decades of
change as his employer bank kept changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Beyer's employer, Columbia Union, became Centerre in 1982, which
became Boatmen's in 1988, which became NationsBank in 1997, which
now is Bank of America. One of the changes transferred him to North
Carolina; all of them brought new policies and plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to take one day at a time,'' Beyer advised.
``Remember that, when you're in a swirling sea of changing
circumstances, you've gone through many changes in your lives
before. Remember what's worked well for you throughout your
lifetimes. Remember not to repeat the things that didn't work
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers in an acquired company should know that they are not
navigating change alone, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be aware that everyone's riding an emotional roller coaster,''
Beyer said. ``Otherwise, you might feel there's something wrong
with you, that you feel so uncomfortable. There's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very normal to feel uncomfortable when you let go of the
old and buy into the new. But you can manage your reaction, and
that's liberating to know that. You may not be able to manage the
change, but you can manage your reaction to that change.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   OMSK, Russia _ It is three hours by air from Moscow to Omsk, a
sprawling collection of fraying low-rises set on a Kansas-flat
plain by the oil fields of Siberia. Every month or two, a
well-dressed, bespectacled young man arrives by commercial jet here
and is whisked away to a corporate apartment not far from the Omsk
Oil Refinery, Russia's largest and most modern petroleum complex.
After a day or two of unspecified business, he leaves as he came.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually nobody in this city of 1.2 million people would
notice, but for his name: Leonid Dyachenko, the husband of
President Boris Yeltsin's daughter and right-hand strategist,
Tatyana Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   Once so anonymous that even prying reporters were unsure of his
first name, the 36-year-old Dyachenko turns out to have a colorful
life.
</P>
<P>
   He popped into the headlines two weeks ago when it turned out
that he had a bank account in the Cayman Islands with more than $2
million. His bank is the Bank of New York, which is at the center
of a criminal investigation in the United States of possible money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Dyachenko is an oil trader. But he is more than that. He is a
participant _ if not a key figure _ in a network of politically
blessed companies that ship Siberian oil products to Ukraine and to
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   His work is all the more colorful because, for many oil traders,
oil is almost an afterthought. Virtually all of Russia's oil giants
use creative financial transactions to ship billions of dollars
offshore, too _ beyond the reach of tax collectors and, for that
matter, company shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Of most interest to investigators tracing the billions of
dollars that have flowed out of Russia this decade are Dyachenko's
bank accounts, which apparently got most of their money from his
dealings with oil companies, according to statements by bank
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The officials of those companies, and Dyachenko's benefactors,
include two Russian tycoons who are among Yeltsin's strongest
supporters, Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, as well as the
son of the autocratic pro-Yeltsin governor of the Omsk region.
</P>
<P>
   Dyachenko's operations stretch from Omsk to Moscow to Manhattan,
where he is allied with a frenetic Russian capitalist named Viktor
Khrolenko and, records indicate, seems to have occupied a luxury
apartment overlooking New York's financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Khrolenko, who set up two oil trading firms that employed
Dyachenko and befriended the Yeltsin family, said in an interview
that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized his records and
that he was recently summoned to appear next Thursday before a
federal grand jury looking into Russian financial dealings in the
United States. Through a lawyer, he denied any wrongdoing. The
Kremlin has refused in the past to discuss Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing so far links Dyachenko to any of the now-infamous
companies, like the Benex International Co., that have been
indicted on charges of illegally moving nearly $7 billion from
Russia through Bank of New York accounts over the last 3 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dyachenko's business in Omsk and Manhattan raises
questions throughout Moscow about his lucrative relationships with
business tycoons who have profited from the personal intervention
of Dyachenko's father-in-law, Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Less clear is the true role of Khrolenko, an engaging but
curious wheeler-dealer who seems to have played midwife on both
sides of the ocean to Dyachenko's oil career.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, good-looking and energetic, Khrolenko was a Russian
capitalist before Russian capitalism was cool, much less before it
overheated. ``Viktor was one of those guys who asked me to smuggle
him a copy of Samuelson's book on economics in '78 or '79,'' said
Jonathan Sanders, a Columbia University professor who is a
godfather to one of Khrolenko's grandchildren. ``He's a real
Russian patriot who just wanted to bring some American things into
his country.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Communism collapsed, Khrolenko had hooked up with a
onetime promoter for the Rolling Stones to secure a CBS recording
contract for a Russian rock band and bring Soviet newscasts to the
Discovery Channel. He started, then sold, an American-style
nightclub, Manhattan Express, in a staid hotel near Red Square, and
published books on Russian art and literature.
</P>
<P>
   His corporate umbrella, Belka International, had annual sales of
more than than $100 million in 1992, according to a Moscow business
newspaper. A more recent report, by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, places recent
sales at close to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders believes Khrolenko had met Yeltsin by the late 1980s,
when Yeltsin was gaining the image of a Communist reformer. And
Khrolenko suggested that he met Yeltsin's son-in-law through a
timber deal in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that in 1993, the Kremlin called Andrew
Nurnberg, Yeltsin's literary agent in London, and said Khrolenko
would negotiate the American rights to Yeltsin's autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard he was desperate to be seen with Yeltsin,'' Nurnberg
said in a telephone interview. ``That was in those days when you
could benefit by being close to the president of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Osnos, then the publisher of Times Books and now the
publisher at Public Affairs, said Yeltsin's book was excellent _
and that the American edition never made a penny.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he recalled attending a spectacular Kremlin
dinner to celebrate the unveiling of the book at which Khrolenko
sat with the presidential family. ``What happened to him after
that, I don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what happened, is that Khrolenko went from publishing to
petroleum _ and Russian politics. By the spring of 1994, when
Yeltsin's book appeared in the United States, Khrolenko's Belka was
peddling its services at a Washington conference on Russian
technology, opened by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Among others there was the governor of Omsk region, Leonid
Polezhaev. A participant, who refused to be identified for fear of
retribution, said Khrolenko was actively promoting oil and gas
deals in the area _ and that Polezhaev was at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hugged each other like old friends,'' said that person.
``I think they'd known each other for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   A huge deal was soon sealed, but it did not directly involve
Khrolenko.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under a government program known as loans for shares, the
Kremlin elected to sell off effective control of the Omsk Oil
Refinery, the city's biggest employer, to the highest bidder. That
triggered a bitter battle that ended when the chief opponent of the
plan, the refinery's general director, was found dead in Omsk's
Irtysh River a week before the company's auction.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the auction was a huge energy company, Siberian
Oil Co., known as Sibneft. Its ownership is murky at best, but most
analysts say control rests with the company's general director,
Abramovich (pronounced ah-bra-MO-vich) and his longtime business
ally, Berezovsky, perhaps Russia's richest and most public business
titan.
</P>
<P>
   The Sibneft acquisition appears to have been good news for both
Khrolenko and Dyachenko. Sibneft began selling its refined Siberian
oil through a network of oil traders. At the top of Sibneft's list
were two companies: a Khrolenko creation called Belka Energy of New
York, and a second, better-known Russian company called Runikom.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Dyachenko has either overseen or played a
leading role in Belka's dealings with the Omsk refinery. A vice
president of Runikom, which itself holds a 10 percent share of
Sibneft, is none other than the son of the governor of Omsk,
Alexsei Polezhayev.
</P>
<P>
   The incestuous nature of the ties is clear from the location of
Belka's Moscow office: in the refurbished building that houses
representatives of the Omsk regional government.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, Sibneft seems to have awarded the
relatives of Yeltsin and a key supporter lucrative contracts to
distribute its petroleum products. Just how lucrative is not clear;
Sibneft, one of the world's biggest oil firms, still does not have
to disclose its internal business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Khrolenko's lawyer, Irwin Rochman, said in a lengthy interview
that Khrolenko's companies are legitimate and that Dyachenko, who
has an undisclosed ``relationship'' with the companies, ``has been
compensated handsomely'' for his work.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear what Dyachenko does.
</P>
<P>
   According to an account by one petroleum expert in Omsk, which
is impossible to verify, Belka and a second Khrolenko company run
by Dyachenko, East Coast Petroleum, move about 10,000 tons of
diesel fuel from Omsk each month. Most goes to former Soviet
satellites like Hungary and Croatia; increasingly, some goes to
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crumbs, mere crumbs,'' that expert said. Like many
experts, he characterized the allotment as a political favor, much
as a powerful American company might suddenly choose to hire the
unexceptional son of a congressman or governor.
</P>
<P>
   But to most people, the sums involved _ and the profits _ can be
immense. The vast majority of Russian oil giants effectively
launder their oil through a network of offshore companies _ some
wholly owned subsidiaries, others controlled by favored friends _
to avoid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government slaps a 20 percent value-added tax on
every ton of exported oil or gas. In the simplest scheme, an oil
company agrees to sell its crude to a foreign trader for slightly
below the market price, thereby understating its profit and paying
less tax. The trader then resells the oil at market prices and
agrees to split the profit with his supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the unreported profit stays offshore. ``If you
have an offshore entity, you can declare less income and pay less
taxes _ excise, profit, corporate or income tax,'' said an
executive of one major Western company.
</P>
<P>
   The rake-off goes largely to feed official corruption, lining
the pockets of politicians and company officials. In particular,
both Russian and foreign oil executives say, the government's
energy and fuel ministry _ which controls oil exports _ is almost
brazenly corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Even officially, the government does little to conceal the
practice. In 1997, a banner year for oil exports, nearly half of
the 97 million tons of crude oil exports were sent _ on paper, at
least _ to tax havens like Gibraltar, Lichtenstein and the Bahamas,
many without refineries.
</P>
<P>
   A review of Russian customs records by a Russian petroleum
newsletter turned up no evidence that either Belka or East Coast
Petroleum had received oil exports in the last two years. That
could be literally true. But experts say it is possible that the
two companies could be placed further offshore in a chain of
transactions beyond the reach of Russian tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
   In Omsk, where at least some of the records exist, even those in
the know do not want to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who have challenged Polezhaev's rule have found
themselves under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In one interview this week, a subject removed the batteries from
a mobile telephone, explaining calmly that this would prevent
security police from monitoring the interview. The governor's
office declined a reporter's request to discuss these and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The less you know,'' said one man who declined to delve deeply
into Belka's history, ``the longer you live.''

<P>
   Alex Lowe, an American climber whose versatility and tenacity in
pushing the limits earned him a reputation as perhaps the country's
finest all-round mountaineer, was presumed killed on Tuesday after
vanishing in a massive avalanche on Shishapangma in Tibet. He was
40 and lived in Bozeman, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe had reached an altitude of about 19,000 feet on
Shishapangma, the world's 14th highest mountain _ also known as
Gosainthan, when he was swept away with David Bridges, 29, a
high-altitude cameraman, who also remains missing.
</P>
<P>
   They had planned to make the first descent by skis of the
mountain's southwest face after reaching the 26,291-feet-high
summit.
</P>
<P>
   A third climber, Conrad Anker, who last May discovered the
long-missing body of George Mallory on Mount Everest, was tossed
100 feet and was ``pretty beat up'' by the crashing snow, but
escaped serious injury, the expedition's leader, Andrew McLean,
said.
</P>
<P>
   McLean reported the accident by satellite phone to
MountainZone.com, a Web site that features outdoor adventures.
Hazardous conditions forced other expedition members to abandon
their search for Lowe and Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Alexander Lowe was born on Dec. 24, 1958, into a Montana
family that started him hiking soon after he learned to walk; he
began his rock-climbing career wearing tennis shoes. His academic
training was in mathematics, but his forte was climbing.
</P>
<P>
   He was widely admired for excelling in every aspect of
mountaineering, from rock- and ice-climbing to ski descents. Galen
Rowell, another climber, described Lowe as ``a renaissance mountain
man in all regards.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other serious climbers, Lowe also resolved to put
his wife and children first. He acknowledged that mountaineering
entailed risks, but said that experience increased the margin of
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one way to gain mountain sense, and that's to be
in the mountains a lot,'' Lowe said. ``Unfortunately, when you're a
young climber, you have none. You're out there and your risk level
is high.''
</P>
<P>
   Climbing light, fast and often alone, Lowe pulled off feats that
left other climbers in awe. ``We're all at this one level,'' Anker
said once, ``and then there's Alex.''
</P>
<P>
   In late July, at an age when most climbers are slowing down,
Lowe led the first ascent of the northwest face of the Great Trango
Tower, a 6,000-feet-high wall in the Karakorum range of Pakistan
that no one else had even attempted. He was ill at the time, fell
50 feet and injured his elbow, but pushed on to the west summit at
20,410 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, he achieved a solo ascent of the north face of the
Matterhorn, the first solo ascent in winter of the north face of
the Grand Teton in Wyoming, and no fewer than 16 routes up the
sheer granite of El Capitan in Yosemite. Lowe scaled the nose of El
Capitan, a climb that once took days, in 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe climbed Mount Everest twice. A fascination with remote
places also took him to Antarctica, Baffin Island in the Canadian
Arctic, the Carstenz Pyramid in Indonesia and the Cordillera Blanca
in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   His recent climbs were sponsored by North Face, the clothing and
equipment outfitter.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Outside Magazine called Lowe the world's best climber.
He shrugged off the accolade, saying that there was no such thing
because climbing was a way of life, not a sport. The best climbers,
he said, distinguished themselves through persistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those are the ones that sort of go on and do lots of
climbs, and harder climbs,'' Lowe said in a MountainZone interview
. ``Those are the people that just can't shake it off. That's what
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same interview, Lowe said his biggest challenge was
balancing the passion to climb with his love for his family, whom
he described as life's greatest reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would let climbing slide away if I had to to maintain my
relationship with my family,'' he said. ``Because it really is the
big adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe is survived by his wife Jennifer and three sons, Max, 10,
Sam, 6, and Isaac, 3.

   SOUTHERN PINES, N.C. _ The playground at Southern Pines
Elementary School used to be four acres of thorny, barren land and
some rickety play equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids used to fight every day,'' said Damita Nocton, a
first-grade teacher at the school, which has 550 pupils in
kindergarten through third grade. ``They were confined to a little
square of asphalt, and the rest was just sandspur and cactus.''
</P>
<P>
   Children called it the Desert. ``We saw a lot of aggressive
behavior, because they were bored and unhappy,'' Ms. Nocton said.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the Blanchie Carter Discovery Park _ renamed in
honor of the beloved principal who retired just as renovations
began _ tells a different story.
</P>
<P>
   At recess, the children fan out over ``the purple monster,'' as
they call a challenging but inviting set of play equipment where
they can leap, hang, climb and run, blowing off steam and
exercising gross motor muscles. They can tear down the sandy track
that circles the professional-grade soccer field. Or maybe they
head toward the log cabin the third graders built, or to the
blueberry maze planted by the first grade. Some might wander to the
top of a grassy hill where the Earth Buddies meet or the pile of
sand dumped by the edge of the woods, looking for sharks' teeth.
</P>
<P>
   This grand space is a work in progress, a collaboration of
children, parents, teachers and community members, guided by Robin
Moore, an urban planner who teaches in the school of design at
North Carolina State University and has specialized in play areas
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is at the forefront of a growing movement in American
education that seeks to reconnect children with nature. California
has vowed to put a garden in each of its 8,000 schools, and has
about 1,650 so far. Maryland encourages every new school or
renovation project to include natural habitats that are accessible
and are incorporated into the curriculum. Ohio, Florida, New
Hampshire, Utah and Vermont have similar plans, and North Carolina
is financing Moore's ``Natural Learning Initiative''
(www.naturalearning.com), based at North Carolina State, which at
the moment is focused on helping child-care centers build creative
outdoor learning environments.
</P>
<P>
   A ``green'' schoolyard not only allows for safe, free play, but
can be used as a giant, diverse classroom, where hands-on
activities integrate math, science and the language arts. ``The
school greening movement is very big in Europe, but Robin is the
strongest, clearest voice right now in this country,'' said Dr.
Roger Hart, the director of the Children's Environments Research
Group at the City University of New York. Hart is working in poor
communities around the world to create green, safe places for
children.
</P>
<P>
   As the federal government pushes for higher test scores and
``accountability'' from teachers and school systems, and about a
dozen states have halved or even canceled recess as too frivolous
an activity for children, educators like Moore maintain that
outdoor activities, whether directed or ``free'' play, encourage
observation and creative thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are no comprehensive studies yet to prove that such
environments improve test scores, schools like Southern Pines
Elementary report a marked reduction in violence and rising
academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our incidents and fights have really gone down,'' said Mary
Scott Harrison, the principal. ``And our test scores have improved
big time.''
</P>
<P>
   In four years, the percentage of children meeting or exceeding
proficiency levels in math and reading rose to 79 percent from 60
percent, she said. The school is aiming for an 80 percent
proficiency rate this year, she added, ``which will make us a
school of distinction in North Carolina.'' She called the pupils'
performance remarkable, considering that many entering kindergarten
``don't even recognize colors or know their numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   On any given day at Southern Pines Elementary, you may see
children planting native grasses in the longleaf pine forest that
abuts the playground, peering at birds through the bird blind,
making musical instruments from sticks or testing the acid-alkaline
balance of water from a storm sewer as they collect data for a
water quality project.
</P>
<P>
   The park has become fertile ground for what Moore calls
``natural learning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued by how this place has become a place of
imaginative play,'' he said as, from a discreet distance, he
watched children fooling around with logs and wood chips inside the
pioneer cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave a little bit of looseness in the environment, and
the kids will adapt it to something,'' he said. Like pretending the
cabin is a spaceship, and the pieces of wood are transmitters.
``Hello! Hello! Coming in!'' they shout as they run among the
shrubs and trees behind the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon Moore watched a group of 7-year-olds, boys and
girls, black and white, playing horse. ``They were riding each
other, galloping around that circle of logs by the cabin,'' he
said. ``It was very positive social action. And it doesn't happen
on a hard place where kids are bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore grew up freely roaming the hills and woods of Kent in
England, poking around old mines and abandoned military camps with
his pals. They built underground forts and leapt from the pliable
branches of coppiced linden trees. They helped with the haying. As
long as they got home for dinner in one piece, no questions were
asked.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from children's play today, of course, where
school and park administrators are constantly worried about being
sued, and parents are anxious about kidnappings, drug abuse and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many parents work long hours, children spend most of
their days indoors or in supervised activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That culture of childhood that played outside has gone and
been replaced by after-school programs,'' Hart said. ``If you're
rich it's programs; if you're poor it's TV, so you're trapped
indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore studied architecture at London University in the 1950s,
when the city was still full of ``adventure playgrounds'' _
bombed-out World War II sites that children put to free-spirited
use. Supervised by play leaders who looked out for their safety,
they invented games and leapt from tall towers built from the
rubble, exhilarated by the risks that Moore thinks are essential
for agility and self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adventure playgrounds never really caught on in the U.S., even
though their safety record is exemplary,'' said Moore, who was the
president of the International Association for Children's Right to
Play for 15 years. ``If kids are really engaged and have a
stimulating environment where they can take risks in the healthy
sense of the word, they are not going to have an accident. That
happens when they get bored and start pushing each other around.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at Southern Pines Elementary, children may not be leaping
off homemade platforms _ Mrs. Harrison keeps a close eye on safety
and liability issues _ but they aren't patronized with kiddie
tools, either. They built the pioneer cabin with real 18th-century
tools under the guidance of parents, and use grown-up saws to cut
logs for the campfire.
</P>
<P>
   In the longleaf pine forest, a forester from the State Fish and
Wildlife Service helps third graders saw young scrub oaks to
prepare for a controlled burn.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Harrison is requiring teachers to create at least six
lessons related to the environment outside the school doors and is
encouraging them to read the works of Howard Gardner, the Harvard
cognitive psychologist whose theory of multiple intelligences
includes sensitivity to the natural world.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   All this seems light years from the day she met Bruce Cunningham
and Ann Petersen, who had decided to send their daughter, Katie, to
kindergarten at Southern Pines Elementary, with its ebullient 50-50
mix of black and white children, rather than to the mostly white
Episcopal church school in their own neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawyers, they were impressed not only with the school's
racial mix, but also with its teachers and the charismatic
principal, Blanchie Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school was a very good school, but it had a stigma,'' Ms.
Petersen said. ``Whenever the local paper reported what little bit
of drug or violent crime we have here, it would say it was coming
out of the school, `which is known to be in a high crime
district.'''
</P>
<P>
   The incidents were limited, parents say, to a street three
blocks from the school. The only real danger that Ms. Petersen and
Cunningham could see was in the rickety equipment on the playground
and the thorny weeds that kept the children cooped up _ and
fighting _ on the one clear patch of hot asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harrison, who was then the assistant principal, invited
them to head up the new playground committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial plan was to raise $40,000 for a piece of
equipment, stick it into this desert and call it a playground,''
Ms. Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   But then Cunningham discovered the work of Moore and talked him
into visiting the school. He arrived with slides of his
``environmental yard'', a playground that children and grown-ups
had transformed from an acre and a half of hardtop into a natural
landscape complete with woods and stream. He laid out some of his
ideas about natural learning and was struck by the spirit of
community at Southern Pines Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   So he agreed to do a master plan. Everybody wanted trees, grass
and new play equipment. But Moore's plan considered circulation
patterns _ how people flow through a space _ and made sure there
were various active and quiet places all through the site.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Everyone worked together on the principles of universal design,
so that a child like Evan Long, who has a learning disability,
could leap from a low platform in the purple monster with as much
joy as his friends who were jumping from higher spots.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Nilda Cosco, a play therapist trained in Argentina, guided
parents away from the Swiss chalet they wanted for a playhouse.
``Build your own culture,'' she counseled them, so they decided to
build their own log cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Moore recalled that when Cunningham suggested putting snow
fencing around the young sycamore trees the children had helped
plant near the play equipment, he shook his head and said, ``Get
each class to adopt a tree, water it and measure it, and you won't
have any trouble with vandalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nocton has watched her first graders become more observant
as they have planted a bird habitat and a butterfly garden. ``They
bring me things, like seedpods, eggshells and feathers,'' she said.
``They tell me about a special place where they heard a bird
singing. They are more respectful _ they want to take care of the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence plummeted as soon as the new park opened. ``Before,
they didn't value the school as much,'' she said. ``They didn't
have a sense of ownership. Now they are actively involved in its
development.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Madie Davis, a counselor for the school who has worked in this
neighborhood for 15 years, has noticed more families going to the
schoolyard to jog or walk. She finds herself using the park during
counseling sessions with troubled children, ``because it is a
serene, peaceful environment and they are more subject to opening
up.''

SPORTS COLUMN: METS' SECOND BASEMAN DOESN'T PLAY SECOND FIDDLE
ANYMORE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Venezuela)   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Luis Gonzalez stood by his dressing stall in the
Arizona Diamondbacks' plush, subdued clubhouse. This was Tuesday
night rapidly segueing into Wednesday morning, and Gonzalez, a
32-year-old outfielder, was attempting to put a stunning 8-4 loss
to the Mets in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks had just suffered the equivalent of a
first-round knockdown to a challenger that showed neither fear nor
respect. Arizona, the National League West champion, was favored
and rested. The Diamondbacks clinched the division so long ago that
they had time to sit and watch the Mets' soap opera drama unfold in
the last two weeks. Little did Arizona know that it would soon
become part of the Mets' script.
</P>
<P>
   That script invariably includes a knock at the door. In Game 1
of the division series Tuesday night, the stranger at the door was
Edgardo Alfonzo, the Mets' 25-year-old second baseman. In his first
at-bat against the indomitable Randy Johnson, Alfonzo, down no
balls and two strikes, cracked a home run over the
left-center-field wall. The confidence spread immediately. After
that, every Met battled Johnson, refusing to be cowed by his
reputation. The Mets had great at-bats, not all resulting in hits,
but they set Johnson on the defensive early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo's homer signaled an early turning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alfonzo has been hitting in the clutch all year this year,''
Gonzalez said. ``Monday, he hit a dramatic home run to start that
game off, today two more. He's definitely the guy we've got to
stop, because if he gets hot, he can pretty much carry that ball
club _ like he's been doing the last couple days.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez got to know Alfonzo when they played winter league ball
in Venezuela, Alfonzo's native country. ``He's not a flashy guy,''
Gonzalez said. ``He's a quiet-personality type guy and he goes out
there and gives you everything he's got. It's kind of weird to see
him playing in city like New York.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Alfonzo's a very good hitter. He's done what
everybody in baseball knows he's capable of doing. The more years
you get up here, you realize what you're capable and not capable of
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are beyond tired, playing on adrenaline. Three
emotional games at home against Pittsburgh, a flight to the
Midwest, a night game in Cincinnati for the wild-card playoff,
another flight halfway across the country, and across three time
zones, to face the 6-foot-10-inch Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo's first-inning home run was medicinal, and set the tone
that lasted until his stunning grand slam in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo had filled a great divide.
</P>
<P>
   Answer the question ``Who is Alfonzo?'' and you also answer the
question ``What is a second baseman?''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo has done what second basemen often do: play second
fiddle to fellow infielders. Play in the shadows of acrobatic
shortstops who do their loop-de-loops and hard-hitting third
basemen and first basemen with limited mobility but hearty bats.
</P>
<P>
   The second baseman emerges from the shadows when all seems lost,
or the team needs a missing punch. Last season, Alfonzo played
third base. When the Mets signed Robin Ventura, Alfonzo moved back
to second with feather-light effortlessness. Now the Mets have the
best infield in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday night's game, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said:
``Over the last few years Edgardo Alfonzo has been a fabulous
baseball player; he has star quality, but he's improving. He's
learning about himself every day that he goes out there, gaining
confidence. And with confidence comes performance like you saw
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   At the plate, Alfonzo has become far more patient and highly
selective of the pitches he will go after. Now he comes to bat with
a plan, no longer content to simply ``let it happen,'' not content
to allow pitchers to dictate the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I come to home plate now, I have an idea what I'm
going to do,'' Alfonzo said. ``I want to have patience at the plate
until I see a good pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo's temperament and talents are a perfect fit for a Mets
infield with the low-key Ventura at third and John Olerud at first,
and the flamboyant Rey Ordonez at short.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and I are about the same,'' Ventura said. ``Rey is flashy
and loud _ the epitome of the Latin shortstop; he has the flair and
the energy that the rest of us don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   And Alfonzo?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just above John and I,'' Ventura said. ``He's more into a
shell than Rey, but he's above us. He's a pretty good dancer, and
he can sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Alfonzo seemed ambivalent when someone asked if he
minded obscurity in a news-media-driven town where notoriety can
often mean dollars. He said that anonymity is fine at one level
``because I'm able to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I can go out with my wife and not worry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same breath he expressed hope for a change, and that some
celebrity would come his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometime, it's going to happen and, hopefully, that will be
pretty soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Change doesn't just happen. You have to force change, and force
transformation. What better way to do it than to homer three times
in two games in October on a New York baseball team?
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo's transformation is indeed under way.  &QL;

GOP LEADERS PUSH THROUGH TAX BREAKS AS WAY TO INCREASE HEALTH
INSURANCE ACCESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House commenced a heated debate over
regulating managed care plans, Republican leaders Wednesday muscled
through a series of tax breaks they said were intended to help
individuals and businesses afford health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The package of incentives to increase health insurance access
was approved 227-205 on a largely party line vote, with dissenting
Democrats claiming the provisions were added to sour support for a
broader package of HMO reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The action, however, was a prelude to a more significant series
of votes scheduled for Thursday on managed care alternatives that
would make it easier for consumers to appeal their HMO health care
decisions and force the plans to provide basic services, such as
access to the nearest emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign that they have capitulated to the demands of some
of their members, GOP leaders have thrown their support behind a
managed care proposal that allows consumers a limited right to sue
their managed care plan. The Senate has already approved a managed
care plan that does not include the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans said the tax provisions were needed to address
the growing number of uninsured Americans, which the Census Bureau
reported this week stood at 44 million people. They added that
Democrats' clamor for HMO reforms would mean little if consumers
could not afford to purchase health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access and affordability is as important as providing patient
protection,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. ``A right without
insurance is no right at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The package includes tax breaks for individuals who pay more
than half the cost of their premiums, and for those who are caring
for elderly family members at home. It would also make it easier
for small businesses and individuals to band together to purchase
cheaper health policies.
</P>
<P>
   It would also expand a Medical Savings Account program, now
capped at 750,000 taxpayers, which allows individuals to sock away
money for medical expenses in tax free accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, said the tax incentives would do little to
address the concerns of many of the uninsured who do not make
enough money to benefit from such breaks. They added that Medical
Savings Accounts benefit only those who are healthy and have the
money to save for extra expenses. They claimed that MSAs drain
insurance pools of healthy beneficiaries, driving up costs for the
sickly who cannot choose other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill does nothing except to help the insurance companies
and the well to do and the healthy,'' said Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also objected to the fact that Republicans had not
detailed how they would pay for the cost of the tax breaks, which
are estimated to be $48 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested the tax provisions were tacked on to force
Democrats to vote against the overall health care legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats were also angry that the Republicans had not
allowed them to bring up amendments that would detail how they
would pay for the managed care reform _ a financing plan that some
Democrats believe must be included in any bill they support.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote President Clinton accused the Republican
leadership of ``legislative gamesmanship '' and spiking the bill
with ``poison pills and legislative sleights of hand to practically
guarantee the defeat of this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., injected
presidential politics into the debate by passing out a letter he
sent to GOP front-runner George W. Bush, asking the Texas governor
to use his influence to urge Republicans to approve the same kind
of tough managed care regulations that he allowed to become law in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is one of a handful of states that allows consumers the
right to sue their managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt noted that Bush should exercise the same influence on
GOP lawmakers on the managed care issue as he did recently on the
budget when he chided Republicans for trying to delay full payment
next year of earned income tax credits to the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan suggested that the governor
supported legislation that included the right to sue managed care
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes people in federal plans ought to have protections
similar to those in Texas,'' said McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   House members Thursday will consider several managed care plans.
One sponsored by Reps. Dingell and Charles Norwood, R-Ga., which is
backed by most Democrats and some Republicans, provides for the
broadest right to sue health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Another health plan sponsored by Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and
supported by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., would give
consumers the right to sue but would only allow such suits in
federal courts and would place limits on damages.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care legislation has been the target of an
aggressive lobbying effort, with business and insurance interests
opposing the measure, and doctors, consumer groups and trial
lawyers supporting it.

CONGRESSMEN ACCUSE CANADA OF LURING AWAY PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A coalition of eight Congressmen fired another
shot Wednesday at Canada over its efforts to lure Hollywood
productions north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The group, led by Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills, is
pressuring U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky to change
rules that allow Canada to subsidize productions such as ``Bad As I
Wanna Be: the Dennis Rodman Story'' under the guise of protecting
Canadian culture.
</P>
<P>
   Berman has asserted in recent months that Canada has violated
the spirit of trade agreements between the nations, which allow
exclusion of U.S. programming and providing economic incentives to
producers if they hire Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1932, Canada has asserted the need for special
exceptions to international trade agreements to protect Canadian
`cultural content' or `cultural sovereignity' '' the group said in
a letter to Barshefsky. ``Over the years, however, any legitimacy
originally attached to claims of Canadian cultural sovereignity has
been replaced by rules and regulations that are nothing more than
protectionism _ plain, simple and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by The Monitor Co. found that Canada accounted
for 81 percent of all runaway production, costing the United States
20,000 jobs and $10 billion in lost wages and revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Rodman TV movie, the letter cited seven other U.S.
projects that had been co-produced in Canada _ ``The Long Island
Incident,'' ``My Date With the President's Daughter,'' ``Oklahoma
City,'' ``Hidden in America,'' ``Joe Torre: Curveballs Along the
Way,'' ``Nixon &AMP; Kissinger'' and ``Texas Rangers'' _ which ``do not
appear to contribute anything to Canadian culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also noted that Canada is able to limit the number of
hours that non-Canadian programming is shown on Canadian TV and
preclude distribution of programming by some U.S. cable companies
in Canada. It asked Barshefsky to address the issue at the World
Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, scheduled for Nov. 30 to
Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the issue of Canadian abuse of the cultural
sovereignty principle is a cover for erecting old-fashioned trade
barriers and must be on the agenda at the Seattle talks,'' the
group said as part of the ``Dear Colleague'' letter seeking more
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials have defended their practices as a legitimate
means of generating economic growth and have claimed that the
estimates of runaway production are overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Berman, five California representatives signed the
letter: Xavier Becerra, D-Los Angeles; Gary Condit, D-Modesto;
David Drier, R-Covina, chairman of the Rules Committee; Robert
Matsui, D-Sacramento; and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon, R-Santa
Clarita. Republicans Mark Foley of Florida and Jerry Weller of
Illinois, both members of the Ways and Means Committee, also
signed.

   LOS ANGELES -- A coalition of eight Congressmen fired another
shot Wednesday at Canada over its efforts to lure Hollywood
productions north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The group, led by Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills, is
pressuring U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky to change
rules that allow Canada to subsidize productions such as ``Bad As I
Wanna Be: the Dennis Rodman Story'' under the guise of protecting
Canadian culture.
</P>
<P>
   Berman has asserted in recent months that Canada has violated
the spirit of trade agreements between the nations, which allow
exclusion of U.S. programming and providing economic incentives to
producers if they hire Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1932, Canada has asserted the need for special
exceptions to international trade agreements to protect Canadian
`cultural content' or `cultural sovereignity' '' the group said in
a letter to Barshefsky. ``Over the years, however, any legitimacy
originally attached to claims of Canadian cultural sovereignity has
been replaced by rules and regulations that are nothing more than
protectionism _ plain, simple and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by The Monitor Co. found that Canada accounted
for 81 percent of all runaway production, costing the United States
20,000 jobs and $10 billion in lost wages and revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Rodman TV movie, the letter cited seven other U.S.
projects that had been co-produced in Canada _ ``The Long Island
Incident,'' ``My Date With the President's Daughter,'' ``Oklahoma
City,'' ``Hidden in America,'' ``Joe Torre: Curveballs Along the
Way,'' ``Nixon &AMP; Kissinger'' and ``Texas Rangers'' _ which ``do not
appear to contribute anything to Canadian culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also noted that Canada is able to limit the number of
hours that non-Canadian programming is shown on Canadian TV and
preclude distribution of programming by some U.S. cable companies
in Canada. It asked Barshefsky to address the issue at the World
Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, scheduled for Nov. 30 to
Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the issue of Canadian abuse of the cultural
sovereignty principle is a cover for erecting old-fashioned trade
barriers and must be on the agenda at the Seattle talks,'' the
group said as part of the ``Dear Colleague'' letter seeking more
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials have defended their practices as a legitimate
means of generating economic growth and have claimed that the
estimates of runaway production are overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Berman, five California representatives signed the
letter: Xavier Becerra, D-Los Angeles; Gary Condit, D-Modesto;
David Drier, R-Covina, chairman of the Rules Committee; Robert
Matsui, D-Sacramento; and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon, R-Santa
Clarita. Republicans Mark Foley of Florida and Jerry Weller of
Illinois, both members of the Ways and Means Committee, also
signed.

   SOUTHERN PINES, N.C. _ The playground at Southern Pines
Elementary School used to be four acres of thorny, barren land and
some rickety play equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids used to fight every day,'' said Damita Nocton, a
first-grade teacher at the school, which has 550 pupils in
kindergarten through third grade. ``They were confined to a little
square of asphalt, and the rest was just sandspur and cactus.''
</P>
<P>
   Children called it the Desert. ``We saw a lot of aggressive
behavior, because they were bored and unhappy,'' Ms. Nocton said.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the Blanchie Carter Discovery Park _ renamed in
honor of the beloved principal who retired just as renovations
began _ tells a different story.
</P>
<P>
   At recess, the children fan out over ``the purple monster,'' as
they call a challenging but inviting set of play equipment where
they can leap, hang, climb and run, blowing off steam and
exercising gross motor muscles. They can tear down the sandy track
that circles the professional-grade soccer field. Or maybe they
head toward the log cabin the third graders built, or to the
blueberry maze planted by the first grade. Some might wander to the
top of a grassy hill where the Earth Buddies meet or the pile of
sand dumped by the edge of the woods, looking for sharks' teeth.
</P>
<P>
   This grand space is a work in progress, a collaboration of
children, parents, teachers and community members, guided by Robin
Moore, an urban planner who teaches in the school of design at
North Carolina State University and has specialized in play areas
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is at the forefront of a growing movement in American
education that seeks to reconnect children with nature. California
has vowed to put a garden in each of its 8,000 schools, and has
about 1,650 so far. Maryland encourages every new school or
renovation project to include natural habitats that are accessible
and are incorporated into the curriculum. Ohio, Florida, New
Hampshire, Utah and Vermont have similar plans, and North Carolina
is financing Moore's ``Natural Learning Initiative''
(www.naturalearning.com), based at North Carolina State, which at
the moment is focused on helping child-care centers build creative
outdoor learning environments.
</P>
<P>
   A ``green'' schoolyard not only allows for safe, free play, but
can be used as a giant, diverse classroom, where hands-on
activities integrate math, science and the language arts. ``The
school greening movement is very big in Europe, but Robin is the
strongest, clearest voice right now in this country,'' said Dr.
Roger Hart, the director of the Children's Environments Research
Group at the City University of New York. Hart is working in poor
communities around the world to create green, safe places for
children.
</P>
<P>
   As the federal government pushes for higher test scores and
``accountability'' from teachers and school systems, and about a
dozen states have halved or even canceled recess as too frivolous
an activity for children, educators like Moore maintain that
outdoor activities, whether directed or ``free'' play, encourage
observation and creative thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are no comprehensive studies yet to prove that such
environments improve test scores, schools like Southern Pines
Elementary report a marked reduction in violence and rising
academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our incidents and fights have really gone down,'' said Mary
Scott Harrison, the principal. ``And our test scores have improved
big time.''
</P>
<P>
   In four years, the percentage of children meeting or exceeding
proficiency levels in math and reading rose to 79 percent from 60
percent, she said. The school is aiming for an 80 percent
proficiency rate this year, she added, ``which will make us a
school of distinction in North Carolina.'' She called the pupils'
performance remarkable, considering that many entering kindergarten
``don't even recognize colors or know their numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   On any given day at Southern Pines Elementary, you may see
children planting native grasses in the longleaf pine forest that
abuts the playground, peering at birds through the bird blind,
making musical instruments from sticks or testing the acid-alkaline
balance of water from a storm sewer as they collect data for a
water quality project.
</P>
<P>
   The park has become fertile ground for what Moore calls
``natural learning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued by how this place has become a place of
imaginative play,'' he said as, from a discreet distance, he
watched children fooling around with logs and wood chips inside the
pioneer cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave a little bit of looseness in the environment, and
the kids will adapt it to something,'' he said. Like pretending the
cabin is a spaceship, and the pieces of wood are transmitters.
``Hello! Hello! Coming in!'' they shout as they run among the
shrubs and trees behind the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon Moore watched a group of 7-year-olds, boys and
girls, black and white, playing horse. ``They were riding each
other, galloping around that circle of logs by the cabin,'' he
said. ``It was very positive social action. And it doesn't happen
on a hard place where kids are bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore grew up freely roaming the hills and woods of Kent in
England, poking around old mines and abandoned military camps with
his pals. They built underground forts and leapt from the pliable
branches of coppiced linden trees. They helped with the haying. As
long as they got home for dinner in one piece, no questions were
asked.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from children's play today, of course, where
school and park administrators are constantly worried about being
sued, and parents are anxious about kidnappings, drug abuse and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many parents work long hours, children spend most of
their days indoors or in supervised activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That culture of childhood that played outside has gone and
been replaced by after-school programs,'' Hart said. ``If you're
rich it's programs; if you're poor it's TV, so you're trapped
indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore studied architecture at London University in the 1950s,
when the city was still full of ``adventure playgrounds'' _
bombed-out World War II sites that children put to free-spirited
use. Supervised by play leaders who looked out for their safety,
they invented games and leapt from tall towers built from the
rubble, exhilarated by the risks that Moore thinks are essential
for agility and self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adventure playgrounds never really caught on in the U.S., even
though their safety record is exemplary,'' said Moore, who was the
president of the International Association for Children's Right to
Play for 15 years. ``If kids are really engaged and have a
stimulating environment where they can take risks in the healthy
sense of the word, they are not going to have an accident. That
happens when they get bored and start pushing each other around.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at Southern Pines Elementary, children may not be leaping
off homemade platforms _ Mrs. Harrison keeps a close eye on safety
and liability issues _ but they aren't patronized with kiddie
tools, either. They built the pioneer cabin with real 18th-century
tools under the guidance of parents, and use grown-up saws to cut
logs for the campfire.
</P>
<P>
   In the longleaf pine forest, a forester from the State Fish and
Wildlife Service helps third graders saw young scrub oaks to
prepare for a controlled burn.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Harrison is requiring teachers to create at least six
lessons related to the environment outside the school doors and is
encouraging them to read the works of Howard Gardner, the Harvard
cognitive psychologist whose theory of multiple intelligences
includes sensitivity to the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All this seems light years from the day she met Bruce Cunningham
and Ann Petersen, who had decided to send their daughter, Katie, to
kindergarten at Southern Pines Elementary, with its ebullient 50-50
mix of black and white children, rather than to the mostly white
Episcopal church school in their own neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawyers, they were impressed not only with the school's
racial mix, but also with its teachers and the charismatic
principal, Blanchie Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school was a very good school, but it had a stigma,'' Ms.
Petersen said. ``Whenever the local paper reported what little bit
of drug or violent crime we have here, it would say it was coming
out of the school, `which is known to be in a high crime
district.'''
</P>
<P>
   The incidents were limited, parents say, to a street three
blocks from the school. The only real danger that Ms. Petersen and
Cunningham could see was in the rickety equipment on the playground
and the thorny weeds that kept the children cooped up _ and
fighting _ on the one clear patch of hot asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harrison, who was then the assistant principal, invited
them to head up the new playground committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial plan was to raise $40,000 for a piece of
equipment, stick it into this desert and call it a playground,''
Ms. Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   But then Cunningham discovered the work of Moore and talked him
into visiting the school. He arrived with slides of his
``environmental yard'', a playground that children and grown-ups
had transformed from an acre and a half of hardtop into a natural
landscape complete with woods and stream. He laid out some of his
ideas about natural learning and was struck by the spirit of
community at Southern Pines Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   So he agreed to do a master plan. Everybody wanted trees, grass
and new play equipment. But Moore's plan considered circulation
patterns _ how people flow through a space _ and made sure there
were various active and quiet places all through the site.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Everyone worked together on the principles of universal design,
so that a child like Evan Long, who has a learning disability,
could leap from a low platform in the purple monster with as much
joy as his friends who were jumping from higher spots.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Nilda Cosco, a play therapist trained in Argentina, guided
parents away from the Swiss chalet they wanted for a playhouse.
``Build your own culture,'' she counseled them, so they decided to
build their own log cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Moore recalled that when Cunningham suggested putting snow
fencing around the young sycamore trees the children had helped
plant near the play equipment, he shook his head and said, ``Get
each class to adopt a tree, water it and measure it, and you won't
have any trouble with vandalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nocton has watched her first graders become more observant
as they have planted a bird habitat and a butterfly garden. ``They
bring me things, like seedpods, eggshells and feathers,'' she said.
``They tell me about a special place where they heard a bird
singing. They are more respectful _ they want to take care of the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence plummeted as soon as the new park opened. ``Before,
they didn't value the school as much,'' she said. ``They didn't
have a sense of ownership. Now they are actively involved in its
development.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Madie Davis, a counselor for the school who has worked in this
neighborhood for 15 years, has noticed more families going to the
schoolyard to jog or walk. She finds herself using the park during
counseling sessions with troubled children, ``because it is a
serene, peaceful environment and they are more subject to opening
up.''

JORDAN'S NEW KING ASSUMING KEY ROLE IN MIDEAST TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Not long ago, King Abdullah planned a quick trip
abroad, to Vermont, to serve as best man at the wedding of a
Deerfield Academy classmate.
</P>
<P>
   But in another reminder of his new role as a pivotal player in
the high-wire world of Middle Eastern peacemaking, his autumn
weekend in New England soon blossomed into an official visit to the
United States, his second in just five months.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, accompanied by the U.S. ambassador to
Jordan, King Abdullah flew off for a long week of Washington
meetings capped by a session at the White House. He carried with
him, somewhat ambivalently, a private message for President
Clinton, one that had been delivered to him here this week by an
emissary of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq _ another of Jordan's
problematic neighbors _ even though the king says has no illusions
about any imminent improvement in Iraqi-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
   The king is to discuss Jordan's military needs with Defense
Secretary William Cohen and duty-free access to the U.S. market
with Commerce Secretary William Daley. He will brief World Bank
president James Wolfensohn on his ambitious economic reform plans _
a prerequisite for further multilateral financing _ and promote
Jordan's potential as a high-tech, low-wage industrial haven to
computer entrepreneurs in Virginia and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   And he hopes to prod Congress to release a promised $200 million
financial package that would make Jordan the second biggest
recipient of economic aid per capita, after Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But his main goal is to maintain the momentum toward the broad
regional peace settlement that he considers the key to Jordan's
security and economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Syria doesn't resolve the problem with Israel, then we pay
the price,'' he said before departing Wednesday. ``If Israel
doesn't resolve the problem with the Palestinians, again Jordan
will pay the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those concerns, Abdullah leaves behind a country
increasingly comfortable with the ambitious and self-assured
leadership style of a 37-year-old ruler who was barely known when
he suddenly and unexpectedly ascended to the throne last February.
</P>
<P>
   And his surprising willingness to break with some of the
policies of his revered father, King Hussein, is already reshaping
Jordan's regional alliances and domestic agenda in ways that his
Arab neighbors and U.S. policy-makers both find welcome.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging conversation Wednesday with a small group of
European, American and Israeli journalists, King Abdullah sketched
out his views on the state of the peace talks and Jordan's changing
role as a regional intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   He is guardedly optimistic about negotiations between Syria and
Israel, despite outward signs that an initially positive dialogue
has degenerated into a sterile exchange of old and incompatible
bargaining gambits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I think things are moving along better than the
atmosphere suggests,'' he said, citing his continuing contacts as
``a middle man or mediator'' with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and, through the king's son, with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Syrians were saying and what the Israelis were saying
were really pretty much the same things,'' he said. ``They were
both in the same ball park, and what we did was to try to get the
messages to either party. As they start to sit down _ the Syrians
with the Israelis, the Syrians with the Americans _ then we have
done what we needed to do, and Jordan will pull out.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he shared the concerns of many Arab leaders that
Israeli peace talks with Syria could overshadow the much more
complex and, in his view, far more important talks between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace with Syria is not peace with the Arab world,'' the king
said. ``The Arab world cannot warm towards Israel if you do not
solve the Palestinian issue, and there are many countries that want
a warm relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   An admirer of Barak, King Abdullah nonetheless warned that his
decision to press for a comprehensive final settlement, even at the
expense of negotiating delays, is being misinterpreted as
deliberate procrastination.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Barak won the election, maybe some people don't want to
admit it, but there was a euphoria all over the Middle East,'' he
said. ``You had the Syrians coming out of their shell, believing in
Barak and believing in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak wanted ``to make something that would last, that would
actually make the Palestinians happier than what we had achieved in
Washington,'' the king said. ``He had good intentions in his heart.
But the perception in the Middle East was, this was further delay,
and that maybe this was not the man that we all thought he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his desire to expedite talks between Israel and the
Palestinians, King Abdullah rejects any direct role.
</P>
<P>
   He has said the Palestinians should take administrative control
of the Muslim holy sites of Jerusalem, which still remain formally
in his family's traditional charge. Unlike his father, he defers to
Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat as the sole leader of
the Palestinian people, except, of course, for the 2 million
Palestinians who remain citizens of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had good relationships with Arafat from Day 1,'' he
said. ``We want to make sure that the Israelis and the Palestinians
have the best atmosphere to move forward with the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he curtly rejects the notion of an eventual confederation
between Jordan and an independent Palestinian state, an idea
resuscitated recently by Arafat, but which many Jordanians fear
would spell the end of an independent Hashemite-led state here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such word as confederation in my vocabulary,''
King Abdullah said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When he assumed the throne last February, Abdullah portrayed
himself as the keeper of the flame, as the custodian of his
father's complex political and diplomatic legacy. But within months
he began changing some of the terms of that inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   He sought rapprochement with his father's old adversaries in
Syria and Kuwait and an end to testy rivalries with Egypt and the
Palestinian Authority. Domestically, he began revamping an
entrenched political order that enriched an Amman elite but
effectively disenfranchised the Palestinian majority. He has
insisted on free-market reforms that will prepare Jordan for entry
into the World Trade Organization, perhaps as soon as next year,
but which will also threaten local business monopolies that
prospered during his father's reign.
</P>
<P>
   His most dramatic break came in September, when he ordered the
arrests of the local leaders of Hamas, the radical Islamist
Palestinian group that King Hussein had long tolerated as a
counterweight to Arafat and as a concession to Jordanian Islamists,
who also oppose peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But senior officials here now portray the Jordanian branch of
Hamas as a renegade terrorist operation supported by Iranian
intelligence and conspiring against Hamas leaders within the
Palestinian territories. Arafat repeatedly asked the new Jordanian
government to take action against the group, foreign diplomats and
senior Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan has made itself quite clear that Hamas offices will be
shut down in Jordan, and that is what will happen,'' King Abdullah
said Wednesday.

HOUSE AND SENATE REACH DEAL ON F-22 FIGHTER JET 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House and Senate on Wednesday night struck a
deal that would allow the Air Force's $70 billion F-22 fighter jet
to proceed to the assembly line if it can pass new stringent flight
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22, projected to be the most expensive fighter jet ever
built at $200 million a plane, would receive $2.5 billion in
research and development money this year, but none for procurement,
the spending category usually reserved for buying weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, the plane and its components,
including its crucial cockpit computers, would have to pass a
series of hurdles and milestones before the F-22 could proceed to
full production.
</P>
<P>
   But the Air Force and Lockheed Martin, the giant military
contractor, can use the money to begin building up to six aircraft
labeled as test models in 2000 and to start the initial production
of up to 10 combat-ready F-22s in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still in for a long-term battle,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens,
R- Alaska, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and one
of the plane's biggest supporters. ``It'll still have to prove
itself. It has to prove it can do what its designers have told us
it can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the Air Force had been set to start full-scale
production of the F-22 as early as this month. The Senate had
allotted $1.2 billion for research and $1.8 billion for full-scale
production of the first six F-22s, a total of $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But then the House, led by Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., and
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's defense spending
panel, deleted the $1.8 billion for production, and called for
additional testing of the F-22, which has completed only about 5
percent of its flight tests, before spending any money on building
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Congress almost never cuts off money for a major weapons system
that is about to enter production, and the overwhelming vote in the
House to stop production of the F-22 pending further tests shocked
the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The deal sealed on Wednesday night allows both the House and the
Senate to claim partial victory. The plane will have to pass many
more tests before full-scale production of combat-ready aircraft
begins, but initial production of up to six test aircraft now can
begin.
</P>
<P>
   Before the House vote, ``we were moving directly toward
purchasing, and maybe committing to as much as $40 billion to $60
billion for production of the F-22,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   More than $21 billion has been spent on research and development
of the plane already; two test aircraft have been built.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lewis said, stringent tests will require that the planes
``will work as we hope they work before we ever get to the point of
production.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and senior Republicans in Congress said that the United
States could not afford the Pentagon's plans to build three
different kinds of fighter jets _ the F-22, the Joint Strike
Fighter and a new model of the F-18 _ at a projected total cost of
$350 billion in the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   They proposed a pause in production of the F-22 to allow the Air
Force to rethink its plans. But a pause would have killed the
plane, the Air Force and its supporters in Congress argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were worried about was a pause _ which would have been
a death,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement makes 2000 ``definitely a testing year'' for the
F-22, she said. ``We need to have successes all the way through the
year to show that the F-22 can be built, that it can be built on
time, that it will be able to perform the way we hope it will.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, the compromise provides $1.923 billion in research
funds that can be used to build test aircraft, $277 million in
so-called ``advance procurement'' funds that would allow for buying
and building parts for additional aircraft in fiscal 2001, and $300
million available in fiscal 2001 to Lockheed Martin if delays or
cancellations cause the company financial or legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force and Lockheed Martin reserved comment until they
see the precise language of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise was sealed as the House and Senate negotiators
wrapped up a Pentagon spending package on Wednesday night that
Lewis said totaled about $269.5 billion, including $1.8 billion for
a military pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also contains $375 million personally requested by the
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, to start
building a $1.5 billion Navy carrier at his home state's shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy had not requested funds for the ship, but Lott and his
staff pressed the Navy to support a budget request of between $375
million and $500 million for the carrier.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Pentagon spending bill also contains about $6 billion in
funds that Lewis said were labelled as ``emergency spending.''
While that technically means they do not count against spending
caps imposed by Congress in 1997, they have to come from somewhere
_ and at the rate Congress is spending, that may be surplus Social
Security funds, which members have sworn to protect.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican plan for billions of dollars in across-the-board
spending cuts, which could keep the Social Security funds intact,
picked up some steam in Congress on Wednesday as the Senate passed
a resolution backing the idea, on a nearly straight party-line
vote. But Republicans continued to argue fiercely among themselves
about the idea, which would require at least $16 billion in cuts in
the spending bills to run the government in fiscal 2000, which
began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is still struggling to pass six of its 13 spending
bills for fiscal 2000. On Wednesday, the Senate very nearly failed
to pass a $12.6 billion foreign aid measure.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was about to fail on a 50-50 tie vote. Then Lott leaned
on Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, to change his vote from nay to yea.
</P>
<P>
   Helms agreed, and the bill survived. But President Clinton has
vowed to veto it, since it cuts 1999's budget for foreign aid by $1
billion.

DEAL ON TEST BAN STALLS AS SENATE VOTE APPROACHES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A deal to postpone a Senate vote on a treaty
banning underground nuclear tests stalled Wednesday on the
Republicans' aim to avoid having the pact become a campaign issue
in 2000 and the Democrats' desire to keep the accord alive next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a growing number of lawmakers on both sides urged
shelving the treaty, which faces near-certain defeat in a vote
scheduled for early next week, to avert a political and diplomatic
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   With critics and supporters girding for a floor debate starting
on Friday, President Clinton signaled that he would welcome
postponing the vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which he
signed in 1996. ``After two long years of inaction,'' Clinton said,
``one week is very little time for considered action.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats and White House officials conceded that the
treaty did not have the two-thirds Senate majority required to
pass. But after having badgered Republicans for more than two years
to bring up the accord, they are now having trouble negotiating a
way out.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and the Democratic
leader, Tom Daschle, began talks on Tuesday. But aides said no
discussions were held Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing a game of chicken,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., who supports the treaty. ``Egos and raw politics start to
get in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon Clinton assembled a group of current and
retired military officers, Nobel laureates and other treaty
supporters at a White House ceremony. They argued that the pact
would make it more difficult for countries like Russia, China,
India and Pakistan to develop and field more advanced nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   But under pressure from his conservative wing, Lott telephoned
Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, to warn him that
the Senate would vote next week, unless Clinton agreed not to bring
up the accord for the rest of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides and Senate Democrats rejected that condition
and suggested that the high-stakes brinkmanship could run right up
to the actual vote. More than 150 countries have signed the treaty.
But only 23 of the 44 nuclear-capable nations whose approval is
required have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president does not want a vote now, but he doesn't want to
put it off to 2001, either,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who
dined at the White House with Clinton and about 10 other senators
on Tuesday. ``He doesn't want to look like he's backing down, and
he'd have a hard time explaining it to our European allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, on the other hand, does not want Democrats wielding the
treaty as a campaign issue next year. ``Lott is willing to put it
off,'' Specter said. ``But he doesn't want to face the same
crescendo next spring.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A small group of senators on each side sees advantage in the
treaty's failure. Republicans could kill one of Clinton's top
foreign-policy goals, and Democrats could accuse the Republicans of
contributing to the spread of advanced nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   As partisan passions heat up, several senators have appealed to
their leaders and Clinton to shelve the treaty. ``Setting it aside
is not so bad an idea,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who is
close to Lott and who opposes the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Two leading Democrats who back the test ban, Robert Byrd of West
Virginia and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut also called for a
postponement.
</P>
<P>
   At a second day of hearings before the Armed Services Committee,
senators wrestled with two major issues, whether the treaty could
be adequately verified and whether a complete ban would jeopardize
the American nuclear arsenal's safety and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Sen. Robert Smith, independent of New Hampshire,
said the treaty would tie the hands of the United States and could
not assure the detection of low-level nuclear explosions that
nations like Iran or Iraq might conduct to test crude nuclear
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged that the proposed
testing rules were not perfect, but that 320 seismic monitors that
would be installed under the accord would detect detonations large
enough to threaten America's nuclear deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not conducted any underground nuclear
tests since 1992. Government scientists now use a $4.5 billion
annual program that uses non-nuclear explosive tests and
sophisticated computer modeling to maintain the safety and
reliability of the arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   But critics, including six former defense secretaries, say as
the weapons age, confidence in their reliability will decline,
unless they are periodically tested. ``Over time, the components of
our weapons corrode and deteriorate, and we lack experience
predicting the effects of such aging,'' wrote the former
secretaries, Frank Carlucci, Dick Cheney, Melvin Laird, Donald
Rumsfeld, James Schlesinger and Caspar Weinberger, all Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. John Shalikashvili, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, told senators that the directors of the national
laboratories had assured military leaders that the aging would not
pose a problem until at least 2005, when the scientific testing
program would be more advanced.

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS KEEP THE PETTITTES CLOSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Pettitte continually tells his father to focus
on his eroding health and forget about baseball, and Tom Pettitte
responds by telling his son to focus on baseball and forget about
how he feels. The telephone conversations occur almost every day.
The son lectures the father, the father lectures back and they both
hang up reminding themselves to be more emphatic the next time.
</P>
<P>
   It is a continuing display of mutual stubbornness and affection.
The father wants the son who tossed fastballs to him when he was 2
years old to excel with the Yankees. The son wants the father who
was dedicated enough to catch thousands of pitches to realize that
baseball, even at this level, is not everything. But healthy
parents are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to talk about baseball, but not as much anymore,''
Pettitte said. ``After all that he's been through, it just ain't
that important.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte looked down at the blue carpet in the clubhouse, shook
his head and lamented that he could not persuade his father to
simply relax when he pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pettitte, 50, has heard Andy's rationale and heard how it
does not help his heart to get annoyed and complain when a gorgeous
cut fastball on the corner is called a ball. While Tom Pettitte
does not disagree with his son, he cannot treat Andy's career
casually.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way can I do that,'' Tom Pettitte said in a
telephone interview Wednesday. ``I've dealt with this guy ever
since he was 2 years old. That's what I told him the other night
when we talked. This is part of being a parent. All the anxieties,
all the goose bumps. I've had them since he was a little bitty
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom wanted to travel from Deer Park, Tex., to the Bronx to see
Andy pitch against the Texas Rangers Thursday night, because he had
missed witnessing his son beat the Padres to give the Yankees their
1998 World Series sweep, having undergone double-bypass heart
surgery five days earlier. Plans had been completed to attend Game
2 of the American League division series, but Tom experienced a new
problem in a recent spate of ailments. He learned he had an
enlarged prostate and was prohibited from traveling long distances.
</P>
<P>
   So Tom expected to pace from one room to another Thursday night
while deciding if he would watch game on television. As devoted as
he is to his son, he conceded last October that he could not watch
games on television because even minute criticism of Andy bothered
him immensely.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte went 14-11 with a 4.70 earned run average this season,
but he started 5-7 with a 5.59 e.r.a. and was nearly traded.
Thursday night, Pettitte has the chance to continue New York's
mastery of Texas, with or without his father watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I watch it or not, I'll decide before it starts,'' Tom
Pettitte said. ``Since my heart surgery, it's too hard on me. It
depends on how I feel. If you don't watch the game, then you're
wondering what's going on, so you're a nervous wreck anyway. It's a
Catch-22. I'm sure I'll probably wind up watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after Tom Pettitte had heart surgery, he returned
to work at the Lubrizol chemical plant in Deer Park, where he works
a 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. shift. At 6 feet 3 inches and 300 pounds, he has
a chest as wide as a keg and friends who tell him that he looks
fine. But he had some dizzy spells last June, almost passed out
twice and had to call 911 once.
</P>
<P>
   Tom spent three weeks in the hospital as numerous tests on his
brain and heart were conducted, but none determined the reasons for
the lightheadedness. He said he thinks that it could stem from his
heart rate ``not being right yet,'' and he wonders if he will need
a pacemaker or if a 40 percent blockage that was not treated during
surgery may have worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been so paranoid and messed up with my own self,'' Tom
said. ``In the meantime, I want to watch my kid pitch, but it makes
me too nervous and I have to listen to the negativism because he
hasn't performed well. I'm not using me as an excuse, but I'm sure
it has to be a concern to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, who visited his father in the hospital in June,
laughed as he recounted telling him over and over that criticism is
a part of being a major leaguer who makes $6 million. Pettitte, 27,
said that he would face the Rangers without worrying about his
father's condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm able to separate the two because the doctors say his heart
is all right,'' Pettitte said. ``I just think he's not in good
health. He's not taking as good care of himself as he needs to.
It's kind of catching up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   October has been an eventful month for the Pettittes. Tom did
not attend the 1997 division series because he had had 24 inches of
his colon removed, and he watched the 1998 World Series while
clutching a pillow to his chest to prevent stitches from popping
open. While Tom missed Andy's first post-season start this year, he
vowed that he would be at Game 3 on Saturday in Arlington, Tex.,
and, he hoped, at other Yankee games in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Andy I resent the fact that I haven't been able to make
it to the playoffs because of the things going on with me,'' Tom
said. ``To me, it's a big deal. As a parent, it doesn't matter
what's going on with you. It's your kid. You want to see your kid
succeed and participate in the things you worked with them for.
That's all.''  &QL;

WHO'S TO BLAME?
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League is not coming back to Los Angeles.
Should we laugh, or should we cry?
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, it's reassuring to know we're not going to be
saddled with a west coast version of the Cleveland Browns, an
expansion team that might require 3-to-5 years to become average
and put a heavy drape over our NFL TV viewing choices.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is not Cleveland, you see, and it's time everyone
stops apologizing for it. We're a sophisticated city that doesn't
need to cling to a sports team for its self-esteem. And having
danced in the pale moonlight with Georgia Frontiere and Al Davis,
we've lost any sense of romance about the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sports teams, we demand a pre-nup, especially
when the NFL is involved. The bottom line for fans is that the NFL
situation in L.A. has never been better. No team equals no losers
and more TV. Pass the chips and salsa.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's frustrating to play the black box tape
from the wreckage of Wednesday's decision and realize the same kind
of people incompetent and/or stubborn civic leaders and prospective
owners with short arms and/or big egos made the same kind of
mistakes that have been dogging L.A. football interests now for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The blame for this particular failure spreads quicker, thicker
and farther than the oil from the Exxon Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Haagan
</P>
<P>
   . He was the Coliseum Commission president who in 1987 refused
to follow through on promised renovations to the Coliseum on behalf
of Davis and the Raiders. That decision led the Raiders to look
elsewhere and their eventual return to Oakland after the 1994
season.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim city officials
</P>
<P>
   . In acquiring the land to build the Pond, they had to negotiate
with the Rams. President John Shaw gave up some land rights in
exchange for a buyout clause in the Rams' lease at the Big A.
Anaheim officials, despite knowing the Rams were unhappy, never
thought the Rams would pay it. Well, they didn't. St. Louis did.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan
</P>
<P>
   . In 1995, Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley stepped up with an offer
to build, with his own money, a $300 million football stadium next
to Dodgers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley was re-energized by the NFL idea after several years of
in-fighting with the Bud Seligs of baseball. But Riordan, urged by
City Hall colleagues on behalf of the Coliseum, talked O'Malley
into letting the Coliseum bid run it's course.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is sad history. O'Malley agrees, the idea loses steam,
he puts the Dodgers up for sale, Fox buys them, and the
organization begins its descent to hell.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas
</P>
<P>
   . Ridley-Thomas hammered the idea of returning to Coliseum, and
his conviction was sincere. But he and everyone in the Coliseum
effort made a huge mistake thinking the NFL would return without
more of its favorite kind of money, public.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the NFL gave the Coliseum its tentative backing in
March, the league all but said it would seek a sweetener to the
modest $40 million in fresh money already committed. How it came
dressed, as parking garages, is irrelevant. The NFL wanted more,
and Ridley-Thomas et al should have known it would come to that.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Roski and Eli Broad
</P>
<P>
   . Roski and the good people in Carson may be the only innocents
in the drama. Roski doggedly pursued a team for the Coliseum and
was willing to pay for stadium construction by himself.
</P>
<P>
   But once the league started holding hands with Michael Ovitz,
Roski and Broad should have called an audible. The league clearly
wanted Ovitz in charge of a L.A. franchise because of his marketing
vision and ties to Hollyweird.
</P>
<P>
   Broad, who is rich enough to buy Michael Ovitz and his favorite
couple, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, bristled at the idea of being
a silent money man behind a classic OPM (other people's money)
charlatan like Ovitz. Ovitz (and the NFL) kept waiting for Broad
and Roski to call and join his group, but it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Gray Davis
</P>
<P>
   . Davis thought he was helping things by sending his man, Bill
Chadwick, into the fray to settle the league's public money issues.
But all Chadwick did was anger NFL owners with financial demands
and waste six weeks of time Roski could have used working to keep
the Coliseum alive.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz
</P>
<P>
   . From the very beginning, there was conjecture that Ovitz
didn't have the scratch to build a stadium and own a NFL team, and
it turns out it was true. Ovitz had a rich ally in grocery
millionaire Ron Burkle, but the Ovitz franchise fee offer was a
short-armed $450 million and included the league carrying a note on
stadium construction.
</P>
<P>
   Remember this the next time someone steps to a podium and says
he has a vision. It's often all he has.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL
</P>
<P>
   . I've saved the most guilty party for last, because every act
of this entire passion (passionless?) play was directed and
produced by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In December of 1994, Paul Tagliabue came to a Raiders game in
San Diego and said the Coliseum was no longer a viable NFL stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the league approved a deal for the Raiders to play at a
new stadium at Hollywood Park, but then submarined it, saying the
idea was underfunded. What the league actually did was insist on a
second tenant and refuse to agree to Davis' terms on the use of PSL
(private seat license) and Super Bowl revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout 1998, the league urged Ovitz to aggressively campaign
for a franchise and new location, leading him to Carson and the
kind of competition for an expansion team the league wanted. But at
no time during the process did the league ever offer a hard
franchise fee figure or even commit to conduct an auction.
</P>
<P>
   Even after choosing the Coliseum, the league did what it could
to keep other sites alive, and even encouraged an eleventh-hour bid
by Marvin Davis and Hollywood Park as another hedge to create the
kind of competition that yields $700 million franchise fees.
</P>
<P>
   Touchdown, NFL.
</P>
<P>
   There will undoubtedly be talk now of an existing NFL team
moving to Los Angeles, or the return of the Raiders. But that's all
it will be until someone builds a stadium. I wouldn't expect to see
Mssrs. Roski, Broad and Ovitz hanging around for another parry with
the NFL unless they plan to buy a team that moves here, which isn't
likely.
</P>
<P>
   So for the moment, all we can really do is congratulate Houston.
We'll see you on TV.

OFF-SPEED PITCHES LEAVING RANGERS OFF-BALANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
NEW YORK _ Rangers hitters are carnivores. They're aggressive,
take-no-prisoners batters that love to feast on fastballs. Any
pitcher that relies too much on the hard stuff is going to get
pounded.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's why the Rangers led the American League with a .295
average and set club records with 230 home runs and 945 runs.
</P>
<P>
   This bit of inside information is hardly top-secret. American
League pitchers have known this for years and the ``book'' on the
Rangers has always been inducing them to be overaggressive at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez did so in beating the Rangers,
8-0, in the first game of the American League Division Series on
Tuesday and Andy Pettitte knows that will be important for him in
Game 2 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, at the beginning of the game you have to set a tone
and show them that you're going to throw strikes and be
aggressive,'' Pettitte said. ``If we get a lead again, that will
get them to start pressing a little bit. That's when teams start
swinging at bad pitches. The game will dictate that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key for me is just to go out and try to get
command of everything and get strike one and throw strikes. Then
you can start expanding the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees don't know anything more about the Rangers than any
other American League team. They just use what they know better.
Their pitching staff was second in the American League with a 4.13
earned-run average, trailing only the Boston Red Sox and Pedro
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   But it does appear the Yankees pitching staff ``owns'' the
Rangers. They've held them to one run in four playoff games going
back to last season's Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the regular season, the Yankees beat the Rangers in
eight of 12 meetings by holding them to a .246 batting average,
their lowest against any team. The Rangers drew 33 walks in those
12 games while striking out 81 times. The Rangers hit .307 in 10
games against the Cleveland Indians with 35 walks and 63
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the Indians don't have the Yankees' pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game, I was saying that's one series \Ragainst the
Rangers\S I didn't want to play again,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ``We gave them one run in three games last year but you know
they're so good offensively. But again, and I allude to Pedro
Martinez pitching in the All-Star Game. You have McGwire, you have
Sosa, you have all those good players.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you're on your game, you can control the game somewhat.
And we've been fortunate against this club that we have been able
to pitch well.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Rangers had success Tuesday. Rusty Greer, the Rangers' most
patient hitter, had two walks his first two times up. Ivan
Rodriguez, the Rangers' best breaking-ball hitter, had a double and
a single, the only hits off Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have controlled aggression,'' Greer said. ``By
that, I mean you go up there thinking: hit, hit, hit, take. You've
got to be prepared to swing the bat early, but sometimes part of
you has to recognize and take a pitch. Any time you think: take,
then swing, that's when I get in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers aren't stupid. Juan Gonzalez didn't hit .326 with 39
home runs and 128 runs batted in by going up there swinging at
anything. He did make the proper adjustment Tuesday night but a
great catch by Bernie Williams robbed the Rangers of a big inning.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, batting with two on and one out in the first inning,
saw a steady stream of off-speed breaking pitches from Hernandez
and ended up striking out on a low slider. Batting in the same
situation in the third inning, Gonzalez made Hernandez get the ball
up and he lined one into the right-center gap. But Williams made a
sliding, lunging catch to take away an extra-base hit, and the
Rangers' rally died.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also had a chance at Hernandez in the sixth inning,
trailing 3-0. Greer, leading off the inning, worked the count 3-1
but popped up a pitch he should have creamed. Gonzalez then worked
a walk from Hernandez but got doubled off when first baseman Tino
Martinez made a leaping catch of Rafael Palmeiro's blistering line
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Juan's ball dropped _ Bernie made a great catch _ and
Rafael's ball goes into the corner, it's a different ballgame,''
Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said. ``They made two great
defensive plays. But this is just too good of a lineup, we have too
many good offensive players, not to go out there and have a good
run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have done it against 12 other American League teams;
they just need to do the same thing against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care, back when I played in the dark ages, good
pitching stops good hitting,'' Torre said. ``That's what this game
is based on.'' nn

NEW RESPECT SHOWN FOR ANCIENT ISLAND SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Runs with HAWAII-WHALES  
BY ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHALA COAST, Hawaii _ In past eras of the tourism boom,
Hawaii's natural history sites might have been seen as nuisances,
impediments to the optimal positioning of a pool or a 15th tee.
Today, however, they're being embraced as important visitor lures,
included among a destination's selling points.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous such sites on the western coast of the Big
Island.
</P>
<P>
   At the northwest tip of the island are the remnants of a fishing
village that dates back more than 600 years, now protected as
Lapakahi State Historical Park. Brochures guide visitors along a
self-guided walking tour, during which amateur anthropologists can
examine carefully piled rocks that once served as canoe sheds, a
well, wind breaks, a game-playing arena. There are also
hollowed-out stones in which the sun turned seawater into salt, for
use in preserving fish.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the Kohala and North Kona coasts are several
petroglyph fields, many coexisting peacefully with luxury resorts
that have sprung up near them _ or in their very midst. Many of the
resorts, in fact, have established cultural centers and put local
historians on staff to acquaint visitors with the links to Hawaii's
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for that kind of responsible stuff,'' said P.K.
``Ski'' Kwiatkowski, a local authority on the ancient etchings.
``What's happened now, people have bought into the fact that a part
of the culture that's visible in areas in which they have their
developments is not a detriment, it's an enhancement to the resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they build around it instead of bulldozing through, the
way they did in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the resorts along this coast don't appear to be keen on
sharing the experience with people who can't produce room keys. The
Mauna Lani Bay Hotel &AMP; Bungalows and the Kona Village Resort, for
example, have regularly scheduled tours for guests, but outsiders
are accommodated by appointment only and must call in advance for
availability.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of other resorts welcome non-guests, though. The
Waikoloa Beach Resort offers a tour every Saturday at 8:30 a.m.; it
meets at the Kings' Shop. The Orchid at Mauna Lani offers a free
guided walk every day at 8 a.m.; it begins near the resort's beach
boy hut.
</P>
<P>
   Both walks are free. ``We try not to sell culture _ or put a
price tag on it,'' said Orchid spokeswoman Donna Kimura.
</P>
<P>
   On a weekday morning this past winter, the Orchid's tour was led
by Gary Medina, a cultural guide employed by the hotel, who
delivered a commentary rich in Hawaiian folklore, legends and
language while leading a 1{-hour walk through undeveloped grounds
adjacent to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The tour featured a Mother Lode of island archeology: an area
called the Puako petroglyph district. There, on a lava plane
perhaps 75 yards long and 20 yards wide, was a remarkable chronicle
of early Hawaiian life.
</P>
<P>
   This site was originally chosen for its strong mana _ a cosmic
force _ and it served as the society's newspaper, its calendar, its
family scrapbooks, its signposts.
</P>
<P>
   The field is covered with carvings, portraying men with
triangular torsos, women giving birth, traveler tallies, boats,
turtles, fishermen, kites.
</P>
<P>
   ``See this one?'' Medina said, crouching near a stick figure.
``The person has his hand up. We think it was an early `aloha.'
Look _ there's nothing in it, no weapon, no threat.''
</P>
<P>
   He indicated a carving of a god in a hunched sitting position,
and noted that a figure almost identical to this one has been found
in New Guinea, suggesting that early South Seas mariners carried
elements of their culture across vast stretches of ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Medina then found a rock carving of Lono, the ancient Hawaiian
god of agriculture and rain. It had multiple torsos, each with two
arms hanging at its sides. Medina put his hand over the lower
portion of the figure, and it suddenly took on the look of a
many-masted sailing ship approaching from a distant horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Captain Cook arrived at this island,'' he said, referring
to the British sea captain's landfall at nearby Kealakekua Bay in
1779, ``the people mistook him for a god, the god Lono. When you
look at this, it's not hard to see why.''
</P>
<P>
   Life thereafter underwent radical changes for the Hawaiians, and
this very area reflects it, Medina said. Once a thriving community,
it was abandoned in the 1800s as Hawaiian royalty ordered the men
inland to help with the lucrative sandalwood harvest on the slopes
of nearby Mauna Kea.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers would have a further impact, one that is still
being felt in these petroglyph fields. During colonial times in the
19th century, Hawaiian culture was suppressed, such that the
meanings of many of these carvings were not passed down for a
generation or two, Kwiatkowski said. Thus, many secrets died with
the old Hawaiians.
</P>
<P>
   Kwiatkowski, 52, has searched out, photographed and puzzled over
Hawaiian petroglyphs throughout the islands (and even elsewhere in
Polynesia), but he says interpretation remains mostly guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was born in 1908,'' he said, ``and when she was growing
up she was actually punished for speaking Hawaiian on school
grounds. The white people wanted to Americanize Hawaiians totally.
The culture basically went underground. The secrets of the culture
were kept hush-hush.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout, even for visitors today, is some confusion over the
messages of the ancient sites.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the petroglyph fields, for example, have gridlike
patterns of small holes in the rock, like a checkerboard.
Kwiatkowski believes it was used for the playing of konane, a
Hawaiian game involving smooth stones.
</P>
<P>
   But Lani Opunui, historian for the Kona Village Resort,
questions this, and wonders if instead it might have been some type
of calendar. ``Why would someone want to be playing that game out
in the sun on the hot rock when you could have made a board out of
wood and taken it under a tree?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Interpretation of the images may be subject to debate. But in a
new era of tourism, the caretakers of Hawaii's ancient sites are
simply thankful people are asking questions. &QL;

   Guide Gary Medina points out features of a figure carved into a
rock at the Puako petroglyph field on Hawaii's Big Island. The
nearby Orchid at Mauna Lani resort conducts the tours _ even for
non-guests _ at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Stone walls from a former fishing village still stand at
Lapakahi State Historical Park in the northwest corner of Hawaii's
Big Island. The site dates back more than 600 years.

SELF-PROMOTION HELPED UKU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putting a highlight film together is not an uncommon tactic for
a high school or junior college football player looking for a place
to play at the next level.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the highlight film actually persuade a coach particularly
one that has no previous knowledge of the player to sign the player
doesn't often happen.
</P>
<P>
   But, without his self-prepared video, Austin Uku, who played at
Narbonne High and Long Beach City College, probably would have
never been discovered by the coaches at the University of Arizona.
And the 6-foot-1, 230-pound Uku certainly wouldn't be in the
starting lineup at defensive end when the Wildcats play host to USC
on Saturday if former Narbonne teammate Brandon Manumaleuna hadn't
delivered the highlight reel to the Arizona coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You search high and low for a player,'' Arizona defensive line
coach Marty Long told the Arizona Republic, ``and all of the sudden
a kid brings in the tape and says, `Look at my buddy.' I recruited
the school (LBCC), I (visited) the school and I didn't know
anything about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many colleges knew much about him especially not as a
defensive player. Uku, who grew up in Pittsburgh, moved to Southern
California during his sophomore year to live with his mother, Carol
Fuller. He filled several roles in high school. He played tailback,
fullback, safety, defensive end, defensive tackle, defensive end,
linebacker and cornerback at Narbonne.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to Long Beach City College, though, Uku fancied
himself as a running back. He played that position for most of his
two seasons despite LBCC coach Larry Reisbig's suggestion that Uku
would be more valuable on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always loved running back,'' said Uku, who did see limited
duty on defense. ``But last year, we had four running backs and the
coaches were trying to spread the ball out evenly. When (defensive
end Scott Parkhurst) broke his ankle I felt I could help the team
out more on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkhurst, who was leading the team with nine sacks, was injured
in the seventh game of the season. Uku, who had 330 yards and four
touchdowns rushing, only played on defense during the final four
games, but he was selected Al-South Coast Conference after
contributing 27 tackles, including 18 for loss, eight sacks, 10
pass breakups, 10 quarterback hurries, a fumble recovery, three
forced fumbles and a safety.
</P>
<P>
   College scouts were flocking to LBCC, but not many of them had
offers for Uku. Only Oregon State and Cincinnati were showing
serious interest until Uku sent out the videos. When Arizona
offered, Uku jumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scheme at Arizona fit me,'' said Uku, who was born in
Nigeria and moved to Pennsylvania when he was a year old. ``And
Brandon and I are basically best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Uku didn't join Arizona until the Wildcats training camp began
and thought he would see limited action behind Mike Robertson, who
started four games last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might be a third-down type of guy,'' Uku said.
</P>
<P>
   He's been much more than that. Uku was one of the few Arizona
defenders to play well in the opening loss to Penn State and was in
the starting lineup by the third week. In five games, Uku has 18
tackles, with four for loss, a sack, a pass breakup, a forced
fumble and fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, one of the year's highlights for Uku came
during the 41-7 loss to Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time that my father (Eustace Uku) had seen me
play,'' Uku said. ``That was pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly been a special year for the Arizona defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's probably been most surprising to me is that we haven't
played good defense,'' Arizona coach Dick Tomey said. ``We've
played pretty good defense around here for a long time. We haven't
been able to do that this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Missed tackles have become commonplace for a Wildcat defense
that has allowed 33 points and 397 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very confusing to me,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said after
watching the Wildcats defense on tape. ``What I do see is,
strategically, a defense that creat a lot of problems for an
offensive football team. They put a ton of people up front and the
plan is to get you confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Uku is expected to play a big part in that confusion on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence is getting greater and greater every week,'' Uku
said. ``It should be through the roof when I completely learn the
defense. All I can do now is stay consistent.''

NFL DECISION NO SHOCKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wow, I can't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL gave Houston an expansion team over L.A.
</P>
<P>
   What a shock!
</P>
<P>
   The next thing someone is going to tell me is that the earth is
round. Or that the sun sets in the west. Or that Ted Turner and
Rupert Murdoch despise each other. Or that there is smog and
traffic congestion in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. had about as much chance of securing the NFL's 32nd
franchise as Michael Ovitz does of being given a glowing
testimonial dinner by Michael Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with the barest knowledge of economics could have
predicted months ago that Houston would prevail against L.A. for
the most compelling reason imaginable money.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to hyperbolic rhetoric, inflated promises and
Hollywood glamour, L.A. had it all going with the publicity-crazed
Ovitz leading its charge.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to actually putting up capital with no strings
attached no deferred payments, no name-dropping of billionaire
friends, no silly mumbo-jumbo utterances calculated to con gullible
journalists Houston had it all going with a person, Bob McNair,
quite willing to put his cash where his mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   Score a dazzling knockout for Houston with McNair's $700 million
franchise fee offer making a mockery out of the puny $400 million
pittance tendered by Ovitz and his wealthy pal Ron Burkle.
</P>
<P>
   McNair stepped to the plate and jolted a Mark McGwire home run.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz stepped to the plate amid great gloating and fanned
ignobly.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. reminds me of an aging beauty queen, or to be gender
equitable an aging Mr. Universe who lives in a perpetual state of
self-deception and refuses to accept reality.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to L.A.'s representatives in recent times, you'd
come to the conclusion that the entire NFL soon would be blown
asunder unless it stuck a team in the second largest television
market in America.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the NFL has survived quite admirably without L.A.
the past four years franchises have appreciated in value during
this period more than 30 per cent and the fact that two teams, the
Raiders and Rams, already have spurned the city is an indication of
the delusional state of L.A.'s leaders.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to Ovitz and it would be difficult not to since
the guy the past couple of years has been gamboling around
extolling the virtues of first Carson and then the Coliseum and
finally Hollywood Park you'd have thought L.A. was a certainty to
get an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   And that has been the problem for L.A.
</P>
<P>
   There have been too many guys with fancy Dunn &AMP; Bradstreet
ratings and entrees to the movers and shakers of the entertainment
community slinging nothing more than a bunch of horse manure.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Ed Roski-Eli Broad Coliseum group and now the
Ovitz-Burkle tandem has besieged the NFL and the media with a lot
of windblown prattle that hasn't been backed up by firm financial
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   So what's next for L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   Well, immediately, someone should stick a horse muzzle on the
mouth of Ovitz, who has received more ink for doing nothing than
any person I can recall since the heyday of George Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, Ovitz is supposed to have all these fantastically
wealthy friends, yet not one not even the ``billionaire'' Ron
Burkle was willing to come even close to matching McNair's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Ovitz thought L.A. was going to get an NFL franchise
on the cheap because it is, after all, L.A.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL owners, a hard-boiled lot who became rich because of
a passionate fascination for money, weren't interested in such a
sentimental concept.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. might have matchless weather and wonderful amusement parks
and gorgeous beaches and plenty of celebrities, but that extra $10
million each owner would derive from McNair's kindly overture was
far more appealing to tastes that are greed-driven.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure the happiest person about L.A.'s latest rejection is Al
Davis, stuck these days with the Raiders in Oakland, much to his
distress.
</P>
<P>
   Davis desperately wants to return here, and still might if he
can (a) get out of his long-term lease in Oakland and (b) if he can
find a suitable way to have a stadium built for him in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   As he found out during his 13 years here and as everybody else
has found out who's tried to do it, that is a most daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prospect of Al Davis and the Raiders returning to
L.A. - as implausible as it might seem is far more likely than
Michael Ovitz ever bringing a team to these parts.
</P>
<P>
   But one can't count out Mr. Ovitz at least in the language
department.
</P>
<P>
   If success were measured purely in words and not in actions then
I suspect one can perceive Michael Ovitz as being a godsend for
L.A. football.

WANTED FOR RAPE: JOHN DOE, WHO IS KNOWN ONLY BY HIS DNA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs last sentence in 3rd graf for clarification; moves
3rd-from-last graf up to put it after 3rd graf and refine it,
including fixing typo; story is now 2 takes)  (bl) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a novel legal gambit that stretches the law to
match the developing science of DNA, a prosecutor in Wisconsin has
filed rape and kidnapping charges against a defendant who has no
name. John Doe is known only by his DNA code, extracted from semen
samples from three rapes, samples which have been tested after six
years of storage in a police property room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that one person raped these three women,'' said the
prosecutor, Norman Gahn, assistant district attorney for Milwaukee
County. ``We just don't know who that person is. We will catch
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's strategy is an attempt to keep the six-year
time limit for bringing a charge from running out in the only one
of the three cases where that has not already happened. A warrant
must identify the person to be arrested, and this one names ``John
Doe, unknown male with matching deoxyribonucleic acid profile.''
The warrant, signed by a judge in September, will keep the statute
of limitations from expiring, which in this case would otherwise
happen in November. Now, every month, an FBI computer will compare
the numbers that describe John Doe's DNA with thousands of genetic
samples from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Doe'' is typically used in a warrant when the accused is
known by an alias or by a physical description. The Milwaukee case
is unusual in that it described the suspect by only DNA
information.
</P>
<P>
   The case reveals several gaps between the law and science. Can a
person be identified on a warrant by biometric evidence, such as a
DNA code or fingerprint, or is a more traditional behavioral
identification required, such as a name and date of birth? And is
the legal concept of a statute of limitations relevant in an age of
DNA testing of old evidence? Legal experts said the case would be
challenged, but has merit.
</P>
<P>
   The case also reveals the promise and limitations of the
national DNA databank, which is one year old this month.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention has focused on the promise. The FBI says the DNA
databank has helped solve 583 cases, such as the serial rapist in
Washington, D.C., linked with a serial rapist in Florida. Police
routinely collect DNA evidence not only in rape cases but from
saliva on beer cans left behind by a burglar, from sweat on a
baseball bat used in a beating, from blood on a bullet that passed
through a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Less attention has been paid to the holes in the system. Only 18
of 50 states are hooked into the FBI databank, known as the
Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), while the rest are working on
the technology and the funding. The databank is still far smaller
than the FBI's fingerprint bank. State crime labs are far behind in
their work. Much DNA evidence that is collected is never analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 180,000 rape kits _ evidence from only one type of
crime _ sit unexamined on shelves in police departments across the
nation, according to a new survey of police agencies commissioned
by the National Commission for the Future of DNA Evidence. These
flat rectangular boxes include blood vials, swabs of semen, a lock
of hair, and fingernail scrapings _ evidence collected from rape
victims in a humiliating ritual.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   New York City alone has 12,000 unexamined rape kits, and is
trying to reduce the backlog by contracting with private
laboratories. It has stopped destroying untested kits after five
years, but other police departments continue the practice.

<P>
   ``We have the technology to solve these crimes, and we're not
doing it'' said Christopher Asplen, executive director of the DNA
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Many police departments still use DNA evidence as they have used
fingerprints and tire tracks, to rule a suspect in or out. But the
new DNA databanks make the evidence useful for matching cases to
convicted offenders, or to other cases in which a suspect may be
known.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the police agencies in the survey reported
that they test all or nearly all samples for DNA. About one-third
of the agencies test less often. And about one-quarter weren't
sure.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Cities vary widely in their use of DNA testing. In Cleveland,
``We only do DNA testing when there's an identifiable suspect,''
said Lt. Edward Thiery, spokesman for the Cleveland Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, ``We now submit every sample for testing, but we
still have a backlog of untested samples,'' said Pat Camden,
spokesman for the Chicago Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the police department buys a new, 40-foot
refrigerated trailer truck every six months, just to hold DNA
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Los Angeles Police Department, right now, if you didn't
have a suspect in custody and a court date, that thing is not going
to get analyzed, whatever it is,'' Maria Foster, a detective
supervisor, told the DNA commission. ``When you got a court date,
when you go to trial, then it will happen.''

</P>
<P>
   The three DNA samples that identified a serial rapist in
Milwaukee were collected in 1993. In each case, on the city's north
side, a man grabbed a woman from behind, told her that he had a
knife, took her to a quiet place, raped her, and demanded money,
police said. After she reported the crime, vaginal and cervical
swabs of semen were collected at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The samples waited at the police evidence room, along with 2,300
other unexamined rape kits. To test them all would have swamped the
state crime lab, which already has a backlog.
</P>
<P>
   So Detective Lori Gaglione and her colleagues in the city's
Sensitive Crimes Unit winnowed down to the best cases, based mostly
on human factors, such as the availability of victims and
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   From the 53 samples that were tested, one case matched a
convicted rapist in Minnesota. Another matched a convicted rapist
elsewhere in Wisconsin, allowing charges to be filed only eight
hours before the statute of limitations expired.
</P>
<P>
   And the three samples were found to match each other.
</P>
<P>
   The law in Wisconsin, as in other states, requires that a
warrant identify the accused. If the name is not known, the law
allows identification ``by any description by which the person to
be arrested can be identified with reasonable certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My argument is going to be that genetic code goes well beyond
reasonable certainty,'' Gahn said. ``We're pushing the envelope as
far as we can. It does something for the victim of the sexual
assaullt, to know that someone cares and to know that we're out
there working on the case.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The forensic science supervisor in the state crime lab, Dirk
Janssen, said that the probability of randomly selecting an
unrelated individual who would have a DNA profile matching the
three samples would be approximately 1 in 7.25 billion _ more than
the world's population _ in the U.S. Caucasian population, and 1 in
1.96 billion in the African-American population.
</P>
<P>
   Such a John Doe warrant has been used at least one other time,
in a Kansas case in 1991. No one was caught, so the issue has not
been tested.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant appears to have merit, said Myrna Raeder, a
professor of law at Southwestern University in Los Angeles and the
former head of the criminal section of the American Bar
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not frivolous,'' Professor Raeder said. ``It's clearly
novel and therefore courts are really going to have to struggle
with the intention of the statute and whether the clear meaning of
the statute would cover this.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As in most states, only people convicted of sexual offenses in
Wisconsin are required to give samples for DNA testing. The
Legislature is on the verge of expanding that to all felony
offenses, as Alabama and Virginia have done. In addition, the
Legislature is considering eliminating the statute of limitations
in cases of rape, as Florida has done.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hope that someday, perhaps even 20 years from now, a
man will leave a cigarette behind at another rape, or cut himself
on broken glass at a burglary. His saliva or blood will be tested,
its DNA catalogued and entered in the FBI databank.
</P>
<P>
   And he will be charged with raping and kidnapping a woman in
Milwaukee on Nov. 9, 1993.

NEW RESPECT SHOWN FOR ANCIENT SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Runs with HAWAII-WHALES  
BY ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHALA COAST, Hawaii _ In past eras of the tourism boom,
Hawaii's natural history sites might have been seen as nuisances,
impediments to the optimal positioning of a pool or a 15th tee.
Today, however, they're being embraced as important visitor lures,
included among a destination's selling points.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous such sites on the western coast of the Big
Island.
</P>
<P>
   At the northwest tip of the island are the remnants of a fishing
village that dates back more than 600 years, now protected as
Lapakahi State Historical Park. Brochures guide visitors along a
self-guided walking tour, during which amateur anthropologists can
examine carefully piled rocks that once served as canoe sheds, a
well, wind breaks, a game-playing arena. There are also
hollowed-out stones in which the sun turned seawater into salt, for
use in preserving fish.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the Kohala and North Kona coasts are several
petroglyph fields, many coexisting peacefully with luxury resorts
that have sprung up near them _ or in their very midst. Many of the
resorts, in fact, have established cultural centers and put local
historians on staff to acquaint visitors with the links to Hawaii's
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for that kind of responsible stuff,'' said P.K.
``Ski'' Kwiatkowski, a local authority on the ancient etchings.
``What's happened now, people have bought into the fact that a part
of the culture that's visible in areas in which they have their
developments is not a detriment, it's an enhancement to the resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they build around it instead of bulldozing through, the
way they did in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the resorts along this coast don't appear to be keen on
sharing the experience with people who can't produce room keys. The
Mauna Lani Bay Hotel &AMP; Bungalows and the Kona Village Resort, for
example, have regularly scheduled tours for guests, but outsiders
are accommodated by appointment only and must call in advance for
availability.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of other resorts welcome non-guests, though. The
Waikoloa Beach Resort offers a tour every Saturday at 8:30 a.m.; it
meets at the Kings' Shop. The Orchid at Mauna Lani offers a free
guided walk every day at 8 a.m.; it begins near the resort's beach
boy hut.
</P>
<P>
   Both walks are free. ``We try not to sell culture _ or put a
price tag on it,'' said Orchid spokeswoman Donna Kimura.
</P>
<P>
   On a weekday morning this past winter, the Orchid's tour was led
by Gary Medina, a cultural guide employed by the hotel, who
delivered a commentary rich in Hawaiian folklore, legends and
language while leading a 1{-hour walk through undeveloped grounds
adjacent to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The tour featured a Mother Lode of island archeology: an area
called the Puako petroglyph district. There, on a lava plane
perhaps 75 yards long and 20 yards wide, was a remarkable chronicle
of early Hawaiian life.
</P>
<P>
   This site was originally chosen for its strong mana _ a cosmic
force _ and it served as the society's newspaper, its calendar, its
family scrapbooks, its signposts.
</P>
<P>
   The field is covered with carvings, portraying men with
triangular torsos, women giving birth, traveler tallies, boats,
turtles, fishermen, kites.
</P>
<P>
   ``See this one?'' Medina said, crouching near a stick figure.
``The person has his hand up. We think it was an early `aloha.'
Look _ there's nothing in it, no weapon, no threat.''
</P>
<P>
   He indicated a carving of a god in a hunched sitting position,
and noted that a figure almost identical to this one has been found
in New Guinea, suggesting that early South Seas mariners carried
elements of their culture across vast stretches of ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Medina then found a rock carving of Lono, the ancient Hawaiian
god of agriculture and rain. It had multiple torsos, each with two
arms hanging at its sides. Medina put his hand over the lower
portion of the figure, and it suddenly took on the look of a
many-masted sailing ship approaching from a distant horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Captain Cook arrived at this island,'' he said, referring
to the British sea captain's landfall at nearby Kealakekua Bay in
1779, ``the people mistook him for a god, the god Lono. When you
look at this, it's not hard to see why.''
</P>
<P>
   Life thereafter underwent radical changes for the Hawaiians, and
this very area reflects it, Medina said. Once a thriving community,
it was abandoned in the 1800s as Hawaiian royalty ordered the men
inland to help with the lucrative sandalwood harvest on the slopes
of nearby Mauna Kea.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers would have a further impact, one that is still
being felt in these petroglyph fields. During colonial times in the
19th century, Hawaiian culture was suppressed, such that the
meanings of many of these carvings were not passed down for a
generation or two, Kwiatkowski said. Thus, many secrets died with
the old Hawaiians.
</P>
<P>
   Kwiatkowski, 52, has searched out, photographed and puzzled over
Hawaiian petroglyphs throughout the islands (and even elsewhere in
Polynesia), but he says interpretation remains mostly guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was born in 1908,'' he said, ``and when she was growing
up she was actually punished for speaking Hawaiian on school
grounds. The white people wanted to Americanize Hawaiians totally.
The culture basically went underground. The secrets of the culture
were kept hush-hush.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout, even for visitors today, is some confusion over the
messages of the ancient sites.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the petroglyph fields, for example, have gridlike
patterns of small holes in the rock, like a checkerboard.
Kwiatkowski believes it was used for the playing of konane, a
Hawaiian game involving smooth stones.
</P>
<P>
   But Lani Opunui, historian for the Kona Village Resort,
questions this, and wonders if instead it might have been some type
of calendar. ``Why would someone want to be playing that game out
in the sun on the hot rock when you could have made a board out of
wood and taken it under a tree?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Interpretation of the images may be subject to debate. But in a
new era of tourism, the caretakers of Hawaii's ancient sites are
simply thankful people are asking questions. &QL;

   Guide Gary Medina points out features of a figure carved into a
rock at the Puako petroglyph field on Hawaii's Big Island. The
nearby Orchid at Mauna Lani resort conducts the tours _ even for
non-guests _ at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Stone walls from a former fishing village still stand at
Lapakahi State Historical Park in the northwest corner of Hawaii's
Big Island. The site dates back more than 600 years.

IMPATIENCE PROVES COSTLY FOR RANGERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not as if the Yankees possess some secret formula on how to
shut down the fearsome offense of the Texas Rangers. It's not as if
the Rangers are numb to the strategy that is destroying them; the
Texas coaching staff has reminded the Rangers players to swing only
at strikes and to ignore the slop the Yankees' pitchers are
throwing out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers keep swinging recklessly and the Yankees keep
shutting them out, inning after inning after inning. Texas, which
has averaged nearly six runs a game during the regular season over
the last two years, has scored one run in its last four playoff
games against the Yankees. The Rangers lost by 8-0 in Game 1 of the
three-of-five-game division series Tuesday night, after scoring a
single run in three games during their 1998 division series against
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Including the last game of the 1996 division series, the Rangers
have scored one run in their last 42 playoff innings against the
Yankees. ``With our offense, our ball club, to me it's
mind-boggling,'' said Johnny Oates, the Rangers' manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' Andy Pettitte will face Rick Helling of the Rangers
in Game 2 Thursday night at Yankee Stadium, before the series
shifts to Texas Saturday, when Roger Clemens faces the Rangers'
Esteban Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   Texas led the American League in batting in each of the last two
seasons, its lineup capable of the incredible. Juan Gonzalez, the
Rangers' right fielder, has driven in 100 or more runs eight times
in his career, catcher Ivan Rodriguez is coming off a season in
which he accumulated 199 hits and Rafael Palmeiro is going to get
consideration for the most valuable player award after hammering 47
home runs and driving in 148 runs.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be that the Rangers, as good as they are, may not be
suited for the post-season. Most of the teams that have won
championships in this decade are stocked with patient hitters who
work the count and give themselves a chance to anticipate a
particular pitch in a certain situation _ and often drive the
opposing pitcher off the mound in the middle innings because of an
escalating pitch count. The Yankees of 1998 may have been the best
example of this trait, and in forcing Aaron Sele to throw 117
pitches in five innings Tuesday, they show they still possess that
quality.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, however, do not. The Texas lineup is very
aggressive. During the regular season, the Rangers averaged 3.73
pitches a plate appearance, an average number for a team stocked
with so many veteran hitters, and during the regular season, the
Rangers ranked fifth in the league in walks _ and fifth in
strikeouts. The Yankees were third.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez drew only 97 walks combined in 1998 and 1999; Bernie
Williams had 100 walks this season. Rodriguez had only 32 walks
last season and 24 this season. Ranger shortstop Royce Clayton had
39 walks and 100 strikeouts, Lee Stevens 52 walks and 132
strikeouts, Todd Zeile 56 walks and 94 strikeouts. It is the way
they have hit all year: attack.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings before Tuesday's game, the Rangers' batting coach,
Rudy Jaramillo, repeated to his hitters how important patience was,
but once Game 1 began, they reverted to their usual mode. Gonzalez
chased an off-speed pitch out of the strike zone with two runners
on in the first inning and struck out with an off-balance swing,
and this continued most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez kept throwing changeups and breaking balls _
and he often changed the speeds of his breaking balls _ and the
Rangers' hitters kept swinging, often off balance, hitting pop-ups
and fly balls. Hernandez walked six in eight innings, but as Yankee
Manager Joe Torre and others noted, it was clear that Hernandez was
pitching around certain hitters _ Rusty Greer and Palmeiro,
particularly. ``He has a lot of confidence in his ability to throw
strikes when he wants to,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Of his approach, Hernandez said, ``That's a tactic that we
discuss within the team that I don't think should be discussed here
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did not work out at Yankee Stadium Wednesday. But
Doug Melvin, the general manager, and the coach Bucky Dent met with
reporters and spoke hopefully of a game in which Texas hits as it
usually does. Once somebody gets a hit and everybody starts
relaxing, Dent said, then the runs will come.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said: ``I know that the guys are going out there and
giving it their best. We're a very good offensive ball club, and
we'll break out of it somewhere along the line here. Just hope it's
sooner than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte allowed one run in seven innings against the Rangers in
Game 2 of last year's division series, pitching in the same pattern
established by David Wells in Game 1: changeups and off-speed
pitches low in the strike zone. He pitched much more effectively
after the trade deadline by relearning to trust his fastball on the
outside corner, when facing right-handed batters.
</P>
<P>
   It will be crucial for Pettitte to get strike calls on the
outside fringe of the strike zone _ and if he does, the Rangers
will have to continue to swing aggressively. But this might be good
news for Texas: Chuck Meriwether, who will umpire behind home plate
Thursday night, has a reputation for not liking to call out hitters
on third strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this team breaks out, it's going to be big,'' Dent said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers better break out soon, or they will be left to
dwell on another post-season failure. &QL;

 WEB SOFTWARE GIVES PARENTS ACCESS TO SCHOOL RECORDS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Lori Anzini, director of technology for the
Pittsburg Unified School District in Contra Costa (Calif.) County,
knows how tough it is to stay ahead of kids.
<P>
   When Pittsburg High School installed a system eight years ago to
automatically phone parents if a student missed a class, kids
quickly figured out how to get around the incriminating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would beat their parents home and erase the tape on the
answering machine,'' Anzini said. ``When my own daughter was in
high school, she was able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has taken a while, but schools are upping the ante. Many now
use the Internet to post attendance, grades and homework
assignments online, allowing parents to keep tabs on their kids as
never before and, ideally, to be more involved in the education
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it as `Big Brother is watching you,' '' Anzini
said. ``But the reality is that parents are responsible for their
kids up to a certain age. Parents need to have a way to see where
their kids are at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a more grown-up version of the Web cams that allow anxious
moms and dads to peek in on day-care centers, a variety of
resources is available on the Internet to give parents almost full
access to the academic records of their school-age youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Some are offered by private companies that hope to fill a niche
among cash-strapped school districts (and turn a buck via
subscription and advertising fees) and others are overseen by
schools using commercially available software or Web-hosting
services. Pittsburg High School is launching an increasingly
popular service called Internet Student Information System, ISIS.
Using ISIS, a pressed-for-time parent need only click onto the
school's Web site, enter a user I.D. and password, and up comes a
full menu of options relating to his or her child, including class
attendance, grades, test scores, disciplinary problems and even
immunization shots received.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which can cost as much as $3,000 per school, was
developed by a Southern California firm called EduLink Systems.
</P>
<P>
   David Funderburk, EduLink's president, said demand is slowly
growing for online tools that help parents monitor their kids'
academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids, when they get home from school, they don't want
to say much,'' he observed. ``ISIS is easier for most parents than
having to go into the school and speaking with a teacher or
counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   EduLink is now shipping newly developed software allowing
schools to add homework assignments to the mix. Pittsburg High
plans to add the homework option this month. The catch to this
latter application, though, is that it requires teachers to input
the information each day, and many educators are voicing reluctance
to adding a task to their busy workloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is training the teachers how to do it,''
Pittsburg's Anzini said. ``This is especially true for the older
ones. But we've got a lot of young teachers that are really excited
about this. They know that getting the parents to participate is
the way to make children succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, though, is convinced that this brave new world of
education is for the best. Michael Kamil, a professor of education
at Stanford University, said one upshot of these electronic
advances is a shifting of responsibility for the student's
performance from the school to the parent _ potentially leading to
less supervision in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a long-term erosion of respect for schools,'' Kamil
said. ``There's been a long-term shifting of responsibility between
what we want schools to do and what we want parents to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply posting academic records online, he insisted, will not
necessarily lead to parents being more in touch with how their kids
are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I tell you that Johnny scored 72 on his test, what does it
mean?'' Kamil asked. ``Information needs to be interpreted in
context. Seventy-two could be the best score in the school and it
could be the worst in the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he pointed out that a growing number of tech-savvy
youngsters are more than capable of hacking into school computers
and fiddling with their records, and that passwords do not provide
the highest level of security.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, although advocates of online school resources trumpet
the Net as a preferred medium for communication between parents and
teachers, Kamil said most educators would say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no substitute for face-to-face meetings with
teachers,'' he said. ``It really is the only way to learn how your
kid is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   For some parents, however, the Net may be the only opportunity
they have to connect with their child's school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to keep communication lines open with parents,
especially at the high school level,'' said Jeff Reich, principal
of Antioch High School in Contra Costa County, which launched its
own ISIS service two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said as many as 400 parents have registered to access ISIS
since its introduction, and some visit the school's site every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're appreciative,'' Reich said. ``They don't have to worry
about when report cards are coming out or about attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   Such appreciation hasn't been lost on those with an
entrepreneurial bent. A number of Internet companies aim to be
intermediaries between parents and schools.
</P>
<P>
   To date, most of these companies have targeted school districts
in the South and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Maddox is head of a firm called Teacher's Pet, based in
Roanoke, Va. His service allows teachers to post homework
assignments online so that parents can make sure their kids are
keeping up with their classes. About 100 schools subscribe to the
service for up to $795 a year, depending on the number of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private schools eat this up,'' Maddox said. ``Their parents
are more customer-oriented than those at public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a bit of resistance from the teachers,'' he
added, ``but that's not a battle we want to fight. It's up to the
administrators.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, GradeNet, based in Tulsa, charges parents $24.95 a
year for the first student and $19.95 for additional students for
online access to grades, assignments and other academic
information.
</P>
<P>
   The company's president, Roger Fox, said he hasn't signed up any
customers yet, but is confident that schools will be attracted to
the service because they would bear no financial burden for posting
and hosting information.
</P>
<P>
   ``My core belief is that this is so valuable, we will not have a
problem getting subscribers,'' he said. (Texas, Fox feels, ``seems
like real fertile territory.'')
</P>
<P>
   So what do kids think about having their parents use the
Internet to check up on them? Nearly all providers of online
academic resources acknowledged that there's a Big Brother aspect
to these services, but they uniformly stressed that the value to
parents far outweighs whatever discomfort may be caused to their
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Antioch High's Reich put it, ``Go to class and you don't
have to worry about it.''

 &HT;    Patients' rights up for vote in House
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives approved a package of
tax breaks Wednesday designed to help the nation's 44 million
uninsured afford health care.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican measure, which passed 227 to 205, mostly along
party lines, was strongly opposed by Democrats, who said it would
require dipping into Social Security surplus funds to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charged the legislation merely provided political
protection for Republicans as the House begins to vote on measures
today that would bring major changes to the way managed care is
administered.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders worked behind the scenes to kill a bipartisan
measure, written by Georgia Republican Rep. Charlie Norwood and
Michigan Democrat John Dingell, that would allow patients to sue
their health insurance companies in state court.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and other top
Republicans oppose that bill, saying it would open the courts to
frivolous and costly litigation.
</P>
<P>
   They favor a bill by Republicans Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and John
Shadegg of Arizona that would allow patients to sue their health
insurers in far more limited way: only in federal court, where
damage awards are typically smaller, and only after patients have
exhausted all administrative appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then they could be dead,'' countered Norwood. He noted his
bill would allow patients to sue at any point in a dispute with
their health insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have approved rules for today's debate that
would bring three competing bills to the floor before the
Norwood-Dingell measure. If any of those bills win a majority, the
Norwood-Dingell measure would not be voted on at all.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood and Dingell have the support of 23 House Republicans,
President Clinton and most of the House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders were trying to chip away at that support.
Coburn said at least half of those 23 Republicans would switch
their vote and support his bill and that some conservative
Democrats were considering it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting hot around here,'' said Norwood, a dentist from
Augusta, Ga. He has pushed his party's leaders to confront
overhauling managed care since he arrived in Congress four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that passed Wednesday would give the self-insured a 100
percent tax deduction for health care insurance premiums. It also
would allow medical savings accounts, which are tax-exempt accounts
that can be used for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would give small businesses the option to buy
health insurance under federal rather than state regulations _
exempting them from state mandates that bigger self-insured
companies now avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican members of the Georgia delegation supported the
measure _ except for Norwood, who said it was designed to undermine
his own proposal. Georgia Democrats opposed the bill; Rep. Cynthia
McKinney did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Georgia congressional delegation, both Republican Bob
Barr and Democrat John Lewis said they would support the
Norwood-Dingell bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of us are more worried about insurance companies than
patients' care,'' Lewis said. ``We need a bill that will hold
insurance companies responsible. We need to do what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Mac Collins and John Linder said they could not support
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uninsured need access to doctors, not lawyers,'' Collins
said. ``Many of the measures we are seeing in Congress seem to be
more oriented toward the health of the trial lawyers' bank accounts
than the health of workers and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Linder said he would likely support the Shadegg-Coburn bill in
large part because he is concerned about trial lawyers flooding the
courts with lawsuits. ``This is a new killing field for trial
lawyers,'' Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about voting against such a high-profile measure sponsored
by a fellow Georgia Republican, Linder said he learned a long time
ago from state House Speaker Tom Murphy that politics is not
personal. ``You just need to smile and go on,'' Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton entered the fray Wednesday to accuse Republicans of
undermining the legislation on behalf of the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   At a Rose Garden appearance, Clinton said House Republican
leaders were setting up the debate so that it would be ``filled
with enough poison pills and legislative sleights of hand to
practically guarantee the defeat of this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats repeated the same claims throughout the day's debate,
saying Republicans were not allowing amendments that would pay for
the Norwood-Dingell bill. The cost is estimated at $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) said Republicans
wanted to dip into Social Security funds to pay for it, which would
be the same as killing the bill for most Democrats.

 WEB SITES REV UP FOR SELLING USED AUTOS  &HT;     By TOM STEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Two online car sites want to do for automobiles what eBay has done
for trading cards and Elvis knickknacks: namely, allow consumers to
buy and sell vehicles via online auctions.
<P>
   It's unclear, though, whether it's going to work. EBay hasn't
attracted much business since it began officially listing cars in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Autoweb.com and Autobytel.com said they plan to go far
beyond eBay's car listing by offering more cars, direct relations
with dealers, and money-back guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Autoweb, a Santa Clara, Calif., online car site, introduced an
auction service for used cars yesterday. The service is limited to
cars made in 1996 or after with less than 60,000 miles on the
odometer.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it works: Participating dealers will provide Autoweb
with a list of cars up for auction. The bidding in this so-called
reserve auction starts at $100 and increases in $50 dollar
increments. A minimum price has to be reached before the dealer
agrees to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer with the winning bid must take possession of the
car. However, there is a 72-hour grace period for consumers to mull
over their purchases and return the vehicles for a full refund if
they are unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make the transaction as safe as possible for
consumers and let them determine exactly how much they want to
pay,'' said Norm Turner, a general manager at Autoweb.
</P>
<P>
   The company launched the service with 14 car dealers in
California and plans to roll out the program to about 50 cities by
next year.
</P>
<P>
   And while the auctions are now conducted only between dealers
and consumers, Turner said that by December, Autoweb plans to
expand the service to include car owners as sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Autobytel of Irvine, Calif., which will introduce its auction
service today, hinted yesterday that it will have a more robust and
full-featured offering than Autoweb's.
</P>
<P>
   Without divulging many details, Autobytel chief operating
officer Ann Delligatta said consumers want an auction service that
allows them to bid on all kinds of used cars, from year-old Hondas
to vintage Cadillacs with more than 100,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   She said consumers can expect Autobytel to come out of the gate
with nationwide auctions for both the dealer-to-consumer and
consumer-to-consumer markets. She said the company also may unveil
additional features such as a transportation service for
long-distance transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the promise, online car auctions are largely unproven. A
random sampling of eBay's car auction site found that the majority
of cars posted there had been sitting idle for a full week without
a single bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting about 100 postings a month,'' said eBay
spokesman Kevin Pursglove. ``We still believe the car market will
be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that the Internet has had a profound impact
on the way Americans buy cars. A 1999 J.D. Power survey reported
that more than 5 million new-vehicle buyers will use the Internet
to gather information before they make a purchase. And Autobytel
estimates that $14 billion worth or new and used cars will be sold
through its site this year.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular cars sites on the Web are Microsoft CarPoint,
Autobytel, Cars.com, Autoweb and AutoConnect, according to Internet
research firm Media Metrix Inc. So far Autobytel and Autoweb are
the only sites offering auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ribiero, who heads up Internet car sales at San Francisco
Honda, believes online car auctions are inevitable. ``Everything is
being auctioned on the Net, so I guess I'm not surprised that cars
are next,'' he said.

 GEOCAST REVEALS ITS SECRET TECHNOLOGY  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Silicon Valley startup Geocast Network Systems secretly has been
developing a technology that uses digital TV broadcasting to
deliver video programs and interactive Web content to personal
computers.
<P>
   Now, Geocast is taking the cloak off its product.
</P>
<P>
   Geocast will announce Thursday that Hearst-Argyle Television
Inc., which operates 28 broadcast television stations reaching
nearly 18 percent of U.S. households, will invest up to $10 million
in the startup.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst-Argyle also will allocate portions of its stations'
digital broadcast frequencies for use by Geocast Network.
</P>
<P>
   Geocast CEO Joe Horowitz said the deal, which gives
Hearst-Argyle an undisclosed stake in the company, is a key step
toward his vision of creating a new network that would give
consumers a new high-speed way to download and watch digital TV
programs on their PCs or download new software or CD albums in
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us to use the mass-medium distribution system yet
personalize it for the individual consumer,'' Hearst-Argyle
Chairman and co-CEO Bob Marbut said in a telephone interview. ``To
me, that's a powerful idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Geocast Network created a buzz in Silicon Valley after it
received funding in December 1998 from three major venture capital
firms _ Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &AMP; Byers, The Mayfield Fund and
Institutional Venture Partners. It's the first time in more than a
decade that all three have invested in the same startup, though
Horowitz has declined to say how much the partners have invested.
</P>
<P>
   Geocast, founded a year earlier, has assembled a team of top
venture capital, technology and media executives, including 10
engineers who helped develop Netscape Communication Corp.'s Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   However, the buzz was about a secret product that few on the
outside had seen. But because of the deal with publicly traded
Hearst-Argyle, Horowitz said he believed it also was time to reveal
Geocast technology, which the company hopes to market by the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   In a preview earlier this week, Horowitz said the network will
center around a receiver slightly smaller than a VCR that would
connect to a desktop computer. The receiver would cost less than
$300 but would not require subscription fees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Geocast would use an unused portion of digital TV frequencies
to beam a ``multicast'' of Web-style programming and data to
Geocast receivers. Consumers could program a receiver to download
only what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A handful of TV stations began all-digital, high-definition
broadcasts last November 1. Congress and the FCC have set a goal to
convert all the nation's 1,600 TV stations to digital by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz said the technology is capable of playing back video at
30 frames per second, about the same quality as standard TV video
and far above the 12-frames-per-second rate now available with the
fastest Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz, a former venture capitalist, said the network would
make TV newscasts or other programming available for playback at
anytime. The technology also would allow consumers to download
digital music videos, CDs or an electronic shopping catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can give you a whole software package in a matter of
seconds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Geocast would not replace Internet connections, which still
would be needed for e-mail and direct contact between the computer
user and Web sites. Online purchases, for example, still would need
an Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the complaints about the Internet is that it's just too
much work to find what you're looking for,'' Horowitz said. ``Now
with the broadcast industry becoming a digital world, there are
opportunities to talk to the PC world.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the idea could succeed though Geocast has many
hurdles to overcome before proving that consumers will feel a
compelling need to buy another electronic box for their computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merging broadcasting with the Net has, in theory, sounded like
the best of both worlds, but in practice, it has proven
difficult,'' said analyst Ross Rubin of Internet research firm
Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Although previous attempts to use analog broadcast frequencies
to beam personalized information like traffic and weather reports
have not succeeded, the digital spectrum is wider and more
flexible, said Rubin, Jupiter's vice president of research.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance with Hearst-Argyle is a key step for Geocast, but
``ultimately, they need more deals like that,'' Rubin said. ``It's
important for them to form cable-network-type deals and also strong
partnerships with leading online properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst-Argyle has two stations in Sacramento, Calif., and one in
Monterey, Calif., but none in the San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Geocast's financial backing is ``impressive,'' Rubin said. But,
he added, ``even the best venture capitalists make some bad bets.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study showed that computer users were spending more
time online and less time watching television.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our target audience,'' Horowitz said. Geocast could
help broadcasters ``recapture some of that market.''

<HEADLINE>
CHIEF OF AT&AMP;T'S CABLE TV OPERATION QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the most significant executive departure from AT&AMP;T
since C. Michael Armstrong took over as the company's chairman in
1997, AT&AMP;T announced Wednesday that Leo J. Hindery Jr., chief
executive of AT&AMP;T's cable television operation, had decided to
leave the company.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery, 51, is a longtime media and cable television executive
and his departure throws the first major wrinkle into AT&AMP;T's plan
to use cable television systems across the nation to offer
consumers communications baskets of interactive television,
high-speed Internet access and local and long-distance telephone
service. The unit that was led by Hindery is spending billions of
dollars to upgrade cable lines, retrain employees and develop the
complex computer systems needed to offer such a variety of
services.
</P>
<P>
   As the former president of Tele-Communications Inc., the big
cable provider that AT&AMP;T agreed to acquire last year, Hindery
enhanced AT&AMP;T's credibility in the sometimes-clannish cable
industry, which is dominated by a mere handful of companies, many
family-controlled.
</P>
<P>
   While Hindery and AT&AMP;T publicly described the move as amicable,
many analysts, investors and executives close to the company said
that Hindery, with his hard-driving, anti-bureaucratic manner, had
developed an irrevocable personality conflict with Armstrong, who
is more measured in his management style. While it is not totally
clear whether Hindery was encouraged to step down, or, in the words
of one investor, ``simply couldn't take it anymore,'' analysts and
executives said his departure was clearly related to the mutual
frustration between Hindery and Armstrong, though the two agreed on
most substantive matters of strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The role of maintaining AT&AMP;T's stature within the cable
fraternity will now fall largely on Amos B. Hostetter, who helped
put together AT&AMP;T's deal to acquire Mediaone Group Inc., another
leading cable carrier, earlier this year. Hostetter is chairman of
AT&AMP;T's cable operation and a member of AT&AMP;T's board.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said Wednesday that he would spend more time at the cable
unit's headquarters in Denver to help develop strategy and maintain
relations with other cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   John Malone, the former chairman of TCI and another titan in the
cable business, is also on AT&AMP;T's board.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T chief financial officer Daniel E. Somers was tapped to
assume Hindery's day-to-day role on an interim basis. AT&AMP;T has
commissioned an outside search for Hindery's permanent replacement,
though it is remotely possible that Somers, who before joining AT&AMP;T
in 1997 was chairman of Bell Cablemedia PLC, a cable operator in
Britain, could keep the job.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T controller Nicholas Cyprus will assume Somers' financial
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery is known as an innovative, fast-moving deal maker. While
at TCI, he helped reshape the cable industry by swapping cable
systems to create big ``clusters'' that could be operated with
lower costs and by striking joint ventures with other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and executives said that perhaps Hindery was not
the best fit as AT&AMP;T, a famously regimented organization, moved
beyond acquiring cable operations and began the dull but vital work
of integrating the cable unit into the larger AT&AMP;T structure.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the world of Leo; he accomplished what almost nobody
else has ever done, which is reconfigure the cable industry,'' said
Jessica Reif Cohen, the lead cable analyst for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
``Personality-wise, I don't think that anyone would be surprised
that he left AT&AMP;T. I think the only surprise is the timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Comcast Corp. president Brian Roberts said, ``Leo emerged as one
of the leaders, if not the leader, the last several years and has
accomplished so much to position this industry for the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Hindery did not seem to think that
news of his departure would come as a huge surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike and I came to the conclusion that I wasn't going to stay
forever and against that backdrop this seemed to be the most
thoughtful way to move forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to AT&AMP;T, it became clear that
Hindery was not going to spend the rest of his career with the
company, not because he and Armstrong disagreed on the fundamental
direction of AT&AMP;T's cable business, but because they disagreed on
the manner and pace they should employ.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, both Hindery and Armstrong appear to agree that
high-speed Internet access to AT&AMP;T's cable systems should be opened
beyond the current monopoly enjoyed by the Excite(AT)Home Corp. But
while Hindery tried to negotiate a side deal with Yahoo, the Web
portal, and openly criticized the merger of the Excite Web portal
and the At Home cable modem venture, Armstrong preferred a less
confrontational approach.
</P>
<P>
   While there did not appear to be one precipitating incident that
led to Hindery's departure, media executives and people close to
AT&AMP;T pointed to two recent episodes that highlighted, and perhaps
increased, the conflict between Hindery and Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Tuesday, news reports emerged that AT&AMP;T's cable unit
had agreed to buy up to 3 million set-top boxes from General
Instrument Corp. and Motorola Inc. in a deal worth as much as $1
billion. The problem, the executives said, was that Armstrong
learned about the deal from the news accounts. No one at AT&AMP;T is
allowed to spend more than $100 million without explicit approval
from the board, the executives said, and Hindery had appeared to
ignore AT&AMP;T's internal authorization process before making a deal
with the two equipment makers. The deal has not been publicly
acknowledged by AT&AMP;T and the executives said they were unsure if
AT&AMP;T was legally obligated to go through with it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Wednesday, Hindery appeared to issue a flat denial to a
reporter that AT&AMP;T was in discussions about breaking up
Excite(AT)Home or changing AT&AMP;T's relationship with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Hindery told Reuters. ``There have been no
discussions under way whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   But less than 24 hours later, AT&AMP;T issued an official statement
essentially repudiating Hindery, saying that discussions were
proceeding. According to people close to AT&AMP;T, the company's legal
and communications departments were livid that Hindery might have
misled investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leo was used to saying, `I speak for a company and I make the
decisions,' '' one senior media executive said Wednesday. ``He
could never bring himself to say, `I have to check with Mike, I
have to go see.' ''

 &HT;    CARE seeks political fix in Sudan
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For decades, CARE, the international relief agency
founded in the aftermath of World War II, assiduously avoided any
involvement in politics or policy.
</P>
<P>
   The job of relief workers, after all, was to feed the hungry and
house the homeless. Not for them the labyrinthine ways of lobbying
or the perils of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   CARE officials have come to the conclusion that the horrendous
suffering in the African nation of Sudan _ where cycles of civil
war and famine have killed about 2 million people over the past 16
years and displaced 4 million _ can never end without a political
solution. And so they have taken a deep breath and plunged headlong
into the unfamiliar waters of advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our advocacy strategy came out of our experience with the
famine,'' said Peter Bell, president of CARE USA, who returned last
week from a lobbying trip to Sudan, where the current cease-fire is
to expire Oct. 15. ``The only way we could really provide support
for these cycles of famine and humanitarian emergencies was if we
worked on the root cause of these crises, which is the war.''
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying campaign, which began evolving a year ago, has
risen to a new pitch in recent weeks. In mid-September, Bell and
leaders of 10 other nongovernmental relief organizations met with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other U.S. government
officials, including the assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, Susan Rice; Harry Johnston, President Clinton's newly
appointed envoy for Sudanese affairs; and several members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, himself a former deputy undersecretary of health,
education and welfare, acted as spokesman for the coalition of
relief officials, urging Albright to fashion a new U.S. policy
toward Sudan that is more neutral and less antagonistic to the
Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
   According to talking points Bell took to the meeting: ``The U.S.
government seems to look at Sudan primarily through an
anti-terrorist lens. We and our constituents,'' Bell said, speaking
of the relief agencies, ``want the U.S. to look at Sudan through a
humanitarian lens as well, making the achievement of a just peace
its primary objective in dealing with Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell urged that the U.S. government be prepared to help pay for
a peace-keeping force to monitor a comprehensive cease-fire, as a
step toward achieving a permanent peace. And he asked that
``President Clinton personally and publicly indicate the high
priority his administration attaches to ending the Sudan conflict''
by announcing the new policy himself.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, the U.S. government's current policy in
Sudan, which is based on fighting terrorism, is not perceived by
those in the region as neutral.
</P>
<P>
   In August of last year, U.S. warplanes bombed the Al Shiffa
pharmaceutical plant in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, claiming
it was a chemical weapons facility operated by terrorist Osama bin
Laden. Bell said the U.S. government's antipathy toward the
government of Sudan makes it impossible for America to help mediate
a solution to the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Carter supports that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States would be reasonably objective in Sudan,''
Carter said in an interview, ``I think that we at the Carter Center
and the Africans who live in that area could bring peace in Sudan.
But the United States government has a policy of trying to
overthrow the government in Sudan. So whenever there's a peace
initiative, unfortunately our government puts up whatever
obstruction it can.''
</P>
<P>
   And this week, the president of Sudan, Omar el-Bashir, said
Sudanese relations with the United States are ``still tense and
negative'' due to the ``unjust measures'' taken by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Sudan is fueled in part by issues of race and
religion. The government and the northern part of the country _ the
largest in Africa _ are primarily Arab and Islamic. The southern
part of the country, where the rebels control vast areas, is mostly
black and its residents practice Christianity or native religions.
</P>
<P>
   The war has been waged for 16 years. Bell said it cannot be won
by either side and must be mediated to end the cycle of violence
and famine.
</P>
<P>
   From his meeting in Washington, Bell traveled to Kenya, where he
talked with representatives of the Sudanese rebel movement. He flew
also to Khartoum, where he met representatives of the Sudanese
government.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels and government leaders alike expressed a keen interest in
Bell's meeting with Albright. Bell said he could tell them only
that ``I came away with the impression that she was going to
seriously consider our arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bell was not in Africa just to report on his effort to lobby
Albright. He also was there to lobby representatives of the warring
factions. At every stop, he pressed for humanitarian agencies to be
granted greater access to all areas of the country; for a
``broadening and deepening of the current cease-fire''; and,
perhaps most importantly, for all factions to work to achieve a
just and lasting peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stressed in every meeting that this was not a moment just
for nice statements, but for taking concrete actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies have sometimes been criticized for their tendency
to respond to humanitarian crises while ignoring their political
causes. In an interview last year, Michael Maren, who has written a
book critical of such agencies, said humanitarian organizations
such as CARE, which has been involved in Sudan for 20 years, may
have inadvertently prolonged the suffering there.
</P>
<P>
   Maren said some of the food aid they deliver is siphoned off by
the rival armies and that food has helped fuel the long conflict.
``It's possible that this war would not still be going on if it had
not been for all this aid going in over the years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials argue that, when people are starving, there is no
ethical choice other than to feed them. But, at CARE, officials
have concluded that food alone is not enough. If the suffering is
to be eased, advocacy for change is needed, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said his trip, which ended last week, gave him the
impression that people on both sides are ready to talk. What they
need is someone to work to secure peace in a systematic,
step-by-step manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard from everyone that people in Sudan are tired of war,
that they ache for peace,'' he said.

IN A NEW TOWN, GORE HERALDS A NEW DAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Arriving in Tennessee to cut the ribbon on
his headquarters, Vice President Al Gore Wednesday continued his
efforts to put a new face on his presidential campaign, naming a
black woman to his inner circle and promising supporters a
``rip-tootin''' candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The transplanting of his headquarters from Washington's K Street
power corridor to a squat one-story Nashville office building hard
by the railroad tracks _ and a world away from Washington and the
Clinton White House _ was as good a sign as any that change was in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   The chief change is that Gore is now visibly in charge,
directing a campaign that he believes has been crowded for too long
by people with only a halfhearted commitment to his longtime
ambition to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lights!'' the candidate called, squinting into a brilliant
sun, as local television cameras trained on him Wednesday morning
in the parking lot outside his still-empty headquarters, a former
rehabilitation center adjacent to a mound of rubble from nearby
highway construction.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, ``there was perhaps too much caution around him,''
said an aide back in Washington, where members of the campaign
staff were packing boxes to clear out of the old headquarters by
the middle of the month. ``Things were too much by the book. Now
it's 100 percent Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift to Nashville is intended partly to separate those who
can make a full-time commitment by moving here from those whose
family and professional obligations, including work for other
candidates, make them less available to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have absolutely committed yourself, then providence
moves too,'' the vice president told a largely black crowd of about
150 people at the Jubilee Restaurant here after the ribbon-cutting
at the new headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the ``new'' campaign, Gore announced that Donna
Brazile, the deputy campaign manager and national political
director, would be the campaign manager, replacing the departing
Craig Smith, whose duties were largely superseded when Tony Coelho
became campaign chairman in May.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brazile, who becomes the first black woman to manage a
presidential campaign, is one of three top advisers moving from
Washington to Nashville. The others are Coelho and Carter Eskew,
the media strategist. Bob Squier, another media strategist, has
left the campaign because of illness, and Gore has replaced two of
his pollsters, Mark Penn and Celinda Lake, with Harrison Hickman,
who will remain in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has been effusive about shuffling his campaign _ a
redirection that he admits was forced on him by his sag in the
polls _ the staff is in an extreme state of flux. A number of his
aides are still deciding whether to move to Nashville, and more
personnel changes are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore is fiddling with his stump speech. He is
trying to tell voters more about himself, and to make a personal
connection to inspire local Democrats across the country to work on
his behalf. This also includes casting his opponent for the
nomination, Bill Bradley, as a turncoat for leaving the Senate
after the Republicans had assumed control of it and briefly
considering a run for the presidency as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Another matter of preoccupation for Gore's top advisers now is
his effort to win the all-important endorsement of the AFL-CIO,
which is meeting in Los Angeles next week. Before Ms. Brazile and
Coelho move in here, they are headed to Los Angeles, where Coelho
is to meet with James P. Hoffa, president of the teamsters' union,
to try to nail down the federation's backing. Shortly after that,
on Oct. 27, Gore makes a joint appearance with Bradley in New
Hampshire, the first of the primary-election states.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new shift ``is not just about real estate,'' said a Gore
aide, Laura Quinn, who will stay in Washington in the vice
president's office, which is distinct from the campaign office and
is remaining largely intact. ``It's a tactical shift, a strategy
shift, a message shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quinn said that while many on the staff had been surprised
by the decision to move to Nashville, she felt more encouraged
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in today,'' she said, ``and there was a great report
from Peter Ragone in New York, from the political shop on the AFL,
from Michael Whooley in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragone is the campaign's spokesman in New York. Whooley is a
political strategist who moved his family from Boston to Washington
only a month ago to work full time for Gore. Since he will oversee
the campaign in New Hampshire and Iowa, he will be traveling
through early February and so can keep his family in Washington
rather than having to move to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   As of a week ago, when Gore announced his campaign shake-up, he
had about 185 people on the payroll in Washington. Coelho said
about 40 percent of the staff there would move to Nashville. The
move should save some money, aides said, given that prices here are
lower than in the capital, but its primary purpose is to get out of
the Washington mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more than symbolism,'' Coelho said. ``There's a
bonding that comes with it. There won't be the barriers that are
put up in Washington all the time. It's very difficult to run from
the Beltway, because people there have too many other separate
interests and you don't have the connection to the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also has several dozen paid workers in just four
states: 32 in Iowa, whose caucuses in four months kick off the race
in earnest; 30 in New Hampshire; 10 in New York, and four in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brazile will manage these field workers from Nashville. She
has a reputation as a strong organizer, particularly of blacks and
union workers. She also comes with a history of having been removed
from Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign for spreading
unsubstantiated rumors about Dukakis' opponent, Vice President
George Bush. Gore's appointment of her indicates he has little
concern about this. As one aide back in Washington put it:
``Spreading rumors? Holy smokes! In this town?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brazile is former chief of staff to Eleanor Holmes Norton,
the District of Columbia's delegate to Congress, and has overseen
efforts to increase black turnout in congressional campaigns across
the country. ``She earned it,'' Gore said of her appointment.
</P>
<P>
   In another spiritual flight about commitment, Gore pointed to
scripture in explaining why he had chosen Ms. Brazile: ``Whatsoever
thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.''

 &HT;    Euro 2000 berths up for grabs
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This weekend's final Euro 2000 qualifying games have
plenty of significant consequences riding on them. As a result,
UEFA is ordering simultaneous starting times. Five automatic berths
and six playoff spots are still to be determined in what has become
a surprising turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   In Group 5, England needs Sweden to beat Poland in Stockholm on
Saturday to get into next month's eight-team playoff round. France,
the World Cup champion, must beat Iceland in Paris, then hope
Ukraine can topple Russia in Moscow. Ukraine leads Russia and
France by a point in Group 4, but the latter trails by four in goal
differential. In Zagreb, Croatia plays hated rival Yugoslavia,
which leads it in Group 8 by two points. Sandwiched in between is
Ireland, which has a tricky finale at Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Italy needs only to tie at Belarus to win Group 1 over Denmark.
Turkey trails Germany by two points in Group 3 and needs to win in
Munich to avoid a playoff. Israel leads Cyprus by a point for the
playoff berth from Group 6, but both teams hit the road, playing at
group winner Spain and Austria, respectively. Romania is all but
certain to win Group 7 by finishing up at hapless Liechtenstein,
while Portugal could wrap up an automatic bid as the best
second-place team with a win over Hungary in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Scotland got a first-half penalty-kick goal by John
Collins and held on for a 1-0 win over Bosnia-Herzogovina in Group
9 to join Slovenia in the playoffs. Norway, Spain and the Czech
Republic have qualified for the 16-team finals next summer, along
with co-hosts Belgium and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLAND: CHELSEA ROUTS UNITED
</P>
<P>
   Two consecutive draws at home to lowly clubs should have been an
ominous sign for Manchester United. On Sunday, Chelsea quenched a
scoring drought by handing the Premier League champions their worst
loss in three years, a 5-0 drubbing that snapped United's unbeaten
streak in all competitions at 46 matches. Gustavo Poyet had two
goals and high-priced signee Chris Sutton got his first since
transferring from Blackburn. The match was marred by a red card
issued to United's Nicky Butt, who kicked a prostrate Dennis Wise
after a midair collision. Butt claims he was pinched on the leg by
Wise.... Arsenal's Patrick Vieira is facing a long suspension and
hefty fine after spitting on Neil Ruddock of West Ham and abusing a
referee in a 2-1 loss for the Gunners.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: DORTMUND STILL LEADS
</P>
<P>
   Borussia Dortmund maintained a two-point lead in the Bundesliga
with a 3-0 win over Hansa Rostock. Striker Victor Ikpeba, recently
fined $10,000 for complaining about a lack of playing time, was
inserted into the lineup and scored twice.... Youri Djorkaeff had
goals in the 66th and 82nd minutes in Kaiserslautern's 4-2 win over
Unterhaching as the 1997-98 champions began inching out of the
bottom half of the table.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY: LAZIO, MILAN IN THRILLER
</P>
<P>
   If Sunday's 4-4 draw between Lazio and AC Milan is any
indication of what might be in store in Serie A, then it should be
even more spectacular than last season. AC Milan, which edged Lazio
by a point for the title in May, overcame a 3-1 deficit to lead
4-3, thanks to a hat trick from Andriy Shevchenko. But the Roman
club earned a point when Marcelo Salas scored in the 74th
minute.... AS Roma moved into second place behind Inter Milan by
virtue of a 3-1 win at Fiorentina as Cafu had two goals. But the
price was steep. Striker Marco Delvecchio will be out at least four
weeks with a pulled leg muscle, while midfielder Francesco Totti
could miss as much as three weeks with a groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: VALENCIA FINALLY WINS
</P>
<P>
   Preseason favorite Valencia built a 3-0 lead in the first half
Sunday, then hung on, despite holding a man advantage, before
beating Real Madrid 3-2 for its first Primera Division win of the
season. Madrid's Roberto Carlos was sent off for a hand ball in the
penalty box in the first half, and manager John Toshack was tossed
for arguing.... At Barcelona, it doesn't seem to matter who scores
the goals as long as Rivaldo and Patrick Kluivert are involved.
They had a goal apiece, assisting each other in either half, as the
champions easily dominated Valladolid 2-0 to keep their edge on
Rayo Vallecano at the top of the table.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: NECAXA TAKES CUP
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Vazquez scored the winning goal off a rebound in the 66th
minute as shorthanded Necaxa defeated Alajuela of Costa Rica 2-1
Sunday in the finals of the CONCACAF Champions Cup in Las Vegas.
Necaxa, fourth in the current Torneo Invierno, qualifies for the
World Club Championship in Brazil in January.... Guadalajara took a
slim lead in Group 4 of the Torneo Invierno with a 2-1 victory over
Leon on Sunday as Jesus Arellano slammed in a rebound off the post
in the final minute of play.
</P>
<P>
   S. AMERICA: PALERMO TEES OFF
</P>
<P>
   With his transfer to Lazio delayed for three months, Boca
Juniors striker Martin Palermo took out his frustrations on
Gimnasia-Jujuy. He scored his ninth and 10th goals in a 3-1 win.
Palermo, who was to move to Italy this week for a reported $25
million, will have to wait until December, after the Apertura
season is over.... Former Brazilian World Cup coach Mario Zagallo
was fired as coach of lowly Portuguesa after a 1-0 loss Sunday to
league-leading Corinthians.

BLUE CROSS   OF CALIFORNIA SUED FOR IMPROPER SURCHARGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- WellPoint Health Networks Inc.'s Blue Cross of
California subsidiary is being sued by two subscribers who claim
the managed-care provider improperly imposed a 20 percent surcharge
on their premiums, a charge denied by company officials.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks
class-action status on behalf of all subscribers affected by the
change. The suit brought by Michael C. Kirchner and Elizabeth P.
Kirchner, seeks unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which was filed late Tuesday, claims that beginning in
November 1994, Blue Cross' changes to the policies of about 12,000
subscribers led them to pay 20 percent more than others with a
similar policy.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Gianelli, the Kirchners' attorney and a partner with
the Los Angeles-based firm Gianelli &AMP; Morris, said Blue Cross in
the early 1970s sold policies to customers in their 20s promising
an age-related benefit, or slow rate of increase in premiums.
</P>
<P>
   However, five years ago, the health care company moved from
``closed'' to ``open'' blocks of business and began charging the
higher premiums to policy holders who were now in their 50s, said
Gianelli.
</P>
<P>
   With the change in policy came the 20 percent increase in rates.
``They didn't want to honor the old policy that restricted the
amount of premiums the company could charge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an old case that deals with technical legal questions
regarding premiums,'' WellPoint spokesman John Cygul said
Wednesday, refusing to discuss the specific allegations. ``We will
defend ourselves vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   If a jury rules in the Kirchners' favor, Gianelli said, one of
California's largest managed-care providers could owe ``tens of
millions of dollars'' in back premiums.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have faced increased scrutiny in courts nationwide. On
Monday, a lawsuit filed in Miami federal court claimed that
Louisville, Ky.-based Humana Inc. committed fraud by concealing
from its subscribers the way it actually decides to approve
treatments and pay claims.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed on behalf of two Riviera Beach, Fla., police
officers, also seeks class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Thousand Oaks-based WellPoint lost 37.5 cents
Wednesday, falling to $51.6875.

A REGULAR-SEASON WONDER, RANGERS' GREER FIZZLES IN PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
NEW YORK _ The Rangers had a day off in New York yesterday to
ponder their fate in the American League Division Series.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most puzzling for them is how their offense can be so powerful
in the regular season, yet so impotent against the New York
Yankees. An 8-0 loss in Game 1 left them with one run in four
playoff games against the Yankees going back to last year's
Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Rusty Greer may be foremost among the Rangers'
offensive contradictions. He has consistently been one of their
best clutch hitters, with 14 game-winning hits in the Rangers' last
at-bat since the start of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But he has never been a factor in postseason play. He was
0-for-2 with two walks in the opener, dropping him to 3-for-29
overall in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience has been good, but the results have been
lacking, both individual- and team-wise,'' Greer admitted. ``But
you go about your business just like you have all season, relax,
swing the bat and try to hit the ball hard. ... A lot of it is just
being hot at the right time, having a good series and having some
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were hoping to change their luck against the
Yankees. They wanted to be more patient, work counts and get good
pitches to hit. That's part of what makes Greer a good hitter. He
hit .300 this year with 96 walks and 67 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly with what Rusty's done before you expect him to do
well,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``But we need a bunch of
guys to break out, not just Rusty.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer's two walks helped the Rangers get two rallies going early
in Game 1. But Yankees starter Orlando Hernandez worked out of
both, striking out Todd Zeile with the bases loaded in the first
inning, and, with runners at first and second in the third, getting
Juan Gonzalez and Rafael Palmeiro on fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   From that standpoint, Greer did his job by giving the Rangers'
best power hitters a chance to do serious damage. But the Rangers
are a team in desperate need of a clutch hit, an area in which
Greer has so often come through in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm better in 162 games because I try to be
consistent,'' Greer said. ``You have slumps. You're going to have
five games where you're not going to get hits, but you're also
going to have five games where you can redeem yourself. In the
playoffs, it comes down to five games, and, if you're not swinging
the bat well, if they're not falling, you don't have another 100
games to redeem yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers don't have an extended period of time. They must
win tonight or go back to Arlington on the brink of elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rusty will have a good series,'' Rangers general
manager Doug Melvin said. ``I think one of the reasons he's such a
great hitter is that everybody concentrates on other guys and he
kind of sneaks in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now would be a good time.

 &HT;    Detroit not just winging it this year
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Detroit had gone 41 seasons without a Stanley Cup, so
the Red Wings shouldn't have suffered much in parting with it after
winning titles two years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But ``defending champions'' sounds a lot better than ``defending
quarterfinalists.'' In the words of Steve Yzerman, ``Now we're one
of the other guys. It's kind of humbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether humility can be equated with danger is yet to be
determined. The Red Wings, who retain far more talent than
vulnerabilities, play the Thrashers tonight at Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit is 1-1 but has outplayed the two Stanley Cup finalists.
The Red Wings defeated Buffalo 2-0, then lost to Dallas 3-2. Scotty
Bowman's team outshot both foes, 44-22 and 34-14, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Motivation isn't a problem. The same couldn't be said last
season, when a possible two-Cup hangover caused the Red Wings to
start 6-6 and rise and fall often during the season _ no more so
than in the playoffs, when they won four in a row against San Jose
and two against Colorado before losing four to the Avalanche to get
bounced in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players understand the importance of the regular season
now,'' Detroit general manager Ken Holland said. ``Subconsciously,
they thought they were judged on how they did in the playoffs and
not the regular season. That's true to a certain extent. But you
need the 82 games during the year to prepare for the playoffs. The
same inconsistencies we showed in the regular season were evident
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Most hockey teams discount the preseason. Not the Wings. They
went 2-7 in exhibitions last year; this year, they were 7-1-1-0,
with only 14 goals allowed, five in one game. Defense was the
biggest problem last season. It is the primary focus of Bowman,
Holland and the players this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear the players are more committed to doing things as a
team,'' Holland said. ``As you go along, you see if they remain
totally focused. It doesn't guarantee you'll win the Cup but it
certainly gives you a better chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland is feeling the heat as much as anyone else. Just before
the trading deadline last year, he acquired four veterans _
defensemen Chris Chelios and Ulf Samuelsson, winger Wendel Clark
and goalie Bill Ranford _ that he thought would help them win a
third title. But the tenures were short-lived for Samuelsson, an
unrestricted free agent; Clark, who signed with Chicago; and
Ranford, now in Edmonton. Only Chelios remains, and he's 37 and
central to the age concerns on Detroit's roster. If defenseman
Nicklas Lidstrom had not re-signed, the results could have been
disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   In making the deals, Holland mortgaged the future, trading away
a young defenseman and former No. 1 pick Anders Eriksson, two
first-round picks, two seconds and a third.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he is now gun-shy about making a deal, Holland
said, ``Gun-shy's not the right word. I don't anticipate we would
be as aggressive at the trade deadline this year, because we have
to keep an eye on the future. But for the last three or four years,
the thinking has been that the future is now. I would do it all
over again. We had won two straight Stanley Cups, and we had a
chance to make our mark on history. Over time, you've only got so
many bullets. To not sacrifice a little to try to win the Cup
would've been wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit made no significant changes this year _ except perhaps
in attitude.

 &HT;    Keep insults at 19th hole
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has been 11 days since the Ryder Cup ended, and the
whining is still audible from the other side of the pond.
</P>
<P>
   Puh-leeze.
</P>
<P>
   Do we need to even mention that Europeans get killed watching
soccer games?
</P>
<P>
   Or that the Europeans originated tacky behavior at the Ryder
Cup, cheering missed putts by Americans and making a mockery of
sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Or that European fans were poking umbrellas through fences at
the Belfry in England in 1993, trying to trip American players as
they walked past.
</P>
<P>
   Or that every time Sergio Garcia made a putt at Brookline, he
danced as though a hornet had come to rest in his BVD's.
</P>
<P>
   And consider the fact that the Europeans played so slowly, it
was beginning to look as if Y2K could become a factor.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the celebration at the 17th hole at Brookline after
Justin Leonard's monster putt probably was not the right thing to
do. But the Europeans, given the same set of circumstances on their
home field, probably would have done the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Did the celebration affect the outcome? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of people being in Jose Maria Olazabal's
putting line, Tom Lehman was so far away from it, he almost fell
into a bunker trying to get to Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   What was bad about the celebration?
</P>
<P>
   The wives, girlfriends and hangers-on who followed the ecstatic
players toward Leonard. Next time, the PGA of America has hinted,
they won't be allowed inside the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   What was good about the celebration for the Europeans? It
conveniently deflected the real issue of the day, which was that
Europe, after the biggest two-day lead in the history of the Ryder
Cup, managed the worst collapse in sports since 1964, when the
Philadelphia Phillies blew a 6 1/2-game lead in two weeks and lost
the National League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Let's blame the European tabloid media for some of the cover-up.
Nearly every post-match question concerned the Americans'
celebration. Tabloid reporters, noted for heartless ``choking dog''
accusations, instead attacked American behavior they felt
intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   While golf fans should celebrate that the Ryder Cup controversy
created incredible interest in their sport smack in the middle of
baseball pennant races and college football season, unfortunately,
two separate issues have been lumped together. The celebration was
one thing. Fan rowdiness is another.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that fans now yell things at golf tournaments that in
the past might have been limited to, say, Giants Stadium, was a
problem for both teams. Colin Montgomerie was a favorite target,
but David Duval and Davis Love III also were razzed by fans.
</P>
<P>
   American golf fans have become an embarrassment, and that's a
legitimate beef for the Euros. The PGA of America, PGA Tour and
U.S. Golf Association need to start expelling fans at the first
insult, not after a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine an insult yelled at Justin Leonard just as he prepared
to strike that historic putt. Or at Olazabal a moment later.
</P>
<P>
   That truly would be a shame.

 &HT;    Rider arrives in camp after case of cold feet
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ In a rambling, often puzzling series of
statements, Isaiah Rider tried to explain Wednesday why he was late
to the Hawks' training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Rider said his two-day tardiness was because he did not want to
play for a rebuilding team, was concerned about his future
free-agent status, had decided that he had wanted to be traded but
changed his mind and did not have a real excuse for arriving late.
</P>
<P>
   Rider, fined about $15,000, met with general manager Pete
Babcock and later with coach Lenny Wilkens, both of whom had
expressed their disappointment in the player's unexcused absence.
</P>
<P>
   Rider said he was ready to go to work because both men had
allayed his fears.
</P>
<P>
   The former Minnesota and Portland player, obtained in August
with Jim Jackson for fellow guards Steve Smith and Ed Gray,
expressed great optimism a few days after the trade but said the
euphoria of a fresh start faded as his personal anxiety grew. Rider
did not say anything about his failure to contact management about
his agitated condition or why he did not return Babcock's frequent
telephone calls. ``I became discouraged by what was written at home
and (in Atlanta),'' he said but would not be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought that the Hawks could not win, he said, ``I'm
optimistic; I'm not a negative person. But we're not as good as
Portland. I feel like we have a dominant big man, good, quick point
guard coming in, good forwards and some new guards now. I think we
have a better chance of winning now that I've talked to Lenny than
I did three or four weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   With free agency a year away, he said he knew he had no clout.
``I thought I don't have much leverage, but I'd rather go to a team
that's, you know, competing in the last year of my contract rather
than a rebuilding team. But I feel a lot better about it now. I
have to go in with a positive attitude. I'm not a loser. Even in
Minnesota they said Rider played hard, (that) he led that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider also said, ``I'm an emotional guy. There were some tears
shed (in the meetings). I want to win. I'm not concerned with
shooting a lot, and it felt good to hear where they were coming
from, and I think it made them feel good to hear some of my
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider said his arrival was delayed last week by unspecified
legal issues that were resolved Friday. He said he could have flown
from San Francisco to Atlanta on Sunday in time for Monday's
mandatory meetings but did not do so. He said he did fly overnight
Monday and arrived in Atlanta at 7 a.m. Tuesday in time for a
connecting flight here. However, he said, ``I don't fly
crop-dusters. Anyone who knows me can tell you that. I saw this
30-, 40-seat plane and I wasn't getting on it. Those planes crash
and kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the plane Rider refused to board was either a 50-seat
jet or 66-seat prop plane, both operated by Delta. He did not
arrive here until midmorning Wednesday, by car. He arrived at the
UT-Chattanooga arena about 11 a.m. after former NBA referee Ken
Hudson picked him up at the team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Rider met briefly with Babcock and took a physical that cleared
him for the team's evening practice. Before taking Rider to the
arena, Hudson said, ``I gave him a good talking to, sort of brother
to brother. That's why he didn't get here sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   But the often-troubled Rider said he did not feel better about
the situation until he met with Wilkens on Wednesday afternoon and
fully understood his role as a primary weapon on a team that feels
good about its chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how strong they felt about that. I thought I
would be thrown to the wolves, or I would play hard and then I
would be left out there at the end of this year and I would rather
play for a winning squad than average 25 and not do well and my
stock still goes down. I do know now that they want me to be a big
part of this team, so I will work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider, for all of his past problems, showed dedication to
winning last season with Portland. After averaging 18.5 points per
game his first five years in the league, he accepted a reduced rule
and averaged 13.9, and the Trail Blazers advanced to the Western
Conference finals before San Antonio swept them.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks president Stan Kasten was pragmatic about Rider's absence.
On Monday, Kasten said, ``J.R. will come in, he'll play his 2,600,
2,800 minutes, and then he'll sign a contract with us next
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said that Rider was told Wednesday that he will have
that opportunity and that his performance and his behavior will
determine whether the organization would like to have him back.
</P>
<P>
   If the Hawks choose not to keep Rider at the end of this season,
they will shed $5.4 million in salary cap money. With four players
in the final years of their contracts _ Rider, Bimbo Coles,
LaPhonso Ellis and Anthony Johnson _ the Hawks will have the option
of dropping more than $10 million from their payroll next summer
and going under the league salary cap, which will exceed $36
million.

REAGAN MEMOIRIST DEFENDS UNCONVENTIONAL METHOD OF CHRONICLING
PRESIDENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edmund Morris, whose memoir of President Reagan's
life threads fiction through fact, began a 14-city tour on
Wednesday night promoting a book that has provoked fascination and
scorn.
</P>
<P>
   Morris opened his tour at the Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstore across
from Lincoln Center, penetrating deep into overwhelmingly
Democratic territory to talk about his unconventional manner of
chronicling the life of a most Republican president.
</P>
<P>
   He was received warmly by a standing-room-only crowd of about
200 people, who listened intently as he shared anecdotes about ``a
consummate actor'' who was a master at using ``charm to garner
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, a member of Random House's stable of accomplished
writers, received a Pulitzer Prize in 1980 for his biography of
Theodore Roosevelt. Handpicked by Reagan's staff, he was granted
enviable access in the hope that he would produce the definitive
text on an often opaque man.
</P>
<P>
   Definitive or no, the text he produced has seeded a news media
storm.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' went on sale
last week. It includes a fictional character, modeled loosely after
Morris himself, who encounters Reagan repeatedly through life. In
one section, this character edits Reagan's prose for the sports
pages of a college newspaper; in another, he reports to a young Lt.
Reagan while serving in the Army Air Force; in the end, he leads
the ailing former president back to his place of birth.
</P>
<P>
   By imposing an imaginary character on a work of nonfiction, the
biography of a president no less, Morris has raised questions about
what readers can trust in his work, about Random House's commitment
to longstanding standards, and about the hazy lines at which
celebrity legend meets historical fact.
</P>
<P>
   Morris offered a polished defense of his methods on Wednesday
night. He said: ``All I ask of the readers of this book is that you
accept, in the early chapters, the presence of a spectator. Maybe a
better word would be a projector.
</P>
<P>
   ``My projector projects a documentary which is absolutely true
to historical fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Random House, which advanced Morris $3 million, is anticipating
brisk sales. It augmented the initial press run of 300,000 with
another 75,000 copies before the first copy of ``Dutch'' was sold.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing giant is also standing behind Morris' work. Its
corporate Web site describes the author's fictions as ``a unique
literary method'' in which Morris' ``biographical mind becomes in
effect another character in the narrative.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent reviews have ranged from praise to contempt,
although the negative reactions stand out for the sharpness of
their disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times that Morris had
squandered priceless access to a sitting president, and written not
a biography but a ``cloying, egocentric novel.'' Writing in The
Wall Street Journal, Peggy Noonan, a former Reagan speechwriter,
described ``Dutch'' as a ``belly-flop into the pools of
Narcissus.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Perry, a spokesman for Random House, said criticism had
split between ``book people,'' who had reviewed ``Dutch'' warmly,
and historians and journalists troubled by the book's fictions.
</P>
<P>
   Perry brushed aside suggestions of an erosion in Random House's
standards. ``I think that's just absurd,'' he said. ``The book is
just too good.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Morris took his case directly to potential
readers.
</P>
<P>
   The customers seemed compelled to attend on Wednesday night, if
only because of an enduring curiosity over Reagan's idiosyncratic
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Morris satisfied their inquisitiveness, describing a president
who occasionally displayed ``astonishing ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was convinced that trees caused acid rain, threatening the
entire industrial Northeast,'' he said, to chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' tour continues during the next five weeks with signings
in San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Chicago and
elsewhere. He returns to New York for an Oct. 23 signing at the the
Henry Luce Foundation in Manhattan, and finishes the tour on Nov.
14 at Bookends in Ridgewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Gilligan, Bookends' store manager, said Wednesday that
ever since Morris was criticized, sales have been hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love an underdog,'' Gilligan said. ``Friday, Saturday
and Sunday, we sold the heck out of the book. The book was blah
until then.''

EUROPEANS SEEK A LITTLE REVENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most years the Alfred Dunhill Cup helps wrap up
the European Tour season, a feel-good event featuring three-man
teams representing 16 countries. Everybody plays for national pride
and a $1.5 million purse.
</P>
<P>
   But almost nobody notices.
</P>
<P>
   Not so this year. Thanks to the sniping at the Ryder Cup last
month, the tone of the proceedings should be different and some
matches less jovial.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery ringing the Old Course at St. Andrews Fife,
Scotland, might be a little more rowdy. And the press may be poised
for some more American bashing.
</P>
<P>
   Seems that the Ryder Cup left the continent with a hangover that
just won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   So when the American team of Mark O'Meara, Tom Lehman and Payne
Stewart arrived in Scotland for the matches, which feature 10
members of the European team and its captain, Mark James, they
found that the British media has a collective memory a lot longer
than Justin Leonard's winning putt.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, Lehman, Stewart and O'Meara will probably
march to the driving range with less of a swagger, not wanting to
incite the locals to riot.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman especially is treading lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Torrance, assistant captain of the European team, had
described Lehman's behavior as disgusting after Sunday's final
Ryder Cup round, which the Americans won in decisive fashion. They
celebrated the same way, too.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a contrite Lehman who addressed reporters this week on
the eve of this cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better place to come and set things straight than St.
Andrews,'' he told the Associated Press.``It's of concern to me
that my reputation has been somewhat damaged. I never walked on
anybody's line. I'm not a monster. I'm not a rogue. I'm not a
hooligan.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman has discussed the situation with Torrance and written
letters to others involved in the snit. And the British press did
acknowledge the gracious behavior of Stewart and O'Meara in
victory.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend we'll find out what British golf fans think.
</P>
<P>
   The cup runs over: The PGA of America will pick a new Ryder Cup
captain before year's end. Part-time tour player and television
commentator Curtis Strange is on the short list.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard would not mind seeing Strange in charge. He's also got
the backing of Davis Love III.
</P>
<P>
   But the insightful commentary by Johnny Miller during this
year's event suggests he'd be a good captain, too. Trouble is, some
tour pros might not want to play for Miller after his pointed
comments.
</P>
<P>
   And if the furor over the conduct of the fans and American team
doesn't die down, maybe the PGA should look for someone with
diplomatic credentials. Maybe Henry Kissinger or former President
Jimmy Carter could fit the captain's job into their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to America: Spain's Sergio Garcia might just develop a
rivalry with Tiger Woods after all. Garcia, the runner-up to Woods
in the PGA Championship, will split his time between the European
and PGA tours next year. He doesn't know which one will get most of
his attention but both tours will be the better for it.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia will compete in the annual Skins game with defending
champion O'Meara, Stewart and David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Senior skins: The original skins _ Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus,
Tom Watson and Gary Player _ will reunite for a special millennium
celebration in the 2000 Senior Skins Game. The $600,000 event will
be Super Bowl weekend at the Mauna Lani Resort on the Big Island of
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, Nicklaus, Watson and Player were featured in the
inaugural Skins Game in 1983. Player won the first title, pocketing
$150,000 with a four-foot putt on the 17th hole.
</P>
<P>
   The same four were paired again in 1984 with Nicklaus taking
that title, winning $249,000.
</P>
<P>
   LPGA sets L.A. date: The LPGA has scheduled its special-events
calendar and the first quarter of 2000. The Los Angeles Women's
Championship is set for Feb. 11-13 at Wood Ranch Golf Club in Simi
Valley. The tournament is moving from Oakmont Country Club in
Glendale.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ask June Shockency, a sergeant-at-arms in
California's Republican Party, what she thinks of Elizabeth Dole,
and her face brightens: ``intelligent, outgoing, warm,'' she says.
But ask Mrs. Shockency about Mrs. Dole's message the last time she
heard her speak, and there is a pause. ``I really can't remember,''
she finally says.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, Mrs. Dole surprised campaign watchers, many of
whom had declared her presidential bid a model of lost
opportunities, by placing a strong third in the Iowa straw poll.
And since then, she has crisscrossed the country, drawing
enthusiastic crowds familiar with the Dole name and intrigued by
the first woman to make a viable bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, her campaign remains something of a puzzle
to outsiders. Although national polls show her running second to
George W. Bush, she has been able to raise only about a tenth of
the money he has collected.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, her campaign has lost three top advisers, including
two spokesmen who left in the last month. The personnel changes
have lent her campaign an air of turmoil, turning routine matters
like obtaining her schedule into exercises in tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   Recent days have seen a wave of speculation that her
fund-raising problems would soon force her to drop out of the race.
And even avid supporters have taken to touting Mrs. Dole as a fine
choice _ for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard go for us,'' Tom Daffron, Mrs. Dole's
campaign manager, said recently with some understatement. ``There's
no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest challenge these days is turning the
curiosity of voters like Mrs. Shockency into support. And in a
series of campaign appearances over the past couple of weeks, many
voters seemed intrigued by her candidacy, but few declared outright
that they would vote for her.
</P>
<P>
   Known for carefully rehearsing speeches down to her trademark
catch in the throat, Mrs. Dole cuts an equally meticulous figure
before voters and donors, with outfits matched down to the polish
on her fingernails. She couches her pitch in a heavy dose of
Southern charm, still carrying the lilt of her native Salisbury,
N.C., and speaks of restoring the values of an earlier era.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we worked to eliminate the federal deficit,'' she said
in a recent address, ``we have done little to eliminate the deficit
that exists in our basic American values: honesty, integrity,
personal responsibility, civility, and respect for our fellow
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Her staff adamantly rejects speculation the she might be the
next Republican to drop out of the race. And until recently her
aides have maintained that Mrs. Dole was deliberately holding off
on taking policy stands so early in the primary race and focusing
instead on building a broad base of support.
</P>
<P>
   But wounded by the speculation, she appears ready to strike a
newly aggressive stance. On Thursday she will outline a tough
anti-drug policy at the Mexican border, and on Friday she will
strike at the home state of Sen. John McCain, with a fund-raising
luncheon in Phoenix. ``I'm out there running hard, working hard,''
she said Wednesday in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   With Republican Party faithful lining up behind Bush of Texas,
Mrs. Dole's strategy aims to stay in the race as the strongest
alternative should Bush fall, gathering in Republicans,
particularly women, who have traditionally remained outside the
political process. ``Her strength is her grass roots appeal,'' said
Kathleen Harrington, deputy campaign manager for Mrs. Dole.
</P>
<P>
   When asked their impressions, people say they look favorably
upon Mrs. Dole, a former president of the American Red Cross, whose
husband was the party's presidential candidate in 1996. But surveys
of voter intentions show her steadily slipping behind the Bush
juggernaut. One recent nationwide survey, by CNN-Gallup-USA Today,
shows Bush with 62 percent support among Republican voters, and
Mrs. Dole with 10 percent, down from 16 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican hopefuls remain in the single digits, but some,
like McCain have been gaining visibility, buoyed by an aggressive
campaign and a newly published memoir. McCain, who sat out the Iowa
straw poll, raised $3 million in the last three months, while Mrs.
Dole's fund-raisers, raised half that much during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole has so far avoided the thrust and parry of battle with
other candidates. Famous for her meticulous planning, she shies
away from press conferences or interviews with reporters she does
not know, and she has remained largely absent from the
rough-and-tumble political talk show circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's back in the pack and she's going to have to do something
to get noticed,'' said Martin P. Wattenberg, a political science
professor specializing in presidential politics at the University
of California at Irvine. Mrs. Dole, he said, ``has to have a catch,
and it has to be something more than `I'm a woman.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In her speeches, Mrs. Dole always acknowledges the historic
nature of her candidacy, but says she does not want people voting
for her because of her gender. She advocates building up the
country's nuclear defense, tighter border surveillance to stop
drugs from Mexico, and increasing local control over schools. She
supports the use of school vouchers, which would allow parents of
children in failing public schools using public funds to switch
their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole reminds voters that polls show her a consistent second
behind Bush, capable of beating either Al Gore or Bill Bradley in a
two-way race, and she sells herself as an experienced hand at
government who advocates traditional values. Her heaviest applause
comes when Mrs. Dole discusses an issue that actually has little to
do with the presidency: discipline in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed,'' said Frank Long, a training technologist at
Carolina Eastman, a chemical company in Columbia, S.C., where Mrs.
Dole spoke to about 200 workers last week. But Long said he wanted
to hear other candidates before deciding his vote.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, speaking to the Christian Coalition in Washington,
Mrs. Dole delivered her call for old-fashioned values with more
steel than ever before. She said that while America enjoyed a
budget surplus, it was suffering a deficit in moral values, and she
called for posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong that our children are not allowed a silent moment
of prayer in school, that a constitutional amendment is necessary
to ensure a child's right to pray,'' she told the Coalition. ``And
it is right that we protect the sanctity of life, that we replace
abortion with adoption, require parental notification, and that we
continue the ban on federal funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides say that Mrs. Dole has strong ideas about the
type and pace of campaign that she wants to run. She insists any
important communication from her staff come to her in writing.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   A strategy paper from her campaign, disclosed to The New York
Times by a person close to her campaign, says a ``shooting war''
against the front-runner is far better left to Steve Forbes, while
Mrs. Dole should focus on doing well in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Winning Iowa's primary would give Mrs. Dole a 15 to 20 point
``bounce'' to bolster her showing in New Hampshire a week later and
build momentum going into South Carolina, staffers say. After
August's straw poll in Iowa, Mrs. Dole surged from fourth to second
place among New Hampshire voters, said Ms. Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We captured that bounce,'' Ms. Harrington said, ``and we've
been able to translate it into organizational strength in South
Carolina.'' While Republican governors across the nation have
already rallied behind Bush, the early primary states have
Democratic governors, another advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Sinclair, a political scientist at the University of
California at Los Angeles, said a cautious campaign so early made
some sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have rivals and the media hitting the candidates if they
don't say anything, and if they say the wrong thing, they can
easily get killed before the public ever starts paying attention,''
Ms. Sinclair said. ``You've got to at least be able to arrive at
the point where people pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign watchers, though, said that with the race coalescing so
quickly, Mrs. Dole should aim for greater visibility now, not
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strategy of ambiguity is more common when candidates have
reason to believe people already like them,'' said Larry Bartels,
author of ``Presidential Primaries and the Dynamics of Public
Choice.'' ``It's hard to get people's attention without saying
something more substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest Mrs. Dole has not appeared hungry enough for the
job. ``She doesn't want to go for the brass ring,'' said Frank J.
Luntz, a Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   After some early gaffes discussing issues like abortion and drug
control, Mrs. Dole has shunned press conferences, opting instead
for brief appearances before reporters, usually after her speeches.
These typically end when an unwelcome question pops up. Mrs. Dole
glances at her nearest aide, who instantly announces, ``Okay. Last
question.''
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, her aides said she was too busy to be
interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   At fund-raising dinners, Mrs. Dole tells donors that she could
obviously not hope to match Bush in fund raising, but requires just
enough to stay in the race. Daffron noted that Mrs. Dole and Bush
shared similar bases of support. When one rises in popularity, the
other falls. ``To the extent that he stumbles, we are the
alternative,'' Daffron said.
</P>
<P>
   One campaign official appeared perplexed that Bush emerged
unscathed after questions arose about whether he used cocaine as a
young man, and his service in the Texas Air National Guard during
the Vietnam War. ``He so far just seems to be a Teflon candidate,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, including those throwing the $500-a-plate dinners
for Mrs. Dole, increasingly speak of her as a potential candidate
for vice president. As the last guests sauntered out of Richard and
Pamela Scurry's penthouse on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan recently,
Scurry said he knew it was a ``long shot'' to bet on Mrs. Dole
becoming the next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``But vice president?'' he asked. ``I don't think that's a long
shot at all.'' This month's Mirabella, a woman's magazine,
headlined it's story on Mrs. Dole's bid, ``Vice Can Be Nice.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as strategists are quick to point out this year, even vice
takes work.

 &HT;    Spurrier turns down LSU's jersey request
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Leave it to Steve Spurrier, Florida's irrepressible
coach, to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   While folks in Gatorland were lamenting Florida's defense,
shredded in a 40-39 overtime loss to Alabama on Saturday, the media
turned its attention to a letter Spurrier wrote to LSU coach Gerry
DiNardo, copies of which were ``accidentally'' faxed to Louisiana
media members this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, dated Jan. 14, Spurrier informed DiNardo that
Florida would not honor LSU's request to wear its traditional white
jerseys for Saturday's game in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   LSU likes to wear white at home, but by NCAA rules, the home
team must wear dark jerseys unless the visiting team agrees to
switch.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Spurrier agreed to wear blue jerseys at Baton
Rouge, and the Gators, ranked No. 1, lost 28-21. Spurrier thought
his team was treated poorly during that trip. In the letter, he
wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the nasty, vulgar treatment our team received from
LSU fans during our last visit to Baton Rouge, we have decided that

   When asked about it after practice Monday, Spurrier did not back

<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can get LSU talking nasty about us. That makes

CRUISE INDUSTRY GETS TOUGH LECTURE AT SENATE HEARING

 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain warned the cruise industry
Wednesday that Congress might restrict its access to American ports
unless the companies did a better job of abiding by United States
laws and insuring the safety of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce,
Science and Transportation as well as a Republican presidential
candidate, said at a committee hearing that he was appalled by
cruise ships' continuing violations of environmental laws and by
sexual assaults aboard the ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a credibility problem right now,'' the senator told
Cynthia Colenda, president of the International Council of Cruise
Lines, the Washington trade group for the 17 foreign-registered
cruise companies that dominate the industry in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Colenda responded by saying the industry had taken several
steps in recent months to improve compliance with environmental
regulations and insure that sexual assaults and other crimes aboard
ships are reported to the proper law-enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   While the cruise industry is booming, its performance on safety,
security and environmental matters is coming under scrutiny in
Congress. On Thursday, the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation will
hold a hearing to examine two recent fires aboard Carnival Cruise
Lines ships and the industry's overall record in security and
environmental compliance.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of articles over the last year, The New York Times
has documented cruise lines' efforts to cover up reports of sexual
assaults aboard ship and their record of repeated violations of
federal environmental law.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's chiding of the industry Wednesday was particularly
stinging because it came at a hearing on legislation he has
introduced to increase access to U.S. ports by foreign-flagged
cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   The Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886, intended to protect
the American shipping industry, requires that ships going from one
U.S. port to another be U.S.-flagged and U.S.-built and have an
American crew. To comply with the law, foreign-flagged cruise ships
sailing out of U.S. ports must stop at a foreign port before
returning to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the requirement has been felt particularly on the
West Coast. For instance, instead of embarking from San Diego for
their cruises along the coast of Mexico, ships leave from Ensenada,
Mexico, some 75 miles to the south. As a result, a coalition of
ports and tourism groups has pushed to abolish or alter the 1886
law, to increase use of U.S. ports.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's bill would create a two-pronged exemption.
Foreign-flagged cruise ships would be allowed limited access to
U.S. routes until Dec. 31, 2006, and American companies could buy
foreign-built cruise ships and re-flag them as United States
vessels to help stimulate an American cruise industry.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who is
co-sponsoring the bill, acknowledged at the hearing that prospects
for passage were already slim, because of opposition from
Democrats, some labor unions and operators of smaller American
cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain cautioned the bill's proponents that any chance of
passage depended on erasing the impression that foreign vessels
ignore United States laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts our efforts,'' he said, ``if these kinds of
violations of law continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the senator said, such violations increase the chances
that Congress will act in the opposite way, adding to the
restrictions that are already law.

 &HT;    Oxendine gets a start, but Chandler
 &HT;    still `doubtful'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons still aren't sure, but Tony Graziani could
start at quarterback Sunday at New Orleans. The start would be
Graziani's second in a row and third in the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler's role in practice was limited Wednesday because
of his strained right hamstring. ``I would say he is doubtful,''
coach Dan Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   The definite news is at running back. Second-year pro Ken
Oxendine, like Graziani a former seventh-round draft choice, will
become the third player to start there this season.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Hanspard, who passed Oxendine on the depth chart after an
encouraging preseason, is battling left knee problems again.
Hanspard also sprained his right shoulder Sunday against Baltimore,
when he had 20 yards on 14 carries in a 19-13 overtime loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoulder is bothering him, as well as the knee,'' Reeves
said. ``Until he gets healthy, it is very difficult for any running
back. Kenny has got to be ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine has carried 13 times for 33 yards, a 2.5-yard average.
The 6-foot, 230-pounder rushed 18 times for 50 yards as a rookie
but lost a fumble on his first pro carry at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' said Oxendine, whose greatest
claim to fame as a player at Virginia Tech was rushing for 150
yards and catching passes for another 60 yards in an Orange Bowl
loss to Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``All through high school and college, you're always trying to
become the starter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the final preseason game of 1998, Hanspard tore the anterior
cruciate ligament and the patella tendon in his left knee against
the Bengals. Some described the injury as career-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared to be strong in the preseason, and in the last
exhibition, a 28-16 win at Cincinnati, he had 69 yards and two
touchdowns on 11 carries, including a 43-yard scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves said Monday that Hanspard lacked the quickness and
elusiveness that marked his rookie season of '97, when he rushed 53
times for 355 yards, a 6.3-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he has 53 carries again, but for 155 yards, a
2.9-yard average. Atlanta's rushing offense is averaging 71.5 yards
per game, which is 29th in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard has been bothered recently by swelling, discomfort and
stiffness in his left knee. When he visited an orthopedist, the
doctor flexed his knee to break up scar tissue that was tightening
the joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sore. Everything is fine,'' Hanspard said. ``I've done
my best. If they're not pleased with that, then I can't do anything
about that. I'm going to support whoever is at running back.''

HENNINGER FLATS AS GOOD AS GOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT PURDUE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pining for an evergreen escape from the heat and
the clattering din of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Relief is tantalizingly close if you possess the thigh muscles
and lung power to ascend to Henninger Flats from Eaton Canyon
County Park. Perched on the south-facing slopes of the San Gabriel
Mountains high above smog-shrouded Altadena, Henninger Flats is a
verdant oasis of cool pines and cedars encircled by the pungent
brittleness of Southern California chaparral.
</P>
<P>
   It's 3.7 miles from Eaton to Eden (7.4 miles round-trip), though
you'll have to earn your ticket to paradise by making a
calf-cramping elevation gain of 1,640 feet. Along the way, you'll
also be switchbacking into a unique chapter of L.A. history.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1880s, William K. Henninger, his pockets bulging with
gold from nearby San Gabriel Canyon, moved to the flats to grow
fruit and nuts. He packed his produce down to Pasadena and Los
Angeles for sale. Some two decades later the land was leased by the
U.S. Division of Forestry for use as an experimental tree farm;
more than 60,000 conifers were raised between 1903 and 1907. The
L.A. County Fire Department bought the flats in 1928 and took over
the tree plantation. Today the department grows more than 20,000
evergreens each year; they are planted to rejuvenate burned areas,
control erosion and stabilize hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   At Henninger Flats _ an area the size of a few city blocks _ the
wind murmurs through towering pines and the scent of cedar needles
wafts on the breeze. Tired hikers and mountain bikers, tongues
lolling, linger over picnic lunches and nab a few ``zzzs'' in the
shade. To the delight of backpackers, there are 18 campsites and
water spigots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so nice because it's got that up-in-the-mountains feel,''
said Dan Schauer of Sierra Madre one recent afternoon. Schauer and
his wife, Marsha, were enjoying Henninger Flats for the first time
after turning back on their previous attempt to reach the locale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of frustrated last time, but this time we said,
`We're going to make it,' '' Dan said.
</P>
<P>
   They did ... barely. ``We just collapsed when we got here,''
said Marsha, gazing at the 40-foot-high trees, which on this day
outnumbered visitors a good 10 to 1. ``But it's so nice with the
pines. It's so pretty that I'm surprised it's not more crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   You have the option of two starting points for the hike. Begin
at Eaton Canyon Nature Center in the park of the same name off
Altadena Drive. Or light out from a fire road gate on Pinecrest
Drive, about a mile north of the nature center, for a 3-mile hike
with a gain of 1,350 feet. If it's your first time in the area, a
stop at the well-stocked nature center (open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
daily; free admission) is highly recommended.
</P>
<P>
   From the nature center, the trail heads north through parched
Eaton Canyon for 1.1 miles, then turns right and climbs the Mount
Wilson Toll Road. More than 70 years ago, tourists by the carloads
were making this ascent; today it's closed to all motor vehicles
but is popular with mountain bikers. The fire road zigzags up the
mountainside, offering ever-grander views of Pasadena and the San
Gabriel Valley, but woefully little shade. Pack plenty of water.
This is dusty chaparral country, dominated by the evergreen-shrub
chamise, laurel sumac, chaparral yucca, black and white sage and
California buckwheat, and no water can be found at Henninger.
</P>
<P>
   At times the fire road seems to soar straight into the sky, but
take deep breaths and after an hour or two of huffing _ depending
on how many breaks you take _ you'll finally arrive at the island
above the haze. Just in time, no doubt, for a walk through the (air
conditioned!) Henninger Flats Visitors Center at hike's pinnacle
... and a nap.
</P>
<P>
   After 40 winks, retrace your steps back to your rig. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU'RE GOING ... &QL; 
From the Foothill Freeway (210) eastbound, exit at Sierra Madre
Boulevard/Altadena Drive in Pasadena and turn left. Follow the
signs to the Eaton Canyon Nature Center, 1750 N. Altadena Drive,
and the first trailhead to Henninger Flats.
</P>
<P>
   To shorten the hike by 1.4 miles round-trip, continue north on
Altadena Drive to Pinecrest Drive, turn right and park near the
gate at 2260 Pinecrest Drive. Walk around the gate on a fire road
that soon intersects the Mount Wilson Toll Road.
</P>
<P>
   Allow at least 4 hours to complete the 7.4-mile round-trip from
the nature center, less for the 6-mile round-trip from Pinecrest
Drive. (Bicyclists are permitted only on the Pinecrest Drive
option.)
</P>
<P>
   Map: Mount Wilson 7.5-minute series topographic.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking information: Eaton Canyon County Park, (626) 398-5420.
</P>
<P>
   Camping: (626) 794-0675. Overnight stays are allowed at
Henninger Flats for up to 14 days; free camping and fire permits
are required and may be picked up at the Henninger Flats Visitors
Center at the apex of the trek. &QL;

SYDNEY GAMES ARE ALMOST ON SCHEDULE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last year, Michael Knight, the president of the
organizing committee for next year's Sydney Olympics, ran into
Peter Ueberroth, who held a similar job for the successful 1984 Los
Angeles Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   As Knight related the story Wednesday, he said Ueberroth told
him, ``You will have serious problems that you don't know are
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight asked, ``What problems?'' He said Ueberroth replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they are, but they're coming, something you
don't expect. When it happens, I want you to remember that every
set of Games has its own set of problems. We had the Soviet-bloc
boycott. Montreal had the boycott of African nations. Just embrace
them and move on. Sight unseen, I'd take your problems over the
ones I had in 1984.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months after Knight talked with Ueberroth, Knight was
saddled with a big problem: a scandal involving excessive gifts to
International Olympic Committee members from the Salt Lake City
committee before and after it was awarded the 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   There were allegations that Sydney, Atlanta (1996 Summer
Olympics) and Nagano, Japan, (1998 Winter Olympics) employed
similar generosity in winning IOC approval for their Olympic bids.
However, Knight said an inquiry by Sydney organizers and the New
South Wales government ``found we were generally clean, but not
absolutely unblemished. We couldn't find anything worthy of further
investigation by the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Sydney obtain the 2000 Olympics corruptly? ``No,'' Knight
said emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, a 47-year-old minister in the New South Wales state
government, met here with editors and reporters from the sports
department of The New York Times Wednesday. He said almost
everything was on schedule for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically,'' he said, ``we're in good shape. Financially,
we're in pretty good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from ticket sales has been encouraging. Knight said such
events as the opening ceremonies and finals of track and field,
swimming, basketball, gymnastics, cycling, field hockey and rowing
were sold out, with many tickets at premium prices. He said when
$220 million worth of tickets were offered to the Australian
public, $340 million in orders were received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``we're telling some people that we can't give
you all the tickets you wanted, but wouldn't you like to see some
other sports, too?'' &QL;

MILLWOOD IS BRAVES' ONE-HIT WONDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the Atlanta Braves facing a crucial situation,
Kevin Millwood pitched a dominant game.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing a complete game one-hitter, and overpowering the
Houston Astros with a nearly flawless performance, Millwood led the
Braves to a 5-1 victory Wednesday afternoon in Game 2 of their
National League division series at Turner Field. The
three-of-five-game series is tied, 1-1, as the scene shifts to
Houston for games Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After playing poorly in a 6-1 loss in Game 1, the Braves needed
a lift, and Millwood delivered the finest pitching performance of
his career. The one-hitter was the fewest hits allowed in a
post-season complete game since 1967, when Jim Lonborg of the
Boston Red Sox threw a complete-game one-hitter against the St.
Louis Cardinals in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   How good was Millwood? At one point, he retired 15 consecutive
batters. He didn't walk anyone. And Houston never got a runner to
second base after the second.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big-time performance, and it reinforced how important
Millwood has become to Atlanta's pitching staff. The Braves have
three Cy Young award winners in their rotation _ Greg Maddux, Tom
Glavine and John Smoltz. But this year, Millwood was Atlanta's most
consistent starter (18-7 with a 2.68 earned run average), and
Wednesday, he was almost untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pitched a one-hitter before, but it was the biggest game
I've pitched in, so I would have to say it was my best performance
ever,'' said Millwood, a 24-year-old right-hander who had eight
strikeouts. ``About the second or third inning, I threw a few
sliders and a couple of curves and I had good control. I knew if I
threw the right pitch and kept them guessing, it was going to be a
pretty good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's only run came on a second-inning home run by Ken
Caminiti. Millwood retired the next 15 batters, and the only other
Astro to reach base was Jeff Bagwell, who was safe on a
seventh-inning error by third baseman Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Braves pecked away at the starting and losing
pitcher Jose Lima, who was 21-10 in the regular season. They scored
single runs in the first and sixth innings, then broke the game
open with three runs in the seventh when they chased Lima, then
beat up on reliever Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   This looked more like the Atlanta team that went 103-59 during
the regular season, and while the Astros were happy to leave
Atlanta with a split, they had seen more than enough of Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stronger game has not been pitched against us all year
long,'' said Houston manager Larry Dierker. ``He spotted his fast
ball, he threw hard, and he has a curveball to finish you off. We
really only hit two balls hard the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading by 2-1, Atlanta scored three runs in the eighth inning.
Bret Boone started the rally with one out when he nearly hit a home
run to left field. When left fielder Daryle Ward misplayed the
carom off the wall, Boone went to third base on the error. Jones
was intentionally walked, then Brian Jordan sent Carl Everett to
the warning track in center field for a sacrifice fly that scored
Boone, while Jones went to second. At that point, Dierker had seen
enough of Lima, who was relieved by Elarton. But instead of
subduing the Braves, Elarton was hammered. Ryan Klesko stroked a
single to left field that scored Jones, then Andruw Jones hit a
single that scored Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves went ahead, 2-1, in the sixth inning, as Jones
snapped an &QC; 0-for-20 slump in division series play. With one out,
Klesko singled, then Jones hit a sharp grounder toward third base
that scooted under Caminiti's glove into left field. Ward charged
the ball in left field, hoping to prevent Klesko from going to
third base. But Ward slipped, and not only did Klesko reach third,
but Jones went to second. It was ruled a double for Jones, then
Eddie Perez delivered a sacrifice fly to center field that scored
Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   It was important for the Braves to start well, and they did,
jumping out to a 1-0 first-inning lead on an RBI single by Jordan,
who was 1 for 3 with 2 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   A lineup change by Braves manager Bobby Cox paid immediate
dividends, as Cox moved Jordan from fifth to the cleanup spot
behind Chipper Jones. In Game 1, Klesko was 0 for 4 as the cleanup
hitter, as the Astros pitched around Chipper Jones and attacked
Klesko. As Cox hoped, Jordan gave Chipper Jones better protection,
and Jordan was inspired by hitting cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept challenges,'' Jordan said. ``When the other team said
they were going to pitch around Chipper, I took that as an insult.
It's a slap in the face. They walked Chipper to get to me, and I
hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's 1-0 lead was short-lived, as Caminiti tied the game
with a rocket that reached the stands in a hurry. But after that,
Houston's bats were silent while Millwood and the Braves took
command.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The Braves asked umpire BRUCE FROEMMING to check JOSE LIMA's
pants for pine tar before Atlanta batted in the first inning.
Lima's pants were checked, and he was allowed to pitch. ``If I put
pine tar in my pants, nobody is going to beat me,'' Lima said. ``I
don't have to cheat to win ball games. I'm not going to be stupid
enough to have pine tar on my pants. This is not the time to be
suspended.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Houston beats L.A. for expansion team
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Its offer buoyed by a record $700 million franchise
fee, Houston rejoined the NFL on Wednesday. The surprising decision
means Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest television market,
will remain without professional football for now.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's expansion committee, meeting in Atlanta, voted 14-0 on
Wednesday morning to recommend Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It took the full membership of 31 owners less than an hour to
approve Houston unanimously, 29-0, with Arizona and St. Louis
abstaining. Twenty-four votes were needed for approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it goes beyond reason and it's much more than I
anticipated paying when I first entered into this process,'' said
Bob McNair, the majority owner of the Houston group. ``But we knew
we had to differentiate ourselves (from Los Angeles) and that's
what we attempted to do. We wanted to make certain everyone knew
that we had an outstanding proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which lost the Oilers to Nashville after the 1996
season, will begin play in the American Football Conference in
2002, when the league will be realigned into eight divisions of
four teams each. One existing team in the AFC will move to the NFC
under the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   McNair earlier reached an agreement with the Houston Livestock
Show and Rodeo and the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority to
build a $310 million, 70,000-seat stadium, which will be the first
football-only venue with a retractable roof. Government funding of
$195 million will help pay for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our facility will be second to none,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   Two groups from Los Angeles, which lost the Raiders to Oakland
and the Rams to St. Louis after the 1994 season, made proposals for
the franchise. But neither offer was anywhere close to the one
McNair put on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood super agent Michael Ovitz, whose group included actor
Tom Cruise, offered a franchise fee of $400 million with another
$150 million in deferred payments. Ovitz most recently proposed
building a stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, Calif., but
there were concerns about access to freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate mogul Ed Roski sought a team for the Los Angeles
Coliseum, but the venue's age and lack of parking were worries.
Also, neither L.A. group could guarantee public funding for
construction or renovation of a venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus with both (potential sites) in Los Angeles was
that there was still quite a distance to travel to have things
completed,'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``There were
concerns about the stadiums there being state of the art and about
guaranteeing the success of the franchise in terms of fan support
and sellouts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston deal also means $5 million more for each of the 31
NFL owners, who split franchise fees annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a financial windfall,'' Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones said. ``You're splitting everything between 32 teams now.
Houston had to move the owners' eyes off of what was perceived as
the No. 1 goal _ to address the No. 2 television market. They did
that and that's pretty impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the difference between Houston and Los Angeles is that
(Houston) was there. It was done, as opposed to `a chance' or
`maybe' (in L.A.).''

TAKING HEADACHE OUT OF ARRANGING PRIVATE FISHING CHARTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 Staff Writer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Unexpected costs at the end of the trip. An
unfriendly crew led by an inexperienced captain. Friends dropping
out at the last minute, leaving you holding the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Chartering a boat from the regional sport-fishing fleet for a
private party trip can be a worthwhile and memorable experience,
but the pitfalls are plentiful. Here's how to help make it as
enjoyable for all as possible: &QL; 
X X X
</P>
<P>
   Once the decision to charter a boat has been made, a trio of
questions must be answered by the prospective group of anglers in
the early stages of planning, according to those in the know. Call
them the three keys to success.
</P>
<P>
   Number in party? ``As a chartermaster, the first thing I do is
find out the group size, so I can match the group with the proper
boat,'' said Dimitri Peros of Westlake Village, who organizes
private charters for fellow members of the San Fernando Valley
Saltwater Fisherman. ``If they only have 15 to 20 people, I'm not
going to put them out on a big 80-foot boat when a 60-footer will
do just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallet size? ``Second, I have to find out how much they are
willing to spend,'' Peros said. ``They can get a really nice boat
for $2,200 to $3,000, but they can also get away with spending $700
or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenhorns or grizzled? ``Finally, the experience level is
really important,'' he added. ``If it's a group of beginners, they
don't care what kind of fish they catch. They are just saying,
`Hey, let's go have fun, eat some dinner' ... so they will be happy
catching any kind of fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on the hardiness of the fishermen. If they are
people who do not fish regularly, I'm not going to send them out on
an overnight trip or send them 60 to 80 miles off the coast. When
that happens, everybody gets blue in the face and throws up, and
everybody ends up wasting their money.''
</P>
<P>
   For those without the luxury of having access to chartermasters,
the next best _ and most direct _ option is to call several
sport-fishing landings in the region and ask for information from
the source.
</P>
<P>
   Chartermasters stress the word ``several'' in order to get a
grasp on the price range and helpfulness of the landings, as well
as when charter boats are available.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some landings require reservations up to six months
in advance of the trip for the more popular boats. However, most
request one or two months' notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like buying a car,'' Peros said. ``You wouldn't just go
to one dealership, walk in and say, `I want a Ford truck,' and buy
the first one they show you. One guy could say, `I'll put your
group of 20 on an 80-foot boat for $2,000,' and the next guy could
say, `I've got a 60-foot boat for $1,000' _ which would be much
better for a group of 20.''
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with landings, details are critical, particularly
when it comes to additional _ and often unforeseen _ financial
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communication with the landing is crucial, because the more
things you discuss up front, the fewer surprises you have,'' said
Tarzana's Michael Grossman, vice president of the Los Angeles Rod
and Reel Club, who also charters boats for friends and other
groups. ``Are the meals included or do you have to pay as you go?
Do you have to pay for fish cleaning, and do they have facilities
to keep the fish on ice?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the last date to cancel the trip without a penalty?
What is the penalty? What if the trip gets canceled due to weather,
do you get your choice of dates to reschedule? Some landings will
substitute boats and skippers without your consent, and you want to
make sure a landing won't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest mistake people make is with tipping,'' Grossman
said. ``You need to find out if it is included, because you don't
want to stiff the captain and crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Peros says that a reputable landing will make sure there are no
surprises, especially for the first-timer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important financial considerations has nothing
to do with the landing or the boat but rather with the other
anglers in the group. Chartermasters suggest getting the money up
front, before people change their mind and leave the burden to the
person who signed the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of selecting a boat, such as the effectiveness and
congeniality of the skipper and crew, are difficult to determine
before leaving the docks. Ask a friend for a recommendation, and
there's nothing wrong with asking the landing for a reference.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, you want to feel comfortable with the
captain and the crew. Often, how many fish are caught on the trip
is secondary to the way the anglers are treated by the hired help.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't predict the fishing, but if the captain and crew are
bad, as well as the fishing, you're going to have a terrible day,''
Peros said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, due to the nature of the business, boats are on
the water so frequently, few groups have an opportunity to meet
their skipper before the trip. But precautions can be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might want to ask how long the captain and crew have been
together,'' Peros said. ``It's important for the captain and
deckhands to work together well, and usually it's a good sign when
the skipper is also the owner of the boat, because he has a double
incentive to make sure you have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Skippers don't take the impacts of word of mouth lightly. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHERE TO BOOK
</P>
<P>
   Examples of single-day prices for privately chartered ocean
sport-fishing boats from various landings and the minimum lead time
needed to secure a reservation:
</P>
<P>
   Marina del Rey Sportfishing: $450-$1,500, two months; (310)
822-3625.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sea Landing (Santa Barbara): $530-$2,800, one month; (805)
963-3564.
</P>
<P>
   Tackle can be rented for those who don't have time to dust off
their old fishing rods or put fresh line on the reels. Ocean-only
fishing licenses _ required for all anglers 16 and older _ are
available at most landings for about $7 for a single day and $19
for the year.

<P>
   OMSK, Russia _ It is three hours by air from Moscow to Omsk, a
sprawling collection of fraying low-rises set on a Kansas-flat
plain by the oil fields of Siberia. Every month or two, a
well-dressed, bespectacled young man arrives by commercial jet here
and is whisked away to a corporate apartment not far from the Omsk
Oil Refinery, Russia's largest and most modern petroleum complex.
After a day or two of unspecified business, he leaves as he came.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually nobody in this city of 1.2 million people would
notice, but for his name: Leonid Dyachenko, the husband of
President Boris Yeltsin's daughter and right-hand strategist,
Tatyana Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   Once so anonymous that even prying reporters were unsure of his
first name, the 36-year-old Dyachenko turns out to have a colorful
life.
</P>
<P>
   He popped into the headlines two weeks ago when it turned out
that he had a bank account in the Cayman Islands with more than $2
million. His bank is the Bank of New York, which is at the center
of a criminal investigation in the United States of possible money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Dyachenko is an oil trader. But he is more than that. He is a
participant _ if not a key figure _ in a network of politically
blessed companies that ship Siberian oil products to Ukraine and to
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   His work is all the more colorful because, for many oil traders,
oil is almost an afterthought. Virtually all of Russia's oil giants
use creative financial transactions to ship billions of dollars
offshore, too _ beyond the reach of tax collectors and, for that
matter, company shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Of most interest to investigators tracing the billions of
dollars that have flowed out of Russia this decade are Dyachenko's
bank accounts, which apparently got most of their money from his
dealings with oil companies, according to statements by bank
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The officials of those companies, and Dyachenko's benefactors,
include two Russian tycoons who are among Yeltsin's strongest
supporters, Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, as well as the
son of the autocratic pro-Yeltsin governor of the Omsk region.
</P>
<P>
   Dyachenko's operations stretch from Omsk to Moscow to Manhattan,
where he is allied with a frenetic Russian capitalist named Viktor
Khrolenko and, records indicate, seems to have occupied a luxury
apartment overlooking New York's financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Khrolenko, who set up two oil trading firms that employed
Dyachenko and befriended the Yeltsin family, said in an interview
that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized his records and
that he was recently summoned to appear next Thursday before a
federal grand jury looking into Russian financial dealings in the
United States. Through a lawyer, he denied any wrongdoing. The
Kremlin has refused in the past to discuss Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing so far links Dyachenko to any of the now-infamous
companies, like the Benex International Co., that have been
indicted on charges of illegally moving nearly $7 billion from
Russia through Bank of New York accounts over the last 3 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dyachenko's business in Omsk and Manhattan raises
questions throughout Moscow about his lucrative relationships with
business tycoons who have profited from the personal intervention
of Dyachenko's father-in-law, Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Less clear is the true role of Khrolenko, an engaging but
curious wheeler-dealer who seems to have played midwife on both
sides of the ocean to Dyachenko's oil career.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, good-looking and energetic, Khrolenko was a Russian
capitalist before Russian capitalism was cool, much less before it
overheated. ``Viktor was one of those guys who asked me to smuggle
him a copy of Samuelson's book on economics in '78 or '79,'' said
Jonathan Sanders, a Columbia University professor who is a
godfather to one of Khrolenko's grandchildren. ``He's a real
Russian patriot who just wanted to bring some American things into
his country.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Communism collapsed, Khrolenko had hooked up with a
onetime promoter for the Rolling Stones to secure a CBS recording
contract for a Russian rock band and bring Soviet newscasts to the
Discovery Channel. He started, then sold, an American-style
nightclub, Manhattan Express, in a staid hotel near Red Square, and
published books on Russian art and literature.
</P>
<P>
   His corporate umbrella, Belka International, had annual sales of
more than than $100 million in 1992, according to a Moscow business
newspaper. A more recent report, by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, places recent
sales at close to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders believes Khrolenko had met Yeltsin by the late 1980s,
when Yeltsin was gaining the image of a Communist reformer. And
Khrolenko suggested that he met Yeltsin's son-in-law through a
timber deal in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that in 1993, the Kremlin called Andrew
Nurnberg, Yeltsin's literary agent in London, and said Khrolenko
would negotiate the American rights to Yeltsin's autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard he was desperate to be seen with Yeltsin,'' Nurnberg
said in a telephone interview. ``That was in those days when you
could benefit by being close to the president of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Osnos, then the publisher of Times Books and now the
publisher at Public Affairs, said Yeltsin's book was excellent _
and that the American edition never made a penny.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he recalled attending a spectacular Kremlin
dinner to celebrate the unveiling of the book at which Khrolenko
sat with the presidential family. ``What happened to him after
that, I don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what happened, is that Khrolenko went from publishing to
petroleum _ and Russian politics. By the spring of 1994, when
Yeltsin's book appeared in the United States, Khrolenko's Belka was
peddling its services at a Washington conference on Russian
technology, opened by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Among others there was the governor of Omsk region, Leonid
Polezhayev. A participant, who refused to be identified for fear of
retribution, said Khrolenko was actively promoting oil and gas
deals in the area _ and that Polezhayev was at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hugged each other like old friends,'' said that person.
``I think they'd known each other for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   A huge deal was soon sealed, but it did not directly involve
Khrolenko.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under a government program known as loans for shares, the
Kremlin elected to sell off effective control of the Omsk Oil
Refinery, the city's biggest employer, to the highest bidder. That
triggered a bitter battle that ended when the chief opponent of the
plan, the refinery's general director, was found dead in Omsk's
Irtysh River a week before the company's auction.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the auction was a huge energy company, Siberian
Oil Co., known as Sibneft. Its ownership is murky at best, but most
analysts say control rests with the company's general director,
Abramovich (pronounced ah-bra-MO-vich) and his longtime business
ally, Berezovsky, perhaps Russia's richest and most public business
titan.
</P>
<P>
   The Sibneft acquisition appears to have been good news for both
Khrolenko and Dyachenko. Sibneft began selling its refined Siberian
oil through a network of oil traders. At the top of Sibneft's list
were two companies: a Khrolenko creation called Belka Energy of New
York, and a second, better-known Russian company called Runikom.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Dyachenko has either overseen or played a
leading role in Belka's dealings with the Omsk refinery. A vice
president of Runikom, which itself holds a 10 percent share of
Sibneft, is none other than the son of the governor of Omsk,
Alexsei Polezhayev.
</P>
<P>
   The incestuous nature of the ties is clear from the location of
Belka's Moscow office: in the refurbished building that houses
representatives of the Omsk regional government.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, Sibneft seems to have awarded the
relatives of Yeltsin and a key supporter lucrative contracts to
distribute its petroleum products. Just how lucrative is not clear;
Sibneft, one of the world's biggest oil firms, still does not have
to disclose its internal business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Khrolenko's lawyer, Irwin Rochman, said in a lengthy interview
that Khrolenko's companies are legitimate and that Dyachenko, who
has an undisclosed ``relationship'' with the companies, ``has been
compensated handsomely'' for his work.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear what Dyachenko does.
</P>
<P>
   According to an account by one petroleum expert in Omsk, which
is impossible to verify, Belka and a second Khrolenko company run
by Dyachenko, East Coast Petroleum, move about 10,000 tons of
diesel fuel from Omsk each month. Most goes to former Soviet
satellites like Hungary and Croatia; increasingly, some goes to
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crumbs, mere crumbs,'' that expert said. Like many
experts, he characterized the allotment as a political favor, much
as a powerful American company might suddenly choose to hire the
unexceptional son of a congressman or governor.
</P>
<P>
   But to most people, the sums involved _ and the profits _ can be
immense. The vast majority of Russian oil giants effectively
launder their oil through a network of offshore companies _ some
wholly owned subsidiaries, others controlled by favored friends _
to avoid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government slaps a 20 percent value-added tax on
every ton of exported oil or gas. In the simplest scheme, an oil
company agrees to sell its crude to a foreign trader for slightly
below the market price, thereby understating its profit and paying
less tax. The trader then resells the oil at market prices and
agrees to split the profit with his supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the unreported profit stays offshore. ``If you
have an offshore entity, you can declare less income and pay less
taxes _ excise, profit, corporate or income tax,'' said an
executive of one major Western company.
</P>
<P>
   The rake-off goes largely to feed official corruption, lining
the pockets of politicians and company officials. In particular,
both Russian and foreign oil executives say, the government's
energy and fuel ministry _ which controls oil exports _ is almost
brazenly corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Even officially, the government does little to conceal the
practice. In 1997, a banner year for oil exports, nearly half of
the 97 million tons of crude oil exports were sent _ on paper, at
least _ to tax havens like Gibraltar, Lichtenstein and the Bahamas,
many without refineries.
</P>
<P>
   A review of Russian customs records by a Russian petroleum
newsletter turned up no evidence that either Belka or East Coast
Petroleum had received oil exports in the last two years. That
could be literally true. But experts say it is possible that the
two companies could be placed further offshore in a chain of
transactions beyond the reach of Russian tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
   In Omsk, where at least some of the records exist, even those in
the know do not want to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who have challenged Polezhayev's rule have found
themselves under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In one interview this week, a subject removed the batteries from
a mobile telephone, explaining calmly that this would prevent
security police from monitoring the interview. The governor's
office declined a reporter's request to discuss these and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The less you know,'' said one man who declined to delve deeply
into Belka's history, ``the longer you live.''

NEW FRANCHISE NEEDS A NAME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID BARRON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the suspense of which city gets the 32nd NFL
franchise out of the way, now comes another intriguing question:
What will be the name of the new Houston pro football team?
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for certain: Oilers is not a possibility. That name
was retired by NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue as part of his
agreement with Bud Adams to change the team's name to Tennessee
Titans after the Houston Oilers moved to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Given the NFL's stance in such matters, don't expect a reprise
of Houston's other pro football team of recent vintage, the Houston
Gamblers of the USFL.
</P>
<P>
   Other than those names, everything appears to be in play. Steve
Patterson, owner Bob McNair's point man on the expansion project,
said Wednesday that about 20 to 25 names have been registered and
are under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Among those, according to a search through Network Solutions, a
Virginia company that assists companies in registering Internet
domain names, are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Roughnecks (a throwback to the city's Oilers roots, but an
obvious target for headline writers who couldn't turn down the
chance to refer to the Houston 'Necks).
</P>
<P>
   _ Roughriders (Teddy Roosevelt, after all, did count Texas among
his recruiting spots during the Spanish-American War).
</P>
<P>
   _ Wranglers (a nod to the Old West, but is it too close to
Cowboys for comfort?)
</P>
<P>
   _ Toros (short, punchy, perfect for headline writers, with more
than a passing nod to the city's Hispanic heritage).
</P>
<P>
   _ Texans (an obvious choice, but it already was used by the
Dallas Texans, now the Kansas City Chiefs, and Houston fans might
prefer something more city-specific).
</P>
<P>
   _ Texians (now you're going way back to the name used for Anglo
inhabitants of the state in the early 19th century, when Texas was
a part of Mexico. Could it possibly fly with NFL Properties? How do
you market a Texian?)
</P>
<P>
   _ Hurricanes (another obvious choice, but why tempt fate?)
</P>
<P>
   _ Roustabouts (and you thought Elvis had left the building).
</P>
<P>
   There will, of course, be more to come. Team officials plan to
launch a new Web site, www.houston2002.com, and that site may
contain information about how the team will get its name.

DOUBLE-PARKING ENDS AS A NEW YORK RIGHT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has long been part of New York's social contract:
car owners who must struggle with the city's byzantine parking
rules are permitted _ wink, wink, nudge, nudge _ to double-park
while one side of a residential street is being cleaned, and police
officers are not pressed into issuing them tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in the Giuliani administration's zeal to unclog the
streets, the Police Department no longer seems willing to look the
other way. From narrow drives to broad avenues, many alternate-side
parkers were surprised, and in some cases, infuriated this week to
find tickets stuck to their windshields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so blown away,'' said Laura Juszczak, a medical
researcher who retrieved a $55 ticket from her dark blue Toyota
Camry at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, 30 minutes after her husband had left
their car double-parked on West 101st Street to clear the way for
street cleaning on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this general understanding that you would be allowed
to move over because of the pressing parking situation in the
city,'' she said. ``This is our home and I think it shows a general
disdain for us and a mean-spiritedness.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration of owning a car in New York City is a given,
particularly in Manhattan, where there are only about 30,000 legal
curbside parking spaces for the hundreds of thousands of vehicles
that use its streets daily. Desperate drivers have long relied on
the city's tacit acknowledgment that there are few alternatives for
those vehicles displaced every other day for up to three hours to
allow street cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   But just as it was when the Giuliani administration declared
that another seemingly inalienable New York right _ jaywalking _
had no place on the city's streets, so now is the city enforcing
the longstanding, but long ignored, ban on double-parking.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Police Department started an aggressive
campaign, known as Operation Move Along, that focuses on commercial
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the campaign resulted in 8,288 tickets for
traffic offenses, including 2,230 tickets for doubled-parked cars
and 1,003 for double-parked trucks, said Officer Carmen Melendez, a
police spokeswoman. Fines start at $55 for illegal parking and run
up to $280 if the police place a clamp on a tire and tow the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some police officials acknowledged that ticketing or
towing was not always the bottom line. James Savage, a former
president of the police officers' union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, said it was long accepted that officers should ignore
double-parking violations during street cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was always an unwritten violation,'' he said. ``You just
knew _ for practical reasons _ you let people double-park on those
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, the chief spokeswoman for the Police Department,
said that double-parking on a residential street has always been
illegal, and that any driver who does it runs the risk of getting a
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars still have to get up and down those streets, and
ambulances and fire trucks,'' she said. ``This is a safety issue.
This is a logistical issue.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the crackdown on double-parking was long overdue.
Allison Baker, a personal trainer, said that she has often been
blocked in by double-parked cars. One time, she even tried to call
the police herself after waiting half an hour for another driver to
move out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives,
a group that wants to reduce car use in the city, said drivers
should realize that they cannot always park free in a place like
New York City. ``There is no such thing as a free lunch and that's
what motorists parking in the street are trying to get,'' said
Kaehny, who pedals his bike to work. ``It should have been enforced
a long time ago.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``I've got a lot of professional memory,'' Rep.
Charlie Norwood said Wednesday afternoon, reflecting on his
experience with managed care companies in the years he practiced
dentistry in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how they deny care,'' he went on, leaning against a
wall near the House floor, sweating through his shirt after hours
of debating and arm-twisting on behalf of his bill that would
establish more stringent standards for insurers and health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they wanted was always the cheapest care, not the best
care,'' he said. ``It drove me crazy, but I wouldn't just let them
say `no' when my patients needed something. I'd fight them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was this experience that led Norwood, a 58-year-old
Republican who is otherwise devoted to his party's principles and
its leaders, to form an alliance with Democrats on the issue of
regulating the managed care industry. His legislation is scheduled
to be voted on in the House of Representatives on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of managed-care restraints had nothing to do with his
decision in 1994 to sell his dental practice and run for Congress,
he said. Quite the contrary, Norwood said, it was his concern over
the way the government was becoming ever bigger. ``I believe in a
smaller federal government,'' he said, ``more freedom, lower
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dental practice, he said, he had found Medicaid
regulations ``awesome and absolutely nuts'' and the rules imposed
on his office by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
nightmarish.
</P>
<P>
   In the health area, Norwood's main concern was President
Clinton's plan for universal health insurance, a plan that he
thought would be disastrous because it envisioned limiting
patients' choice of doctors and doctors' choice of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood defeated an incumbent Democrat in a district of small
towns and rural areas in eastern Georgia and came to Washington as
an acolyte of Newt Gingrich and a loyal foot soldier in the
Republican revolution.
</P>
<P>
   It was an entirely new career after 25 years of practicing
dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Whitlow Norwood Jr. was born July 27, 1941, in Valdosta,
Ga., near the Florida border. After graduating from Georgia
Southern University and the Georgetown University dental school, he
spent two years as a dentist in the Army, including a year in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the Army, he set up dental practice in Augusta and became
active in the Georgia Dental Association, including a term as
president.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Gloria, have two grown sons.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the aggressive class of Republicans who won control of
the House in the 1994 election, he was close to Gingrich and a
staunch supporter of the Contract With America, then the party's
manifesto. Through Gingrich's influence, he was given a seat on the
Commerce Committee, one of the most influential panels in Congress
and one that has jurisdiction over the regulation of health
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   In his second term, Norwood made it clear that he had a mission
to put some restraints on health maintenance organizations. Working
with Democrats and some dissident Republicans, he assembled 230
sponsors, more than half the members of the House, for legislation
to allow patients injured by the denial of their claims to sue
health plans in state court with no limits on damages that could be
collected for lost wages or medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders were vigorously opposed to the measure, and
they put Norwood on a working group headed by Rep. Dennis Hastert
of Illinois, then the chief deputy Republican whip and now the
speaker, to see whether a compromise could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The group came up with a bill that did not allow the right to
sue but did put other restrictions on health plans. In the spirit
of party unity, Norwood went along. The bill was passed by the
House on a party-line vote but died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Norwood decided not to compromise. The ability to sue
insurers was important to keep them in line, he decided. ``Why do
they need immunity anyway unless they are denying benefits?''
Norwood asked Wednesday. ``Why should this industry be the only
industry in America that has a shield of immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not been easy to take on his leaders, he said. Recently,
he has spent his evenings at home watching war movies to build up
his gumption.
</P>
<P>
   Did he expect repercussions from his disloyalty?
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine they'll put some logs in the road for me,'' he said
of the party's leaders. ``They can't let me off scot-free.''
</P>
<P>
   But overall, the matter has been a boon to him politically, he
said. ``I may never have anybody ever run against me again,'' he
said with a laugh. ``The people in the 10th District of Georgia are
very pleased with what I'm doing.''

BROOKLYN MUSEUM RECEIVES SUPPORT IN LEGAL BATTLE WITH MAYOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Brooklyn Museum
of Art prepare for a hearing in U.S. District Court Friday, a surge
of support for the museum's legal position has begun to emerge,
some of it from institutions queasy about the art at the center of
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Most prominent among the institutions that have come out in
support of the museum, though not necessarily of the controversial
exhibition that has sparked the dispute, was the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. Its director, Philippe de Montebello, said in an
Op-Ed article in The New York Times on Tuesday that he regretted
``that the mayor has given undue notoriety to artists who deserve
to remain obscure or be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the museum joined a half-dozen other cultural
institutions in a friend of the court brief filed in support of the
Brooklyn Museum, which has been embroiled in a bitter battle with
Giuliani over the exhibition ``Sensation,'' because it includes a
painting of the Virgin Mary spattered with elephant dung. Giuliani
has denounced the art as ``sick stuff.'' The museum has sued to
prevent the mayor from withholding city funds from it because of
the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Also joining in the legal battle in support of the museum
Wednesday was the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, a
Catholic who has said that the art was ``offensive.'' Valone's
office said that he would join in another friend of the court brief
expected to be filed Thursday by Public Advocate Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone and officials of the Metropolitan Museum were among
dozens of individuals and groups that have given legal support the
museum. But unlike many of them, they have also found Giuliani's
dislike of the art at least tenable.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Vallone, said that while the
speaker ``finds the art very offensive, we fund cultural
institutions with the knowledge that they can make decisions that
people find offensive.'' He said the mayor was in violation of the
city charter by trying to pull the city's funding of the museum.
``I'm sure that libraries have many books that are offensive,'' he
added, ``but we are not about to burn books or close libraries.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Holzer, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
said that his museum's support was ``very limited.'' He said that
it was based on First Amendment grounds and only addressed the
belief that the mayor could not cut funds to the Brooklyn Museum
because he did not like the artwork that it showed. He also noted
that Montebello, paraphrasing Voltaire, said in The Times article
that ``so much as I may disagree with some of the exhibitions they
may mount, I will defend to the death their right to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office did not respond to several calls seeking
comment on the court briefs.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has filed a federal lawsuit against the city and the
mayor asserting that by withholding its city funding. Giuliani is
violating its First Amendment right to artistic expression.
</P>
<P>
   The city has announced its intention to cut off $7.2 million in
funding that it provides the museum each year. It has also gone to
state court seeking to terminate the museum's lease and to take
control of its board, saying that taxpayers should not have to pay
for offensive exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, the lawyer who is representing the museum in its
federal suit against the city, said that the support from other
cultural institutions demonstrated that ``the arts community, the
literary community, the museum community and much of the city as a
whole are coalescing around a single theme: no mayor may be
permitted to serve as the censor of what the public may see.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the mayor said he would also cut off city funding to
any other publicly financed cultural institution in the city that
mounts an exhibit that he considers an attack on religion.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the mayor might broaden his sights or that some
other politician may attempt similar measures has also frightened
many of them, said Victor A. Kovner, the former city corporation
counsel under Mayor David N. Dinkins, who filed the brief joined by
the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the mayor can do this to the Brooklyn Museum, there is a
question of what he will do to others,'' he explained. ``So this is
an ominous threat to everybody.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives passed a bill on
Wednesday creating tax breaks to help millions of people buy health
insurance. But it also took a procedural step that may jeopardize
legislation to define patients' rights and regulate health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and House Democrats cried foul. The White
House said Clinton would veto the bill authorizing new tax breaks
for the purchase of health insurance if the measure reached his
desk in the form approved by the House on Wednesday night. The
bill's benefits would go mainly to a small number of healthy,
affluent people, the administration said.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Clinton and House Democrats have demanded a House
debate on legislation to set stringent, enforceable federal
standards for HMOs and insurance companies. They got their wish on
Wednesday. The debate began.
</P>
<P>
   But House Republicans insisted that the House first take up a
separate bill that would create new tax breaks and
insurance-pooling arrangements to help individuals and small
businesses buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the bill, which encourages the use of tax-free
savings accounts to set aside money for routine medical expenses,
could help millions of people without insurance. But the White
House said the bill would cost more than $40 billion over 10 years
and would help fewer than 1 percent of the people who lack
coverage, mainly healthy people with higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual procedural move, the Republican majority voted on
Wednesday to yoke this tax credit bill to whatever patient
protection bill is approved by the House on Thursday. That will
have the effect of draining support from the most popular patient
protection bill, which is backed by many Democrats who oppose the
tax credit bill. Further clouding the chances of a patient
protection bill, Republicans refused to let Democrats include a way
to pay the costs of a bill.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and many Republicans said they wanted a patient
protection bill, to help people denied care by the cost-control
tactics of HMOs. But House Speaker Dennis Hastert said, ``The most
important patient protection is to provide health care coverage for
people who do not now have it.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats said they had enough votes to pass a popular
bipartisan HMO patients' rights bill, drafted by Reps. Charlie
Norwood, R-Ga., and John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said on Wednesday: ``The House leaders concocted a
process filled with enough poison pills and legislative sleights of
hand to practically guarantee the defeat of this bill. This is a
travesty. It's the sort of thing they did to kill common-sense gun
legislation in the aftermath of Littleton.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans rejected the criticism, saying the Democrats wanted
a political issue for next year's elections rather than genuine
protections for patients. Rep. David Dreier of California, who
wrote the rules of debate as chairman of the House Rules Committee,
said Clinton's criticism was ``just preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans cited a new Census Bureau report showing an increase
in the uninsured as evidence that Congress must deal first with
their problems, before worrying about new rights for people who
already have coverage. On Sunday, the bureau reported that the
number of people without health insurance rose last year by
833,000, to a total of 44.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bill to create tax breaks and other incentives for the
purchase of insurance was approved on Wednesday night by a vote of
227 to 205. Voting in favor of the measure were 216 Republicans and
11 Democrats. Five Republicans joined 199 Democrats and 1
independent in opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to vote on Thursday on proposals to
define patients' rights. If one of those bills survives, it would
be merged with the bill intended to expand access to health
insurance. And the package would be sent to the Senate, which
approved a more limited set of patients' rights in July.
</P>
<P>
   All the major patients' rights bills in the House and the Senate
would guarantee access to emergency medical care, allow patients to
appeal coverage decisions to an independent board and permit
doctors to talk freely with patients about treatment options. A
majority of House members also want to allow injured patients to
sue HMOs for damages caused by the improper denial of care. The
Senate bill includes no new right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, said the merger of the two bills
without a separate vote was ``a very peculiar procedure,'' devised
by Republican leaders to ``derail meaningful regulation of the
managed-care industry.'' The tactic, he said, ``may well doom''
enactment of legislation to define patients' rights.

</P>
<P>
   As the House Wednesday began its long-awaited debate on health
care legislation, some Democrats said they had been outfoxed and
outmaneuvered by House Republican leaders, who have for months
tried to put off debate on the Norwood-Dingell bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark of California, one of the Democrats' leading
experts on health policy, said: ``The Republicans have scored a
procedural victory, no question. They are basically defeating
patient protections through procedural legerdemain.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats denounced the rules of debate as a Machiavellian
tactic to weaken support for the Norwood-Dingell bill among members
of both parties. And, they conceded, it might work, but the outcome
is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic floor leader,
said that passage of a patients' rights bill was ``severely
endangered'' by the Republican rules of debate, approved on
Wednesday by a party-line vote of 221 to 209.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwood-Dingell bill has a comparatively modest cost, $7
billion over five years. By contrast, the tax breaks for the
uninsured are estimated to cost $47 billion over 10 years. Neither
bill pays for these costs _ a source of grave concern to fiscal
conservatives in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., said Democrats had begun to worry
about the cost of their patients' rights bill ``only at the last
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to cause a loss of federal revenue for this
reason: Health insurance premiums would rise slightly as HMOs and
other health plans provide more care and incur new administrative
costs. Employers would claim larger tax deductions for the cost of
such insurance. Tax collections from employers would decline
slightly, as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they wanted to pay for the cost of their
patients' rights bill, but Republicans refused to allow any
amendment for that purpose. As a result, Gephardt predicted,
``we'll lose a pretty big number of Democrats'' when the House
votes on passage of the patients' rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed on Wednesday includes these measures to help the
uninsured:
</P>
<P>
   _People who do not receive health benefits from their employers
could take a tax deduction for the cost of any health insurance
they purchase on their own. The deduction would take effect
gradually from 2002 to 2007.
</P>
<P>
   _The government would widen access to the tax-free savings
accounts used to pay medical expenses. Congress agreed to test such
``medical savings accounts'' in 1996, but fewer than 60,000 people
have taken advantage of the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   _Trade associations and chambers of commerce could establish
group health plans for their members across the country.
Republicans say these ``association health plans'' would allow
small employers to pool their purchasing power and obtain discounts
similar to those that big employers now get from health insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, under the House bill, people could take a tax
deduction for the premiums on individual insurance covering the
costs of long-term care. And a person who cares for an elderly
relative could take an additional personal exemption. The amount of
the exemption is now set at $2,750.

U.S. PRESSES SECURITY COUNCIL FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST TALIBAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States on Wednesday asked the
Security Council to impose economic sanctions on the Islamic
Taliban movement in Afghanistan, demanding that the Afghans turn
over Osama bin Laden, a Saudi-born militant who is wanted in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed resolution circulated among Security Council members
by the United States would ban all international flights by
aircraft owned or operated by the Taliban government and freeze
bank accounts and property abroad owned by the Afghan leadership.
The proposed sanctions are similar to measures the United States
imposed this year, but not as far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is also asking the Council for the right to use arms
to enforce the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan airline, Ariana, flies only to the United Arab
Emirates; India and Saudi Arabia have stopped flights. Taliban
officials say they have no overseas assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a taste for caviar and French wine,'' a Taliban
supporter said at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday. ``We
live on bread and onions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, which controls most of the country but has not been
given Afghanistan's U.N. seat, maintains a small unofficial
diplomatic office in Queens. The director of that office, Abdul
Hakeem Mujahid, said he had discussed the possible U.N. sanctions
with the Taliban leaders in Afghanistan on Wednesday and that they
were ``mentally prepared'' for the blow.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid said that isolating Afghanistan would only play into the
hands of Iran, which wants to attract a gas pipeline that American
companies wanted to build in Afghanistan, and of Russia, which is
also seeking greater influence in the region.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the loss of international airline service would
mostly hurt Afghan traders who have no other way to sell goods
abroad. Government
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials reported recently that opium production has risen
sharply in Afghanistan this year in areas controlled by the Taliban
and by the remnants of the former mujahedeen coalition government,
which was supported by the United States and is now confined to a
small area in the northeast. But officials stop short of accusing
the Taliban of profiting directly from drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that the sanctions resolution could come to a vote
within a week. U.S. representatives are confidant they have broad
support in the Security Council, including from Russia and China,
which might otherwise oppose a resolution imposing economic
sanctions on a developing country, are dealing with Islamic
insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is also asking the Council to demand that
Afghanistan stop harboring international terrorists, close their
training camps and bring indicted militants to trial. In November
1998, bin Laden and another militant, Muhammed Atef, were indicted
in U.S. District Court in New York on charges of complicity in the
bombings of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August that
year. A $5 million reward has been offered for the capture of
either man.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombings, the United States made air strikes on what
it said was a camp in Afghanistan belonging to bin Laden, but the
attacks failed to kill him or to persuade the Taliban to turn him
over. Bin Laden is believed to have a close relationship with the
Taliban's religious leader, the Emir Omar.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid said his government was willing to negotiate with the
United States over the bin Laden case but would not accept
``commands.'' &QL;

 By DANNY ROBBINS  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees held a light workout Wednesday. The
Texas Rangers, ensconced in their hotel, took the day off.
Hopefully, no one in the team's traveling party purchased the
Triborough Bridge.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Yankees-Rangers American League Division Series resumes
with Game 2 tonight at Yankee Stadium, the Rangers will be forced
to define their future.
</P>
<P>
   Having absorbed an 8-0 drubbing in Game 1 on Tuesday, the
Rangers must win tonight or face the prospect of beating Roger
Clemens and David Cone in Texas over the weekend to force a
decisive fifth game.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost seven consecutive playoff games to the Yankees and
having scored only one run in the last four, the Rangers must win
simply to cast out some growing demons, to overcome what general
manager Doug Melvin calls ``this hump'' of losing to the Yankees in
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal, without looking at other teams, is to win the World
Series,'' Melvin said Wednesday, trying to make sense of what has
happened in the last four years to the team he has put together.
``We feel this is the best chance we've had. This is the best team
we've had. We still think we have the team that can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to win a (playoff) series before you can think of
the World Series. We all know what we have to do. It's just been
that the Yankees have made it difficult for us.''
</P>
<P>
   All the talk of how this could be the Rangers' year, of how they
had improved and how the Yankees had come back to the pack after
lapping the field in 1998, melted away Tuesday as Texas'
high-powered offense returned to its postseason funk of a year ago.
Ivan Rodriguez's two hits, a double in the first inning and a
single in the third, were all the Rangers could muster against
Yankees starter Orlando Hernandez, who went eight innings, and Jeff
Nelson, who pitched the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's series started in similar fashion, with David Wells
throwing eight shutout innings and giving up only five hits, and
ended in a Yankees sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have confidence in your ballclub,'' Rangers left fielder
Rusty Greer said. ``We wouldn't have won 95 games if we didn't have
confidence. We have to regroup, obviously. Thursday becomes a
must-win game for us. The hill got a little steep. If we don't
produce Thursday, it becomes even steeper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will try to get untracked against Yankees lefthander
Andy Pettitte, who ended the regular season considerably stronger
than he started it. After going 5-7 with a 5.59 ERA in his first 16
starts, Pettitte finished 9-4 with a 3.84 in his last 15,
improvement some attribute to the fact he was the subject of
well-publicized trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   The Game 2 starter for Texas will be Rick Helling, who won 13
games but gave up a major-league-leading 41 home runs, including 13
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Helling said he would feel no extra pressure as a result of his
team's lack of offensive production in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have complete faith in our offense,'' he said. ``You look at
what we've done over the last two years offensively, we're one of
the best offensive teams in baseball. Our offense is capable of
scoring 10 runs a game if we start swinging the bats the way we
can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody will tell you if you put yourself in position to
have success, eventually it's going to happen. `El Duque'
(Hernandez) threw a great game. We had chances early to score runs
and just couldn't get that big hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team has traditionally gotten that big hit when we needed
it, and eventually it's going to happen. I have a ton of faith in
our offense. It doesn't put pressure on me. I'm trying to throw
zeros on the board anyway. I don't worry about the offense. More
times than not, they're going to score runs for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did have their share of tough outs Tuesday, the most
dramatic being Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams' play on Juan
Gonzalez's drive to the gap in right-center with runners on first
and second and one out in the third inning. At that point, the
Yankees had only a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very good ballclub, and we'll break out of it
somewhere along the line here,'' Melvin said. ``I just hope it's
sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt they (players) think about it. But this is
just too good a lineup, too many good offensive players, to go out
there and not give it a good run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give credit to the Yankees, too. Their pitchers
are very good. And, you know, if Juan's ball is dropped _ Bernie
doesn't make a great catch _ that ball Rafael (Palmeiro) hit goes
into the corner (instead of being caught by Yankees first baseman
Tino Martinez), it's a different ballgame. They made two great
defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focused on each game during the regular season. We didn't
get too up or too down after losses. We have to continue to have
the same approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in his sixth year as general manager, Melvin has seen a
franchise that never had appeared in the playoffs suddenly become
one that, unless events change swiftly, could be known for getting
there and falling apart at the sight of pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we went through a couple of years where we couldn't
beat the Mariners, and I think we put that behind us,'' Melvin
said. ``We went through not playing well in the Texas heat. We were
going to blow the chance to be in the postseason (because of the
heat). So this is just another hurdle. It's a big hurdle, the
Yankees are, but I think we can overcome it.''

`NICE GUY' FINISHES FIRST AS McNAIR AWARDED NFL TEAM 
 
By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A 23-year-old Robert Cary McNair came to Houston from
South Carolina in 1960 with a psychology degree, a wife and two
children, $700 in the bank and the promise of $3,000 loan to get
started in an auto-leasing business.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McNair agreed to pay the National Football League
one million times what his net worth was 39 years ago to became
owner of the league's 32nd franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In between was a business career that has led McNair from one
industry to another, through a bankruptcy court that left him with
about $500,000 in 1983, and onto this year's list in Forbes
Magazine of the 400 richest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The American dream has come true for McNair, the son of
working-class parents who was the first in his immediate family to
graduate from college.
</P>
<P>
   Now 62, McNair wants to leave a legacy in his adopted home town.
That includes a winning team playing in a state-of-the-art stadium,
the site of many future Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   After paying $700 million for the franchise, McNair doesn't
expect it will earn any returns for himself and others in his
ownership group for ``many, many years.'' But it will provide what
he calls ``an emotional equity.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like Houston is a special city,'' he said. ``I came
here when I was 23 and had $700 in the bank. I was just impressed
with the fact that the people who had capital in Houston didn't
just sit on it and keep it to themselves. They kept reinvesting in
people like me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a beneficiary of that environment, and I'm glad now to be
able to reinvest in my community and, hopefully, improve it for
everybody,'' he said. ``If it weren't for a strong sense of civic
pride, I would not be doing this.``
</P>
<P>
   Those associated with McNair _ a man known for honoring
handshake deals and a stout Presbyterian who donates millions of
dollars annually to charity _ say the words ring true.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really is a nice guy who finishes first,'' said Chuck
Watson, owner of the Houston Aeros minor league hockey team. Watson
is expected to buy about 15 percent of the new football team.
</P>
<P>
   Even his opponents in the NFL bidding war speak highly of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am, trying to get the same team McNair wants, trying to
do my best to better him, and damned if I'm not saying to myself,
`Gee, this is really a good guy,''' said Los Angeles developer Ed
Roski.
</P>
<P>
   McNair was born in Tampa, Fla., into a family that moved all
around the South as his father slowly worked up the ladder of the
Sunshine Biscuit Co.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls fond childhood memories, including playing in the
restaurant his maternal grandfather owned across the street from
the Have-A-Tampa cigar company, a venue for dice and card games.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in sports was displayed early, when he played
football, basketball and baseball in high school. He also played on
the University of South Carolina's junior varsity basketball squad,
but quit ``because I had nothing else to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had to work his way through college in various sales
jobs. After graduation, McNair went to work for a fellow South
Carolina graduate and Sigma Chi fraternity brother in an auto
leasing company. The business fell flat after about five months,
leaving McNair out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he was offered a $3,000 loan to move to Houston and
start what eventually because Executive Auto Leasing.
</P>
<P>
   A quick learner, he put the business on a sound financial
footing, then spent the next 20 years building it, selling it,
using the equity to form a bigger one and starting the process all
over again. Ownership of an auto-leasing company became ownership
of an equipment leasing company, which became ownership of a
trucking company.
</P>
<P>
   But trucking deregulation slowed McNair's steady rise, forced
him into Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy. One of his companies
that leased trucking equipment owed $10 million it could not
immediately pay.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually repaid all creditors 100 cents on the dollar, and
accumulated enough personal assets ``to last my family about three
years.'' By then, he and his wife, Janice, had four children.
</P>
<P>
   McNair began looking at other industries, especially ones that
would let him take advantage of the lessons he had learned through
the deregulation of trucking. Borrowing more money, he formed a
Cypress Telecommunications, a long-distance telephone carrier.
</P>
<P>
   His big coup was taking advantage of the impending deregulation
of electricity. In the early 1980s, amid rising oil prices, power
companies and large power users were looking for ways to save
money.
</P>
<P>
   In response, McNair founded Cogen Technologies, which helps
companies save by employing ``cogeneration'' plants. For example, a
power plant that burns oil to create electricity can recapture the
heat generated from that process to create steam, another form of
energy, which also can be used to generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, McNair's business took off. Earlier this year, Cogen
sold most of its assets to Enron Corp. for $1.4 billion, partly so
McNair could pursue his dream of owning a pro football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is someone who really does go after his dreams,'' said
Enron Chairman Ken Lay, who has known McNair for almost two
decades. ``He is very smart and very capable, and when he sets his
sights on things, he gets it done.``
</P>
<P>
   Always consumed with sports of all kinds, McNair had spent years
trying to get an NFL team and a National Hockey League team. He
bought a stable five years ago, and his horses have won major
races. He owned part of Touch Gold, which the 1997 Belmont Stakes,
and Strodes Creek, which placed second in the Kentucky Derby. He
also shares a 75-foot sailing yacht with former U.S. Commerce
Secretary Bob Mosbacher.
</P>
<P>
   Lay noted another McNair trait, one he and others believe helped
him negotiate with the NFL for two years despite the league's
obvious desire to put the expansion team in Los Angeles:
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't get mad.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who were close to McNair over the last two years
said he rarely even raised his voice about the frustrating
negotiations. He views obstacles as challenges, not reasons for
quitting.
</P>
<P>
   And he did not make a wrong step during the arduous NFL
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to have a big ego because people don't do what he has
done without one,'' Lay said. ``But he doesn't let his ego get in
the way of what he wants to do.``
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he first began talking with McNair about getting a
football team at the urging of San Diego Padres baseball team owner
John Moores. At the time, Moores was just giving up hope of getting
another NFL team for Houston, a venture that included Watson.
Moores thought McNair might be the best person to move forward with
the effort, Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson and McNair had their first conversation about the NFL at
the River Oaks Country Club in Houston, where McNair is a member.
</P>
<P>
   ``During our golf game, we talked about our philosophies toward
sports,'' Watson said. ``We both agreed that we wanted to enhance
Houston's image around the country. We'd never hire anyone who
might damage the city's image.``
</P>
<P>
   They have worked together to get an NFL team, though Watson's
role has diminished as his duties as CEO of Dynegy have increased
over the last two years due to the company's growth spurt. Over
time, Watson's stake in an NFL team has dropped from a 50-50 split,
when the expansion fee under consideration was $400 million, to 10
percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and I have had nothing in writing, it's all been in a
handshake'' Watson said. ``It drives our attorneys a little nuts,
but he is a person you can trust.``
</P>
<P>
   McNair has said he will not run the team, leaving that to
top-notch coaches and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to make sure they perform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A member of Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church, McNair views his
good fortune with humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole view about my money is that we're all stewards in
this world,'' McNair said. ``I don't own anything, I'm just a
steward. Everything belongs to the good Lord. I'm only going to be
here a short period, so I'm just stewarding those assets.``

 &HT;    All Millwood, all even
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If one game could capture what Kevin Millwood has been
all about this season, Wednesday afternoon's Game 2 of the Division
Series wraps it up. And it's why the Braves are still alive and
well, having gained a split with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   With their backs to the wall and desperate for a win in this
best-of-five series, the Braves turned to their 24-year-old alleged
fourth starter with the nasty repertoire and crowned him a
postseason hero.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood pitched only the fifth one-hitter in postseason history
for a 5-1 victory in the first playoff start of his life. Well,
actually the second.
</P>
<P>
   There was that playoff appearance he made for the Class A Durham
Bulls in 1996. He pitched eight shutout innings then, which should
come as no surprise now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew today would tell me whether I've got it,'' said
Millwood, who made last year's playoff roster but didn't pitch.
``It's good to go out and pitch well.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing the possibility of yet another Braves postseason coming
to a premature close, the calm and collected Millwood needed to be
perfect. And he almost was.
</P>
<P>
   If not for a two-strike fastball in the second inning to Ken
Caminiti, who homered for the second time in the series, and an
error by Chipper Jones on a Jeff Bagwell grounder in the seventh,
no Astro would have touched base. Two of Millwood's 105 pitches
were hit hard _ Caminiti's and a Stan Javier line drive, which Bret
Boone safely snared for the game's final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that start was probably the most dominant postseason
start I've ever seen,'' Chipper Jones said. ``Tommy Glavine in Game
6 in the World Series in 1995 was awfully dominant. If it's
possible, I think Millwood was more dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   With Millwood in control, the Braves finally loosened up
offensively. Brian Jordan was back in the cleanup spot and drove in
two of the Braves' four runs off Jose Lima. Ryan Klesko, seeking
redemption for his bases-loaded strikeout in Game 1, came through
with three hits.
</P>
<P>
   And Andruw Jones recovered from a pair of weak at-bats to give
the Braves their first extra-base hit of the series and a giant
offensive lift with his double in the sixth inning. Jones ripped an
0-1 Lima pitch off Caminiti's glove to set up an Eddie Perez
sacrifice fly for a 2-1 lead. The Braves added three runs in the
seventh on consecutive RBIs by Jordan, Klesko and Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show them the Braves are not going to roll
over,'' Jordan said.

 &HT;    Bobby Labonte on Charlotte pole
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Bobby Labonte really can't explain it, neither
can crew chief Jimmy Makar.
</P>
<P>
   For some unknown reason, the Pontiac No. 18 driver has
flourished during qualifying at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte
this year. Labonte captured the pole position Wednesday night for
the UAW-GM Quality 500 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second Charlotte race in a row that Labonte will be
the pole-sitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I have a secret... The No. 18 car (of Joe
Gibbs Racing) seems to always do good at Charlotte throughout its
history,'' said Makar. ``We've just been able to come up with a
(car setup) that likes this place and hits on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Labonte, ``I think Jimmy Makar is a big key. He always
seems to have same setup for this track, and we've always done
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who is second behind Dale Jarrett in the Winston Cup
points standings, won the pole with a speed of 185.682 mph. He will
share the front row with Rusty Wallace, who is still one shy of his
50th career victory.
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti, Mark Martin and Tony Stewart round out the top
five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the fourth time I've been third-fastest here,
so obviously I'm no better than third-best when it comes to
qualifying here,'' Andretti said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton was the biggest surprise in first-round qualifying,
but not in a positive way. Burton was last at 50th in qualifying
after the No. 99 Ford slid sideways on the first turn of the lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way of saying (exactly what happened),'' Burton
said. ``I'm real disappointed with the run, but I am proud I didn't
wreck it. I did a good job of not wrecking it, but it's a shame
(because) we'll have to start (the race) in the back of the pack
and we had a fast car today.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte won the pole at the Coca-Cola 600 in May and finished
runner-up to Burton in the race. Labonte also started No. 1 in The
Winston, an exhibition at Charlotte between many of the top
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the track and I won my first race here,'' Labonte said.
``Nobody can ever take that away from me. I guess I have a special
place in my heart for it. I always have liked coming here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a combination of things. Everything works out
good and I've got a good confidence level going into qualifying,
race day or practice, whatever the case may be.''

CLINTON ADDS STIFFER PENALITIES TO MILITARY CODE FOR BIAS CRIMES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Wednesday signed an executive
order amending the military criminal code to add stiffer penalties
for crimes motivated by hatred based on the victim's race,
religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The order also creates a confidentiality privilege in criminal
matters for service members' conversations with psychotherapists.
</P>
<P>
   Both changes have long been pushed by advocates for gay and
lesbian members of the military, who said that reports of violent
crimes against gay service members had been rising and that they
thought harsher penalties would be a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for gay service members had also complained that
therapists had been turning in gay and lesbian service members who
sought counseling about their sexuality, resulting in their
discharges from the military.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of both provisions, which are amendments to the
Pentagon's manual for courts-martial, is to improve incrementally
the difficult climate for gay men and lesbians in the military. The
psychotherapist privilege softens slightly the ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy to allow men and women to confide their homosexuality
to a therapist in certain circumstances without risking immediate
separation from the service.
</P>
<P>
   But the new rule applies only to criminal proceedings and does
not ensure confidentiality in administrative actions, which are the
ordinary mechanism for discharging acknowledged homosexuals from
the military.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department had recommended both changes after
discussions with the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a
Washington group that represents soldiers who are prosecuted or
harassed because of their perceived sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osburne, a founder of the network, called the
establishment of the therapist privilege a ``step forward that
doesn't go nearly far enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Osburne said that although military psychotherapists were not
required to alert commanders to a service member's statements of
homosexuality many did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you eliminate the safe space of the therapist, which as a
civilian would be held in confidence, you create an environment
that is deleterious to the military,'' Osburne said. ``The limited
privilege is a good first step, but does not address situations in
the administrative system, only in the criminal system.''
</P>
<P>
   The hate-crimes sentencing provision comes in the wake of the
slaying in July of an Army private at Fort Campbell, Ky., because
he was thought to be homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier, Pvt. Barry Winchell, was beaten with a baseball
bat. An Army private was charged in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the courts-martial code was in process before the
killing, a White House official involved in the policy said.
</P>
<P>
   The official said stiffer penalties for crimes that were
motivated by bias could serve as a deterrent against violence not
only against gay service members, but also against racial and
religious minorities and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we have worked on for more than two years,''
Osburne said. ``It is unfortunate it has to come in the wake of the
murder of a soldier at Fort Campbell and escalating reports of
harassment servicewide.''

DONATIONS TO COLLEGES SWELL AS HARVARD LEADS THE PACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (js) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Universities don't usually set fund-raising goals that they
can't meet, but when Harvard decided in 1992 that it would try to
raise $2.1 billion by Dec. 31, 1999, the task seemed herculean: The
university would have to collect an average of nearly $1 million a
day for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Harvard president, Neil L. Rudenstine, informed a
gathering of alumni at the Harvard Club in Manhattan that the
university had not only reached its target but had exceeded it,
raising $2.3 billion _ with three months still remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Though no U.S. college or university has ever raised as much in
a similar period _ Yale and Columbia, believed to be the closest
competitors, each raised $1.7 billion over seven years in the 1990s
_ Harvard's experience is only the most dramatic example of a
larger trend: Donations to institutions of higher education are
swelling beyond even the grandest expectations, thanks in part to a
booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donors are much more willing to talk,'' said Will Melton, the
vice president for external affairs at Middlebury College in
Vermont, which has raised all but $57 million of the $200 million
it hopes to collect from October 1997 to June 2001. ``They are not
reluctant to talk about their wealth and success, and they want to
share it with the institutions that mean something to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the golden age of philanthropy, and Harvard rode the
market climb perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard collected $462.7 million in gifts last year, an increase
of 124 percent over the $206.2 million in donations that it
recorded in 1992, the end of the most recent recession.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, annual contributions rose 152 percent at
Princeton; 141 percent at Columbia, and 68 percent at Stanford,
according to figures from the Council for Aid to Education, a
nonprofit organization that tracks contributions to colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   While, in general, the number of donors to each institution did
not increase appreciably, the size of donations has grown.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, a mere 85 gifts _ out of the 172,000 received since
1992 _ provided nearly half of the campaign goal, university
officials said. Each was at least $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The largest gift, $70.5 million, was pledged in 1995 by John L.
Loeb, class of 1924, a former member of Harvard's governing body,
and his wife, Frances Lehman Loeb.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among the most lucrative aspects of the campaign was the focus
on female donors, who have generally given substantially less than
male classmates at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Hauser _ a member of the law school class of 1959, who,
along with her husband, gave $14.5 million to the law school and
$10 million to establish the Hauser Center for Nonprofit
Organizations _ led an effort that raised $40 million from female
alumni.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Harvard intends to use its trove for a variety of purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The school's Widener Library, for example, is to receive a $70
million renovation, and repairs to the freshman dormitories, at
about $65 million, have already been completed. And 25 new faculty
positions have been added to improve the ratio of undergraduate
students to professors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the campaign, the university's endowment has
grown to $14.2 billion, from $6 billion in 1994. The university's
annual budget is $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when institutions have been under external pressure to
spend more of their endowments on their operating expenses,
particularly to reduce tuition, Harvard has continued to spend
about 5 percent of the value of its endowment annually. But because
the size of the endowment has expanded so dramatically, the portion
of the operating budget financed by the endowment has grown to 28
percent, from 18 percent about a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, tuition and other fees, including room and board,
are $34,350 this year. Nearly half the students who attend Harvard
receive scholarships, with the average grant about $17,200,
university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Harvard should be willing to part with a bit more of
its endowment each year, to lessen the burden on students,
Rudenstine, the president, said, with an eye on the cycles of the
world economy over the last century: ``You have to make sure that
the thing can last forever.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While other institutions contacted Wednesday were fairly envious
of Harvard's good fortune, Rudenstine said that, in reality, $2.3
billion does not go as far as it used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably going to take $500 million alone just for new
space, new equipment, new people, new technicians, new inventions
and new teaching, just in the next three to five years,''
Rudenstine said. ``There is a lot more to do.''

ANXIOUS PILL MAKER PUTS INTERVIEW ON WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A diet-product company Wednesday posted on the
Internet a complete, unedited videotaped interview between an ABC
News correspondent and the company's chief executive in an effort
to publicize its concerns that ABC would broadcast an unfair report
on the medical risks of its popular dietary supplement.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, called the posting by
the company, Metabolife International Inc., ``a not very subtle
attempt at intimidation'' and said it would have no effect on the
network's reporting.
</P>
<P>
   But news executives from ABC, as well CBS and NBC, acknowledged
that the move had implications for journalism, especially because
making interview material public before it is broadcast or
published makes the information available to competing news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The executives all said the move could lead them to institute
some kind of agreement seeking to prevent an interview subject from
releasing a tape of network material before it was broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Metabolife, which has been the subject of several investigative
articles examining the safety of an ingredient in its diet pills,
bought full-page advertisements in The New York Times and The New
York Post on Wednesday to publicize the creation of the Web site.
Metabolife's decision to take the action was reported Wednesday in
The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Metabolife chief executive Michael Ellis said he became
concerned about ABC's fairness because the interview, which took
place Sept. 9, ``felt more like a deposition.'' He also said ABC
did not respond favorably when Metabolife informed the network that
one of the doctors cited as a critic of the company in the
interview questions had a conflict of interest because he was on
the board of a competitor, Slim Fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site's address is: www.newsinterview.com Ellis noted
that the ABC correspondent for the report, Arnold Diaz, runs his
own Web site, called Schemes, Scams and Savin' a Buck, which he
said put him on alert that ``we were being lumped in with scams in
ABC's thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis acknowledged that he had no idea what ABC intended to
broadcast about his company.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Requests by companies to tape interviews while networks are
conducting them have become common in recent years and they are
almost always accepted. But companies usually use them to counter a
news report they consider unfair. ABC News president David Westin
spoke at a meeting of the ABC News staff Wednesday morning and said
Metabolife's Web site posting could affect policies regarding
taping of interviews by interview subjects, perhaps creating the
need for the network to construct some kind of formal agreement
that an interview subject would not make public material from the
interview until it was broadcast or published.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely going to think about the implications of
this,'' said ABC News executive vice president Shelby Coffey. ``We
clearly have concerns about it. We don't want other people
attempting to get into and shift the journalism process.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffey said that nothing on the Web site would have any effect
on what ABC eventually put into its broadcast, or on the timing of
the broadcast. The report is still in preparation and no date has
yet been scheduled for it to appear on ABC's newsmagazine
``20/20.'' But an ABC News spokeswoman said it was likely to be
broadcast ``within the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal Shapiro, the executive producer of NBC's newsmagazine
``Dateline,'' agreed that the move by the company had implications
for journalists and said that executives at the network would talk
about what steps it could take.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News president Andrew Heyward said he thought this
particular circumstance was highly unusual. ``It's expensive and
cumbersome for a company to do something like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``It's an interesting idea to ask for an agreement
that the material not be used before we broadcast. That might be an
option. I just think that the fewer deals that are made between
journalists and sources, the better.''

QUEST FOR BEAUTY WENT AWRY AT HANDS OF A FAKE SURGEON, MIAMI POLICE
SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ The bodybuilder, a former Mr. Mexico and a
runner-up Mr. Universe, just wanted his pectorals enhanced. But he
woke from his anesthetic-induced sleep to find that the plastic
surgeon, who turned out not to be a doctor at all, had given him
women's implants. He had breasts.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds, said the police on Miami Beach, like some supermarket
tabloid fiction, something that would run alongside tales of aliens
and Elvis and babies born with horns. But the nightmare story of
the former Mr. Mexico, Alexander Baez, is not only real, the police
said, but part of a larger bad dream involving the man patients
knew on fashionable South Beach as Doctor Reinaldo.
</P>
<P>
   The police in Florida were searching Wednesday for Reinaldo
Silvestre, a 58-year-old man who, they say, pretended to be a
doctor and performed an unknown number of cosmetic surgeries in his
Miami Beach office, procedures that resulted in the disfigurement
of Baez and at least two other patients, both women.
</P>
<P>
   Using animal anesthetic, he clumsily cut open and prodded inside
the bodies of his patients, leaving gruesome scars, said Miami
Beach Capt. Charles Press, who watched a videotape of one of
Silvestre's operations. ``It was a butcher job you wouldn't want to
have happen to your dog,'' Press said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, who said Silvestre had operated in his clinic
since at least June 1998, predicted that the number of cases would
probably grow as patients too embarrassed to come forward now are
located and interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very, very badly,'' said Jeannette Bernal, 32, who had
a breast augmentation in the summer of 1998. Silvestre botched the
first one, and only made it worse with four more operations that
left her breasts disfigured, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Silvestre not a plastic surgeon, he is not a doctor
of any kind and holds no license to practice medicine anywhere, the
police said. He has been charged with practicing medicine and
administering narcotics without a license and aggravated battery.
</P>
<P>
   Press would not comment on the search for the fake doctor, who
has vanished and may have fled the country. Two of Silvestre's
employees _ his assistant and anesthesiologist _ have been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story that shocked even veteran investigators in South
Florida, for whom beheadings, serial killings and ritual murders
are old hat. ``I've been here 25 years, and I thought I had seen it
all,'' Press said, ``until this.''
</P>
<P>
   Silvestre, a confident, smiling, Cuban-born man who easily won
people over, his patients told the police, operated from the Ocean
Health Center on Lincoln Road, in trendy South Beach. He lived
well, on Hibiscus Island on Miami Beach, from the $3,000 to $4,000
he charged for each surgery, according to police records.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Baez, hoping to enhance his bodybuilding career,
went in for his surgery. ``Amateur,'' Press said, is too kind to
describe what happened: Baez, who had been given Katamine, an
anesthetic used on animals, kept waking up, in tears, as Silvestre
tried to force the too-large implant into his chest. ``He wakes
up,'' Press said, ``and he's got breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, months and several medical procedures later, Baez has a
large scar on the right side of his chest, and still has the
bulging breast implant on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Baez was not the only one Silvestre put under the knife, the
police said. There was Ms. Bernal, whose boyfriend left her after
the botched surgeries, and Mileidi Pimienta, whose complaint led to
the investigation of Silvestre. When her breast augmentation
surgery only led to several failed attempts to repair the original
damage, resulting in breasts of drastically differing size, she
went to the police.
</P>
<P>
   It was Miss Bernal who made the videotape that would help
investigators make their case against the phony doctor. As a favor
to the doctor after her first surgery _ but before she knew about
his deceit and her own medical problems began to show _ she
video-taped the operation on Baez.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the country, where plastic surgery is still
less common than podiatry, the news of the botched surgeries might
not resonate so loudly. But here in Miami, it was a lead story on
television news, complete with pictures. Looks matter here more
than other places, said experts on cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In part, it is the warm weather, which puts more flesh on
display. But the culture of beauty here comprises more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at themselves in the mirror, and they go looking
to see how they can improve themselves,'' said Seth Thaller, a
professor of medicine at the University of Miami and chief of
plastic surgery at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. ``They do it
to make themselves feel better. They want to put their best face
forward. People down here are out all the time, they wear shorts.
They want to feel like teenagers.''
</P>
<P>
   Thaller said that anyone considering such procedures should
check credentials and backgrounds. But the case of Silvestre is
proof, said both medical experts and investigators, that many
people do not investigate thoroughly and accept, almost on face
value, the promises of plastic surgery. Silvestre, the police said,
would meet people in public and sell them on his practice.
</P>
<P>
   Press compared Silvestre's methods to a horror movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sickening,'' he said, ``how he did it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Under pressure from his own management team and a group of
outside investors, Jeffrey A. Citron agreed to step down Wednesday
as chairman and chief executive of Datek Online Holdings and to
relinquish any role in the company he helped fashion into a Wall
Street powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Citron, who is 29, will still be the company's largest
shareholder, but Datek executives said they hoped his departure
would help remove some of the questions about the company, which
has become the subject of a growing number of criminal and
regulatory inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, law enforcement officials said Wednesday that they are
looking into Datek and Citron as part of an investigation of Robert
E. Brennan, the flamboyant penny-stock promoter who has been banned
from the securities industry for life after bilking small investors
of hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Datek executives said they were unaware of any investigation
into possible ties between Brennan and Datek and Citron but added
that they were cooperating with several criminal and regulatory
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we want to disassociate ourselves from the
past,'' said Edward J. Nicoll, Datek's former president and chief
operating officer who was named to replace Citron as chairman and
chief executive. ``The company's value has been diminished as a
result of the investigations. But we want to do the right thing,
ethically, morally and in every way.''
</P>
<P>
   Datek, which blossomed from a small Brooklyn operation into the
nation's fourth-largest online brokerage firm, is best known on
Wall Street for creating an electronic trading market called Island
ECN, which matches buyers and sellers of stocks without market
makers.
</P>
<P>
   To help finance its plan to register Island as a stock exchange,
the company, which is now based in Edison, N.J., has invited
outsiders to invest in recent months, opening itself to more
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the company has been the subject of
investigations by the Manhattan district attorney, the U.S.
attorney for Manhattan and the Securities and Exchange Commission
for a range of possible offenses, including participating in a
money-laundering scheme, illegal trading activity and fraudulent
accounting practices, according to people close to the
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of concerns about those investigations, Vulcan
Ventures, the venture capital firm financed by Paul Allen, the
co-founder of Microsoft, decided in July to withdraw a planned $300
million investment in Datek. Two other companies, TA Associates of
Boston and Groupe Arnault of Paris, went ahead with investments
totaling $195 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Datek dropped a planned initial public offering of
stock because of similar concerns, despite widespread enthusiasm
about the company's prospects on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Citron, who joined Datek when he was 17 years old and worked his
way up from clerk to day trader to chief executive in 1997, was
considered a technology and trading wizard.
</P>
<P>
   Nicoll said Citron ``literally changed the shape of Wall
Street,'' by transforming a small Brooklyn brokerage firm into the
nation's fourth-largest online brokerage house in less than a
decade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Bill Burnham, a general partner at Softbank Capital Partners
and a former stock analyst who specialized in online trading, said
Datek under Citron's leadership broke new ground on Wall Street by
introducing low-cost electronic trading, thus empowering individual
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an incredibly talented guy,'' Burnham said Wednesday. ``I
think he just realized that the company would benefit if he stepped
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Citron did not return calls for comment. In a statement released
by the company, Citron said he was ``stepping aside to let this
seasoned team of professional managers lead Datek Online as it
begins on an important new phase in its development.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company said that Citron would ``pursue other interests.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nicoll said that Citron's decision to step down came after
more than a month of meetings with his management team and with the
consultation of several of the company's largest investors.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives at Datek also conducted an internal inquiry, a
step prompted by an investigation by the U.S. attorney's office
into trading activities at Datek, according to people close to the
company. Datek's review shed more light on Citron's relationship
with Raft Investments Inc., a firm that loaned money to day traders
and is under inquiry by the U.S. attorney's office, people close to
the company said, though they declined to elaborate on what the
review found.
</P>
<P>
   Following the company's review, Citron agreed to stepdown.
Although Citron owns about 30 percent of Datek, the company said in
its statement that he ``entered into an agreement'' to turn over
all his voting and management rights to the company's board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pact, Citron will have no role in the company
for two years. After that time, it is unclear what role he may
resume.

CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR SEEKS OVERHAUL OF STATE ELECTION LAWS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD Conn. _ Struggling to keep his head above a bribery
scandal that threatens to swamp his administration, Gov. John G.
Rowland of Connecticut urged legislators Wednesday to undertake a
sweeping examination of state election and ethics laws.
</P>
<P>
   Although the call included no specifics, it was the first time
the governor voiced his support for any overhaul of the laws
governing the financing of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The change of heart comes at a time when the governor faces
daily questions about the actions of one of his running mates last
fall, Paul J. Silvester, the former state treasurer, who pleaded
guilty last month to money laundering while in office. And it
follows an accumulating series of ethics issues that have become an
insistent backdrop for Rowland's administration since he took
office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Silvester, who lost the race for treasurer last November,
pleaded guilty to accepting cash kickbacks in return for placing
$500 million in state pension investments with certain equity
funds. He is now cooperating with federal prosecutors, and lawyers
for some other politicians under investigation say Silvester has
provided details about his dealings with high-level Connecticut
officials of both parties, including the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who appointed Silvester to the vacant treasury
post in 1997, denies any wrongdoing. Nevertheless the investigation
seems to be consuming a great deal of Rowland's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Usually affable and approachable, Rowland Wednesday was hustled
away after his speech by an unusually large contingent of state
troopers, and an aide slammed the door of his limousine when
reporters tried to ask him what kind of overhaul he might have in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Silvester provides information for investigations by
the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the scandal has become a baleful presence hovering
over politicians of both parties in a state that has traditionally
been known for relatively clean politics.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's call came during a speech at the 25th anniversary
luncheon of the state Elections Enforcement Commission, which, just
hours before, had voted to begin an investigation of the financing
of Silvester's campaign, including his links to the governor and
the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who battled many ethical questions in his first term,
remained popular and was overwhelmingly re-elected last year. Now,
both his friends and opponents are wondering about the impact of
the current scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even short of proving criminal behavior by the governor or his
aides themselves, there's a cumulative weight of all these
stories,'' said Sen. George C. Jepsen, a Democrat from Stamford who
is the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime supporters of tighter campaign-finance laws reacted
with skepticism to the overture from Rowland, whose emissaries have
fought such legislation during past legislative sessions. Miles S.
Rapoport, a former Connecticut secretary of the state who now is
executive director of Democracy Works, a nonprofit group in the
state that supports drastic change in campaign-finance laws, said
he was concerned that the governor did not specify even one change
he would support.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his remarks today, there was absolutely no content,''
Rapoport said. ``If the governor is truly open to taking away the
desperate need for dollars that in part drove the Silvester
scandal, I would be delighted. Given his past, I'm skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland said he expected debate and many changes in the laws
when the Legislature convenes this winter. ``What a great way to
begin our session this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland directed the staffs of the state Ethics Commission and
the state Elections Enforcement Commission to develop ``a reform
package that all of us in a very bipartisan way can live with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy, if I can call it that _ the scandal, if I can
call it that _ over the last two weeks, has helped us all focus on
the problems and the improvements that still have to take place,''
Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   After the governor was driven away, his spokesman, Dean Pagani,
said the review could include the possible taxpayer financing of
campaigns. Pagani said the governor also would consider a ban on
contributions from anyone who does business with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``His position is that everything should be looked at,'' Pagani
said.

Don Zimmer says he was more scared than anything 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Coach Don Zimmer was at his club's optional workout
yesterday, looking as handsome as ever despite getting hit by Chuck
Knoblauch's foul ball in the fifth inning of Game 1 on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer was taken to the clubhouse for a couple of innings, but
later returned to the dugout holding an ice pack on his left cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the ball come at me,'' Zimmer said. ``What I did was
turn my head. When the ball hit me, I didn't know whether it hit me
up in the head, whether it hit me in the cheek bone; I didn't know.
When I woke up this morning, I knew where it hit me the hardest,
right here on the neck. It scared me more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer has been through worse, and not because he's a former
Rangers manager. He was hit twice in the head by pitches as a
player, in 1953 in the minor leagues and in 1956 by Cincinnati's
Hal Jeffcoat while playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers. That injury
required a metal plate to be inserted inside his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys sitting in the dugout are not paying
attention,'' Zimmer said. ``As many times as I've been hit in the
head, I pay attention. If I hadn't been paying attention, it might
have hit me solid and I could have been hurt.'' Yankees changes
Manager Joe Torre is planning two changes in his lineup for Game 2
tonight. Chili Davis is expected to be the designated hitter
instead of Darryl Strawberry, and Joe Girardi will catch instead of
Jorge Posada.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is 3-for-12 with two home runs against Rangers starter
Rick Helling, and Strawberry has never faced him. Girardi is the
regular catcher for Yankees starter Andy Pettitte as well as Roger
Clemens, and Posada is usually behind the plate for Orlando
Hernandez and David Cone. Greatness rides the subway The Yankees
have won one game against the Rangers, but already two themes have
emerged in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Will there be a Subway Series?
</P>
<P>
   Are the Yankees the Team of the Decade?
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a Subway Series heated up even more after the New York
Mets defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks, 8-4, in the first game of
their National League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a great team,'' Yankees general manager Brian
Cashman said. ``It's a scary team. I'm sure the National League
opponents that have to go through them aren't comfortable playing
them. I just hope we can get to the World Series, but I'll
certainly be rooting for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves are usually considered the team of the '90s
because they have won eight division titles. But they've also won
only one World Series while the Yankees have won two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think we're qualified to be in that debate,''
Cashman said.

THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN IN KANSAS, MISSOURI COVERED BY NEW HEALTH
PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONNA MCGUIRE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michelle Guymon feels fortunate that her three children avoided
broken bones and other health problems the last seven or eight
years. Without insurance, the medical bills would have been
disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to take our chances,'' the Blue Springs woman
said. Insurance, she said, was something the family just could not
afford.
</P>
<P>
   Her children are covered now _ through the state.
</P>
<P>
   Since Missouri and Kansas started new children's
health-insurance programs in the last year, more than 65,000
previously uninsured children have gained coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity has helped other children, too. About 33,000
children from families too poor to qualify for the new programs
have been provided traditional Medicaid instead.
</P>
<P>
   Insured children can receive everything from immunizations and
physicals to X-rays, counseling and dental care.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by $24 billion in federal funding, this nationwide
crusade marks America's largest expansion of health insurance for
children in more than 30 years. Kansas and Missouri officials are
campaigning to enroll thousands more children in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've touched a lot of children through this effort that we've
never been able to touch before,'' said John Garlinger, a spokesman
for the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services,
which receives about $31 million annually in federal funding for
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Eligible children live in families in which parents earn too
much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford private
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, officials hope to enroll 2.8 million children in the
new insurance programs and 600,000 more in Medicaid by next
September.
</P>
<P>
   So far Kansas and Missouri are meeting or exceeding their
enrollment targets. Missouri officials think their program may be
one reason the state's number of uninsured people declined in 1998
while the number of uninsured rose nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Yet challenges remain, starting with continued recruitment. Many
families are still not aware of the new programs. The problem
appears more serious in St. Louis, where enrollment lags behind
Kansas City levels. Yet even in Kansas City, recruiters constantly
are considering new ways to spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem: Gaining insurance does not guarantee access to
services, especially dental care. A committee recently formed in
Kansas City will study why Jackson County does not have enough
dentists. It is a problem also experienced in parts of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, some parents have turned down health insurance for
their children after learning that they were too poor for the new
program and eligible instead for Medicaid. They think Medicaid has
a stigma. They don't want it.
</P>
<P>
   That is a perception state officials worried about when they
started the new insurance program, too. Both programs are funded by
federal and state funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people, especially in the Midwest, don't want to feel
like they are dependent on the government,'' said Susan Kannarr,
who directs implementation of the new Kansas program for the
Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services. ``How do we
convince those people that health insurance is important for their
kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Some people need no convincing.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Warren Jackson took his grandson to the dentist and
learned that the 9-year-old needed a root canal. Jackson, who lives
in Kansas City, Kan., knew his daughter could not afford the $650
bill. Neither could he. Perhaps the dentist could work out some
type of payment plan, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jackson told the dentist's receptionist that his grandson
had enrolled in HealthWave, the new Kansas health insurance
program. She replied that the root canal was covered. Completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a godsend,'' he recalled. ``Just unreal.''
Criteria vary
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, children up to age 19 can enroll in the new
health-insurance plans if they meet eligibility guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Those guidelines vary among states, with Missouri having one of
the most generous plans in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A Missouri family of four can qualify with earnings of nearly
$50,000, though some premiums apply to the higher-income families.
The Guymons, for example, pay less than $70 a month to cover three
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saves me $100 a month,'' said Michelle Guymon, who
considered adding the children to her employer's plan when she
started working for a public school this fall. Her husband is
self-employed in the construction business and has no company-paid
insurance. If she had put her children and her husband on her work
plan, her paycheck would have been gobbled up by insurance
premiums, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's new insurance program, called MC+ For Kids, is an
expansion of the state's Medicaid program. It offers the same
benefits and the same choices of medical plans as traditional
Medicaid. Statewide, more than 52,000 children have enrolled since
coverage began in September 1998. About 20,000 other children have
been added to traditional Medicaid rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas created HealthWave separate from Medicaid, though
benefits are the same. A family of four can earn up to nearly
$33,000 annually and still qualify for HealthWave.
</P>
<P>
   More than 13,700 children have enrolled in HealthWave since it
started in January. An additional 13,000 Kansas children have
joined traditional Medicaid rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kansas guidelines, one child may be eligible for Medicaid
while another in the same family is eligible for HealthWave. As a
result, some parents may need different pediatricians for different
children. That is one of the few complaints child advocates have
about the Kansas program.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, child advocates worry that income verification
rules discourage some families from applying. State officials say
such safeguards (parents must show pay stubs as proof of income)
are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be some checks or balances or everybody will come
in,'' said Marilyn Knipp, associate director of the Missouri
Department of Social Services, which receives about $52 million a
year in federal funds for its new program.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics think the state is being too generous with its
income guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear from one side (the child advocates) that we are not
enrolling enough kids and from the other side that we are enrolling
too many,'' Knipp said. ``That was unexpected. These are uninsured
kids who are eligible for health care,'' she said, and agency
officials think they should be covered.
Spreading the word
</P>
<P>
   For decades, states have enrolled poor families in Medicaid when
the families applied for other state services, such as cash
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   They had no program set up to inform working families about the
new health-insurance program. How would they get the word out?
</P>
<P>
   A committee at the Local Investment Commission in Kansas City
began brainstorming last year. The Heart of America United Way set
up meetings.
</P>
<P>
   There were some bumps, especially in Missouri. Some early
promotional materials failed to explain what MC+ For Kids was all
about. Other materials incorrectly listed the eligibility criteria
as being the same for all income levels. Applications in Spanish
were late being printed.
</P>
<P>
   Other efforts, however, helped. For example, traditional
enrollment forms for Medicaid in Kansas and Missouri were more than
a dozen pages long. At two pages the new forms are much easier to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   State hot lines also have been set up. Recruiters staffed booths
at both state fairs and sent brochures to schools.
</P>
<P>
   And in Kansas, people like Helen Monroe were hired.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe is the HealthWave recruiter for Wyandotte County. She
visits businesses, churches, civic organizations, malls _ anywhere
she thinks she might find eligible children. She asks employers to
inform employees about the program. She asks groceries to let her
put up posters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never go anywhere without an application,'' Monroe said
recently while visiting a meeting of foster grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   After explaining the program, she asked the grandparents to help
her spread the word. Some asked for forms. One promised to talk to
people at her church.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, recruiters think churches and small businesses will
be the next places to go in search of families. They have already
placed advertisements on city buses and sent thousands of fliers to
schools.
</P>
<P>
   It may take several times of seeing the MC+ message before
parents apply, said Linda Johnson, who leads a health-insurance
task force for the Local Investment Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some parents won't let their kids ride bikes or play outside,
because they are afraid the kids will get hurt,'' she said. ``Plus,
these kids don't get preventive (dental) care, so we are seeing
kids with major dental problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In both states officials look at the numbers of children
enrolling and know they have made a dent in the uninsured
population. But they are relying on old census data that said
60,000 Kansas children and 90,000 Missouri children lacked
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   They are uncertain how many more children need to reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find out how many kids are still showing up at
doctors' offices and pharmacies and dentists' offices still
uninsured,'' Johnson said. ``My goal is to make sure (the numbers)
are going down.''

POPULARITY OF CHARTER SCHOOLS HURTS KC SCHOOL DISTRICT'S
ENROLLMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The unexpected popularity of charter schools
is playing havoc with the Kansas City School District's efforts to
adequately staff classrooms, district officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks after classes resumed, Van Horn and Southeast high
schools still have 40 to 50 students in some classes, far above the
recommended number.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not something we want for our children,'' Mary
Long, Van Horn principal, said this week. ``But it's the situation
we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers at other schools that experienced large drops in
enrollment this year will be reassigned to other schools.
</P>
<P>
   The district notified 14 elementary teachers this week that they
were being transferred. The district said it expected to hire 26
more high school teachers and a still-undetermined number of middle
school teachers to ease the overcrowding problem.
</P>
<P>
   The district also is asking students in schools that are
overcrowded to voluntarily transfer to less-crowded buildings. No
layoffs are planned, because the district still has teaching
vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the move of students to charters may force the
district to close schools, some board members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the enrollment to justify them anymore,'' board
member Lance Loewenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many urban districts, the Kansas City district typically
reorganizes its teaching staff in the first quarter of every school
year to account for unexpected shifts in enrollment. District
officials say the annual reorganization is disruptive but necessary
to comply with Missouri class-size standards and stay within the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   District officials, however, said it was impossible to plan for
the full effect of charter schools. The publicly funded
experimental schools began operating in Kansas City this year and
already have enrolled an estimated 4,500 students, including many
former district students.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulty in projecting which schools district students would
attend resulted in some schools being understaffed while creating
student overcrowding at others.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we make predictions on the unknown?'' said chief of
staff Cheri Shannon, who oversees the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The staffing issue still angers many parents.
</P>
<P>
   At a school board meeting Tuesday night, parents from Hartman
Elementary School, which serves children in kindergarten and first
grade, complained that moving teachers this late in the school year
would be traumatic for their children. The district initially
allocated 10 kindergarten teachers to Hartman this year, but
enrollment plunged to 289 from 428.
</P>
<P>
   Parents pleaded that the district not move the teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they could not afford to maintain a 12-to-1
student-to-teacher ratio at Hartman while other elementary schools
had more than 30 students in some classes. In kindergarten through
second grade, the state recommends 20 students per teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The district Tuesday notified the Hartman principal that the
school would be losing four kindergarten teachers and one
first-grade teacher. But that plan was put on hold after board
members asked for a meeting next Tuesday to receive a more detailed
report.
</P>
<P>
   At the same school board meeting, a Van Horn parent complained
about the lack of teachers and the long-term use of substitutes in
a social studies class. She said students were being told to do
their homework from other classes, visit or sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no instruction occurring,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She questioned whether students in the class would be given a
grade of incomplete, given the amount of class time lost.
</P>
<P>
   The district on Wednesday approved hiring 11 more teachers for
Van Horn, and officials said students would not receive an
incomplete in the course.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Patricia Kurtz questioned whether the students
would ever be given a chance to catch up on missed course work or
just miss out on learning.
</P>
<P>
   District officials say they intend to begin the planning process
earlier next year to reduce staff movement during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that it is disruptive to the educational process,''
Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. warned the board to expect the
enrollment figures and teacher allocations to continue to shift
throughout the current school year. The district already has found
many cases of students simultaneously enrolled in district and
charter schools. In other instances, students who began the year in
charter schools have returned to district schools, while students
who began the year in district schools have moved to charters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, at this point, can't say what our enrollment is going to be
over the next six months,'' Demps told the board. ``The numbers
could change again next week. We're in a very uncertain time.''

SUPPORT GROWS IN CONGRESS FOR PENSION SYSTEM TO AID HIGH EARNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Md.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Support is growing quickly in Congress for a vast expansion of
retirement tax breaks for business owners, executives and highly
paid workers, moves that Republicans and Democrats alike say would
be popular with voters.
</P>
<P>
   The leading proposal, known as the Portman-Cardin Pension Reform
Plan, has 148 sponsors and would raise the $10,000 limit on annual
tax-deductible savings in 401(k) plans to $15,000 and, for those
age 50 and older, to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The stated goal is to include many more employees in retirement
programs by making the plans more attractive to business owners and
to simplify complex rules that are designed to make sure most
workers share in the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, the plan's leading sponsor, said that
more firms are opting for executive-only plans without tax breaks.
``We need to try something new because the system we have isn't
working,'' he said, ``and we need to get more people covered.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the bill's co-sponsor acknowledges that it may not do
that. Critics say the bill is actually little more than cover for a
plan to shower new tax benefits on the rich.
</P>
<P>
   One provision would allow businesses to cut pension benefits by
as much as one-third for workers making less than $160,000 annually
without reducing benefits for those earning more. Supporters say
they expect few businesses to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Stein, a University of Alabama Law School pension
specialist who analyzed the Portman-Cardin plan, said it ``should
be called the Retirement Reduction Act.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill's co-sponsor, Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said in a speech
last week that the bill might not increase the number of people who
would collect retirement benefits, but it had such strong support
from business that it was worth giving its provisions a try.
</P>
<P>
   Easing regulations and raising savings limits would make
retirement plans more attractive to business owners, he said, and
should be viewed as ``part of an overall strategy that will
eventually cover more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardin and Rep. Rob Andrews, D-N.J., are circulating a letter
among House Democrats urging them to support the bill. Andrews said
``anything we do that increases contributions to retirement plans
is a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics acknowledge tens of thousands of new retirement plans
would be created if Portman-Cardin is enacted, but they fear that
few lower-paid workers would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Halperin, a pension specialist at Harvard Law School, has
estimated that the expanded tax breaks would let a person easily
accumulate tax-deferred retirement benefits of $5 million, even if
not one additional lower-paid worker got a dollar in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill turns the concept of using tax benefits to expand
retirement income security on its head,'' he said, adding that the
proposal ``while well intentioned and containing many good ideas,
would on the whole do more harm than good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Bennett of Buffalo, N.Y., president of Hodgson, Russ,
Andrews, Woods &AMP; Goodyear, the largest law firm in upstate New
York, said that if the Portman-Cardin plan becomes law its likely
effect ``would be to expand retirement plans that benefit only
owners of business and to dramatically reduce the benefits
granted'' to the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bennett, a pension specialist, cited examples from
retirement plans that she has drafted for clients to show that most
of the benefits already flow to a few highly paid employees, a
situation that she said would worsen drastically if the proposals
were enacted.
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``many of my clients will not like what I am
saying or that I am saying it.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said support for the
proposal was spreading quickly among Democrats eager to tell voters
that they have made an easily understandable improvement to the
401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   The official said none of the lawmakers he had talked to seemed
to understand the provisions that could harm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and critics agree that the greatest need is to have
more people collect benefits when they retire. Supporters have
focused on how more people would be ``covered'' by such plans, a
measure of how many people could potentially participate in a plan,
rather than how many will actually collect benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also agree that increasing the amounts that can be
put away untaxed will encourage more savings in retirement plans.
But critics say that the increase will be narrowly focused among
those already saving the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Few workers are held back by the current $10,000 limit on
tax-deferred 401(k) savings.
</P>
<P>
   Only 4 to 11 percent of 401(k) plan participants save the
maximum now, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute,
a nonprofit group in Washington whose studies are regarded as the
standard for the benefits industry. Workers save an average of
$3,000 each in 401(k) plans, the institute estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Portman-Cardin may be included in a bill to raise the minimum
wage by a dollar, to $6.15, in two steps.
</P>
<P>
   The additional $10,000 that older workers could save each year
would add $360,000 to a retirement nest egg of someone who is 50
years old, retires at 65 and earns historic stock market returns.
</P>
<P>
   Current law generally limits the total amount that a worker and
an employer together can set aside in a retirement plan to 25
percent of pay up to a maximum of $30,000 of savings.
Portman-Cardin would increase that to $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision would let some people sock away their entire
paycheck, where it would grow untaxed until the money is withdrawn
in retirement. That option would be attractive to those who can
live off investment income, such as dividends and capital gains,
and to those two-income families who can live on one paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Raising benefits at the top means that 62 percent of the new tax
breaks would flow to people in the top 10 percent income group,
analysis using the Treasury Department's economic modeling software
found.
</P>
<P>
   The middle fifth of households would get just 3.2 percent of the
tax breaks, according to the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a Washington advocacy group for the poor, which
performed the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The Portman-Cardin plan has wide support from business
organizations and is similar to proposals by Sen. William Roth, ,
R-Del., for whom the popular tax-free Roth IRAs are named.
</P>
<P>
   The provision that most concerns critics would increase the
maximum annual pay that can be considered in calculating pension
benefits by 47 percent, to $235,000 from $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   That would let highly paid business owners increase their own
pension benefits by 47 percent without raising benefits for
employees earning less than $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, the provision would allow a business owner to
collect the same number of dollars from the retirement plan for
himself, while cutting retirement benefits by up to one-third for
everyone making less than $160,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But James Delaplane, vice president for retirement policy at the
Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans in Washington,
said market forces should discourage that type of response.

JOHNNY OATES ADJUSTS RANGERS ROSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Because the Yankees are pitching left-hander Andy
Pettitte tonight, Rangers manager Johnny Oates is making one lineup
change and considering another.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said Roberto Kelly will start in center field instead of
Tom Goodwin, and he's considering using Luis Alicea at second base
for Mark McLemore. Alicea was used at second base against
left-handers late in the season until he suffered a pulled
hamstring muscle on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea hit .290 against left-handers this season while McLemore,
a switch hitter, hit .163. Oates said he'll wait to see how Alicea
is running today before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also has hit left-handers much better than Goodwin. Kelly
hit .358 against them while Goodwin hit .262.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Oates said, ``We just need to swing the bats better.
If we don't swing the bats, we're not going to win. We ought to
score more runs by accident, but there's not much else we can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called going up there and hitting the baseball. We had
one chance to run \RTuesday\S and Pudge \RRodriguez\S stole a base.
You've got the nine best hitters in the lineup. There's nothing
else you can do but relax and try to get some hits.'' Advice from
Dent One member of the Rangers understands what it's like to hit
well and win in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Bench coach Bucky Dent not only hit his famous home run in the
1978 playoff game against the Boston Red Sox, but he was the Most
Valuable Player in the World Series. Dent hit .417 with 10 hits in
24 at-bats to lead the Yankees to a world championship in six games
against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   In watching the Rangers struggle against the Yankees, Dent said,
``The big thing is for us to relax. Over the course of the year,
we've gone into a little bit of a funk at times and broken out of
it. So, we just need to relax, do the things we've always done and
remain positive because we have a good-hitting club.''
</P>
<P>
   Dent said the Rangers just need that one hit to get the offense
rolling. They didn't get it in Tuesday's 8-0 loss to the Yankees.
Instead, Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez struck out Todd Zeile
with the bases loaded in the first inning and got both Juan
Gonzalez and Rafael Palmeiro to fly out with two runners on base in
the third inning. Those were the Rangers' two best chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this team breaks out, it's going to be big,'' Dent said.
He said it ``We're a very good offensive ballclub, and we'll break
out of it somewhere along the line. You just hope it's sooner than
later.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rangers general manager Doug Melvin. Record losing streak The
Rangers have lost seven consecutive Division Series games, tying
the record held by the Houston Astros. The Rangers lost the final
three games of the 1996 series to the Yankees, got swept by them in
three games last year and lost on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros lost the final three games of the 1981 Division
Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, got swept by the Atlanta
Braves in 1997 and lost the first game to San Diego last year.
Pursuing Bernie Doug Melvin was the Yankees scouting director in
1985 when he signed Bernie Williams as a 17-year-old free agent out
of Puerto Rico. He considered signing him again last off-season
when Williams was a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went through my mind last year to get heavily involved with
him,'' Melvin said. ``But at the time, we were a pretty good
offensive ballclub and our needs have been pitching. We were
pursuing that No. 1 starting pitcher that everybody wants us to
get.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was in Banff, Alberta, last \RNovember\S on a week's
vacation when I got a call from Bernie Williams. I returned the
call and Bernie was on the phone. He said he just signed with the
Yankees. I didn't know what he was calling about, whether to
express interest or not. I was fortunate to get a guy like Rafael
Palmeiro.''

ADVERTISING: GUERRILLA MARKETING IS GOING MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The moon hung in the sky over Union Square, and fans
of the fusion-jazz group Incognito were lined up in front of the
Irving Plaza theater, waiting for the doors to open. Ivan Ramirez,
``guerrilla marketer,'' spied an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   With two assistants _ Ian Zucker, an 18-year-old just out of
high school, and Danny DeJesus, a much-tattooed disk jockey known
as Ruido/Mentol Nomad _ he descended on the group, handing out
cassette tapes of an unrelated band called Supreme Beings of
Leisure and taping posters of another group, Break Beat Era, onto
the cart of a willing hot-dog vendor. ``We'll be selective,''
Ramirez said with a certain degree of satisfaction. ``We won't give
out the tapes to everybody. We try to niche it.''
</P>
<P>
   The people in line reacted with mild interest, amusement or
indifference. ``I get this all the time,'' said one, Timothy
McDaniel. ``This word-of-mouth and foot promotion is the best. You
have it in your hand. You can ask them questions.'' As Ramirez
worked his way down the line, a theater security guard stuck out a
beefy hand for a cassette. He got one.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics, long in place at small companies trying to get a
toehold, are starting to be embraced by the mainstream as they
evolve into more subtle forms. Coca-Cola Co. has used Ramirez's
company, Cornerstone Promotions in New York, as guerrilla marketers
for Sprite. Nike has used it to help drum up interest in its Quick
Six shoes. Even the National Football League has joined the game,
trying to develop fans among 12- to-24-year-olds. Other companies
have invested in their own guerrilla marketing teams, whose
full-time job is to promote company products at the grass-roots
level.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose, these companies say, is mainly to reach younger
consumers by cutting past all the static that the companies
themselves created and that young people have tuned out _
television, radio, print and Internet ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that to reach teens, we have to talk to them where
they live, in a language that they understand, with a message that
is meaningful and delivered by a credible source,'' said Polly
Howes, a Coke spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   With guerrilla marketing _ unexpected, subtle and usually
delivered by young people _ companies say they can get higher sales
and sometimes rejuvenate their images, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a term for out of the box, plus some,'' said Lisa
Skriloff, president of Multicultural Marketing Resources, which
specializes in advertising by demographic group. ``It goes beyond
tried-and-true methods. It's something that would almost catch
someone by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see it as one more way to blur the traditional
definitions of advertising and marketing. ``Advertising used to be
something you could point to and say was advertising,'' said John
Stauber, editor of P.R. Watch, a newsletter that monitors the
public-relations and marketing industries. ``There's now more and
more advertising that is more propagandistic. It slips the
marketing below the level of any audience awareness and often puts
it in the mouth of somebody who is more likely to be trusted by
that target audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of guerrilla marketing is still about hitting the pavement,
with ``street teams,'' to hand out free samples and fliers. But
lately it has begun to take other forms as well, through product
placement and unexpected appearances on television and the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh Samantha, a seven-year-old juice company based in Maine,
has three employees in their early 20s who drive up and down the
East Coast in a Winnebago towing a huge bottle of juice. Their
finest moment, in their opinion, came earlier this year when they
got themselves, and their bottle, onto the ``Today'' show. The team
members dressed up in fruit and animal costumes, made sure they
were assembled before the program's studio windows at Rockefeller
Center at 4:30 a.m., ahead of the crowds, and took along a huge
banner with the company's name on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They held up the banner and the camera showed them maybe 10 or
15 times,'' said Betta Stothart, the juice company's marketing
director. They also persuaded the show's hosts to take a bottle of
juice, and it sat on the set for the rest of the show. A similar
coup took place recently with a film crew making the television
series ``Sex and the City,'' Ms. Stothart said. The crew agreed to
show the juice on camera if the company would supply the product
free.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when it's going to work,'' she said.
``Sometimes it fails miserably. They've gotten a lot of parking
tickets.'' Still, she called it ``the most powerful way to
communicate the identity of our company.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For other companies, guerrilla marketing is one tool among many.
``We do it to complement our air war, in traditional TV and
print,'' said Glenn Chin, director of life style marketing for EA
Sports, a division of Electronic Arts that makes sports video
games.
</P>
<P>
   A recently developed boxing game called Knockout Kings includes
subtle messages about Ecko, a clothing line, as well as a singer
called O who has yet to be marketed by his recording label,
Hollywood Records. ``It seemed a perfect synergy,'' Chin said.
``Kids can dress their boxer in Ecko clothes. It's
cross-pollination.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, EA Sports has guerrilla-marketing teams in 12 areas
of the country who visit concerts and other places where young
people congregate, as well as student representatives on 30 college
campuses, Chin said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies trying to break into crowded markets have turned
to the same program. ``You need to be incredibly proactive,'' said
Michele Peranteau, a spokeswoman for Jeremy's Microbatch ice cream,
based in Philadelphia. ``You can't be reactive.'' Jeremy's, founded
three years ago, has street teams in half a dozen cities who
distribute coupons and samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very cost-effective,'' she said, adding that sales have
risen 75 percent since the teams were first sent out in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's company, Cornerstone, was founded three years ago by
Jon Cohen and Rob Stone, two friends who were sales executives in
the music business. Using their connections, they put together a
group of disk jockeys from around the country and now use the group
to promote consumer products like Nike sneakers and Sprite and a
Web company, Boo.com, that is being developed to sell sports
apparel and footwear. Some of the promotion is through CDs that
include ads as well as music and are distributed monthly to DJs.
</P>
<P>
   In another program, which began in May, Cornerstone signed a
contract to promote the Nike Quick Six, a shoe that was new last
spring. As disk jockeys who had been given pairs of the shoes
extolled them on the air, most listeners were unaware that the
shoes were being marketed to them.
</P>
<P>
   At Nike, the tactic was only one part of what a company
spokesman described as ``intersecting our brand with popular
culture.'' Did sales go up? A spokesman, Erin Patton, would say
only that the shoe was ``a very successful shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most successful marketers these days are really striving
for a more personal, two-way communication with the consumer,'' he
added, ``and the vehicle of that is the nuance of culture the
consumer is interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, for his part, says promoting products by connecting them
to popular music does work. ``I'm not saying we can be as effective
as a huge national ad,'' he said, emphasizing that his company is
extremely selective about what it promotes because of worries about
losing its credibility. ``But word of mouth can be so effective,''
he added. ``We get to the taste makers.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is also betting heavily on the Internet for its
music clients as well as consumer-products companies, transferring
the tactics of street teams like those led by Ramirez to the
virtual battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a team of people who do the equivalent of what Ivan is
doing on the Internet,'' Cohen said. ``We'll bring in X amount of
kids; they'll go to every search engine and set up giveaways and
get people to sign up for things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a street team is part of guerrilla marketing,'' he
added, ``but we're moving beyond that. There's no end to it. The
end is if it's not done in a tasteful manner, it'll be everybody
just throwing things at everybody.''

CLINTON ACCUSES SENATE OF BIAS IN REJECTING JUDGE CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE AND KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House continued Wednesday to accuse
Senate Republicans of unfair treatment of minorities in the
selection of federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   One day after a party-line vote defeating the nomination of
Ronnie White, the first African-American to serve on the Missouri
Supreme Court, President Clinton's spokesman produced a study that
said whites were confirmed more easily than minority nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact remains, there appears to be a higher bar for them,''
White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said. ``Unfortunately, Judge
White had the bar moved up even higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kit Bond characterized the White House accusations as
``unmitigated political hogwash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is once again playing the race card,'' said
the Missouri Republican. ``It's absolutely unsupported, and it's
unworthy of someone in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Black groups who also criticized the rejection of White as a
U.S. district judge in St. Louis asked whether the Senate had
created a new judicial litmus test _ unequivocal support of the
death penalty. White declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Others continued to see the defeat of White, the only judicial
appointment killed on the Senate floor since Robert Bork in 1987,
as an election ploy by Republican Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri.
He faces a re-election race next year against Gov. Mel Carnahan, a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft disputed that allegation, noting that he had opposed
the nomination since shortly after Clinton nominated White in 1997.
Republican Senate leaders also denied that any higher bar was
imposed on White or minorities in general. They continued to say
that White's soft record on the death penalty was the key factor.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said support for White crumbled when Bond, who had
served as White's sponsor, pulled his support at the last minute
Tuesday. That left White without an official Senate backer from his
home state, an untenable position for a nominee already opposed by
Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must defer to my colleagues from Missouri with respect to a
nominee whose jurisdiction, if confirmed, would be wholly limited
to that state,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican and
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon, a Democrat who tried to
unseat Bond last year, accused the senator of betraying the black
voters who had given unusual support to a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, who had accused the Republican of blocking the nomination
in 1998, on Tuesday told the Associated Press that Bond's vote was
a ``classic bait-and-switch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the political heat's off, he's safe to assist in
tanking the nomination of a fine man for blatant political
reasons,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said he expected a partisan reaction from Nixon. Bond
explained that he changed his mind when he heard from law
enforcement officers who were not comfortable with White's record
on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Tuesday issued a sharp condemnation of a ``process
that has lost any pretense of fairness.'' On Wednesday the White
House referred to a study conducted by the nonpartisan Citizens for
Independent Court in Washington. The analysis covered the 1997-98
term of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, 75 percent of 55 women and minorities were
confirmed, compared with 85 percent of the 68 white men nominated,
the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The average number of days between nomination and final action
was 167 for white men and 243 for women and minorities. For
successful nominees, the number of days was 154 for white men and
194 for women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The study also compared white nominees to minorities. It found
that 79 of 92 white men and women nominees eventually were
confirmed, compared with 20 of 31 minority nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft let a spokesman respond to questions Wednesday about
Clinton's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous for the president to accuse...senators from
all over the nation of racial bias,'' Steve Hilton said. ``Where is
one scrap of evidence for such scurrilous suggestions?''
</P>
<P>
   White's record as both a judge and a three-term state lawmaker,
he said, ``is a complete refutation to those kinds of assertions.''
</P>
<P>
   According to data compiled by Ashcroft's office, the senator had
voted for 23 of 26 black judicial nominees and 50 of 58 women
nominees in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Ashcroft and Bond released a letter they sent to
Clinton urging him to make another nomination soon. The nominee
should ``enjoy widespread support in our state,'' especially from
law enforcement officials, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Black groups, meantime, continued to assert that White's skin
color ultimately cost him a federal judgeship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're outraged,'' said Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich, executive
director of the Black Leadership Forum, a group that represents 26
civil rights groups, including the NAACP and the Urban League. ``We
think that this is a blatant and outrageous example of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting White, the Senate sent a message that only nominees
who expressed unwavering support of the death penalty pass muster,
Scruggs-Leftwich said. That, by itself, could undercut the number
of blacks who won federal judgeships, because many
African-Americans traditionally oppose capital punishment. They
contend that the death sentence is disproportionately meted out to
black defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate should avoid judicial litmus tests, particularly when
it comes to the death penalty, said Robert Popper, a law professor
at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``In death-penalty cases, you want judges to be very, very
careful in reviewing decisions with capital-punishment
implications, because life is at stake,'' Popper said. ``It seems
to me there should be a right for a justice to dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations continued Wednesday that Ashcroft opposed White for
political gain. Democrats charged that Ashcroft wanted to keep
focus on the death- penalty issue, which ensnared Carnahan earlier
this year when he commuted a death row inmate's sentence at the
request of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters asked Carnahan on Wednesday whether he thought race
played a part in the Senate's rejection of White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have to make their own judgment,'' Carnahan
said. ``It is statistically true that minorities and women have a
harder time being confirmed by the Republican U.S. Senate. It is
very graphic how many of the minorities have been held back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bailey, assistant dean of the University of
Missouri-Columbia law school, said he also sensed that politics was
at play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge White became a pawn in the political match that's
occurring between Ashcroft and Carnahan,'' Bailey said. ``I think
Ashcroft is demonstrating that he's tough on crime, and he's going
to try to demonstrate that Carnahan is not as tough and concerned
about crime as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats noted that in a majority of the instances when White
voted to reverse a death sentence, the Ashcroft appointees on the
court joined him in an unanimous agreements. The Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington said Ashcroft did
``irreversible damage to the integrity of his office.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft drew support from the conservative Landmark Legal
Foundation, based in Kansas City. The Senate's job is to provide
advice and consent regarding any presidential nominee and not to
``rubber stamp'' the choice, noted foundation president Mark Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that White was strongly opposed by law enforcement
groups, Levin said it followed that the Senate would reject him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, this has nothing to do with Mr. White's race,'' Levin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of groups out there who want to turn
this into something it's not. They're getting their lead from the
president of the United States, who is demagoguing this issue to
the hilt.''

PEPSICO PROFIT RISES 6.7 PERCENT, SLIGHTLY BEATING EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a performance that was in line with expectations, Pepsico
Inc. reported a 6.7 percent increase in third-quarter profit
Wednesday on the strength of higher earnings at its Frito-Lay and
Tropicana units.
</P>
<P>
   Net income rose to $507 million, or 34 cents a diluted share,
compared with $475 million, or 32 cents a share, in the period a
year earlier. The results were adjusted to include the August 1998
purchase of the Tropicana juice company and the spinoff of the
Pepsi Bottling Group. Analysts had expected the company to earn 33
cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 6.5 percent, to $4.58 billion from $4.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the profit growth came from the Frito-Lay snack
unit, where earnings increased 11 percent, and Tropicana, where
profit grew 54 percent. That was in contrast to the performance at
Pepsi-Cola North America, the largest division of the company's
soft-drink business, where case sales were flat compared with those
in the period a year earlier. Concentrate shipments declined 2.5
percent, although revenue increased 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The situation at Pepsi-Cola, which is a result of higher
supermarket prices after several years of steep discounts, is
mirrored at the Coca-Cola Co., Pepsi's rival. Nevertheless, the
earnings announcement from Pepsi sent the share prices of both
companies skyrocketing. Shares of Pepsico rose $1.75, or 5.6
percent, to $33.1875. Coke rose $4, to $51.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew J. Conway, a beverage analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said there was little reason for the jump other than what
he observed had been ``a minibeverage rally'' during the day, when
the market rose for many consumer stocks. ``Coke's stock had been
in a downward spiral since June, and at some point the spiral slows
or stops,'' he said. ``Since early June, Coke's market cap has
declined by $40 billion, which is almost as large as Pepsi's market
cap today.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the earnings were mostly unsurprising.
``Soft-drink profits were worse than I expected, and snack food was
completely in line,'' said Jennifer Solomon of Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts Wednesday afternoon, Roger A.
Enrico, the chairman of Pepsico, expressed confidence that the
soft-drink business would rebound. One of the tactics Pepsico plans
to use is a new commercial starring singer Ricky Martin. Enrico
also suggested that higher prices, which went into effect earlier
this year, would not be repeated in terms of percentage increases
in the future. The increase was 5.2 percent this year, compared
with typical increases of 2 percent to 3 percent in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to just sit around and say, `We know the
industry will come back,' although we know it will,'' he said.
``People in this industry are pretty good marketers. If some of the
price points are wrong, we will make adjustments to those price
points.'' But he added that he did not expect to call for a sharp
increase in marketing for any of Pepsico's businesses. ``I think
we've got enough money there to have the right impact in the
marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One factor in Pepsico's recent stock slide was the unexpected
resignation last month of Philip A. Marineau, the president of
Pepsi-Cola North America. Marineau left to become chief executive
at Levi Strauss. Enrico made no mention of the change, except to
note that Marineau's successor, Gary M. Rodkin, who formerly led
Tropicana, was coming up to speed.

FINDING RIGHT MIX ON LINES WITHOUT MODANO NOT EASY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Stars coach Ken Hitchcock is finding life
without No. 1 center Mike Modano to be a tad more confusing than he
expected.
</P>
<P>
   He's trying to mix and match the pieces from Modano's line with
other lines.
</P>
<P>
   He had winger Jere Lehtinen playing on a line with Joe
Nieuwendyk and Jamie Langenbrunner yesterday at practice while
Brett Hull practiced on a line with Pavel Patera and Mike Keane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see where it goes to,'' Hitchcock said. ``I think we've
got to be flexible. We're learning when you take out a player like
Mo or Syd, adjustments have to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Modano (concussion) nor defenseman Darryl Sydor
(fractured eye socket) will be available when the Stars play
Anaheim tomorrow night and San Jose on Saturday. Hitchcock said the
focus when playing those teams is usually checking, a role Modano's
line played well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Mo, we've had to structure some different thoughts,''
Hitchcock said. ``I don't know if we have anything cut in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock also said backup goalie Manny Fernandez will get his
first start of the season this weekend. Hitchcock said he is
leaning toward playing Ed Belfour against Anaheim and Fernandez
against San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Injured winger Grant Mashall (groin) and recently acquired
winger Chris Murray are also expected to get into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make a decision \Rtoday\S on Marshall,''
Hitchcock said. ``We'll play both this weekend, but we'll play one
guy at a time. I don't know if we want to try to break them both in
at the same time.'' Best memories Some of winger Blake Sloan's best
memories have come in Joe Louis Arena in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   He guessed he played upward of 40 games there while playing
college hockey at Michigan. His best memory might have come on
Tuesday, with his father and grandfather on hand, as he scored his
first NHL goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to get the monkey off my back,'' said Sloan, who
took 36 NHL games before scoring his first goal. ``I've been
getting some good chances. I've been working on bearing down on
chances. I was just trying to stay positive and just keep going at
it. It's just kind of a sigh of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   While he sighed, his teammates screamed.
</P>
<P>
   His linemate Juha Lind jumped so high when Sloan scored, a
spectator would've thought he scored the goal. The Stars' bench
also celebrated like it was a game-winning goal at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players were as excited for Sloany as anybody because he's
had so many opportunities,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We've
played three games, and I bet if you look back, he almost leads the
team in shots. He's played so well out of the gate. We knew he
could score at practice and we knew if he got one, he was going to
be able to score in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one goal is going to go a long ways into making him a
bona fide right winger.'' Kariya returns Oft-injured Anaheim
captain Paul Kariya returned to the Mighty Ducks lineup in time for
Tuesday's 4-0 loss to Phoenix. He had been sidelined by a sore left
hip for most of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   So, will the Ducks risk playing him in what could be a physical
game tomorrow night against the Stars?
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is going to play against Phoenix,'' Ducks coach Craig
Hartsburg said. ``So, I don't see any reason he wouldn't play
against Dallas.'' Learns a lesson Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he
likes playing Detroit, especially so early because the game always
allows him to learn something about his team.
</P>
<P>
   So, what was the lesson in Tuesday's 2-0 victory?
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the gauge out there was when they are on the top of
their game and we're not, it can be very embarrassing,'' Hitchcock
said. ``And when we're on top of our game, we can dictate the tempo
too.''

ADVANCED MICRO SAYS LOSS IS SMALLER THAN EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported a loss for
the third quarter Wednesday that was smaller than expected as sales
of its new Athlon line of microprocessors accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro executives said they were on track to achieve
their goal of break-even results in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that uncertainties remained regarding the supply
of chip sets and motherboards, the main boards of personal
computers, because of the earthquake in Taiwan. Advanced Micro is
vulnerable to supply constraints in Taiwan because it depends on
manufacturers there for the circuits that accompany its PC
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro reported its results after the close of the
market. Its shares closed at $19.4375, up 81.25 cents, on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro's fortunes have improved since August, when it
introduced the Athlon, which gives it the ability to compete with
the high end of Intel Corp.'s Pentium line. Before August, the lack
of a high-end chip had put Advanced Micro at the mercy of Intel's
aggressive price cuts. Intel could afford deep cuts on its low-end
Celeron processors because it still had good profit margins in its
higher-powered chips, which are commonly used in work stations and
servers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Advanced Micro introduced a 700-megahertz
version of the Athlon that was immediately available in computers
produced by IBM and Compaq. Intel's Pentium III currently tops out
at 600 megahertz, although faster versions are expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro chairman W.J. Sanders said, ``Sharply higher
sales of flash memories and sales of AMD Athlon processors at
higher margins than those experienced on AMD-K6 family processors
combined to boost revenues smartly and cut our operating loss by
more than $70 million compared to the immediate-prior quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, which ended Sept. 26, Advanced Micro reported a
loss of $105.5 million, in contrast to earnings of $1 million, or 1
cent a diluted share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell 3
percent, to $662.2 million, from $685.9 million in the third
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The loss per diluted share was equivalent to 72 cents; analysts
had expected Advanced Micro to lose 97 cents a share, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for continuing product groups were up 16 percent from the
second quarter and up 1 percent from the third quarter of 1998, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said that he had set a break-even goal of $850 million
in revenue and that the company could have revenue exceeding $800
million in the fourth quarter based on current order rates. But he
said the situation in Taiwan remained uncertain and information was
being updated daily.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the company said it had asked investment bankers at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and at Salomon Smith Barney to find a
buyer for its communications product group, which makes integrated
circuits for telecommunications and computer networking. Advanced
Micro said it hoped to complete a sale of the unit in the first
half of next year; the unit had revenue of $70 million in the third
quarter and employs about 400 people.

PETTITTE NO ACE IN SEASON, BUT IN PLAYOFFS, HE'S BEEN KING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five-time Cy Young award winner Roger Clemens is 1-2
in nine postseason starts. He hasn't won one since 1986. Strikeout
artist Randy Johnson would've made Babe Ruth shake in his shoes
during the regular season. But in the playoffs? Try seven
consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's quiet Andy Pettitte. Two World Series victories
and four playoff victories in three postseasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put more on what someone's accomplished in big games,'' said
Yankees manager Joe Torre, who stood by his pitcher during rough
times and rampant trade speculation this season. ``I try not to
lose sight of the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte is scheduled to start Game 2 of their American League
Division Series today against the Rangers at Yankee Stadium. Three
months ago, Pettitte, deemed washed up by some at the tender age of
27, seemed a sure bet to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled mightily in the first half of the season, going 5-7
with a 5.59 earned-run average. Playing for an owner who fashioned
the what-have-you-done-for-me-lately mantra long before it was in
vogue, Pettitte was central to many trade rumors despite winning 81
games in five years for the Yankees, more than any Yankees pitcher
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost seemed like I was struggling for my life
individually,'' Pettitte said.
</P>
<P>
   He insists the rumors never affected his performances or
motivated him, especially during the turnaround second-half after
owner George Steinbrenner publicly said Pettitte had something to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte said hard work with pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre
helped him rediscover his two-seam fastball. He also said Torre's
unyielding support helped him relax. With renewed confidence,
Pettitte rolled to a 9-4 record with a 3.84 ERA after the All-Star
break. He finished the regular season with a 14-11 mark, his fifth
consecutive season with double-figure wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying it all along, it makes you feel good when you
know \RTorre's\S behind you,'' Pettitte, who resides near Houston
in Deer Park, said. ``In the past, I've been able to do some good
stuff in the postseason. He remembers stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in the playoffs for a fourth time, the question hanging
on Pettitte is this: Is he the finesse pitcher with pinpoint
control able to last into the late innings? Or is he the erratic
pitcher who, as recently as his previous start, walked six and
allowed six hits and six earned runs in 41/3 innings?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think mentally, I am a lot tougher than that,'' Pettitte
said. ``Me and Mel worked hard trying to figure out my mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's pitching matchup, Pettitte vs. Rick Helling, is a
rematch of last year's Game 2, a 3-1 Yankees victory that gave them
a commanding 2-0 lead heading back to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, 2-0 against the Rangers in the playoffs and a far
better pitcher at Yankee Stadium than in Arlington, pitched a dandy
in that one, going seven innings and allowing one run on three
hits, while striking out eight and walking none.
</P>
<P>
   In his only outing against the Rangers this season, Pettitte
earned the win in that 21-3 debacle at The Ballpark in Arlington on
Aug. 23. Before this season, Pettitte had a 6.42 ERA vs. the
Rangers, who can load the lineup with right-handed batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given me trouble in the past, that's no secret,''
Pettitte said. ``If you keep stuff in the heart of the plate,
you're going to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will be satisfied as long as Pettitte continues to
produce in a big way in the playoffs.

RELAXED RANGERS PITCHER HELLING AWAITS YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Right-hander Rick Helling, the Rangers' scheduled
starter for Game 2 of the American League Division Series, held
court yesterday morning at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers must beat the New York Yankees tonight or leave the
Bronx trailing the best-of-five series, two games to none. And if
yesterday's session were a court of law, a spectator might have
wondered if Helling perjured himself in his 15-minute deposition
with the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected us to win, so there's not really pressure on
you when you're not expected to win,'' Helling said nonchalantly.
``It's when you're expected to win that there's pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   No sweat dripped from Helling's brow despite the glare of camera
lights that soaked him and his wool coat on a chilly, October
morning. Helling (13-11) appeared to be one cool customer, and the
28-year-old pitcher better be the Rangers' version of the Iceman
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Rangers could be staring at the possibility of
being swept for a second consecutive season in the Division Series
by the Yankees on Saturday night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think really anybody expected us to win this series
anyway,'' Helling said. ``To me, all the pressure is on the
Yankees. They won the first game. Obviously, it would be nice if we
won the second game and went back home with a split.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been the underdog all year. Everybody has talked about
us being matched up with the Yankees ... and if we could finally
beat them, and we haven't yet.''
</P>
<P>
   That burden falls squarely on Helling's shoulders tonight, and
his right arm should be cause for concern. Helling went 2-4 with a
7.68 earned-run average during his final seven starts of the
regular season and surrendered 15 of his major league-high 41 home
runs during that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the utmost confidence in myself that I'll make the
pitch when I have to,'' Helling said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers need Helling to duplicate his June 16 start against
New York. Helling surrendered only four hits and two walks through
seven scoreless innings, and the Rangers escaped Yankee Stadium
with a 3-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Helling proved merciless with runners in scoring position that
evening. The Yankees went 0-for-6 in those at-bats, and that bears
greater significance considering the Rangers' inability to produce
runs against New York's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, it's going to happen,'' Helling said. ``I have a
ton of faith in our offense, and it doesn't put any pressure on me.
I'm trying to put zeros on the board anyway. I don't worry about
what they do. More times than not, they're going to score plenty of
runs for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense is capable of scoring 10 runs a game if we start
swinging the bats the way we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling will be best served by regaining the feel for his
curveball, a pitch ``that's game-to-game with me,'' he said.
Helling needs command of his curveball to complement his fastball,
which he throws about 70 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence in it,'' Helling said. ``If it's not
working, I'll use my other pitches. You make the best with what you
have that night. Obviously, you don't just throw a couple of them
in the first inning and say, `Oh, it's not working,' and then throw
it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep throwing it and make the hitter know you're
going to throw it. Obviously, if it's working, it'll make your job
easier. The more pitches you have in your repertoire, the easier it
is to pitch.''

LEONARD S. SHOEN, 83, FOUNDER OF THE MOVE-IT-YOURSELF INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonard S. Shoen, who created the multibillion-dollar
do-it-yourself moving industry in 1945 when he welded together a
trailer, painted it an attention-grabbing orange and called his
little company U-Haul, died on Monday morning after he drove his
car into a utility pole near Las Vegas, Nev., his hometown for the
last 20 years. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   His death was a suicide, said a spokeswoman for the Clark
County, Nev., coroner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Shoen was known for stunts like tossing $1,000 out of an office
window in Phoenix, creating a traffic jam on the street below, to
show how easy it was to waste money.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, a vicious family feud erupted over control
of his company. He successfully sued several of his 13 children
after some of them took over U-Haul International Inc. in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Sam or L.S., Shoen was born on Feb. 29, 1916, in
McGrath, Minn. He earned a bachelor's degree and a law degree from
Oregon State University, and after World War II naval service, he
and his wife, Anna Mary Shoen, moved to her family ranch in rural
Washington  &UR; s &LR; tate. At the age of 29, he created the first U-Haul
trailers on the ranch. He rented them for $2 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Later, dealerships were established, and by 1949, it was
possible to rent a trailer for a one-way trip from city to city in
most of the country. Today, U-Haul rents trucks and trailers
through independent dealers and company-owned centers.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Shoen gave most of his stock to his children.
Several of them, principally Joseph Shoen and Mark Shoen, then
ousted him as president and chairman in 1986 and stripped him of
his retirement benefits after differing on corporate strategy.
Shoen and other family members then sued and won a $1.5 billion
settlement that was later reduced to $461 million.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Shoen and Mark Shoen now head the company. Efforts to
reach them directly were not successful; they did not return
messages left on Wednesday with their public relations officials
and at U-Haul's headquarters in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Shoen was married five times; he was widowed once and divorced
three times. He is survived by his wife, Carol, and her daughter,
Shana Coupland of La Mesa, Calif., whom he adopted. He is also
survived by six children from his marriage to his first wife, Anna

UNION PACIFIC ORDERS LOCOMOTIVES FROM GM UNIT IN $2 BILLION DEAL

   TORONTO _ Union Pacific Corp. said Wednesday that it had ordered
1,000 locomotives worth more than $2 billion from a Canadian
division of General Motors Corp. It was Union Pacific's biggest
step yet to improve a railroad network that was so slow and snarled
two years ago that some customers rebelled and began sending
freight by truck.
</P>
<P>
   The General Motors Electro-Motive Division in London, Ontario,
about 150 miles southwest of Toronto, will deliver the new
locomotives over the next four years. It is the largest single
order for locomotives ever placed by the Omaha-based railroad, and
the largest piece of business ever won by the Canadian
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific will replace about 1,500 older locomotives in its
current fleet of 7,000 with the new ones, said John Bromley, a
spokesman for Union Pacific. ``We were faced with significant
maintenance and overhaul costs if we hadn't done something to
reduce the average age of the fleet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific has been replacing about 200 locomotives each
year, with some leased and some purchased. It will lease the 1,000
new locomotives through General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian plant, which employs 2,700 people and can make 600
locomotives a year, had been preparing for layoffs because of a
decline in orders. ``We now see a stable order book for the next
three to four years,'' said Kevin McKittrick, a spokesman. The
plant also makes light armored vehicles and is Canada's largest
military contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000-horsepower SD70 models ordered by Union Pacific have
been in use on North American railroads for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific is currently investing about $2 billion a year in
new equipment to try to become a more efficient competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Its $5.4 billion purchase of Southern Pacific Transportation
Corp. in 1996 created the largest railroad in the United States _
and a textbook case of how to mismanage a merger.
</P>
<P>
   The two rail networks, with 53,000 employees, 7,000 locomotives,
155,000 freight cars and 36,000 miles of track, failed to meld and
adapt, causing delays and lost shipments. Customers ranging from
grain farmers to petrochemical producers revolted, sending their
products via trucks instead. Some called for tighter regulation of
big railroad mergers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months congestion has been reduced and average train
speeds have risen, but some customers continue to complain, and
Union Pacific's management acknowledges that it still needs more
modern equipment and operating procedures.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Union Pacific shares finished unchanged at
$48.0625. GM shares rose 37.5 cents, to $65.75.

   CLEVELAND _ For baseball fans of New England, October is the
cruelest month, the time of year when championship dreams are
crushed. The blow sometimes comes early, as it did in 1978, with a
Bucky Dent home run to give the Yankees a victory in a pennant
playoff. It might come late, with a Mookie Wilson ground ball in
1986, to give the Mets new life in a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   For this season, although it is too soon to be sure, Boston's
gloom might have begun Wednesday night, midway through the opening
game of the first round of a three-round tournament. Boston's Pedro
Martinez, baseball's best pitcher, was cruising along with a 2-0
lead over the Indians. He seemed to be gaining pace and momentum.
Then he suddenly left the game with a back injury, not taking the
mound for the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians erased the lead with a two-run home run by Jim Thome
in the sixth and went on to win by 3-2 on a bases-loaded single by
Travis Fryman off Rich Garces in the bottom of the ninth. Cleveland
takes a one-game-to-none lead into the Game 2 of this best-of-5
division series on Thursday afternoon. The winning run was scored
by Manny Ramirez, who led off the ninth by getting hit by a pitch
from Derek Lowe, who performed well but took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Also pitching well but not getting the decision was Cleveland's
Bartolo Colon, who left after eight innings after allowing two runs
and striking out 11 batters, his season high.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the top of the ninth with the score tied at 2-2 was
Cleveland's Paul Shuey, who got credit for the victory. Colon's
exit ended what had started as a duel between two friends from the
Dominican Republic who are among the best pitchers in the American
League.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday here, Charles Nagy will pitch for Cleveland against
Bret Saberhagen. Game 3 and Game 4, if necessary, are scheduled for
Saturday and Sunday at Fenway Park in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's injury was described as a muscle strain in the middle
of his back. The team announced the prognosis for his recovery as
``day to day,'' but his departure was a jolt to both the Sox and
the hopes of New England fans, whose team has not won a World
Series since 1918.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez entered the game with a record of 23-4, best in the
league, and with the league's best earned run average, 2.07. He
also led in strikeouts with 313 and is considered a sure bet for
the Cy Young Award as the league's best pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   When Lowe came on in the fifth, Boston not only had a 2-0 lead,
but Martinez had given up just three hits and seemed to be
improving. He retired the Indians in order for the first time in
the fourth, getting the final out while covering first base and
taking the throw from Mike Stanley on a grounder by David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Though they lost the league's best pitcher, the Red Sox regained
the league's best hitter Wednesday night. Nomar Garciaparra, who
missed the last week of the season after being hit on the right
wrist by a pitch, returned and helped create the first two runs. He
led off the second inning with a line-drive home run that barely
cleared the wall in right-center field. In the fourth, he led off
with a double and scored on a single to left by Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra walked in the sixth inning, drawing a cheer from the
Cleveland fans, and was doubled off first after Justice caught Troy
O'Leary's fly ball against the wall in left and threw back to the
infield. Garciaparra had already rounded second and was doubled off
easily.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians tied it at 2-2 in the bottom of the sixth when a
throwing error by third baseman John Valentin on a routine grounder
allowed Manny Ramirez to reach first with two out. The next batter,
Thome, hit Lowe's first pitch into the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Colon is almost four years younger than Martinez and their
friendship is like that between a freshman and a senior from the
same neighborhood who attend rival schools. Colon is 24 years old
and Martinez will turn 28 on Oct. 25. Both are from the Dominican
Republic, a cradle of talent for baseball. Martinez, an established
star, comes across as confident and relaxed, speaking confidently
in both English and Spanish. Colon, an emerging star, seems more
tentative, using a teammate as an interpreter..
</P>
<P>
   Colon said Wednesday afternoon that Martinez is something of a
mentor to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great person, he can help me a lot with my pitching and
with life,'' Colon said, with translation provided by catcher Sandy
Alomar. ``Whenever we get together or before the game, whenever we
see each other, we have conversations about pitching. He is a great
person to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Colon finished the season tied for second in the league in
victories with 18, with five defeats. His ERA of 3.95 ranked
seventh. In previous games matching the two pitchers, Martinez was
3-0 and Colon was 0-2.
