<HEADLINE> No Positive Test at Tour de France: UCI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Cycling Union (
UCI) said in Lausanne on Wednesday that there was no positive test
from the cyclists who competed in last month's Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
But three riders were expelled from the Tour de France hours
before it began after failing blood tests. The tests, which
measure the level of hematocrit in the blood, are an indication
that riders may be using the banned hormone EPO, but UCI has yet
to approve a test for the drug and the 15-day bans were levied on
health grounds.
</P>
<P>
Urine samples from cyclists in this year's Tour have been
frozen for EPO testing once a new examination has received expert
approval.
</P>
<P>
UCI, which decided not to use the French-developed test during
the Tour, will unfreeze the samples "once it has been validated as
a stand-alone test" by the International Olympic Committee, the
body said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa agreed to help
Zimbabwe restore fuel supply and the tarnished international image,
a senior Zimbabwean official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The promise was made during talks between Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe and visiting South African President Thabo Mbeki
here on Wednesday which was focused on the problems facing
Zimbabwe and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Finance and Economic Development Minister Simba
Makoni told reporters after the meeting that the South African
delegation had expressed interest to assist Zimbabwe in solving
its economic and political problems.
</P>
<P>
He said Mugabe had briefed the South Africans on developments
following the parliamentary election in June and the economic
recovery programs.
</P>
<P>
Makoni said the measures discussed at the meeting included the
stabilization of the exchange rate and solution to the budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been facing fuel and foreign exchange shortages
and high inflation and interest rates since last December and its
international image has been tarnished mainly by its land reform
policies.
</P>
<P>
South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said they believed
it was their duty to make the international community understand
Zimbabwe's problems.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Sudan Renew Support for Land-for-Peace Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Sudan on Thursday
reaffirmed their support for the land-for-peace principle to
achieve a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the Middle East
in conformity with international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued at the end of a two-day visit by
Sudanese President Omar Hassan El-Bashir, the two countries
stressed that peace in the region should also be based on the
implementation of the United Nations resolutions and a full
commitment to agreements already signed.
</P>
<P>
Peace can never be achieved without Israel's withdrawal from all
occupied Arab lands, including the Golan Heights it seized from
Syria in 1967, as well as the restoration of the Palestinian
people's legitimate rights, including the establishment of an
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It said Jordan and Sudan shared identical views on the need to
consolidate Arab unity and the two countries agreed to continue
coordinating stands on bilateral and Arab issues.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Bashir and Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
focused their discussions on bilateral, regional and world issues
of common concern, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders stressed that conflicts in Africa and the Middle
East should be solved through peaceful means, including cooperation
and respect of each other's internal affairs, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Slam U.S. Intention to Move Embassy to Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League criticized the
United States on Thursday for its intention to move the embassy in
Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, whose status is still under
negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The declared U.S. desire "does not conform with its role as a
major sponsor of the Middle East peace process," said Ahmed Ben
Heli, the league's assistant secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Egypt's Middle East News Agency, Heli said the
announcement by U.S. President Bill Clinton contradicted the
country's principled position that East Jerusalem remains part of
the Arab territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
In an interview broadcast on Israeli television last Friday,
Clinton said that he was considering moving the U.S. embassy to
Jerusalem by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Arabs have been angered by Clinton's expressed desire. Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said early this week that the question
of moving the U.S. embassy was an extremely thorny issue. He urged
all parties to avoid taking unilateral steps which that disturb the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state. But Israel insists that the holy
city, sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians, is its "eternal and
indivisible" capital, a claim not recognized by the international
community, including the U.S.

<HEADLINE> PLC Reaffirms Commitment to Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Legislative Council
(PLC) reasserted Thursday "the fair and comprehensive peace, based
on the U.N. resolutions that guarantee the legitimate rights of the
Palestinians, is the strategic option of our people and
leadership."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the West Bank town of Ramallah, the PLC
reiterated that the relevant United Nations resolutions are the
bases and references of the peace process and the Palestinians'
talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The sincere and accurate implementation of the resolutions is
the only guarantee for fair, lasting and comprehensive peace in the
Middle East, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement highlighted the Palestinian stance in the peace
process, particularly that Jerusalem is the capital of the future
independent Palestinian state and an inalienable part of the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The statement rejects all Israeli proposals on shared
sovereignty over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It underscored the right of the Palestinian refugees to return
to their homes in line with the resolution No. 194 of the U.N.
General Assembly as well as Israel's recognition of the legal,
political and moral responsibility over the refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out the importance of Israel's complete
withdrawal to the borders of June 4, 1967, according to the U.N.
Security Council resolution No. 242 and the dismantlement of Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
It also underscored the resolution of the Central Council of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on the declaration of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital on September 13.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the PLC urged the Arab leaders to convene an
Arab summit to back the Palestinian position on Jerusalem and the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PLC expressed regret over the U.S. intention to
move its embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, in violation
of international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
"The move will be an undermining factor to the peace process at
a time when we try to develop our ties with the United States," the
statement added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Largest Gold Mine Starts Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's largest gold
mine which is expected to yield revenue of 150 million U.S.
dollars a year officially went into operation on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Ashanti Gold Field of Ghana and Anglo Gold of South Africa
have invested 165 million U.S. dollars in the construction of the
Geita Gold Mine, which will produce about 500,000 ounces (16 tons)
of gold yearly for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa promised that the government will continue to create an
environment conducive to more investment in the mining sector.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to nurture the kind of investment climate
that will enable us to turn the mineral wealth underground into a
catalyst for rapid growth and development of our country and its
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of environment protection in
large-scale mining operations with emphasis on controlling of
pollution, land degradation and hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
Mining officials said that 85 percent of the 600 staff at the
Geita Mine in western region of Mwanza, around the Lake Victoria,
are Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
Mining is one of the fastest growing sectors in Tanzania's
economy with a growth rate of 9.1 percent in 1999. It has
attracted more than 720 million U.S. dollars investment in the
past five years.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Togo Call for Change of UN Mandate in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Togo called on the
United Nations on Thursday to change its mandate in Sierra Leone
from peace keeping to peace making.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and his Togolese
counterpart Gnassingbe Eyadema also urged the international
community to provide logistic and other assistance to the West
African Peacekeeping Force or the ECOMOG to enable it to support
the UN mission in Sierra Leone, where the Revolutionary United
Front rebels refused to disarm under the Lome peace accord signed
in July 1999 and blocked UN peacekeeping forces from deploying in
areas under their control.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of defense chiefs of the Economic Community of the
West African States (ECOWAS) held in Ghana' s capital Accra last
month resolved to make the ECOMOG a permanent stand-by force to
maintain peace in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued at the end of the one-day
visit to Nigeria by Eyadema, who is also the chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), African states should take
measures to further strengthen the OAU Central Organ for Conflict
Prevention, Management and Resolution.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also welcomed the cessation of hostilities
between Ethiopia and Eritrea and urged African leaders to fully
give their perspectives in the forthcoming UN Millennium Summit to
be held in the UN headquarters in New York on various issues
confronting the continent.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Continues Effort to Reverse Taliban Edict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
continuing negotiations with the Taliban warring party in
Afghanistan in an attempt to reverse the latter's edict barring
Afghan women from working with U.N. agencies and non-governmental
organizations, the United Nations said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said that there have
been several U.N. missions to Afghanistan, with one currently in
the Afghan capital and another scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite these efforts, we are still faced with an edict signed
by the head of the Taliban," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations is very concerned about the edict's
impact on the delivery of humanitarian assistance in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, the largest warring party in Afghanistan, issued
an edict early last month barring Afghan women from working with U.
N. agencies and national and international non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations began negotiations with the Taliban three
weeks ago, hoping that the issue would be resolved soon so as to
avoid any negative impact on the provision of humanitarian aid at
such a critical moment for the Afghan population. Afghanistan is
suffering one of the worst droughts in decades in addition to the
aftermath of 22-year-long civil strife.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Indonesia to Restore Law in West Timor Refugee Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Thursday called on the Indonesian government
to take effective steps to restore law and order in refugee camps
in West Timor and to provide free access for humanitarian
personnel to the camps.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read out by Council President Hasmy Agam, the
Council also asked the Indonesian government to separate the
former military personnel, police and civil servants from the
refugees and to arrest militia extremists attempting to sabotage
refugee resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed its profound concern over the continuing
presence of large numbers of East Timorese refugees in those camps,
the continuing presence of militias in the camps, and their
intimidation of the staff of the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
The Council said it is particularly concerned that the
intimidation had reached such a level that UNHCR had been forced
to indefinitely postpone its activities, including refugee
registration.
</P>
<P>
The Council said that the Indonesian government should be more
determinedly involved in solving the problem and cooperate more
closely with the United Nations Transitional Administration in
East Timor in ending cross-border incursions from West Timor and
in disarming and disbanding the militias.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 85,000 to 120,000 refugees, who fled or
were forced by pro-Indonesia militia to flee to West Timor when
violence erupted in East Timor after its people voted
overwhelmingly in August 1999 for independence.

<HEADLINE> Russia's GDP to Grow 20 Percent in 2001: Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia's gross domestic product (
GDP) will rise 20 percent to 7.75 trillion rubles (278.78 billion
U.S.dollars) with the inflation under 12 percent next year, the
Russian Finance Ministry forecast Thursday in a draft federal
budget for 2001.
</P>
<P>
The goals will be reached if the oil price on the world markets
stands at 18-19 dollars per barrel, according to the ministry's
macroeconomic policy.
</P>
<P>
The forecast was based on an analysis of the country's economic
situation in the first half of this year, Anton Siluanov, chief of
the ministry's macroeconomic policy department told reporters here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the first six months show that the Russian
economy is developing faster than initial scenario and the
macroeconomic situation is more optimistic," Siluanov said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures from the Russian State Statistics Committee
show that GDP grew 8.4 percent in the first half of this year with
investment up 14.3 percent, he said, adding that under this
situation GDP will reach 6.45 trillion rubles (232.01 billion
dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Siluanov said the ministry sees no reason yet to revise the
inflation figure written into this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
He assured that next year's budget plan will be "fully balanced.
"
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to conclude work on the draft and submit it
to the cabinet in the middle of August, so that the spending plan
can be submitted to the State Duma, the lower house of the
parliament, on August 26, he said.

"Rayo" operates on the base of two multiple rocket launchers
with a capacity of 12 rockets each, mounted atop a MAN SX2000 6X6
specially designed truck.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5 meter, 160 millimeter rockets with a weight of 122.5
kilograms can reach 51 kilometers. At their tips they carry a
highly explosive load of up-to-date TNT/RDX.
</P>
<P>
They can operate in any kind of weather and are catalogued as
insensible munition, which constitutes the highest possible
security level for transportation and handling.
</P>
<P>
This rocket system was first designed in 1986. At the beginning
of May the penultimate technical test was carried out in the same
area. Besides, the Chilean army will make soon an intense
promotion campaign in different countries with the purpose of
starting the fabrication and sale of this weapon system.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Keen to Resume Israeli-Palestinian Talks: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is keen
to resume negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians after
the three-way Camp David summit failed to reach an agreement, a
senior visiting U.S. official said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Edward Walker briefed him on U.S. efforts to
bridge gaps between Israel and the Palestinians at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The two-week U.S.-sponsored summit attended by Clinton, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
failed to reach any agreement on the fate of Jerusalem, Palestinian
refugees, border, security arrangements and other core issues
between Israel and a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Walker told Abdullah that Clinton is keen to see the resumption
of negotiations between the two sides for a lasting peace in the
Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Abdullah commended Washington's role in the
peace process and said he hoped Washington will continue its
efforts to achieve a just peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting with Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu
Ragheb, Walker stressed Washington was determined to continue its
efforts to realize a permanent settlement to the Arab-Israeli
conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb briefed the U.S. official on Jordan's stance for a just,
durable and comprehensive peace to guarantee the rights of all
peoples in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 as the second
Arab state after Egypt to realize peace with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Belongs to Palestinians: Iranian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
reiterated here Wednesday that the sovereignty of Jerusalem belongs
to the Palestinians who have the right to establish an independent
state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem belongs to all Palestinian people and the Palestinians
have the right to decide their own fate, Khatami told visiting
Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. plan to shift its embassy in Israel from
Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Khatami said it showed Washington's sympathy
with Israel following the failure of the Camp David tripartite
talks on July 26.
</P>
<P>
The talks, attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
failed to achieve any agreement after an endurance of 15 days.
</P>
<P>
Washington has no competency to mediate between the Palestinians
and Israel, because it is biased toward Israel, Kahtami said.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon in May after an
occupation of 22 years, Khatami called it a big victory of the
Lebanese resistance movement.
</P>
<P>
What happened in south Lebanon was an important event in the
contemporary era because the people of Lebanon had successfully
ousted an enemy without giving it any concessions, said Khatami in
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Berri for his part thanked Iran for its long-term "spiritual"
support for Lebanon in its resistance against Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said the unity and strategic cooperation among Iran, Syria
and Lebanon served as important factor in the victory against the
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese parliament speaker arrived here Tuesday for an
official visit. He had held talks with his Iranian counterpart
Mehdi Karrubi and Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Appeals to Save Congolese Cease-fire Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. envoy to the Great Lakes
region Harold Wolpe said Thursday that there was need to find
ways of ensuring the survival of the Lusaka cease-fire agreement
aimed at ending a two-year conflict in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Wolpe, who was on a three-week tour of the Great Lakes region,
made the remarks after meeting Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
in Harare.
</P>
<P>
"We want to find ways of rebuilding Lusaka agreement and get it
back on track," Wolpe said, adding that there were a number of
obstacles to implementing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
There had been growing concern that the DRC government was
undermining the implementation of the Lusaka cease-fire agreement
signed in July last year, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He noted with concern that the DRC government had lost
confidence in former Botswana President Ketumile Masire as a
facilitator, and prevented the deployment of about 5,500 U.N.
peacekeeping forces in the country.
</P>
<P>
There had been fighting in the Equator region between the DRC
government troops and rebels led by Jeane Pierre Bemba.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Surge in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- New orders to U.S. factories
increased 5.5 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted amount of
409.2 billion dollars, the biggest surge in nine years, the
Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The big jump in factory orders followed a 4.7 percent rise in
May and was the largest monthly increase since July 1991.
</P>
<P>
Orders for non-durable goods actually dropped 0.1 percent in
June, following a 1.6 percent increase in May. Demand for chemical,
paper and tobacco products showed the largest decreases.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three
years, were up 9.7 percent, slightly lower than an advanced report
last week that had put the gain at 10 percent. But it was still
the biggest increase in durable goods orders in nine years.
</P>
<P>
June's increase in factory orders was led by a record 42.2
percent jump in demand for transportation equipment, which climbed
to 68.8 billion dollars. The strength was mainly boosted by a
record 175.2 percent increase in orders for commercial aircraft
and other aerospace equipment.
</P>
<P>
Excluding transportation categories, orders increased only 0.3
percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Shipments by factories increased 1 percent to 384.9 billion
dollars in June, following a 2.2 percent increase in May. Unfilled
orders rose 4.3 percent to 582.5 billion dollars after a 1.2
percent increase in the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Likely to Discuss Ties With DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
began a closed-door session Thursday, likely to discuss U.N. ties
with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) at a time when U.N.
military deployment is being blocked in the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation body will hold discussion with visiting DRC
Human Rights Minister Leonard She Okitundu, who is expected to
brief the Council on the relevant stance of his government, headed
by President Laurent Kabila, a U.N. spokesman told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Okitundu is currently in New York, and he wants to speak
to the Security Council," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came as the civil war in that country moved into a
third year Wednesday, with no sign of an early end despite a 1999
peace deal. On the battle front, however, there are signs that the
warring parties are exercising restraint.
</P>
<P>
In late July, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press
conference here that the United Nations was reassessing its
strategy toward that country due to "repeated obstacles" caused by
the government preventing the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
"We're reassessing our positions in the DRC," Eckhard said. "
The planned U.N. mission for the Democratic Republic of Congo has
met repeated obstacles to its deployment from the beginning."
</P>
<P>
The DRC government has "denied us the right to deploy armed
peacekeepers," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Political Committee, a ministerial committee overseeing
the peace accord, said last Saturday that the peace agreement
reached in the Zambian capital of Lusaka a year ago was now in
serious danger. The committee comprises ministers and senior
officials from all sides to the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in that country, as well as the skirmishes in May
and June between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in the Congolese city
of Kisangani, has dampened hopes for a faster implementation of
the Lusaka accord, diplomatic sources said here.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda has since pulled out of Kisangani, the third
largest city in the northern part of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on February 24 authorized an
increase of the U.N. force to 500 military observers and some 5,
000 troops to protect them and provide logistics.
</P>
<P>
The deployment is conditional on a subsiding of the fighting,
as called for in the Lusaka accord, which also included requests
for a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations last month suspended the deployment of a
Tunisian unit meant to be the first sent to the DRC after
President Kabila publicly stated that U.N. soldiers should not be
sent to the northwestern cities of Kinshasa and Mbandaka.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force was to set up positions at four bases -- two in
Kindu and Kisangani in rebel-held territory and two in Mbuji-Mayi
and Mbandaka in government-controlled regions. The Tunisian
contingent was to set up a headquarters in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission comprises some 228 military observers and
military liaison officers in and around the DRC, including 200 in
the central African country itself.
</P>
<P>
In the prolonged war, Uganda and Rwanda back the rival rebel
groups while Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe support the government.

<HEADLINE> Half of the Bodies of Victims of Concorde Crash Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the bodies of the
114 victims of the Air France Concorde aircraft crashed on Tuesday
last week have been identified and the remains will be soon
returned to their families, a court in Pontoise, northwest of
Paris, which is in charge of judicial investigation of the crash,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of 64 people among the dead have been formally
identified, while the remaining 50 will be identified with the
help of the victims' families, doctors and dentists, said the
public prosecutor of Pontoise, Xavier Salvat.
</P>
<P>
The German judicial authorities are sending information to the
French authorities, but the process is slow because of the season
of vacation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-six of the 114 dead in the crash were German tourists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French government decided on Thursday to
maintain the suspension of the flight of Concorde planes of Air
France.
</P>
<P>
``The uncertainties persist always over the interpretation and
linking of the facts and it is not possible yet to answer the
questions which appear fundamental for establishing the
recommendations for a resumption of the flight,'' said Gilles
Ricono, director of the cabinet of the Minister of Transport Jean-
Claude Gayssot.
</P>
<P>
French investigators cannot establish the links between
different elements which could have caused the crash, including
the burst of one or two tires, the outbreak of a massive fire and
the problem of an engine and an undercarriage.

<HEADLINE> Annual Inflation Rate in Switzerland Rises to Record Level Since 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The annual rate of inflation in
Switzerland has risen to its highest level since 1996, according
to figures released Thursday by the Federal Statistics Office.
</P>
<P>
At the end of July, the inflation rose to two percent, up from
1.9 percent in June, the federal statistics office said. The
annual inflation figure a year ago was only 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
It added that the consumer price index, calculated according to
a new system since May, rose by 0.2 percent in July compared to
the previous month to reach 100.6 from 100 in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
The office indicated that the rise in inflation was caused
mainly in the accommodation and energy sectors caused by a rise in
heating oil prices (70 percent in a year), and higher transport
costs.
</P>
<P>
It said the level of prices for domestic products remained
stable in July compared to June but rose by 0.7 percent for
imported goods.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urged to Settle Aegean Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Thursday once again
urged neighboring Turkey to settle their disputes over the eastern
Aegean Sea in line with international law.
</P>
<P>
The call was in response to recent remarks made by Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem that Turkey was ready to discuss all
matters related to the Aegean Sea within the framework of the
United Nations and that he himself never viewed Cyprus as an
obstacle to developing Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that Turkey
must respect international treaties that define borders, relations
and behaviors.
</P>
<P>
In the few decades, Greece and Turkey have nearly gone to war
three times over their territorial disputes over the Aegean Sea
and the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Since last June, however, both countries have taken some steps
to improve their strained relations. They have held several rounds
of low-level talks and signed nine cooperation agreements.
</P>
<P>
But Greece still complains that Turkey has not made enough
goodwill gestures for the improvement of bilateral relations. On
Thursday, Greece accused Turkey's minority policy as being "tragic
" and rendering the Turkish government a target of international
criticism.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Launched Against Move to Impose Quota on Foreigners in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Committee against the 18 percent initiative" said
proposals to restrict the number of foreigners in Switzerland
would have dire consequence. It warned that restricting the number
of foreigners could severely damage the Swiss economy, and
relations with Europe.
</P>
<P>
The committee, made up of 186 parliamentarians from seven
parties, including the four in government, is resolutely opposed
to an initiative, which proposes restricting the number of
foreigners in Switzerland to 18 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Currently, foreigners make up 19.3 percent of Switzerland's
whole population of about seven million. The committee says the
initiative would therefore result in a "de facto" ban on the
recruitment of foreign workers, which would be detrimental to the
Swiss economy.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government and parliament have already made clear
their opposition to the initiative. Earlier this year, the
government put forward a compromise solution, which would make it
more difficult for non-European Union citizens to come to
Switzerland.

 ATHENS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 7,000 farm animals have
been killed in Greece's northeastern region of Evros since the
outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease in the region early last
month.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a total of 3,700 cattle, 1,300 sheep and 1,900

MPA) quoted local veterinary agencies as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although inspections in the region showed that the disease
appeared to be on the decline, the restrictive measures set by the
responsible EU committee and the Greek agencies were still in
effect for precautionary reasons.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 farm animals were killed in the northern

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Protests EU Sanctions as "Lack of Legal Basis" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade Thursday
protested the sanctions of the European Union (EU) imposed on the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), saying that the EU move is "
lack of legal basis" and causes "enormous damage" to the economy
and society of the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The protest was contained in a letter to the president of the
U.N. Security Council by Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of
the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations. The letter is being
circulated here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Beginning in 1998, the European Union imposed its own
sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, without legal
ground in any document of the legal system of the United Nations,"
Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
"They constitute a unilateral act made in bad faith and
contrary" to the U.N. Charter, "the Purposes and Principles of the
United Nations, in particular the principle of noninterference
into the internal affairs of States," he said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions also runs counter to the EU Charter, which
demands the approval of the Security Council before the decision
to impose the sanctions against a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions "have never been referred to the Security
Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "the EU sanctions are contrary also to the goals of
the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights," and "they also violate the basic principles of other
international documents, including those of the World Trade
Organization, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe and the Council of Europe, regulating free trade and a free
flow of goods and capital and a free movement of people," he said.
</P>
<P>
On June 30, the EU strengthened sanctions against the FRY by
publishing the "White List" with 190 firms in the Balkan nation
which are allowed transactions with partners in EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The step "constitutes a flagrant violation of the basic rights
in the field of free movement of goods and capital," he said. "It
discriminates against economic subjects in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia on the basis of anti-democratic, political criteria,
the aim of which is also to cause internal splits and divisions."
</P>
<P>
"Alongside the 1999 NATO aggression against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, the EU sanctions stopped and hindered a
stable and dynamic economic development of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, market-oriented and based on domestic resources," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The production and the overall social product of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia plunged drastically and created
difficulties in the financing of private and public consumption,"
he said. "Privatization financed from abroad also came to a halt."
</P>
<P>
In the social sphere, unemployment rose and the living
standard of the population fell. Wages, pensions and social
benefits plummeted, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that over 80 percent of the population living
at the subsistence level," he said. "The situation in the fields
of education, health and ecology and in many other areas has
deteriorated."
</P>
<P>
"Despite a diminished social product, the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia continues to provide, at great cost to its own
population, a high level of humanitarian assistance to almost 1
million refugees from the former Yugoslav republics and displaced
persons from Kosovo," the autonomous province of the FRY, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It should be pointed out that the assistance of the
international community accounted for only 10 percent of the
overall expenses of their accommodation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, "The EU sanctions affect also neighboring countries
and all of southeastern Europe," he said. "They are a great
impediment to the development of that region and have accounted
for the persistence of lasting instability there. They have
blocked regional cooperation, which is not in the interest of
Europe as a whole."
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of the EU sanctions impedes the efforts to
alleviate the consequences of the NATO destructive aggression on
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," he said. "The losses
sustained by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia due to the
imposition of the EU sanctions and the NATO aggression amount to
over 150 million U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "the Government of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia calls upon the Security Council to consider the lack of
legal basis of the continued imposition of the sanctions, declare
them illegal and propose that they be urgently lifted," he said.
</P>
<P>
On May 30, 1992, the United Nations imposed sanctions on the
FRY. Following the November 1995 signing of the Dayton Agreement,
which ended the war in Bosnia, the Security Council decided to
suspend the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, 1996, the Security Council adopted a resolution
to lift altogether  the sanctions after the elections in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Put Public Administration on Line  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government will allocate
12 trillion lire (about 5.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the next
three years to computerize public offices and train staff in new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious plan, announced Thursday, is aimed to ban dust-
laden folders and replace paper work with computer work as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Civil Service Minister Franco Bassanini, who has spent the last
four years reforming Italy's inefficient administration, said the
new measures mean that about 60,000 civil servants will become
redundant by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"Downsizing is already a fact of life in the public
administration and staff is being cut by about 1 percent a year,"
he said. In fact, staff cuts have already been 2 percent in 1999
and this year.
</P>
<P>
When the plan is fully implemented, hundreds of thousands of
pages of trial and other judicial records, property registries and
paper work for road and car taxes will be dumped in the garbage
bin of history, said officials overseeing the computerization of
public administration.
</P>
<P>
The plan will help ease the life of ordinary people in areas
ranging from tax advice and online filing of tax returns to new
entries in public registries, medical records of individuals and
national online transplant registration.
</P>
<P>
Citizens' identity cards will become electronically available
and the time taken to issue passports will be cut radically thanks
to centralized networking between police stations and local
interior ministry offices.
</P>
<P>
Central e-procurement of public institutions will significantly
cut costs.

<HEADLINE> Free ISP Service Market Said to Triple in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 3 (Xinhua) -- As the cost of network
bandwidth falls, the U.S. market for free Internet access services
will more than triple in the next five years, according to a new
study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 12 million U.S. users access the Internet via
a free, advertising-supported service, said the study by U.S.
market research and consulting firm Strategies Group. That number
is expected to grow to 37 million by 2005 and will represent about
23 percent of all residential Internet users in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, there are three basic service models
for free Internet service providers (ISPs): Pure free ISP which
develops its own brand and marketing channels, those who are co-
branded with a well-known portal or e-commerce brand to leverage
an existing customer base, and those who are co-branded with an
established "old economy" brand to take advantage of long-standing
customer relationships.
</P>
<P>
While consumers may be saving money by using free ISPs, the
study found, the time needed to download the dial-up software was
often lengthy. Users are also often required to complete a lengthy
form with demographic information before they can use the service.
Delays can also be expected when logging in, and from slow
connection speeds. Another common drawback is advertising, which
is often their source of revenue. Most use a bar across the screen
to show the ads, but they often cover some of the content on Web
pages, forcing the user to move the ad around the page.
</P>
<P>
Strategies Group said that free ISPs now must focus their
efforts on demonstrating that the millions of subscribers they
serve can be translated into a profitable, long-term business.

<HEADLINE> First-Ever Software Exposition Begins in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The first-ever three-day "BCS
Software Expo 2000" began here Thursday with a view to reaping
export benefits from the increasing demand for software and
services around the world.
</P>
<P>
About 50 leading software developers, training institutes and
Internet service providers are participating in the exposition
organized by Bangladesh Computer Samity (Association) (BCS).
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the exposition, Finance Minister Shah A.M.S.
Kibria called upon the country's entrepreneurs in the information
technology(IT) sector to maximize prevailing comparative
advantages in exporting software and IT-enabled services.
</P>
<P>
Kibria said the government declared IT as a thrust sector and
has been providing it with all sorts of support, including duty-
free import of computers, tax holiday and protection of
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking as a special guest, Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed
said the software exposition would provide a unique opportunity
for software developers, service providers and training service
providers.
</P>
<P>
At the inaugural function, IT experts urged the government to
computerize its various organs within a stipulated time for
ensuring e-governance and entering into the information society.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the high price of Internet access, they said the
Internet cost should be brought down by 70 to 80 percent after
deregulation of V-SAT (very small aperture terminal). The present
cost of Internet access in Bangladesh is between 1 to 3 U.S.
dollars per hour,which is among the highest in the world.

<HEADLINE> Former U.N. Inspector Slams U.S. for Maintaining Sanctions on Iraq EDS-Updates with details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Scott Ritter, former United
Nations arms inspector, criticized the United States for keeping in
place the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been "an active implementer" of sanctions on Iraq
as well as one of the leading U.N. Security Council members behind
the continuation of the decade-old sanctions, Ritter said in a
press conference Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ritter said the U.S. needs an Iraq policy that conforms with the
international law, a policy that has "a chance of success."
</P>
<P>
Ritter said he visited Iraq to make a documentary film to
educate the U.S. people about the current situation of Iraq, which
has been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government knows the facts about Iraq, but the American
people do not. Therefore, "I am here to gather information, facts
that will be useful in trying to educate people about Iraq," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the U.S. government for being "inaccurate" and "
disingenuous" on issues such as whether Iraq still poses a threat
to its neighbors, or whether Iraq still possesses weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. will definitely not like this film," he foretold.
</P>
<P>
There have been efforts to "intimidate" him not to come to Iraq,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Before the visit, the Office of Foreign Assets Control from the
U.S. Department of Treasury sent Ritter a letter, warning that he
could be subject to imprisonment of 12 years, fines of over 1
million U.S. dollars and other civil penalties if he comes to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation even appointed several
members to question him.
</P>
<P>
Ritter regarded this as "an inappropriate response" from the U.
S. government, saying he came to Iraq as a journalist making a
documentary film.
</P>
<P>
"I am here to collect information to make a fair, objective film
so that people can make judgements by themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, with other three people, arrived in the Iraqi capital
Baghdad on July 29 and he has held talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz, Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid and other
officials.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to leave Iraq later in the day.

NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepal Thursday expressed its
solidarity with India in its efforts to fight acts of terrorism
against civilians, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported here.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hizbul Head Defends Deadline for Indian Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Supreme leader of Hizbul
Mujahideen Syed Sallahuddin Thursday defended setting August 8 as
the deadline for India to "positively" respond to its cease-fire
offer, saying that otherwise New Delhi would be responsible for
the consequences.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Xinhua in Islamabad, Salahuddin said his group had
announced a unilateral cease-fire 11 days ago to create a
conducive atmosphere but "unfortunately India has not yet
responded positively."
</P>
<P>
"Now we have set a deadline and hope that India will sincerely
reciprocate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sallahuddin said the 53-year-old Kashmir dispute should be
solved through peaceful dialogue. "India should respond positively
so that we could begin the second phase of dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Insisting on tripartite talks, he said there are three basic
parties to the conflict, including Kashmiris, Pakistan and India.
"If we ignore Pakistan then the issue would remain to be internal.
It is not an internal issue but it is an international matter," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Hizbul chief condemned the latest massacre of Hindu
pilgrims in India-controlled Kashmir and said there were
possibilities of India's involvement as well as of those groups
which opposed the Hizbul cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
"India might be involved to show the world that it wants peace
but the process is being sabotaged. The groups might be behind the
massacre to express anger against the Hizbul cease-fire," he
observed.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there was no substantial evidence to blame
any one, adding that Hizbul Mujahideen had itself started
investigation into these killings in a bid to find out who were
involved in the carnage.
</P>
<P>
Hizbul Mujahideen, the biggest Muslim militant group combating
Indian rule over the disputed area of Kashmir, declared a
unilateral cease-fire late last month and asked for dialogue with
the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
However, a series of gory killings during the past two days,
which claimed some 100 lives in the India-controlled part of
Kashmir, have increased tension there.

with only small rebel groups totaling nearly 2,000 men, about 500
of them mercenaries, continuing their fight against the federal

<P>
SEVILLE, Spain, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Any team that aspires to
strike gold at world level with foreign-born stars was greatly
reduced its chance on Thursday when the International Volleyball
Federation changed its rules on naturalized players.
</P>
<P>
The 27th Congress of the International Volleyball Federation (
FIVB) on Thursday agreed to put a limit of one naturalized player
to any one national team playing at the world championship, world
cup and world league.
</P>
<P>
Countries affiliated with the International Volleyball
Federation, world's governing body of the sport, can still pack
their teams with foreign-born players but they can only play one
such player at any one world-level tournament from now on.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-born player now playing for his/her adopted country
has had to have played at world levels for home country before to
qualify for the new ruling, the FIVB said.
</P>
<P>
The Seville congress also approved an outside agent system that
will assist on the transfer of players from country to country and
from club to club.
</P>
<P>
But any transfer will still have to get the approval from the
national volleyball association, the congress said.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan to Supply Electricity to Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 3 (Xinhua)-- Southwest China's Yunnan province
today signed an agreement with Guangdong province in south China
on supplying electricity to Guangdong in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan will supply 900,000 kwh of electricity to Guangdong in
2001. The amount will grow to 1.2 million kwh in 2002 and to 1.5
million kwh per year from 2003 to 2010.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan will further increase electricity supplies to Guangdong
after 2010.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is one of the richest provinces in China in terms of
energy resources, especially hydropower.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong province is one of the most prosperous provinces in
China. But it lacks energy. Rapid economic growth is expected to
boost the demand for electricity in the province by 7.7 percent
every year.
</P>
<P>
The province will need nearly 15 million kilowatts of
additional electricity generating capacity in the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Barak Discuss Future of Palestinian-Israeli Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in the
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria Thursday to discuss the
future of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak told reporters after the meeting that he expounded to
Mubarak Israel's views on the peace talks with the Palestinians and
expressed readiness to make efforts for a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Palestinians to show "seriousness and
responsibility" by softening their stance on the toughest issue of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Barak's meeting with Mubarak came one day after Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat dealt with the Mideast peace process with the
Egyptian leader. Israeli officials accompanying Barak told
reporters before the meeting that Barak would ask Mubarak to
persuade Arafat to adopt a less uncompromising stance.
</P>
<P>
In a separate briefing of Thursday's meeting, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said Cairo is keen on helping and encouraging
the Palestinians and Israel to push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
It is not Egypt's job to pressure the Palestinians to make
concessions on Jerusalem, he said. Concessions should be made by
all parties within the framework of resolutions of the
international legitimacy, not outside of them, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed Egypt's position that any durable solution
must be balanced and fair.
</P>
<P>
Israel insists that Jerusalem remain under its full sovereignty
as its "eternal and indivisible" capital, a claim not recognized
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Arab and Islamic countries support the Palestinians' stance that
East Jerusalem is part of the territories occupied by Israel in the
1967 Mideast War and should be returned. The Palestinians want that
part of the holy city as the capital of their future independent
state.

<HEADLINE> Pak Attack Foiled, 4 Pak Soldiers Killed: India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Army claimed on
Thursday that it had foiled an attack by Pakistani troops on a
forward Indian post along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir,
killing four Pakistani soldiers and injuring four others.
</P>
<P>
A group of Pakistani soldiers wearing black combat dresses
entered Indian territory near the forward post in the Noushera
sector at around 3:45 early Thursday morning, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) quoted defense sources in Kashmir as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alert Indian troops, on noticing the movement of the enemy,
swung into action and opened fire on them, the sources said,
adding that in the ensuing gunbattle which lasted for nearly two
hours two Pakistani soldiers were killed and four others injured.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani soldiers pulled their dead and injured back to their
side under the cover of firing from Pakistani posts and there was
no casualty on the Indian side, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, two Pakistani soldiers were killed
opposite the Krishna Ghatti area of the Poonch sector in
retaliatory action by the Indian troops on Wednesday night, the
PTI added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in U.S. leading newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Former defense secretary Richard Cheney accepted the
Republican vice presidential nomination Wednesday night and
immediately took aim at Vice President Gore, tying Gore to
President Clinton and holding them both responsible for making
Washington "a scene of bitterness and ill will and partisan strife.
"
</P>
<P>
-- Many of the Republican convention speakers during the prime
evening hours for the past three nights have been minorities, and
party leaders say reaching out to minority voters will be crucial
to the GOP's long-term success in a nation where faces of color
are becoming more and more plentiful.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Republican Party Wednesday night nominated George W.
Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
-- Four years after it led the nation into a sweeping
deregulation of the electric industry, California is at the brink
of a breakdown in its power supply. The state Wednesday nearly ran
out of power for the third straight day.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- California ordered energy-saving measures as a heat wave and
a regulatory crisis threatened rolling cutoffs or a broader grid
collapse. The situation results from serious miscalculations about
deregulation, which the state helped pioneer.
</P>
<P>
-- FBI e-mail surveillance came in for court scrutiny as a
judge gave the agency until August 16 to decide if it will
disclose blueprints for its Carnivore system. A civil-liberties
group is seeking them under the Freedom of Information Act.

<HEADLINE> China to Become World's Second Largest Aviation Market: Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 3 (Xinhua) --Boeing believes that China would
become the second largest aviation country after the United States
in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
According to a market survey by Boeing, China's civil aviation
industry will require 1,790 jet planes worth 137 billion U.S.
dollars in the coming two decades, said Fred R. Howard, president
of Boeing China Inc., at a flight demonstration today in Urumqi,
capital city of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The prospect is very attractive, said Howard. In fact, China is
a market that no jet manufacturer can ignore.
</P>
<P>
Boeing will continue its cooperation with China's civil
aviation industry and provide the Chinese market with better
aircrafts and post-sale services, Howard added.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has worked out a so-called Total Customer Solution (TCS)
to help promote the development of China's aviation industry. The
Solution, based on the ordinary post-sale services, will help
customers solve problems such as fund raising, leasing jets, the
application of technology, management, and training of aviation
professionals.
</P>
<P>
This would be the first time that Boeing introduces TCS to
Chinese customers.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's 767-400ER, the latest model to join the 767 fleet, is
currently on a world trip flying to 17 cities and four continents.
</P>
<P>
The plane will give flight demonstrations in Urumqi, Shanghai,
Beijing, and Haikou, capital city of south China's Hainan Province
this week.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the biggest jet producer in the world, entered the
Chinese market in 1972. Among China's 510 jet planes, 341, are
made by Boeing.

<HEADLINE> HK Customs Launches New Mission at Int'l Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Customs will have a
greater role to play at the international front with the recent
assumption of the office of a vice-chairman of the World Customs
Organization (WCO), a senior customs officer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent assumption of the office of a WCO vice-
chairman, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department has started
to launch a new and important mission at the international front,
Customs Assistant Commissioner Lawrence Wong Sau-pui told a media
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Customs, in the name of "Hong Kong, China," was
elected a vice-chairman of the WCO representing the Asia Pacific
region at the WCO's Council Sessions held in Brussels last month.
</P>
<P>
The tenure of the office of the vice-chairman will last from
July 2000 to June 2002.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time Hong Kong Customs takes up such an
important role at the international arena, which greatly
strengthens the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's status
as a separate customs territory working under the principle of '
one country, two systems'," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The WCO is an independent intergovernmental body with worldwide
membership whose mission is to enhance the effectiveness and
efficiency of customs administrations in the areas of compliance
with trade regulations, protection of society and revenue
collection, thereby contributing to the economic and social well-
being of nations.

<HEADLINE> Stock Market Investors Should be Able to Sue Market Manipulators: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A renown Chinese legal expert has
put forward the proposal to establish proper legislation to
provide average stock market investors with the right to sue
irregular stock market dealings.
</P>
<P>
Wang Liming, member of the Financial and Economic Committee of
National People's Congress, made the call at a legislative
symposium held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"China's stock market is flourishing, but we have a crisis on
our hands," he warned, noting that "illicit market manipulations
are becoming more conspicuous."
</P>
<P>
Merely relying on the government to tackle the problem will not
do, since capital and manpower are limited, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"However, if laws are established to encourage average
investors to sue market manipulators, it would cost the government
nothing and the victims will be compensated if they win their
lawsuits," Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, such lawsuits against stock market manipulators are
usually thrown out of court because there are no clear legal laws
concerning market manipulation.
</P>
<P>
"In order to meet the needs of the market economy and
international practices, improper intervention from the government
should be reduced to a minimum," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing a remedy for those who have suffered
market manipulation, improving the current legislation can provide
a favorable environment for the government to more effectively
regulate the market, he said.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Calls for Palestinian Resistance Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei here on Wednesday urged the Palestinians to resort to
resistance against Israel in order to get back their lands occupied
by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Resistance is the sole way of liberating Palestinian lands, the
leader said, quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with visiting Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih
Berri, Khamenei also emphasized that all Palestinian refugees,
displaced by the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, must be
allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
Tehran, which refuses to recognize the Jewish state, has opposed
the Middle East peace process and called for armed struggle to
liberate Israeli-occupied Arab and Islamic lands.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli pullout from south Lebanon in May after 22 years
of occupation, Khamenei said it was a "unforgettable" victory of
the Lebanese resistance movement.
</P>
<P>
He warned, however, that the resistance and struggle against
Israel must continue, as the Israeli threat still exists due to the
Jewish state's "greediness."
</P>
<P>
Despite the Lebanese victory, great struggles lie ahead, said
Khamenei. He added that with Palestine being still occupied, the
danger of Israel will be there and all Muslims have the duty to
strive for liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Berri for his part thanked Iran's long-time support for the
Lebanese resistance movement and expressed hope that such supports
would continue. He also called on Iran to help Beirut in its
reconstruction effort.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese parliament speaker arrived here Wednesday on an
official visit. He has held talks with his Iranian counterpart
Mehdi Karrubi on bilateral relations and the Middle East issue.

export and import of genetically-treated foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syria's natural gas production is expected to reach
24 million cubic meters in 2005 against 13 million cubic meters at

including 12 million export-oriented tons.
</P>
<P>
It is planning to build a third oil refinery with a capacity of

</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Balkan firms will seek to increase the number of
partnerships during the Balkan Partnership 2000 program conference
to be held in Greece's northern city of Thessaloniki in November
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Economic Development Foundation announced Wednesday

would make a decision on the issue as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The cost of resurrecting the eight banks is expected to be as

Another alternative is to form several smaller merged entities,
while the third option is to sell the banks individually.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Japanese Nippon company and South Korean Posco company
are taking great interest in the privatization of the Turkish iron

Isdemir's General Director Necip Ebegil said Nippon and Posco
can submit bids to Isdemir on August 18.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Isdemir can benefit from the technology and markets
of these two companies, Ebegil said.

<HEADLINE> International Efforts Urged to Help Iran Combat Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) here on Wednesday urged the international community
to help Iran fight against an unprecedented drought that has hit
most parts of the country, inflicting severe damages.
</P>
<P>
Immediate help and relief efforts are needed from the
international community to assist the Iranian government, which is
almost at its wits' end in face of the drought disaster, Xu
Haoliang, deputy resident representative of the UNDP in Tehran told
Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
He said a mission of U.N. experts are currently in Iran to
evaluate and confirm the severity of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Ir Frits Verhoog, a member of the U.N. mission, stressed in the
interview that the mission's task is mainly focused on estimating
the drought situation and mobilizing international support, while
all the material aids needed, such as water tankers, would mostly
be provided by voluntary foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
At present, Iran needs about 10,000 water tankers to send
drinking water to people in rural regions, he said, adding that the
U.N. will also help the Iranian government to mobilize national
forces to fight against the drought, the most serious one in the
past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Documents provided by the UNDP showed that, up to now, 18 of
Iran's 28 provinces, mostly in southern, eastern and central parts
of the country, have been seriously affected by the drought, which
was caused mainly by the continuous lack of precipitation since
last year.
</P>
<P>
A large number of livestock, such as camels and cattle, have
died of the dryness. The drought has also caused agricultural
losses of 2.8 million tons of wheat and 280,000 tons of barley.
Total damages caused by the drought in agricultural, livestock and
potable water sectors are estimated at 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has allocated some 0.3 percent of the
state budget, or 2.600 trillion rials (some 317 million dollars),
to deal with the drought problem, mainly through buying dying
livestock from farmers and providing food and potable water.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's allocations are far from enough, the
U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
With the acute water shortage, it is estimated that over 60
percent of the rural population may be forced to migrate to cities,
which, in most cases, are facing serious water shortage themselves,
Verhoog said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the overall drought situation in Iran may further
worsen in the months to come, as summer temperatures continue to
rise and rain is not expected until November.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. officials expressed optimism that foreign countries
will respond positively to the U.N. call, saying that some
countries have explicitly showed their willingness to help.

BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Ma Mingyu failed to become the
first Chinese footballer to play in Italian Serie A after the talk
between his club Sichuan Quanxing and Perugia fell through.
</P>

term "transfer" Perugia had used in their fax to Quanxing.
</P>
<P>
The Italian side also said that they would not cost money on
such an ageing player as Ma although the 30-year-old Chinese
international is the only player eligible to play in Serie A.
</P>
<P>
Quanxing club later raised another proposal that Perugia free
loan a Serie A player to Quanxing in exchange for Ma, only to be
rejected by the Italian side.
</P>
<P>
Perugia showed their interest in Ma after Quanxing launched
their pre-season training camp in Italy. The Italian club sent a

XI'AN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China held an international seminar
here today to study the Xi'an Incident, which forced Kuomintang
leader Chiang Kai-shek (1888-1975) to stop the civil war and fight
against Japanese aggression.

More than 60 people from China and overseas attended the
meeting. They delivered more than 60 papers and discussed a wide
range of issues relevant to the Incident.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Give UNIFIL Deployment Nod in 24 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud is
expected to give the final nod to a complete U.N. peacekeepers
deployment in south Lebanon within 24 hours, the local press
reported Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army and the command of the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) scheduled a crucial meeting on Thursday morning in
the border town of Naqoura to finalize field arrangements for the
imminent deployment, An Nahar newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are to certify that Israel has corrected the last
border encroachment in the Yaroun district, on the strength of
which President Lahoud will give the green light to UNIFIL to fan
out in the entire zone vacated by Israeli troops withdrawal on May
24.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL second-in-command Gen. James Sreenan and Lebanese
military command Amin Hotait spent the whole day of Wednesday at
the Yaroun district to verify whether Israel had corrected its last
infringement on the Blue Line, which was drawn by U.N.
cartographers to verify Israel's withdrawal in accordance with U.N.
Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian sappers have dismantled about 130 mines to clear a
path for the joint verification team to cross in a UNIFIL armored
car to the immediate border vicinity at Yaroun.
</P>
<P>
The final report on the verification will be presented to Lahoud
by or after the meeting in Naqoura.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the anti-Israeli Hezbollah guerrillas Wednesday
withdrew from two outposts they had set up at the Manara and
Abbassieh border points in the central sector of the Blue Line and
handed them over to UNIFIL troops, the As Safir newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas have taken effective control of the vacated
zone after the May 24 Israeli withdrawal, pending the U.N.
deployment.
</P>
<P>
The leadership of Hezbollah, or Party of God, has given public
assurances that their guerrillas will not defy UNIFIL or the
Lebanese army when they move into the liberated strip, which had
been under Israeli occupation for 22 years.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Denies Challenging Barak's Party leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami emphasized Thursday morning he has no intention of
running against Prime Minister Ehud Barak for the leadership of
Labor party.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, a leading dovish politician, said in an Israel Radio
interview that he has no doubt that Barak will lead the party in
the next elections, even if he does not succeed in reaching a peace
agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has created many political rivals in the
process of advancing peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Three right-wing parties in his coalition resigned from his
government ahead of the Camp David peace summit last month, due to
his readiness to go to the summit.
</P>
<P>
To Barak's deep disappointment, the summit with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to
resolve core issues between Israel and the Palestinians after 15-
day-long negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Foreign Minister David Levy, who argued that Israel
made too many compromises at Camp David, also submitted his
resignation letter Wednesday, which made Barak's control in the
Knesset (Parliament) further shrink to 40 seats, one third of the
total 120 members.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported Thursday morning that even in Barak's own
Labor party, there is also growing critical attitude toward his
handling with the peace process and domestic political issues.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that at a Wednesday evening meeting of Barak's
One Israel faction, in which the Labor party is the backbone, Barak
and Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg were entangled in a venomous
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Some figures in the party even raised the possibility of ousting
Barak as the party's leader. Ben-Ami and Burg are two promising
candidates, according to these figures, to replace Barak.
</P>
<P>
However, Ben-Ami said Thursday he will not challenge Barak's
party leadership at such a critical time for fighting for Israel's
security and national interests.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated he will keep working to advance the peace process
with full coordination with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
There is room for criticism within the party, Ben-Ami said, but
at this time, stability within the government is needed.
</P>
<P>
Communications Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer also told Israel
Radio Thursday morning that in his opinion, no one in the Labor
party will dare to challenge Barak's authority as long as the prime
minister is committed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would like to succeed Levy as Israel's new
foreign minister, Ben-Ami replied the portfolio is a very important
job, but it is up to Barak himself to decide who will be the next
foreign minister. If he is appointed, Ben-Ami added, he will carry
out the job faithfully.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the foreign ministry, there are other 10 ministerial
posts vacated by the resignation of Shas, National Religious Party
and Yisrael Ba'aliya ministers, and the resignation of former
Transport Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who was involved in a sexual
scandal and is waiting for trial.
</P>
<P>
Ben Eliezer said Barak had set up teams on Sunday to negotiate
with various parties to explore the possibility of re-organizing a
solid coalition.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Kucik, the director-general of Barak's Office, revealed
Thursday that Barak might name a batch of ministers to fill the
vacuum as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the major opposition Likud party
leader Ariel Sharon repeated Thursday that he will not form a
national unity government with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Levy and Yisrael Ba'aliya party leader Natan Sharansky had
promoted the establishment of such a government in the past few
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Suffers Heavy Economic Cost by Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The ten-year U.N. sanctions imposed
on Iraq after its occupation of Kuwait on August 2, 1990 have also
inflicted great economic and social losses on Turkey, statistics
indicate.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the U.N. sanctions, Iraq ranked first in terms of
foreign trade volume with Turkey among Turkey's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. sanctions, which started ten years ago, brought a
collateral blow to Turkey's economy, especially in the southeastern
region bordering north Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Some economists estimated Turkey's losses have reached nearly
80-100 billion U.S. dollars over the past ten years, Turkish Daily
News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Parallel to economic ties, political relations between the two
countries soured after the Gulf War in which Turkey played a part
in the U.S.-led coalition that forced Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two neighboring countries were also worsened by
Turkey's role in helping allied planes enforce a no-fly zone in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Aslan, chairman of Trade Chamber in southern province
Gaziantep, said "not only Turkey's southeast, but regions all over
Turkey have incurred great losses."
</P>
<P>
"The closure of the border gates to Iraq has caused economic
losses and unemployment. Before the crisis we had almost 4 billion
dollars in trade volume per year with Iraq. We were making more
than 500 million dollars in live animal exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had played a bridge for Turkey to reach out to the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
"We also had important economic relations through Iraq with Gulf
countries including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman
and Bahrain before the crisis," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the trade volume with those countries constitutes
only 8 percent of Turkey's total foreign trade, showing that the
crisis has paralyzed Turkey's previously prosperous relations with
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
The poor economic conditions led immigrant flows, from southeast
in particular, to other parts of the country and intensified
terrorist activities by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK),
which has waged a 15-year armed struggle for self-rule in Kurdish-
populated southeast.
</P>
<P>
The chairman called on the government to take urgent measures to
re-establish its trade with Iraq and other Gulf countries to pre-
Gulf War levels.
</P>
<P>
Gaziantep Industry Chamber Chairman Nejat Kocer described the
past ten years as "lost years," urging the government to make
efforts to lift the U.N.-imposed embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Turkey has decided to change its current
relations with Iraq and is expected to appoint a new ambassador to
Baghdad very soon in a bid to upgrade bilateral relations.

ISLAMABAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Two persons were killed and
four others injured when a fresh bomb blast occurred Thursday in
Pakistan's southwestern city of Quetta.
</P>
<P>
According to local police sources, the blast was apparently the
result of a pencil time bomb which went off Thursday afternoon in
a auto workshop.
</P>
<P>
Those killed were auto mechanics and the injured included two
children whose conditions were said to be critical.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth bomb blast in Quetta in the last two weeks.
On July 22, three bombs exploded in the capital of Balochistan
province killing six people.
</P>
<P>
The police sources also told Xinhua that 126 hand grenades and
other ammunition were recovered in Quetta recently during a
campaign to clean the city of illegal arms.
</P>
<P>
Police raided a under-construction house in the city and found
126 grenades, two rocket fuses and thousand of rounds of
Klashnikovs buried there in a polythene bag.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Goes to Kashmir, Army Launches Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the evening of August 1 to early morning of August 2,
militants in Kashmir made at least six terrorist attacks against
local civilians, killing at least 100 people and injuring nearly
100 others.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, heading an all-party delegation which included senior
officials like Defense Minister George Fernandes, Railway Minister
Mamata Banerjee and Opposition leader Congress President Sonia
Gandhi, would mainly visit Pahalgam in west Kashmir, where
militants massacred 36 people, mostly pilgrims on their way to the
holy Amarnath Cave in north India, said the PTI, adding that the
delegation was scheduled to return here by evening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indian army on Thursday launched a major offensive
against militants in the Kashmir valley, the PTI quoted top
defense sources in Kashmir as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have launched helicopter-mounted operations in Doda and
other areas of Pri Panjal ranges to sanitize the entire belt
against the militant attacks," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The primary target of the operation was the Lashkar-e-Toiba
militant outfit, which Indian Home Affairs Minister L K Advani
accused on Wednesday of conducting the massacres, they added.
</P>
<P>
Police, Border Security Force and other troops have been put on
high alert in several districts across Kashmir, they said.
</P>
<P>
The PTI also said on Thursday that seven militants, including
five "foreign mercenaries" who tried to infiltrated into India-
controlled Kashmir from the Pakistani side, had been killed in
Kashmir since Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Jakarta Working Closely to Probe Bomb Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that police authorities from the Philippines are now
working hand in hand with their Indonesian counterparts to probe
the bomb attack on the Philippine Embassy in Jakarta on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Press Undersecretary Michael Toledo said the
Philippine and Indonesian governments are now working closely to
get to the bottom of the incident which killed two and injured
several others including Philippine Ambassador Leonides Caday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has sent its own team of experts to assist in
the investigation, including members of the National Bureau of
Investigation, Philippine National Police and Department of
Foreign Affairs, Toledo said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said Philippine intelligence operatives are helping
Indonesia conduct a cross-check of Filipinos who entered Jakarta
during the last two weeks or so.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government had noticed an unusually high number
of Filipinos who entered Jakarta in the last couple of weeks,
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the investigation will not be
likely limited to Filipinos. "There is no concentration (of the
investigation) on Filipinos. All possibilities are being looked
into,"he said.
</P>
<P>
Toledo repeatedly stressed that in the absence of concrete
evidence, the investigators are pursuing all possible leads on the
case as of now.

<HEADLINE> Talks Begin Between Indian Government, Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Talks began in Kashmir Thursday
afternoon between the Indian government and leaders of Hizbul
Mujahideen, a major militant outfit in Kashmir, to work out
modalities of a cease-fire announced by the militants last week,
the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks, being held in Srinagar, capital of India-controlled
Kashmir, were attended by a two-member Indian Home Ministry team
headed by Home Secretary Kamal Pande and four commanders of Hizbul
Mujahideen and Fazal Haq Qureshi, nominated mediator of the
militant outfit, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi was quoted as saying they had come for talks to work
out modalities of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Hizbul Mujahideen made a surprise announcement
of a unilateral cease-fire, to which the Indian government
responded with cessation of all military operations against the
militants and an offer for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, this had triggered a mass bloodshed in Kashmir on the
evening of August 1 when militants opposed to the cease-fire
launched a series of attacks against civilians, massacring at
least 100 people and injuring nearly 100 others.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government said on Wednesday that it would be
deterred from holding talks with Hizbul Mujahideen by the bloody
killings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, news from Islamabad said Hizbul Mujahideen
threatened to end its cease-fire offer on August 8 if India
insisted on excluding Pakistan from the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
While respecting the cease-fire with Hizbul Mujahideen, India
has not agreed to allow Pakistan a place at the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Washington Agree to Hold More Talks on SOFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States agreed Thursday
to transfer custody of United States Forces Korea (USFK) soldiers
to South Korea at the time of indictment under ensured legal
rights for the U.S. suspects.
</P>
<P>
The current SOFA stipulates U.S. criminal suspects be handed
over to South Korea after sentencing.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was reached at the end of two-day meeting
on the revision of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between
South Korea and the United States, was carried in an eight-point
joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to discuss establishment of SOFA
provisions on environmental protection and further deliberate all
other issues discussed in the round of talks.
</P>
<P>
"The two delegations explored ways to establish a new civil
proceedings provision and avoid reporting traffic accidents as
criminal violations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to hold the next round of talks in the United
States before October.
</P>
<P>
Items discussed at the meeting included the environment,
granting and return of land and facilities, quarantine of animals
and plants, working conditions for Korean employees of USFK,
control of Korean nationals' access to USFK's Non-Appropriated
Fund facilities, civil proceedings and the scope of persons
covered under the SOFA.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been pushing for revision of the agreement
which is seen a slant to favor the USFK in the country as many
South Koreans believe that U.S. soldiers enjoy preferential
treatment after a series of incidents.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was concluded amid strong anti-U.S. sentiments in
South Korea after the USFK had discharged poisonous chemicals
formaldehyde into the Han River at its headquarters in downtwon
Seoul and the U.S. bombing practice in Maehyang-ri had caused
great damage and wounds to the local residents.

<P>
MACAO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The results of the drawing of lots
for the preliminaries are not helping China as the Atlanta
Olympics women's volleyball silver medalists start their campaign
at the Sydney Olympics next month, China's head coach said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jin said although China is drawn into an apparent weaker
group which also includes Brazil, the United States, Croatia,
Australia and Kenya, the squad will definitely have a tough
quarterfinal to play.
</P>
<P>
He said according to schedule, top four teams from each group
will face opponents from the other group to vie for a berth in the
final four.
</P>
<P>
Hu expected Russia, Cuba, Italy and South Korea will qualify
for the quarterfinals from the other group but each of them is
tough to beat.
</P>
<P>
Hu added: "I would rather be drawn into a group with stronger
teams so that the quarterfinals would be easier."
</P>
<P>
China is aiming at entering the last four at Sydney, he said.

<HEADLINE> CAS Rebuffs Chiba's Claim over Olympic Selection: Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Court of Arbitration for Sport
(CAS) dismissed Japanese swimmer Suzu Chiba's claim over Japan's
Olympic selection process on Thursday, Japan's Kyodo news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo said after hearing arguments from Chiba and the Japan
Amateur Swimming Federation (JASF) in Tokyo, CAS arbitrators ruled
that the JASF's decision to omit the 24-year-old swimmer from the
national team for the Sydney Olympics is valid.
</P>
<P>
The CAS, however, ordered the JASF to pay 10,000 Swiss francs (
about 650,000 yen) "to partly compensate Suzu Chiba for expenses
incurred in connection with this appeal procedure," which it said
"might have been avoided" if the JASF had disclosed its selection
policy.

NANJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
which ranks second in the country in terms of GDP, has attracted a
growing number of Chinese students that have studied in foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
The province's six development zones for returned students to

Statistics show these businesses, mostly engaged in high-tech
industries, have generated more than 100 million yuan (about 12
million U.S. dollars) in profits.
</P>
<P>
Local experts attributed the achievements to an improving
business environment in these zones.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stone Forest Found in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Geologists have discovered in
southern Hainan Province a stone forest, which is similar to a
tropical rain forest, a phenomenon rarely found elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The Xian'an stone forest, located in the village of Qianlong,
Baoting County, covers an area of 350,000 square meters, including
170,000 square meters of exposed karrens.
</P>
<P>
The karrens, standing on the 700-meter-high Xian'an Hill, are
mostly three to four meters tall; there are also some 10-15 meter
ones, and the tallest is 35 meters.
</P>
<P>
In the stone forest are a large number of water-eroded caves
different in size and shape. In some of the caves are streams
where people can boat.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the place was under the sea 400 million years
ago. Crustal movement made the thick limestone deposited on the
seabed upthrust and later turned into the unique karst landforms
through long-time erosion by wind and rain.
</P>
<P>
Another stone forest in China, located in southwest Yunnan
Province, covers 26,666 hectares. The Yunnan Stone Forest was
designated a state-level scenic spot in 1982.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government has
reached agreement with Cyber-Port Limited, a special vehicle set
up under Pacific Century CyberWorks (PCCW) to perform the role of
Cyberport developer, on the Residential Portion Land Value for the
Cyberport project.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Information Technology and Broadcasting
Bureau said Thursday that the residential portion land value of
the project, at 7.8 billion HK dollars (1 billion U.S. dollars),
was agreed by the two sides following a series of discussions in
the past eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The figure of 7.8 billion HK dollars is the open market value
of the land earmarked for the Residential Portion as at the date
of the grant of the Development Right to the Developer on June 8
this year." he said. This premium of 7.8 billion reflects an
accommodation value of 20,780 HK dollars (2,664 U.S. dollars) per
square meter.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal reached between the government and the developer
in May this year, the developer should hand over the completed
Cyberport in three phases by end 2001/early 2002, end 2002 and end
2003.
</P>
<P>
The Cyberport, designed to provide an information
infrastructure to create in Hong Kong a strategic cluster of IT
companies and professional talents, has attracted great interest
from international companies, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
To date, a total of 155 companies, local and overseas, have

BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai plans to invest 1.02
billion yuan (about 123 million U.S. dollars) into the development
of traditional Chinese medicine in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Between 2000 and 2002, the municipal government will invest 120
million yuan for the project, and the rest is expected to come
from local enterprises and social organizations, the Wen Hui Daily
reported.
</P>

By implementing the three-year plan, the municipal authorities
expect to speed up the production of patent Chinese traditional
medicines, the Shanghai-based newspaper said.

<P>
Over the past five years, Shanghai lagged behind the rest of
the country in developing new patent herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
Of the 863 new medicines approved by the Ministry of Health
between 1994 and 1999, only 11, or one percent of the national
figure, were produced in Shanghai, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years, Shanghai plans to cultivate ten major
manufacturers in the sector and ten brand products each with an
annual sales worth over one million yuan, the report said.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Plan to Search For Risky Earthward Objects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese astronomers have planned
to build a monitoring station to search for risky earthward minor
planets and comets that might collide with the Earth.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jiexing, an astronomer in charge of the project, said
today the station will be built in Tieshanshi State Forest Park in
Xuyi County in Jiangsu Province, east China, at an estimated
expense of more than 10 million yuan (1.25 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the searching plan is the necessary step before any
measures could be taken to prevent any possible disastrous
collision between the Earth and minor planets and Comets.
</P>
<P>
Chinese astronomers will use the telescope to search for any
risky earthward minor planet and comet, and then figure out their
orbits so as to make sure whether they will pose any threat to the
Earth, said yang.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the location is an ideal place for them as the park
has a wide view and the night sky there is very dim with fine
weather for most of the year.
</P>
<P>
The telescope to be installed is a near earth telescope which
has a diameter of 1.2 meters, said Yang, who works for the Nanjing-
based Purple Mountain Observatory.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be completed by 2002 with funding
from local and central government departments and contributions
from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said the Earth has been hit many times in history by foreign
space objects, such as minor planets and comets, leaving lots of
aerolite-related pits on the surface of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
"The most recent event took place in 1906 when a piece of
aerolite with a diameter of 50 meters hit forests in Siberia,
leaving 2,000 sq. km forest destroyed," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sciences Times published Monday by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, British and other European scientists are
probing ways to change the orbits of minor planets using nuclear
bombs if they are deemed to pose threats to the Earth.
</P>
<P>
Orbits of the Earth and some of the 200,000 verified minor
planets are overlapped, which may lead to collision, the paper
said.

CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
arrived in Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast Thursday to hold
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Israel's peace
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid greeted Barak upon arrival at
the airport and accompanied him to Ras el-Teen Palace on the
seafront to meet Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Barak was expected to brief the Egyptian leader, a key player in
the Middle East, on his own views on the Camp David peace summit
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly would ask Mubarak to try to persuade Arafat to
adopt a less "uncompromising" stance on the question of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak ended their 15-day talks in the United States
last Tuesday without an agreement on the thorniest issues,
including the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian refugees
and Jewish settlers and the borders of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future state while Israel insists that the holy city, sacred
to Muslims, Jews and Christians, is its "eternal and indivisible"
capital, a claim never so far internationally recognized.
</P>
<P>
Barak came to Egypt one day after Arafat met Mubarak on the last
leg of a tour of Arab states garnering support following the Camp
David summit.

<HEADLINE> Five Olympic Athletes on Tour to Sudan and Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Five Olympic athletes have begun
an eight-day journey to the Sudan and Eritrea, according to a
press release by the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The team will be working in cooperation with Olympic Aid, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and various
national Olympic committees and governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The team of Olympians is led by quadruple gold medallist
Norwegian speed skater Johann Koss. He is joined by Canadian rower
Silken Laumann, Australian swimming legend Shane Gould, American
champion gymnast Trent Dimas, and American track star Mike Powell.
</P>
<P>
The mission from July 31 to August 8 is a grassroots initiative
organized by the athlete-run international humanitarian
organization, Olympic Aid, and the athletes themselves. Their goal
is to deliver hope and relief to Eritrean refugee children and
raise awareness of their desperate situation.
</P>
<P>
This will be accomplished through the organization of Olympic
Festivals in the refugee camps of Kassala and the displaced
persons camps of Asmara, as well as through the generous donation
of Nike sporting equipment. Confronted by the horrors of armed
conflict and the boredom of refugee camp life, sport and
recreation are the only outlets for these children.
</P>
<P>
Based on the true Olympic Spirit of peace, goodwill and human
dignity, this mission underscores the true meaning of the Olympic
Movement, according to the IOC. These Olympic athletes are eager
to show the world that the Olympic Movement and the Games are
about more than simply competition and victory; the Olympic
movement is about friendship among nations and people and it is
defined by a desire to both strive for personal excellence and
help others to achieve excellence.

<HEADLINE> Report Calls for China's Strategic Oil Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A recent research report has
called for the establishment of China's strategic oil reserve
system as soon as possible to combat crisis caused by changes in
the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
The report on China's future oil imports suggests that a
government strategic oil reserve plus enterprises' commercial
reserve should not be less than 15 million tons by year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The current reserve of state-owned petroleum enterprises is
very limited and could support production for only one week or so,
says the report released by the Economic Research Center of the
State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
The report further notes that major oil consumption countries
such as the United States and Japan all have their strategic
reserve systems, adding that the absence of the strategic oil
reserve is not suitable to China's position as a major oil
consumer.
</P>
<P>
It is also unfavorable for the government and enterprises as
well to weather changes in the international oil market and posts
a threat to the nation's economic security, says the report.
</P>
<P>
It predicts that China's oil production would remain at 160-170
million tons in the foreseeable future, while the consumption
would hit 243 million tons by 2005, 296 million tons by 2010 and
360 million tons by 2015.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Army Chief Denies Military's Involvement in Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Army Chief of Staff
Gen. Tyasno Sudarto Thursday denied allegations that elements of
the Military (TNI) were involved in Tuesday's bomb explosion in
Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"Those who accused the TNI (of being involved in the bombing)
just want to undermine the unity and cohesion in Indonesia,"
Tyasno told reporters in Makassar, capital of South Sulawesi
province.
</P>
<P>
Tyasno was in Makassar to preside over the transfer of the post
of chief of the Wirabuana regional military command overseeing
Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
"We should promote alertness. Do not let ourselves be pitted
against others by certain parties who want to instigate unrest,"
he was quoted by the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tyasno also did not rule out the possibility that the bombing
was the handiwork of international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"Now is an era of globalization, when borders between countries
can be easily crossed. The increasingly sophisticated
communication and information system has also enhanced the acts of
terrorism," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a powerful bomb blast in front of the residence of
Philippine Ambassador Leonides T. Caday in Central Jakarta left
two persons dead and 21 others, including the Philippine envoy,
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta Police Chief Inspector General Nurfaizi Thursday told
reporters that his office is probing the statement of a group
which calls itself Mujahiddin Khandaq from the Philippines, which
has claimed responsibility for Tuesday's bombing.
</P>
<P>
"The vice president of the Philippines however said there is no
such organization in her country," Nurfaizi said.
</P>
<P>
A day after the massive explosion, the Jakarta Police received
a facsimile message from Mujahiddin Khandaq.
</P>
<P>
Nurfaizi said the letter is considered important information
but the authorities are still evaluating its authenticity.
</P>
<P>
"We are closely coordinating with the Philippine authorities in
investigating the bombing," he added.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Declared as Defendant in Corruption Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia's Attorney General
Office (AGO) declared here Thursday former president Soeharto as a
defendant in corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to appear before the court soon, sources at the
AGO said after meeting with Soeharto's lawyers at the 79 year old
man's residence in Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon confirmed the changes
of Soeharto's status by saying that, "Pak Harto (Soeharto) has
been named as defendant in corruption case, as of today" he told
Xinhua, adding that his side has not yet received any official
letter on the changes of his client status.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Soeharto was named as suspect in corruption charges
and has been put under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
He and his family have been accused of corruptly amassing
illegal fortune during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to stepped down from his presidential
office in May 1998 following an economic and political crisis in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman has pledged to bring Soeharto
to justice before August 10, coincided with the annual session of
the country's highest law-making body of the People' Consultative
Assembly (MPR), scheduled for August 7-18.
</P>
<P>
But Tampubolon said that he is not optimistic that Soeharto
could be tried before August 10. "It is a miracle, if Soeharto can
be tried before August 10. According to a normal schedule, a
defendant would be tried at least three weeks after the dossier
being submitted to the court. Now, the dossier of Soeharto have
not yet been submitted to the court, it just has been filed to the
prosecutors only. But perhaps, there will be another miracle," he
told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Romania Gives More Responsibilities to State-run Company Managers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government has
decided to give more responsibilities to state-run company
managers in an attempt to eliminate their current financial
difficulties, according to a media report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government recently issued an emergency decree making the
payment of salaries in indebted state companies conditional upon
debt servicing. But the decree stirred the anger of trade unions.
Both sides later agreed to increase managers' responsibilities,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the managers of the state-run companies
will be given free hand to offer salaries they see fit but are
asked to take measures on freezing the arrears. Should the
managers fail to comply, heavy fines of up to 150 million lei (
about 6,830 U.S. dollars) will be imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
The indebted companies will be restructured and their
collective bargain contracts will also be renegotiated if they
fail to present their annual budgets in due time, Minister of
State Mircea Ciumara was quoted by the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The state-run companies record peak debt figures of more than 7
billion U.S. dollars, the equivalent of Romania's state budget
and about the same as the country's foreign debt, said the report.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Likely to Award African Country 2010 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The pressure from Africa to
force FIFA to award a country on the continent the right to host
the World Cup has yielded results.
</P>
<P>
The Star newspaper on Thursday quoted reliable FIFA sources as
saying that the world soccer governing body would announce shortly
that an African country, possibly South Africa, would host the
2010 soccer World Cup.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would get the nod on condition it withdrew the
arbitration case against the decision by FIFA to allow Germany to
host the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Sources within FIFA said on Wednesday that the world soccer
governing body intended to announce the host of the 2010 World Cup
tournament at the FIFA congress to avoid the legal threat posed by
South Africa, which is unhappy with the vote that gave Germany the
right to host the 2006 tournament.
</P>
<P>
FIFA has already set a precedent, by announcing the hosts of
the 1970 and 1974 World Cup tournaments at the same time that
England was awarded the 1966 tournament. The 1970 tournament was
given to Mexico, with Germany being granted the 1974 event, and
insiders believe that the possibility exists that South Africa
could be awarded the 2010 World Cup in the same way.

<HEADLINE> Individuals Buy Most Housing in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Individuals have become the
mainstay of home buyers in Sichuan Province, one of the most
populous areas in western China.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the province sold houses with a
total floor space of 1.74 million square meters, up 13 percent
from a year earlier. More than 93 percent of the buyers are
individuals.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government official cites two reasons for the
booming real estate market. One is urban residents now show
growing enthusiasm in purchasing new homes due to the on-going
housing reform and improved services in house purchase. The other
is that state banks offer loans to new home buyers.

<P>
Only one of the 28 funds on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
markets rose.
</P>
<P>
Five funds dropped more than one percent, including four small-
cap restructured funds. Fund Tongzhi was the top loser, down 7.3
percent, which implies that the market is paying more attention to
performances and investment values. Moreover, listing
uncertainties facing Fund Tongzhi's newly expanded units have
exposed the fund to market fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the 22 restructured funds would regain an
upward trend, after the vigorous corrections.

<HEADLINE> Lead Pollution of Urban Children Raises Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The increasingly serious lead
pollution among China's urban children has caught the attention of
a group of experts and officials, who gathered here today to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
An April survey of 14,400 children in the southern city of
Guangzhou showed that 83.2 percent of them carry in their bodies
lead that is much higher than the normal standard.
</P>
<P>
The problem was especially acute among children living in the
city's working areas as well as in areas with big flow of traffic.
</P>
<P>
Children are particularly vulnerable to the harms of lead
pollution, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Studies indicated that lead contained in the air one meter
above the ground is estimated to be 16 times more than that in the
air 1.5 meters above the ground.
</P>
<P>
Higher than normal amount of lead in the human body does harms
to the central nerve system, causing mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
The experts called on the public and government to pay more
attention to lead pollution, which is becoming more serious as the
country's economy steams ahead.

<HEADLINE> American Serial Rapist Falls in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- An American fugitive who fled to
Manila following his involvement in a series of rape cases in the
United States fell into police hands Thursday morning and was set
to be flown back to the United States this evening.
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Immigration (BI) Commissioner Rufus Rodriguez told
reporters that Mark Anthony Lewis was arrested by a team of
immigration agents after five days of intensive surveillance
conducted by a joint police and the special operations group of
the BI.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, according to Rodriguez, did not resist arrest and
voluntarily turned himself over to the arresting agents who
immediately brought him to the BI main building in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy to the Philippines said earlier that Lewis is
wanted in Illinois on several charges of home invasions and
criminal sexual assaults which he committed in Chicago between
April 7 and July 19, this year.
</P>
<P>
The embassy said all except one of Lewis' victims were of Asian
descent and that the fugitive has been charged with one count for
each offense.
</P>
<P>
Under the criminal statutes of Illinois, each offense that was
charged against Lewis carries a maximum penalty of 30 years
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said Lewis was arrested for being undocumented alien
as a result of the cancellation of his passport by the U.S.
government.

<HEADLINE> Security Strengthened at Philippine Embassy in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Security measures have been
strengthened at the Philippine Embassy in Bangkok, following a
fatal explosion at the residence of Philippine Ambassador to
Indonesia on Tuesday, the Thai News Agency (TNA) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More security officers have been deployed at the embassy and
adjacent areas, with frequent patrols, the report quoted a senior
police officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Authorities instructed local police to stand guard in front of
the Philippine mission and adjacent areas, though no request for
special protection has been put by the Philippine Embassy, said
the police officer.
</P>
<P>
All cars have been banned from parking near the embassy, and
all vehicles have been and will continue to be checked thoroughly
before entering the building.
</P>
<P>
It was unlikely to have a similar attack at the Philippine
Embassy to Bangkok, as movements of terrorists had been monitored
closely, adding that there had been no reports of any suspected
case, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed and 20 others were injured, including
Philippine Ambassador to Jakarta, from a bomb laid in front of the
residence of the Philippines' top envoy to Indonesia on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Defense Budget to Increase Significantly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) The Indonesia's defense budget is
expected to increase significantly in the next fiscal year to 19.9
trillion rupiah (2.842 billion U.S. dollars), much higher than the
current budget of 10.973 trillion rupiah (1.567 billion U.S.
dollars), a senior official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia also planned to purchase military equipments
including warships and submarines from foreign countries, Ghafar
Suwarno, director general for general planning and budget at the
Ministry of Defense told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current figure of the country's defense budget
only reached 0.9 to 1.8 percent of the national GDP, whereas the
ideal figure is 5 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we will propose to the parliament that our defense
budget at least will reach 2 percent of our GDP," he added.
</P>
<P>
The defense budget within the current fiscal year only reached
10.973 trillion rupiah (1.567 billion U.S. dollars), and in the
fiscal year 1999/2000 it was 12.652 trillion rupiah (1.807 billion
U.S.dollars) while in 1998/1999 it recorded at 8.995 trillion
rupiah (1.285 billion U.S. dollars), Suwarno added.
</P>
<P>
He said that a large portion of the next defense budget will be
allocated to financing the improvement of personnel welfare
program and increasing their professionalism as well.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Minister of Defense Juwono Sudarsono said that the
government would modernize its military, saying that the country
planned to purchase weapons, ammunitions and other military
equipments including warships and submarines to meet the need of
the Indonesian Military (TNI).
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government planned to purchase military
equipments from China.

<HEADLINE> New Market Opened in Central Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 3 (Xinhua)-- A long awaited Orussei Market
was officially opened Thursday in central capital to welcome some
6000 vendors in a bid to promote family economy.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sophara, governor of Phnom Penh, launched the
inauguration ceremony with some hundreds of participants.
</P>
<P>
It is the newest and the biggest market in the capital with
the project costing 11 million dollars. The construction of the
three-story market was started in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
The market is part of an overall plan to upgrade the eight
major shopping areas in the city, said the governor.
</P>
<P>
The market will open seven days a week from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two months, hundreds of vendors staged protests,
demanding lower cost for their booth rentals, and the demand was
compromised lately.
</P>
<P>
The booth rates were set at $1900 to $3300 for a 20-year lease,
with the money to be paid over a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
The vendors will sell all kinds of commodities at the market,
including household facilities and electronics.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Gun-related Crimes Rise in First Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of serious crimes
involving the use of firearms in Japan rose 26.1 percent in the
first half of this year from the same period last year, the
National Police Agency (NPA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 87 serious crimes involving guns were reported,
including 63 robbery and murder-robbery cases and 16 murders, the
agency said in a survey.
</P>
<P>
The number of robbery and murder-robbery in which guns were
used rose by 16 from the same period last year, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
During the period, police confiscated 413 guns, down 93 from a
year earlier, the agency said, adding that the number of guns
seized from gangsters and gangster groups was 242, down 42 from
the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Another survey released by the NPA showed that computer-related
crimes such as fraud and copyright violations in Japan doubled in
the first six months from the same period in 1999.

ABU DHABI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Al Nasr of the United Arab
Emirates became another team to quit the Asian Club Championship
on Thursday, withdrawing from their first round clash with Iraqi
side Al Zawra.
</P>
<P>
The Asian club has been brought forward by a month due because
of the Asian Cup in Lebanon in mid-October and the new dates have
caused widespread problems.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese side Al Ansar have pulled out of Championship while
Saudi Arabia's Shabab Sahel pulled off from the Asian Cup Winners'
Cup. The number of initial entries was also down on previous
years.
</P>
<P>
Al Nasr's withdrawal should see Al Zawra secure a spot in the
second round.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Likely to Award African Country 2010 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The pressure from Africa to
force FIFA to award a country on the continent the right to host
the World Cup has yielded results.
</P>
<P>
The Star newspaper on Thursday quoted reliable FIFA sources as
saying that the world soccer governing body would announce shortly
that an African country, possibly South Africa, would host the
2010 soccer World Cup.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would get the nod on condition it withdrew the
arbitration case against the decision by FIFA to allow Germany to
host the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Sources within FIFA said on Wednesday that the world soccer
governing body intended to announce the host of the 2010 World Cup
tournament at the FIFA congress to avoid the legal threat posed by
South Africa, which is unhappy with the vote that gave Germany the
right to host the 2006 tournament.
</P>
<P>
FIFA has already set a precedent, by announcing the hosts of
the 1970 and 1974 World Cup tournaments at the same time that
England was awarded the 1966 tournament. The 1970 tournament was
given to Mexico, with Germany being granted the 1974 event, and
insiders believe that the possibility exists that South Africa
could be awarded the 2010 World Cup in the same way.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is so convinced about the validity and strength of
its case that it is not even considering withdrawing or backing
down.
</P>
<P>
The Star and 30 independent newspapers have sent hundreds of
thousands of signatures, gathered in a petition campaign, to force
FIFA to grant the next World Cup to Africa.

<HEADLINE> Motor Vehicles Run on Cheaper, Cleaner Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Technicians at Jianming Energy Equipment Factory in Jinhua
developed a technology to use the lighter hydrocarbons as auto
fuel, and a filling station has been put into operation in the
city.
</P>
<P>
They claim that the technology is a first in China.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese cities have used liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and
compressed natural gas (CNG) to replace gasoline and diesel oil to
reduce auto exhaust pollution. But Jinhua's technicians said
lighter hydrocarbons produce almost no pollutants and are more
economical, because as a fuel they are much easier to transport,
store and fill. A car averagely consumes about 40 liters of
gasoline to run 400 km, but it only needs 34 liters of lighter
hydrocarbons to cover the same distance.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a standard LPG or CNG filling station costs
about two million yuan (240,000 U.S. dollars), but it only takes
about 200,000 yuan (24,000 U.S. dollars) to refit a gas station to
handle lighter hydrocarbons, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The Jinhua technicians have got two patents for their
technology. The Zhejiang provincial government plans to promote
its use throughout the province this year.

<HEADLINE> China Pushes Forward Merger, Bankruptcy Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China is pushing forward the
reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by allowing more loss-
incurring firms to get annexed or go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Economic and Trade Commission, China has
announced 1,093 merger or bankruptcy projects so far this year,
and related departments are drafting plans for more in the latter
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
China began to carry out the merger and bankruptcy policy in
1996, mainly in coal, nonferrous metal, sugar, textile, iron and
steel, and defense industries, in a bid to streamline and
restructure SOEs.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 6,400 large and medium-sized SOEs were
merged or downsized during 1996 to 1998, and 1,843 enterprises
went bankrupt or closed in 1999, writing off non-performing loans
of 29.1 billion yuan, according to the commission.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Seven Chinese cities, namely
Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Shenyang, Nanjing, Hefei, Xining and
Changsha, reported slight air pollution today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King to Visit Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
will soon visit Iran at the invitation of Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami for the first time since he acceded to the throne
in February 1999, Jordanian officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's invitation was contained in a message delivered to the
king Wednesday night by Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Sayyed
Mohammad Sadr, who is visiting the kingdom as a special envoy of
the Iranian president.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Khatami expressed Iran's appreciations for
Jordan's stand on Islamic issues, mainly on the holy city of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Khatami commended the monarch's efforts to safeguard the
interests of the Islamic nations and his support for the rights of
the Palestinians, particularly the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Currently Khatami is the chairman of the Organization of Islamic
Conference which groups 54 Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of King Abdullah's visit to Iran will be
bilateral ties between Jordan and Iran, and the fate of Jerusalem
among other issues standing in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East war, and later annexed it and claimed the city as its "eternal
and indivisible" capital.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Sixty-one Israeli legislators approved the bill in a
preliminary reading Wednesday to dissolve the 15th Knesset
(Parliament) and hold early elections. The result was a bleak
finale for the coalition as the Knesset concluded its spring
session Wednesday night and adjourned for a three-month recess.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said later that despite the vote, he
will make an effort to establish a new coalition during the
recess. "I don't see the Knesset dissolving itself and going to
elections," he said. "The dust will settle in the coming weeks."
</P>
<P>
However, the major opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon
declared that his faction will not "be resting or going on vacation
during the recess." Over a year ago, Sharon said, "We were hit hard
during the elections, but today we have the momentum for replacing
the government."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy submitted his resignation
-a terse, single-sentence, handwritten note - to Prime Minister
Ehud Barak Wednesday, thereby making good on the ultimatum he
presented to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Levy said last week that if Barak did not make a "sincere" and "
earnest" effort to form a national unity government by Wednesday,
he would quit. Later Wednesday, Levy and his brother Maxim Levy
supported the Likud's early election bills.
</P>
<P>
Levy had been discontent for some time over being virtually
excluded from the negotiating process with the Palestinians, and
more recently over the positions taken by the Israeli delegation at
the Camp David peace summit.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Leaving behind his domestic political problems for a few
hours, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will fly to Alexandria,
Egypt, Thursday for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
According to Barak's office, the talks will deal with the results
and ramifications of last month's Camp David peace summit.
</P>
<P>
Barak's visit comes a day after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
met with Mubarak in Alexandria. Arafat has just finished a tour of
Arab states to drum up support for his positions on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near East
Affairs Edward Walker, a former ambassador to Egypt and Israel, is
on a 15-day tour of 14 Arab countries, trying to convince them to
make Arafat more compromising.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- In his first full day on the job Wednesday, Israeli President
Moshe Katsav received a request from Sephardi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak
Kadourie to issue a pardon to former Shas leader Aryeh Deri, who is
due to go behind the bars this month.
</P>
<P>
Katsav, who attended morning prayers at Kadourie's synagogue in
Jerusalem's Bukharan Quarter, responded it is too early to
speculate on the issue of pardons, and he will eventually examine
the Deri case and other pardon requests.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Prime Minister Ehud Barak's handling of the peace
process, Katsav said, "Barak has in front of him the most
monumental decisions in the history of this state since Ben-Gurion
declared the state." He pledged to keep his promise not to make
political statements.

MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Share prices in the Philippine

issues were at bargains' levels.
</P>
<P>
They added the statement from the U.S. Federal Reserve
indicating an unlikely hike in U.S. interest rates in the near

<HEADLINE> Verdict on Anwar's Sodomy Trial Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 (Xinhua) - The decision on the sodomy
trial of Malaysia's former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
which has been fixed for Friday has been postponed, Bernama news
agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One of Anwar's lawyers, Sankaran Nair said he was informed of
the postponement through a facsimile message from High Court
Deputy Registrar Rozilah Salleh Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision has been postponed because the "judgment is not
ready," according to Rozilah.
</P>
<P>
Anwar and his adopted brother Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja
are separately charged with sodomizing Anwar's former family
driver Azizan Abu Bakar.
</P>
<P>
Sukma, 39, a businessman, also faces another charge of abetting
Anwar, 52, to sodomize the 39-year old Azizan.
</P>
<P>
High Court Judge Arifin Jaka made the announcement on July 18
that the court will give the verdict of the case on August 4.

<HEADLINE> Australian Opposition promises Abandon Support for NMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Opposition
promised to abandon the support for the United States missile
defense shield.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party approved Thursday an amendment to its platform
which commits it to abandoning support for the plan in government,
the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
"In government, Labor will review any Australian involvement in
the National Missile Defense plan through the Pine Gap early
warning satellite relay station or other arrangements," the
platform reads.
</P>
<P>
"Our judgment is that Australia should not support or be
involved in NMD research, development or trials," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party opposes the plan on the grounds that it could
reignite the nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier by The Age daily that the Pine Gap
early warning satellite relay station has already extended last
year and started cooperation with the United States in NMD trials.
The government has not yet announced it's support officially and
clearly.
</P>
<P>
Pine Gap located at the center of the continent and was
initially a U.S.-Australia joint electronic spy station.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Meet Budget Deficit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Budget and Management
Secretary Benjamin Diokno assured the public Thursday that the
government will be able to meet its budget deficit target of 62.5
billion pesos (1.56 billion U.S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Diokno's pronouncement came about after the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed doubts that the government would
not meet the said target which was made a condition in releasing
the more than 300-million-U.S.-dollar standby facility loan the
IMF committed to the Philippines this year.
</P>
<P>
Diokno said that the deficit target pre-conditioned by the IMF
could be met considering that the government's 30 percent stake in
the Philippine National Bank amounting to about 6.5 billion (162.5
million dollars) was already disposed.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the government is also perceived to generate more
revenues from the sale of its stakes in the Manila Electric
Company before the end of the year, Diokno said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Another thing that would help plug up the deficit is the
delivery of the more than 300 million dollars worth of proceeds
from the flotation of the government's Samurai bonds to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The IMF was worried after the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)
failed to meet its target collection goal in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
But Diokno said that the BIR has committed to collect more in
order to fill up the revenue shortfalls until the end of the year
through its implementation of action plans necessary to collect
more taxes as expected.
</P>
<P>
Diokno also clarified that the revival of the 10,000 para-
military forces in Mindanao, which will cost the government some 4
billion pesos (100 million dollars), will not have an impact on
the deficit as this would be taken from the president's social
funds.

<HEADLINE> California Faces Power Blackout Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A lingering heat wave
throughout the U.S. West drove demand for electricity in
California to near-record levels Wednesday and brought the state
close to a full-scale power emergency.
</P>
<P>
Demand for electricity rose to record levels, according to the
California Independent System Operator, which directs electricity
to 75 percent of the state's power grid. California's power grid
strained under the demand of air conditioners Wednesday, leaving
little electricity to spare in the region.
</P>
<P>
"You have a demand in California and the entire West is
outstripping the supply," said Patrick Dorinson, an ISO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A power emergency was declared for the next day, triggering
prearranged voluntary cutbacks by large customers, a step taken to
avoid rolling blackouts.
</P>
<P>
The mercury climbed to the upper 90s Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees
Celsius) and over 100 (37.8 degrees Celsius) in many parts of the
state, and the heat was compounded by moist air from the Pacific
that made some areas feel like the tropics.
</P>
<P>
California's 1,100 power plants now generate about 54,000
megawatts a day. The state also imports about 25 percent of its
annual energy needs from the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest,
said Claudia Chandler, spokeswoman for the California Electricity
Commission. But the state still faces a shortage.
</P>
<P>
"We all face a heat wave that extends from Washington to Texas
and there's not as much electricity available from neighboring
states to serve California's power needs," Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
But power producers in surrounding states were reportedly on
standby, ready to help California if a more serious stage-three
emergency is called and the state has to undergo a rolling series
of blackouts.
</P>
<P>
The California Electricity Commission is also looking at ways
to increase conservation. It urges people to reduce power
consumption by closing drapes or blinds to keep out sunlight,
cooking and doing laundry during off-peak hours and using fans
instead of air conditioners and refraining from opening
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
The state hasn't built new power plants in about 20 years and
has an average of about 485,000 new residents each of the last
five years. Four plants are under construction and nine others are
planned. The first new plant won't begin operating until next year.
</P>
<P>
Gov. Gray Davis Wednesday ordered state agencies to speed up
the approval of the desperately needed new power plants.
</P>
<P>
But some experts said that intense heat occurs typically about
15 days a year and building power plants just for those occasions
might be a very expensive approach.

The parliament was summoned by President Chandrika Kumaratunga
for an emergency session for the government to unveil the new
constitution that seeks to end the 17-year separatist civil war by
devolving more powers to the minority Tamils. Traffic was tightly

suburban Colombo, while army commandos and police armed with
automatic weapons guarded the area, witnesses said. (S.Lanka-

<HEADLINE> Thailand Opens Olympiad-Bidding Website </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 3 (Xinhua) -- As part of the bidding campaign
for hosting the 2008 Olympic Games, Thailand launches a website
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As the website ceremoniously opened at the bid office situated
on the seventh floor of the World Trade Center, officials said it
will be one of many projects to outline Bangkok's advantageous
position to stage the Olympiad.
</P>
<P>
"It is an other strong step to present Bangkok's facilities and
what it will offer the world, if selected to be the host, " said
Nipat Thonlek, one of the officials who handles the website
program.
</P>
<P>
With the first phase of the Olympic bid contest fast
approaching, and the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
executives busy studying the efficiency of each of the 10 cities
qualifying to host Games of the Olympiad in 2008, Bangkok, one of
the contenders to stage the quadrennial celebration, is preparing
to show the world the assets it possesses.
</P>
<P>
Nipat also said some bidders have tried to take advantage of
the fact that Bangkok has been modest and hasn't publicized the
many resources it possesses, plus the experience it has, having
staged four Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"A few weeks ago, we saw the results of a poll on the internet,
conducted in another bid city and Bangkok enjoyed the honor of
being given top preference to stage the Games. " he said.
</P>
<P>
Thai IOC member Nat Intrapana, Thai Olympic Committee officials
and Miss Thailand who acts as the Information Ambassador for
Bangkok's bid campaign, attended today's ceremony.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A local bank and three hospitals
in Shanghai have started a medical credit program to help needy
patients with eye diseases.
</P>
<P>
A 29-month-old girl has become the city's first beneficiary
from the new scheme.
</P>
<P>
The girl, Tan Jiaxin, has congenital heart disease and suffers
from muscle paralysis, which affects her sight.
</P>
<P>
Tan's parents are short of money after they spent 40,000 yuan (
about 4,800 U.S. dollars) on her medical treatment. Last week,
they applied a loan from Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Lujiazui
Branch for their daughter.
</P>
<P>
Doctors then performed an operation on Tan and she is soon to
be discharged from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tan is China's first patient to receive medical credit.
</P>
<P>
From now on, patients who go to three hospitals in Shanghai can
get medical loans from the bank.
</P>
<P>
The three are the Xinhua Hospital affiliated with the Shanghai
No.2 Medical Sciences University, Oriental Hospital, and Shanghai
No.7 People's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Shen Xiaoming, head of the Xinhua Hospital, said that the loans
will help a number of elderly people who are in financial
difficulties to have their cataracts removed.

NANJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Recent surveys show that

worsening, due to a delayed pollution control work.
</P>
<P>
Of the 777 major polluting enterprises in the Lake Taihu
Valleys, 541 have not yet met the country's pollutant discharging
standards, accoding to the surveys.
</P>
<P>
This year, the lake water's content of phosphorus and nitrogen
grows by 62 percent and 24 percent, respectively, compared to the
1999 level.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has planned to build 82 sewage disposal plants with a

<HEADLINE> Four Britons Sentenced in Cyprus for Possession of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Four British tourists have been
handed stiff prison sentences in Cyprus for possession of ecstasy
tablets, local newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In sentencing the Britons Wednesday for two separate cases,
Nicos Santis, district court judge of Famagusta town, southeast of
the island, made extensive reference to the need to protect Cypriot
society from the scourge of drugs.
</P>
<P>
The holidaymakers, identified as John Paddington, 32, Craig
Dykes ,28, and Kevin O'brien, 32, were arrested in Ayia Napa,
southeastern coastal town, in early May.
</P>
<P>
Paddington was handed an 18-month jail term for possession of 99
ecstasy tablets. Dykes was given a 14-month sentence for the same
offence.
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, who had also pleaded guilty of intent to supply
ecstasy, was sentenced for two-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
The fourth British, 28-year-old David Fisher, had pleaded guilty
to possession of 10 tablets of ecstasy. He had been arrested in
mid-July after drug squad officers stopped and searched him as he
drove a hired moped through Ayia Napa. He told police he had bought
the tablets in the resort the day before, for 10 Cyprus pounds (16
U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Santis sentenced Fisher to a year in prison for possession of
the 10 ecstasy tablets.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Supreme Court recently recommended tougher sentences
for drug offences, Santis said, noting the maximum jail sentence
his court could impose was five years.
</P>
<P>
Ayia Napa has recently become a Mecca for young British
holidaymakers attracted by the resorts booming club scene.
</P>
<P>
Drug-related arrests at the resort have increased remarkably in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Supreme Court Orders Referendum for New Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Supreme Court on
Thursday ordered the government to hold a national referendum for
the new draft constitution which was presented to the parliament
with the aim of politically ending the long-running ethnic civil
war.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruling was read out by Parliament Speaker K.B.
Ratnayake at an emergency session of the parliament when the
government presented its long-cherished draft constitution which
was first unveiled five years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling said that the parliament must approve the
draft by a two-thirds majority before the national referendum.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the government of ruling People's Alliance
will find it in an uphill battle to gather 150 votes out of the
225-seat parliament amid escalating opposition. Nine political
parties and nongovernmental groups petitioned the Supreme Court
Wednesday to stop the draft bill going ahead.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition United National Party (UNP), which holds
the balance of power to make or break reforms, has decided not to
support the reforms, claiming that the government had not given
sufficient time for the influential Buddhist clergy and the people
to study the provisions of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a UNP member of Parliament burned in public one
copy of the draft constitution distributed to him. Some other UNP
members of Parliament tore up and crumpled the copies before
throwing away.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary officials said the draft constitution would be
taken up for debate on August 7 and 8 and put to vote on August 9.

<HEADLINE> Fruitful Control of Desertification in Anhui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 3 (Xinhua) --- East China's Anhui Province has
effectively turned more than 100,000 ha. of arid and desertified
land into vegetated areas in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
As a result, greenery has so far covered 32.4 percent of local
arid and desertified land, whose grain yield has grown by 10 to 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
The province has some 700,000 ha. of arid and desertified land,
mostly in northern Anhui. Of them, 130,000 ha. are desertified
land, which pose a big threat to local ecological environment and
hamper local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Dangshan County, which suffers from serious drifting sand in
the province, has done a good work in controlling shifting sand,
growing trees and grass, and developing agricultural production in
desertified areas in the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
So, forested areas in the county have risen from the past 10
percent to the current more than 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local people in the county also make great profits from growing
fruit trees on 50,000 ha. of former arid land, with annual output
reaching 700 million kg.
</P>
<P>
Dangshan has now become one of China's top 100 fruit-growing
counties.

BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua)-- Fearsome cancers and leukemia
stopped their gnawing bites on people's lives. Ordinary people on
the earth are enjoying their interstellar travels aboard man-made
flying objects.
</P>
<P>
These are not random talks at Arabian nights but some of the
forecasts of China's 60 academicians from the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering on the scientific
and technological developments in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Titled " Academicians' Forecasts on the 21st Century", the book
has just come off the press, today's Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Forty years ago, twenty-five renowned scientists depicted their
dreams about the future in a popular science book " Scientists'
Remarks On the 21st Century", talking about then nonsense-like
mobile phones, visual telephones and computer networks.
</P>
<P>
As most dreams in the first book have come true, academicians
now cudgel their brain to boldly predict the fortune of science
and technology which will bring to the people.
</P>
<P>
The newly published book totaling more than 333,000 Chinese
characters is the fruit of the sixty top scientists' two-year
effort.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Presents Draft Constitution Amid Tight Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government on
Thursday presented a draft constitution to the parliament where
hundreds of heavily armed soldiers and police were deployed.
</P>
<P>
The parliament was summoned by President Chandrika Kumaratunga
for an emergency session for the government to unveil the new
constitution that seeks to end the 17-year separatist civil war by
devolving more powers to the minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
Traffic was tightly restricted on the main roads to the
parliament at Kotte in eastern suburban Colombo, while army
commandos and police armed with automatic weapons guarded the area,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
They said President Kumaratunga cannot make her voice heard in
a speech to present the draft constitution as opposition United
National Party (UNP) members of Parliament shouted and made lots
of noises.
</P>
<P>
The UNP, which holds the balance of power to make or break
reforms, has decided not to support the reforms, claiming that the
government had not given sufficient time for the Buddhist clergy
and the people to study the provisions of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Officials sources said the parliament will begin to debate the
draft from August 8 and put it to vote on August 14.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes moderates among the Tamils will support
the move, which could eventually sideline the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam rebels who have rejected the draft and demanded a
separate state for Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.

<P>
The fertility rate for women aged 30-34 years is now 118 births
per 1,000, according to a Thursday's press release of Statistics
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
This is a significant departure from the early 1970s when early
childbearing was the norm and women aged 20-24 years supported the
highest fertility rate. The fertility rate for the 30-34 year olds
at that time was only one-half of that for those aged 25-29 years.
</P>
<P>
The average age of New Zealand women giving birth is now 29.3
years, compared with 27.9 years in 1992 and 25.5 years in the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Live births registered in the year from July 1999 to June 2000
totaled 58,033, 4 percent fewer than the peak of 60,427 recorded
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Annual birth rates for the current year suggest that New
Zealand women average 2.05 births per woman. This is the highest
level for the last six years, but still marginally below the level
of 2.10 births per woman required for the population to replace
itself,without migration.
</P>
<P>
Deaths registered in the year from July 1999 to June 2000
totaled 27,725, up 1.9 percent on the figure for the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt to Crack Down Software Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai Commerce Ministry's
Department of Intellectual Property will start from next week to
inspect more than 14,000 firms in order to crack down software
piracy, according to a government report issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These firms have failed to return the department's
questionnaires on software use, which were issued to 15,0000 local
and foreign business in April, asking for information about the
software they use, it said.
</P>
<P>
Only about 700 firms, or less than 5 percent gave their replies.
</P>
<P>
The companies will be informed of the inspections ahead of time,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, it also noted that the inspection is a visit, not a
raid. "Businessmen and office workers are not criminals," said
Weerawit Weeraworawit, deputy director-general of the department.
</P>
<P>
Software piracy has damaged the country's economy. In 1998 such
violations have cost the Thai economy 1.9 billion baht (47.5
million U.S. dollars ).
</P>
<P>
Officials have estimated that currently in this country, 81
percent of all software in use is pirated, a slight reduction from
last year.

<HEADLINE> Poland's Grain Output to Drop Markedly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Poland's grain output this year is
expected to drop by 14-18 percent due to unseasonable weather and
the country may have to import four million tons to make up for
the shortfall, the Polish Republic newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 25.1 million tons last year, this year's grain
output is expected to fall to 20.5 million to 21.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The drop in this year's grain production has been caused by a
late-spring cold wave, a drought, and a spell of incessant rains.
</P>
<P>
Other crops have also been affected. The output of fruits is
expected to drop to 1.5 million tons this year, down 21.9 percent,
vegetables to 4.9 million tons, a fall of 6.3 percent, and
rapeseed production, down 25-33.7 percent, the newspaper cited
Polish Statistical Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the country may need to import as much as four
million tons of grain this year to stabilize the market. Early
this week, the government announced its decision to import another
200,000 tons of grain in addition to the same amount of import in
June.
</P>
<P>
The price of wheat looks certain to go up again this year after
a 40 percent hike last year, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins U.S. Republican Presidential Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W.
Bush won presidential nomination for the 2000 U.S. election here
Wednesday evening as the Republican National Convention entered
its third day.
</P>
<P>
Bush has received 1,042 votes in the roll call, which is more
than enough to win the nomination since only a simple majority of
the total 2,066 delegates is required.
</P>
<P>
Bush arrived in Philadelphia Wednesday morning to accept his
nomination after finishing a campaign swing in six states captured
by the Democrats in the last election, including Arkansas,
Missouri and Ohio. Bush, who watched the nomination procedure on
TV at a local hotel, is scheduled to deliver an acceptance speech
on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Bush, the eldest son of former President George Bush, embarked
on his first Republican campaign trip to Iowa in June 1999 when he
declared that "I'm running for President... and there is no
turning back."
</P>
<P>
He had built the most formidable fund-raising machine in U.S.
political history, which helped him steamroller his way to the
Republican Party presidential nomination early in 2000.
</P>
<P>
He defeated Arizona Senator John McCain and other challengers
in the primary presidential race earlier this year around the
country.
</P>
<P>
If he wins the November 7 election, Bush would be the second
president who is also a presidential son, long after John Quincy
Adams followed his father, John Adams, into the White House in
1825.
</P>
<P>
Born on July 6, 1946, Bush grew up in Midland and Houston,
Texas. He received a bachelor's degree from Yale University and
then an MBA from Harvard Business School. He was elected Texas
Governor in 1994 and re-elected to the post in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was nominated
by acclamation on Wednesday night at the Convention to run for
vice president on the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
In a speech prepared for his acceptance as Bush's running mate,
Cheney promised "big changes" if they are elected.
</P>
<P>
"What are we to make of the past eight years? I look at them
and see opportunities squandered," Cheney said, lashing out at the
Clinton administration. "The wheel has turned and it is time. It
is time for them to go."
</P>
<P>
Cheney, 59, was born in Nebraska and grew up in Wyoming. He
became assistant to the president and White House chief of staff
in 1975 and served as congressman for 10 years from 1979 to 1989.
As the secretary of defense from 1989 to 1993, Cheney masterminded
the Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War.

according to Indonesian Amateur Athletics Association (PASI)
secretary-general Tigor Tanjung.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian young women's tennis
player Wynne Prakusya managed to reach her goal of competing at
the Olympic Games in Sydney after the International Olympics
Committee (IOC) awarded her a wild card earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to National Sports Council Chairman Wismoyo
Arismunandar dated July 31, the IOC said the invitational position
was allocated to Wynne after careful consideration involving the
Asian National Olympic Committee and the International Tennis
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Indonesian Tennis Association Benny Mailili
said that Wynne had just improved her world ranking to the 120s
after winning the Challenger tournament in Salt Lake City, Utah,
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I think the IOC made its decision after Wynne won the
tournament," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
A wild card is granted to any player who is in the world top
120 before August.
</P>
<P>
Benny also said that the IOC had set its eyes on Wynne as she
had received an Olympic Solidarity scholarship.
</P>
<P>
"She received the scholarship, so IOC must have observed her
performances," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many of Wynne's seniors have made their way to the event over
the years, although none have yielded any medals.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka's Main Opposition Refuses to Support Constitutional Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
United National Party (UNP) has announced that it will not support
the constitutional reforms due to be presented in the parliament
on Thursday by the government of ruling People's Alliance (PA).
</P>
<P>
"The UNP has decided not to vote for the constitutional reforms
and oppose it as it is being presented in Parliament without
subjecting it to a proper public debate," said UNP Chairman Karu
Jayasuriya in a statement issued Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The government is due to present its Constitutional Amendment
Bill on Thursday to the special sessions of the parliament called
by President Chandrika Kumaratunga. Parliamentary sources said the
special sessions have been called exclusively for the presentation
of the Constitution Bill.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday morning the scheduled meeting for
discussions between the PA government and the UNP on the reforms
lasted only 15 minutes. Both President Kumaratunga and UNP Leader
Ranil Wickremesinghe did not attend.
</P>
<P>
The UNP delegation which was headed by Jayasuriya registered
their opposition to the continuation of the Executive Presidency
which President Kumaratunga pledged to abolish as far back as 1995.
</P>
<P>
They also told the government delegation that they cannot
support the reforms, as government had not given sufficient time
for the Buddhist clergy and the people to study the provisions of
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the UNP reiterated its strongest and
unreserved commitment to bring lasting peace to the country and it
was with this objective that it attended all sessions of
discussions with the government and submitted important proposals.
</P>
<P>
The stand taken by the UNP was that the reforms should be
presented to the Buddhist clergy and other religious leaders, all
political parties and the Tamil Tiger rebels to enable them to
democratically express their views on the reforms before it was
presented in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNP cannot sanction or approve an attempt by the
government to pass through the parliament a piece of legislation,
which is crucial to the national interest, in an unusual and
hurried manner.
</P>
<P>
Jayasuriya added that there were certain provisions included in
the draft, to which the UNP cannot agree such as an increase in
the number of members in the present parliament or to extend the
period of office of the Executive Presidency.

SHANGHAI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial and
commercial city of Shanghai is expecting another period of high
growth in the years to come.

All other major economic indicators in the city also show
favorable signs of a high growth, analysts said.

dollars) in industrial output value during the January-June period,
an increase of 12 percent. And total profits from the industrial
sector jumped 38 percent to reach 14.8 billion yuan (about 1.78
billion U.S. dollars).

Exports of the city surged a record 40 percent to top 11.7
billion U.S. dollars from January to June, while fixed assets
investment stopped declining, with the volume standing at 60.3

<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Deteriorating water pollution in
China will do great harm to people's health and life quality,
according to some members of the China People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Since some areas and rivers around Chinese cities are being
polluted, ground water could become toxic and unsuitable for human
consumption, the Subcommittee of Human Resources and Environment
of CPPCC warned at a recent symposium on "drinking water and
health" in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China's major water systems, the Liaohe River in the northeast
and the Haihe River in the north are seriously polluted, and the
Huaihe River in the east is also in poor condition, according to
today's Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
And the water quality of the Yellow River, the country's second
longest, is also declining, while lakes and underground water
across the country are being polluted every year.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the committee said that large amounts of
industrial polluted water and urban waste water is the major cause
leading to the serious damage of China's water systems, and the
pollution of drinking water has increased the incidence of some
major human diseases.
</P>
<P>
The committee suggested an integrated harnessing system be
built to control the pollution and provide better-quality drinking
water for all the country's residents.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls signed free
agent guard Ron Mercer on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Financial terms were not disclosed, but the deal is worth $27
million over four years, according to reports by the Chicago Sun
Times.
</P>
<P>
Chicago landed Mercer, who finished last season with the
Orlando Magic, after apparently failing to sign any of the top
free agents available -- Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady, Tim Duncan and
Tim Thomas.
</P>
<P>
Mercer, who was drafted in 1997 by the Boston Celtics, will be
joining his fourth team. He was acquired by Denver in August 1999
before the Nuggets sold the impending free agent to the Magic
before the trade deadline last season.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Mercer will immediately join in a starting spot
for the Bulls, which have gone a woeful 30-102 over the last two
seasons. Chicago was just 17-65 in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
In 68 games last season with Denver and Orlando, Mercer
averaged 16.9 points. The 6-foot-7 (2.01 meters) player has a
career average of 16.2 points in 189 games.

<HEADLINE> Tibet to Build Highway Leading to Namco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Planning
Commission and the National Tourism Administration recently
allocated 20 million yuan (2.4 million US dollars) for the
construction of a highway in Damxung County, 160 km north of Lhasa,
capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The highway leading to Lake Namco in western Damxung is
expected to play an important role in developing ecotourism in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has already worked out an overall
development program aimed at protecting wild animals, natural
resources and natural beauty around the lake, China's second
largest saltwater lake.
</P>
<P>
With an elevation of 4,700 meters, the lake, covering an area
of 1,920 sq km, has become a natural habitat for rare water birds
like swans, egrets and sand birds. It attracted about 100,000
domestic and overseas tourists last year.
</P>
<P>
July and August are the best season to travel to Namco.
Visitors can enjoy the sight of vast grassland, cattle and sheep,
blue sky, white clouds, as well as a stone forest on the Island of
Zhaxi.
</P>
<P>
However, the area's poor transportation and accomodations
facilities have hindered the development of the local tourism
industry.

<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China's pharmaceutical industry
is opening wider to overseas investors in an effort to better
compete with the rest of the world when China enters the WTO,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
At least five Chinese medicine companies have signed contracts
or "letter of intent" to set up Sino-overseas joint pharmaceutical
retail chains, said Yu Mingde, director of the pharmaceutical
department under the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
China has wooed more investment in new technology, equipment
and medicines including new anti-cancer medicine and medicine for
the brain, he added.
</P>
<P>
The country also welcomes new technologies and investment in
modernizing traditional Chinese medicine, so that it can reach out
further into the European and American markets, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 6,000 medicine producers, 1,000 of which
are losing money, and more than 16,000 are medicine wholesale
firms.
</P>
<P>
The number will be cut over the next five years when China has
45 to 50 large-scale medicine distribution groups or companies
whose combined sales will account for 70 percent of the total
sector, he added.

<HEADLINE> China to Plant More Trees in Rainy Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China plans to plant 5.4 million
hectares of trees this year, with 77 percent to be planted by hand
and the rest by aero-sowing.
</P>
<P>
The State Forestry Administration is urging local authorities
to make full use of the current rainy seasons and plant more trees,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Due to the serious long-standing drought this spring, a record
300 million yuan (36.1 million U.S. dollars) of damage has been
reported during the planting.
</P>
<P>
The drought has affected more than 1.5 million hectares of
woodland or 56 percent of the total wooded area, including 300,000
hectares of trees and grass newly grown on mountain slopes.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the survival rate of afforestation was as low as
30 percent in some regions, and the maximum was less than 70
percent," an official with the administration said.
</P>
<P>
The administration is calling on related departments to make
the best of the three-month rainy season starting July to make up
for the loss of trees caused by the drought.
</P>
<P>
Techniques like advanced method to cultivating seeds and
growing young trees are encouraged, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The administration has mapped out a program employing 187
technological methods that will receive financial support from the
central government.
</P>
<P>
These methods are expected to raise the survival rate to more
than 80 percent, the official added.

<HEADLINE> China Stepping Up Treatment of Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China is taking positive measures
to fight against water pollution.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) plans
to strengthen the control on enterprises that discharge pollutants
and accelerate the construction of sewage-treating plants.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources vows to reinforce the
supervision on water quality and make drinking water reach state
standards.
</P>
<P>
Some 131 waste water disposal factories are still needed in the
rivers of Huaihe, Haihe and Liaohe and the lakes of Taihu, Dianchi
and Chaohu. At present there are already 28 such factories in
operation while 125 are under construction.
</P>
<P>
Some local governments are also making efforts to avoid further
water pollution. Central China's Hubei Province is now
implementing a huge project to clean polluted water.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing in southwest China will invest three billion yuan in
the coming four years to treat its contaminated water. The
spending is more than the total amount spent on cleaning its
rivers and lakes in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Water pollution caused 144 billion yuan of economic losses in
China annually in the late 1990s, according to a survey conducted
by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Water pollution exists throughout China and is especially
serious in the country's rivers and lakes. In 1993, the volume of
polluted water into the Yellow River reached 750 million cubic
meters while in 1998, the number soared to 930 million cubic
meters, up 22 percent in five years.

BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Readers in Shanghai now have many
opportunities to choose books for their recreation, the Shanghai-
based Wenhui Daily has reported.
</P>
<P>
More and more readers prefer special bookstores, according to

newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
However, a great proportion of readers favor books on computer
science, art, college entrance examinations, laws and others.
</P>
<P>
Youngsters always go to Jifeng Bookstore, in downtown Shanghai,
to buy cartoons and teaching materials on Harvard MBA courses,
while researchers go to Luming Bookstore, near Fudan University,
to get academic books, the newspaper says.

<HEADLINE> Obesity Sickening China's Young Hearts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua)-- An increasing number of young and
middle-aged Chinese are suffering from heart diseases because of
obesity.
</P>
<P>
Medical research suggests that it is urgent to take effective
measures to prevent it within the first few years of a child's
life, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Kong Lingzhi, division chief in charge of chronic
disease control with the Ministry of Health, recent lifestyle
changes have caused serious health problems and obesity is to
blame for the increase in heart diseases.
</P>
<P>
As young to middle-aged people are shouldering the heaviest
burden from work and daily chores, they seldom spare time for
medical check-ups or physical exercises.
</P>
<P>
In addition, this age group was born around 1960 when China was
undergoing a difficult time. Inadequate nutrition from birth could
cause chronic diseases later on in life, experts said.
</P>
<P>
To fight against the possibility of contracting chronic
diseases, experts called for a healthier lifestyle by eating less
and doing more exercises, and an increasing health consciousness
among young and middle-aged Chinese.

<P>
ABU DHABI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Tiger Woods, the world's No. 1
golfer, has confirmed that he will play the 2001 Dubai Desert
Classic, from March 1 to 4, 2001, organizer and promoter Dubai
World Trade Center (DWTC) announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About coming to Dubai, Woods said, "I am very much looking
forward to coming to Dubai. I've never competed in a professional
tournament there, but I've heard great things about the event. I
always look forward to playing in new places," reported local
media on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The participation of Tiger Woods in next year's Dubai Desert
Classic will further enhance the profile of the tournament on the
world's sporting stage," said Mohammed Ali Alabbar, vice chairman
of the DWTC.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Desert Classic has turned professional since
1996 with 26 tournament winners, 20 of them on the PGA Tour,
including this year's U.S. Open Championship, the 1999 PGA
Championship and the 1997 Masters Tournament, when he became the
youngest Masters Champion ever.
</P>
<P>
Woods turned professional in the same year 1996, when the total
purses awarded on the PGA Tour then equaled about 69 million U.S.
dollars. This has doubled now and Tiger is the main reason.
</P>
<P>
After running away with the 2000 Open Championship at St.
Andrews, Scotland, last week by 8 strokes, Tiger became the
youngest player to win a career Grand Slam, beating golf legend
Jack Nicklaus by two years. He is currently preparing to defend

TIANJIN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A group of ancient wells and
Taoist wooden tablets recording Taoist alchemists' skills have
been unearthed in Jixian County in this port city of north China.
</P>

It is the first time in China to excavate such kind of wooden
tablets, which are valuable in academic research although their
age has not be disclosed, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
All the wells are located in a 10,000-square-meter depression
in Da'anzhai Village in Jixian. They were discovered by villagers
while digging soil for housing construction on June 2.

State Council released a 5,000-character article today detailing
the education, use and development of the language since the
peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951.
</P>
<P>
Under the old system of feudal serfdom, the article notes, 95
percent of Tibetan people were illiterate and only a small portion
of the Tibetan population, mostly monks, serf owners and their
children, could have the opportunity to learn and use Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
In New China, Tibetan people's native language has been
effectively protected by the Central People's Government and the
People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region, since the
Peaceful Liberation of Tibet in 1951, and, in particular, since
the Democratic Reform was launched in 1959, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
China's Constitution and the Law on Ethnic Regional Autonomy
stipulate that ethnic minority people have the freedom to use and
develop their own spoken and written language, it says.
</P>
<P>
While Tibet adopts a dual-language teaching system using both
Chinese and Tibetan languages, Tibetan has always been one of the
main subjects in Tibetan schools of all kinds and all levels.
</P>
<P>
Except a few urban schools which are mainly open for Chinese
students of Han nationality, most local primary schools use
Tibetan language as their teaching language.
</P>
<P>
Currently, local junior middle schools are gradually turning to
teaching subjects on natural sciences with Tibetan language.
Tibetan language is also being used in Tibetan middle schools in
inland areas, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Both Tibetan and Chinese are used by all local government units
for official documents and materials as well as official seals,
certificates, forms, envelopes, papers, signs and signatures.
</P>
<P>
Higher People's Court and Higher People's Procuratorate of
Tibet are using both Tibetan and Chinese to handle legal documents.
In recent years, the higher people's court and the higher people's
procuratorate have published a series of books on laws and legal
terminology in Tibetan language.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTE CARLO, Monaco, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Banned Cuban high
jumper Sotomayor is eligible for the Sydney Olympic Games as the
three year suspension on the world record holder has been shorten
from two years to one on Wednesday by the international Amateur
Athletic Federation, the world governing body of athletics.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF, holding an extraordinary meeting Wednesday to handle
pending drug cases, also opened the door for former Olympic 5,000-
meter champion Dieter Baumann to compete in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
A two-time world champion and the '92 Olympic gold medalist,
the 32-year-old Sotomayor was stripped of his title in the high
jump at last year's Pan American Games after testing positive for
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Five weeks ago, a three-person IAAF arbitration panel
overturned a ruling by the Cuban Athletics Federation that allowed
him to continue competing domestically and in other non-sanctioned
meets.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF had suspended him from all competition until July 31,
2001, but cited "exceptional circumstances" on Wednesday in
cutting the ban in half.
</P>
<P>
Although Sotomayor has not competed for a year, he has
continued to train and is currently capable of jumping 2.35 meters,
according to his trainer Guillermo De la Torre. Sotomayor cleared
2.3 meters over the weekend during an exhibition track event in
Havana.

<HEADLINE> Camp David Summit Is Neither Failure Nor Success: Erakat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator for
interim talks Saeb Erakat said Thursday the recent Camp David
summit proved to be neither a failure nor a success. Rather, it
broke many of "the Israeli taboos," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the session of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC),
held in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Erakat said "we did not go
there in order to say we reached an agreement as we had a great
responsibility on our shoulders. Our message is not to reach a deal
at any price."
</P>
<P>
"We went to Camp David in search for a fair peace agreement and
a historic reconciliation under the rules of international
legitimacy in order to end the suffering of the Palestinian people
according to the U.N. resolutions 242 and 194," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day marathon summit at Camp David in the United States,
brokered by President Bill Clinton, failed to produce a peace deal
between Israel and Palestinians, mainly due to their differences
over the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Erakat underscored the firm Palestinian position on the issue of
Jerusalem. The Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem, captured by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as the capital of their future
independent state.
</P>
<P>
Erakat quoted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as telling
Clinton that "I, as representative of the Palestinian people and
the Arabs, will never accept any Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem
and will never sell the holy city to enter history as a traitor."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people seek peace and are keen on the peace
process," Erakat said, adding, "It is an honor for me to represent
the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
"Our peace will not come at any price," he said, "We dealt, and
will deal, with the peace process positively. Our pursuit is for a
fair peace that can stand the test of time."
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted that Jerusalem, a holy city to Muslims, Jews
and Christians, must be its "eternal and indivisible" capital, a
claim not recognized by the international community.

<P>
ROME, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A further step was taken Thursday to
start work on the new high-speed, high-capacity railway line on
the crucial 180 km stretch between the northern city of Milan and
the central town of Bologna.
</P>
<P>
The project is now expected to cost 9,300 billion lire (about 4.
6 billion U.S. dollars) with construction to be completed in
nearly seven years.
</P>
<P>
According to Antonio Savini Nicci, managing-director of Tav,
the company that is handling high-speed rail projects in Italy,
preliminary work began in May and the various work sites can be
expected to start normal working in the next couple of months.
</P>
<P>
Railway lines and roads between Milan and Bologna have the
heaviest traffic load in Italy and have been teetering close to
saturation for years.
</P>
<P>
Work is also to start shortly on long-disputed new road and
rail links to ease the bottleneck in the Apennine mountains
between Bologna and Florence.
</P>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A soldier from the
Bangladeshi Battalion of the United Nations Mission in East Timor
had been killed as a result of the blast from unexpected ordnance,
the United Nations said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said another
soldier was lightly wounded in the same incident, which occurred
while 15 Bangladeshi soldiers were engaged in a clean-up operation
at one of Dili's beaches to ensure the area was free of unexploded
ordnance.
</P>
<P>
The beach had been sealed off to the public on July 1, when
unexploded ordnance wounded three Portuguese peacekeeping soldiers,
and part of the beach was used as a training ground for small arms
fire practice by the United Nations peacekeeping forces, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Though the device that exploded was still to be identified, the
United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor reported
that it was left there prior to the deployment of the U.N.
peacekeepers, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The mission had established a Board of Inquiry to investigate
the incident, he added.

<P>
The United Nations peacekeeping forces were deployed in East
Timor in September 1999.

MEXICO CITY, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's state-owned oil

from selling oil products in the country's internal market during
the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
This amount represents almost two-thirds of the income earned
during all of 1999, and one of the main reasons for this situation
is the monthly increase applied to the main fuels, such as natural
gas, gasoline and diesel among others.

Gasoline alone produced 3.5 billion dollars, while in 1999 it

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urged to Speed Withdrawal of Foreign Troops from DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Thursday urged the U.N.
Security Council to speed the withdrawal of Ugandan, Rwandan and
Burundian troops from his country.
</P>
<P>
DRC Human Rights Minister Leonard She Okitundu told a closed-
door Security Council session that the "withdrawal of the
attacking troops is the primary and essential condition for
restoring peace" in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The DRC minister urged the 15-nation Security Council to
deploy the U.N. observer mission, known as the MONUC, solely in
combat zones "to assure the complete and total withdrawal of
Ugandan, Rwandan and Burundian troops."
</P>
<P>
However, council members were said to have told the minister
not to wait until the troops had pulled out of the war-torn
country before launching a dialogue aimed at national
reconciliation and facilitating the deployment of the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
Members also asked Okitundu to report back to DRC President
Laurent Kabila that they needed the DRC's commitment to all
provisions of the Lusaka accord, signed in the Zambian capital in
July 1999 to end the many-sided war.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on June 19 adopted a resolution demanding
the withdrawal of Ugandan and Rwandan troops from the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have been backing rebels in fighting against
the Kabila government, supported by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe
after the conflicts broke out in August 1998 in the DRC,
previously called Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Cuba's Sotomayor in Quest for the Gold in Sydney 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's high jump world-record
owner Javier Sotomayor said Thursday that he will look for gold in
the Sydney 2000 Olympics in spite of his being out of
international competitions.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor thanked the International Amateur Athletics
Federation (IIAF) for having reduced from two to one year the
sanction imposed on the Cuban athlete for supposed doping. This
will enable Sotomayor to participate in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
In brief declarations to the press after the oath ceremony of
the Cuban Olympic delegation to Sydney Wednesday evening,
Sotomayor insisted in his innocence and said that he was victim of
a plot in the Panamerican Games in Winnipeg, Canada.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the inevitable abandonment of international
competitions in the last months perhaps will affect his
performance, but he said that he never quit training so he is fit
for Sydney competitions.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, winner of the gold medal in the Barcelona Olympic
Games in 1992, has the high jump world record set in 2.45 meter in
open sky and 2.43 under cover.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Council of the IIAF, consisting of 20 members,
reduced Wednesday from two to one year the sanction imposed to
Sotomayor on July 31, 1999 under doping charges -- cocaine consume
-- in the Winnipeg Panamerican Games.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, nick-named by his country's sport press the "prince
of heights," said that with this attitude by the IIAF, he is just
half-way ahead towards the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will not quit in his effort to prove his
innocence and will use every means available "to erase this stain
in my 17-year athletics career."
</P>
<P>
Cuban sport authorities welcomed the IAAF's decision but showed
disagreement because it did not recognize Sotomayor's innocence.
</P>
<P>
The athlete's analysis resulted positive for cocaine during an
anti-doping control in Winnipeg, according to the Panamerican
Sports Organization (ODEPA), which took away the gold medal from
Sotomayor who got it jumping 2.30 meters in Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
Havana's sports authorities said Sotomayor was another victim
of the number of aggressions against Cuban sport in recent years.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russian Officials Discuss Further Steps Against Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and Russian officials
have met in Washington to seek support for further measures to
make Afghanistan's ruling Taliban crack down on Islamic militants,
including Saudi exile Osama bin laden, the State Department said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said in a statement that the U.S. and
Russian officials, meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, "renewed their
condemnation of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan and
reiterated their determination to cooperate in countering it."
</P>
<P>
"They called for full implementation of U.N. Security Council
Resolution 1267 and for support for further measures against the
Taliban, in view of their refusal to implement that resolution,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides noted that a multifaceted approach, drawing upon
diplomatic, law enforcement, and other legal means, is required to
counter the threat of international terrorism from Afghanistan and
to create conditions for Afghans to establish a broad-based
government in that country. They agreed that continued cooperation
between their governments is necessary to promote that approach,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution, passed in October 1999, demanded that the
Taliban stop providing sanctuary to "terrorists" and turn over bin
Laden to a country where he can face trial or which will extradite
him to such a country.
</P>
<P>
The statement gave no details of the new measures Moscow and
Washington are considering against the Taliban but diplomats have
said the two countries want to target the Taliban leadership
without affecting ordinary Afghans.
</P>
<P>
The talks in Washington were between working groups led by U.S.
Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering and Russian First Deputy
Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Trubnikov.

<HEADLINE> Britain Launches Plan to Crackdown on Alcohol Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government Thursday
launched an ambitious plan to tackle public drunkenness and curb
alcohol related violent crime.
</P>
<P>
Plans put forward by Home Office (interior ministry) ministers
include the possibility of introducing fixed fines for public
drunkenness, like those for speeding offenses.
</P>
<P>
There is the possibility of new laws to ban drinking in certain
designated areas and new powers to allow police to seize alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Further backing for proof-of-age schemes to combat under-age
drinking and the use of different glass to lessen the impact of
attacks also form part of the government action plan.
</P>
<P>
Home Office Minister Charles Clarke said: "We know the rise in
violent crime is in part alcohol-related. This must be combated."
</P>
<P>
"Public drunkenness can give rise to serious problems of
disorderly conduct, nuisance, criminal damage and alcohol-related
assaults, particularly in the proximity of licensed premises at
closing time," he added.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, drunken offenders are responsible for 40 percent of
violent crime, over three quarters of all assaults and 88 percent
of criminal damage cases, according to government figures.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of fixed penalty fines - similar to those
issued to speeding motorists - would be served in the form of
notices to people involved in drunken or loutish behavior.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Calls Labor Unions to Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana made a call Thursday to labor unions to go back to the
negotiations for discarding pressure mechanisms such as the labor
strike.
</P>
<P>
Although there is a meeting scheduled for Friday with the
minister of labor to resume dialogue, the government hopes it will
be a drive to the talks, said Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian leader said that this kind of encounters cannot
be considered as a failure because there are no radical positions
in them neither by the government nor by the parties, nor by the
labor unions.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana described Thursday's strike as a useless measure to
solve problems. Labor unions organized a strike against the
government's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the strike took place without any problem and
showed his confidence in keeping the order during the events
announced for Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Angelino Garzon said the government will respect
the constitutional right to protest.
</P>
<P>
The official announced that in the next days he will make a
call to the commission of permanent coordination of wage and labor
policy to look for agreements with businessmen and workers.

<HEADLINE> Georgia to Meet NATO Standards After Russia's Pullout: President </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian Armed Forces will
move closer to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
standards in the next two-three years after Russia withdraws its
arms from the bases in the republic by the end of 2000, Georgian
President Eduard Shevardnadze said in Tbilisi Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The process of Georgia joining NATO will be stepped up and the
relations between Russia and Georgia will also be improved
following the pullout, the Interfax news agency quoted
Shevardnadze as saying at a meeting with General Sir Charles
Guttry, chief of the United Kingdom General Staff.
</P>
<P>
Guttry, who arrived in the Georgia capital of Tbilisi Wednesday
for a three-day working visit, promised that Britain is prepared
to assist Georgia for achieving its goal.
</P>
<P>
London can provide advice and manuals to help Tbilisi build its
army, he said, adding that special attention may be given to the
teaching of English in the United Military Academy of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Guttry also had a meeting behind closed doors with
senior officials of the Georgian Defense Ministry. He plans to
visit Georgia's western town of Zugdidi Friday for a meeting with
the British officers serving as U.N. military observers in the
Abkhazia conflict zone.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Shevardnadze announced after his reelection
as head of state that Georgia will push on to join NATO before his
second mandate expires in 2005.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Parliament Approves Reviewed Budget for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan parliament has
approved the reviewed state budget for the year of 2000, which
entails revenues estimated at over 41.4 billion kwanzas (some 3.76
billion U.S. dollars) and the equal amount of expenses, an
official document said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the document issued by the Angolan National
Assembly (ANA), the budget was approved on Wednesday with 93
favorable votes, 19 against and 28 abstentions, after being
seriously debated by the members of parliament (MPs).
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Joaquim David, who led the government's
economic team at the parliament's hearing, expressed his
satisfaction over the cabinet's performance and reminded MPs of
the "serious economic situation the country is facing".
</P>
<P>
Joaquim David also informed the parliament of the advantages to
work with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with which the
government has recently signed a monitored program, with an aim to
get long-term low-interest loans from the international
organization.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on the fuel prices, the finance minister
admitted the possibility of augmenting once more the prices of
fuel and its by-products in accordance with the evolution of crude
prices on the international market.
</P>
<P>
On salary in arrears, Joaquim David explained that this
terminology should not exist because money availability with the
finance ministry has been timely. According to him, the relative
delay still happening with the payment of civil servants' salaries
is due to administrative and technical problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Public Administration, Employment and
Social Security Pitra Neto told members of the parliament that
there will be no retrenchment of civil servants.

JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Jacob Zuma called for exploitation of gas for the sake
of sustainable development on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Gas is an industry with great promise and potential in our
country and the rest of southern African region," Zuma said at the
launch of a new gas pipeline in South Africa's port city of Durban.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline was set up by Sasol, the largest enterprise in
South Africa, to refine gas directly from coal.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said that the area south of Durban is quickly reaching its
maximum level of toxicity through industrial emissions and the new
pipeline will help introduce an environmentally friendly source of
energy into the area.
</P>
<P>
"Government would like to encourage smaller industries to
consider this source of energy as an environmentally sustainable
alternative," he said.
</P>
<P>
Business, labor and communities have to work in partnerships to
reduce the toxic levels in the area and energy-intensive
industries are faced with the challenge of developing a culture of
gas usage, Zuma added.

LUANDA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises from Angola and other
countries will soon invest some 150 million U.S. dollars in north
central Angola's Kwanza-sul Province, the official Radio Nacional

</P>
<P>
The decision was made by entrepreneurs at a round-table meeting

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit to Discuss Congo War, Regional Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The civil war in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the establishment of a
free trade zone in the southern African region will dominate the
upcoming Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit
meeting, SADC acting Executive Secretary Prega Ramsamy said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ramsamy said the DRC crisis will be one of the main topics to
be discussed by the summit, which will be held on Sunday and
Monday in Namibia's capital Windhoek, adding that the United
Nations (U.N.) should speed up the deployment of peacekeeping
forces there under the Lusaka peace accord which has failed to
halt the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The first group of Blue Helmets should have been deployed in
early August, but U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on July 26 that
"We're reassessing our positions in the DRC" after Kabila banned
the deployment.
</P>
<P>
Ramsamy said another issue to be dominated the summit meeting
will be the implementation of the SADC regional free trade
agreement, which is aimed at creating a free trade zone in the 14-
nation regional bloc and among 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
The trade protocol will be launched on September 1 and 10 SADC
member states, excluding the DRC, Seychelles, Zambia and Angola,
have so far ratified it, laying a foundation for phasing out
tariff barriers for intra-SADC trade over the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
The protocol envisages that 85 percent of SADC trade will be
liberalized by 2008, while the remaining 15 percent, concerning "
sensitive products", will be tariff-free by 2012.
</P>
<P>
Angola, the DRC and Seychelles have yet to sign the trade
protocol while Zambia has signed it but not yet ratified it.
</P>
<P>
Ramsamy said Angola has not been in a position to sign the
agreement because of its civil war, while the DRC and Seychelles
are new members of the group who are expected to accede to the
protocol "when they are ready."
</P>
<P>
Other subjects due to be discussed are debt relief and HIV/AIDS
which affects up to one in three adults in SADC countries, Ramsamy
added.

<HEADLINE> SADC Free Trade Agreement Critical to Regional Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community's (SADC's) free trade agreement is the
critical pillar of the region's development, Namibian Trade
Minister Hidipo Hamutenya said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by South African Press Association,
Hamutenya said in Windhoek while opening the SADC council of
ministers meeting that the agreement, set to come into force on
September 1, is the kingpin in SADC's drive toward true regional
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
"Our business people and their counterparts in other parts of
the globe are looking to this trade arrangement as the critical
pillar of this region's economic growth and development," he said,
adding that "they are eager to see it being implemented."
</P>
<P>
The council of ministers is the forerunner to a summit of SADC
heads of state on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hamutenya, who will take over the rotating chairmanship of the
council at the end of the summit, said those among the SADC's 14
member states who are not yet ready to implement tariff
elimination next month will have the chance to do so by January 1
next year.
</P>
<P>
"I hope also that countries, which have not been able to make
significant movement in terms of the
finalization of domestic arrangements regarding the implementation
of the protocol, will do so expeditiously," he said.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing chairman of the ministers' council and Mozambican
Foreign Affairs Minister Leonardo Simao, said the free trade
protocol is one of the critical elements for regional integration.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident of attaining this objective given the steps
that have been taken up to now," Simao said.
</P>
<P>
He added the ministers will also have the opportunity to
discuss the restructuring of the SADC itself, making it a dynamic
organization capable of ensuring implementation of the SADC
founding treaty signed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is represented at the two-day meeting of the
council of ministers by Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-
Zuma, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, Trade and Industry Minister
Alec Erwin and Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang.
</P>
<P>
In addition to trade and restructuring issues, the ministers
are also expected to consider a call for a co-ordinated regional
response to international drug companies' offer of cheaper AIDS
drugs.

LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian authorities have arrested
779 suspected drug peddlers and seized 7.4 million kilograms of
illicit drugs between January and June this year, Nigerian press
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA)

The Chairman and Chief Executive of the Agency, Ihya Lokadang

<HEADLINE> Fish Species in Lake Victoria Reduced by Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- About 40 percent of the 500
fish species in Lake Victoria have disappeared mainly due to
pollution of water, a senior Tanzanian official was quoted as
saying by Friday's local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Edward Lowassa, Minister of State in the Vice-President's
Office responsible for Environment, said in western region of
Mwanza around the lake that research done in the past decade has
shown that Lake Victoria water was dirty and darkening.
</P>
<P>
"There is a decrease in oxygen supply at the bottom of the lake
by up to 50 percent in certain areas, cutting down fish survival
ability," he said.
</P>
<P>
He related the pollution to pouring refuse waters into the lake,
the spread of water hyacinth weed, illegal methods of fishing,
wasteful use of land and destruction of forests.
</P>
<P>
Lowassa disclosed that further research is carried out to try
to find where the lost fish varieties might be hiding and to find
ways of stabilizing the tiny communities and eventually permitting
their being spread once again to most parts of the lake.
</P>
<P>
He commended an environmental protection project for the lake
funded by the World Bank through its Global Environment Facility
which had helped clearing of areas hitherto covered by the water
hyacinth, freeing areas for fish breeding, fishing and
communication within the lake.
</P>
<P>
"Success has had to do with mobilizing residents to participate
in the project especially in multiplying the insects feeding on
the weed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials have said that illegal fishing methods have greatly
declined following police crackdown over the past few years when
391 individuals have been arrested and 2,613 prohibited fish traps
seized.
</P>
<P>
The government has also urged residents of the regions around
Lake Victoria to cooperate with experts working on conservation
activities for the benefit of the current and future generations.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Flower Exports Blossom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's flower exports
increased from 7.76 million kilograms in 1998 to 9.4 million
kilograms last year, earning the country from 1.93 million U.S.
dollars to 2.83 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A Customs Department report, issued on Friday's newspapers,
said that international demand of the Tanzanian-grown flowers has
risen with the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and Britain being big
customers.
</P>
<P>
The local exporters are ready to improve qualities of their
flowers as the European customers are sensitive to color, size and
weight of the products. They also need improved cold storage
facilities at international airports in eastern Dar es Salaam and
in northern Kilimanjaro to cater for increasing flower exports.
</P>
<P>
However, they complain about few flights as Air France and Gulf
Air have cut off the flights.
</P>
<P>
"This has forced exporters to transport their produce by trucks
to Kenya to the Jomo Kenyatta International airport for airlifting
flowers to Europe and Middle East," the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the problem is being alleviated to some extent as a
private charter cargo plane, MK airline, has started handling
flower exports to Europe.

NAIROBI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
appealed again to the international community to donate more
relief food to starving Kenyans, citing the situation is at stake,
the East African Standard newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The critical famine situation needs immediate response,
National Emergency Response Committee chairman Uhuru Kenyatta was
quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The assistance needs to include drugs as well as food such as
powder milk, beans and vegetable oil which are in acute shortage
in the famine-hit areas, Kenyatta told a press conference on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the appeal made by Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi in June has received positive response from Italy, the
United States, Egypt, Israel, Iran, Britain, Switzerland and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
He also commended the World Food Program (WFP) for putting in
place a proper food distribution system which has made sure that
the relief food reached the needy famine victims.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the East African Standard reported
that 10 children had died of hunger in the past two weeks in north
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Due to the failure of two consecutive rainy seasons, Kenya has

NAIROBI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Uganda have resolved to
stamp out illegal infiltration of firearms and promote trade

line with the East African Community Treaty, local media reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Government officials from the two countries Wednesday convened
a security meeting at West Pokot District in western Kenya,
saying infiltration of illegal firearms into Kenya or Uganda
should be curbed by all means and security patrol will be beefed
up along the border points.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to enter into an agreement to share
intelligence in an effort to fight crime along their borders, and
resolved that criminals who attempt to take refuge in any of the
two countries would be apprehended and repatriated.

It is reported that the Ugandan government had repatriated a
number of criminals and returned stolen animals to the Kenyan side,

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean War Veterans to Stop Further Farm Occupations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Zimbabwe National
Liberation War Veterans' Association Chenjerai Hunzvi Thursday
ordered all ex-fighters to stop further farm occupations, The
Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans' leader said this would allow for smooth,
orderly and lawful distribution of land to thousands of land-
hungry peasants and former fighters without further confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Hunzvi said at a press conference Thursday in Harare that the
war veterans and villagers would remain on the already occupied
farms and not move to "any other unoccupied farms which are not
among the 3,000 announced by the government" for acquisition.
</P>
<P>
He said no more farms had been occupied since the announcement
of the proposed acquisition of the over 3,000 farms.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it was realistic for the government to resettle
the landless villagers on the 3,000 farms within the next month,
Hunzvi said it was possible as the farms had already been
identified.
</P>
<P>
The former freedom fighters have occupied about 1,500 white
farms since February this year to press the government to speed up
the land reform process.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Needs More Troops in Sierra Leone, Jetley Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The commander of the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone, known as the UNAMSIL, said
here Thursday that he needs more troops on the ground to carry out
its mandate, but he failed to say how many more troops are needed
to monitor the peace process in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Major General Vijay Jeley, an Indian national, told reporters
after he briefed a closed-door Security Council meeting that "we
need more troops."
</P>
<P>
"They (the Security Council members) didn't say how many more
troops at the moment, because they are talking about moving (the
peacekeeping troops into Sierra Leone) in a gradual manner," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force commander was echoing the statement by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who recommended an increase of U.N.
peacekeepers in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, Annan
recommended Tuesday a six-month renewal of the UNAMSIL when its
current mandate expires on August 7, and said it would have to be
increased beyond its current authorized strength of 13,000 drawn
from more than 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
"I remain convinced that it will be necessary to further
UNAMSIL to enable it to fulfill new tasks in Sierra Leone," Annan
said, promising to submit proposals to the 15-nation council soon
after assessing the political and military situation.
</P>
<P>
A brutal eight-year civil war, financed by rebel sales of
illicit diamonds and marked by widespread atrocities, was supposed
to have ended with an accord signed in Lome, capital of Togo, in
July 1999 that brought rebel leader Foday Sankoh into the
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
However, fighting broke out again in the war-torn country
early this year and more than 500 U.N. peacekeepers were held
hostage by the rebels, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) led by
Sankoh, in May. Sankoh is currently under government custody in
Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Jetley was briefing the Security Council on the current
situation in Sierra Leone, which Jetley said is largely under the
U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council met Thursday behind the closed doors also
to discuss a draft resolution, which is expected to be adopted
Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the resolution will not touch on the increase the strength
of the UNAMSIL, and it will approve Annan's recommendation to
extend the mandate of the U.N. peacekeeping force in the West
African country.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Fernando
de la Rua said Thursday that the country is coming out of
recession, and called on the people to look to the future with
optimism.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua issued the statement at the end of a visit to a
factory of Ford in Buenos Aires, where he headed the event during
which the first Ford Focus came out of the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the new Ford model made in the country, he said that
this new line with an investment of 120 million pesos (dollars) is
a result of trust and confidence in the future of the country.
</P>
<P>
The president talked about the advantages of the automobile
accord signed with Brazil as clear and firm regulations generate
reliability and certainty and favor investments in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Ford presented Thursday its Focus model made in Argentine,
whose project demanded a 117 million dollar investment, in order
to supply local consumers as well as the Southern Common Market (
Mercosur) and other markets.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The governors of the European
Central Bank (ECB) Thursday decided to keep its main interest
rates unchanged despite the continued fall of euro.
</P>
<P>
The bi-weekly meeting of the governors maintained that the
three main interest rates, namely the main refinancing rate, the
marginal lending rate and the deposit facility, will continue at 4.
25 percent, 5.25 percent and 3.25 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The last ECB rate hike was in early June, when the central
bank of the 11-nation euro zone decided to raised the three main
interest rates by 0.5 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, euro continued its trend of decline this week as it
slumped to an ECB reference rate of 0.9028 dollars Thursday from 0.
9142 the previously day.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts believed that euro's recent course was affected
by economic data of the American economy and that the European
Central Bank would take its next move depending on the
inflationary statistics in the Euro-zone.

<HEADLINE> Bargain-Hunters Lift Tech Stocks Higher On Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Technology stocks on Wall Street
moved out of a slump Thursday as investors rushed into the market
for bargain-hunting in late session.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 101.42 at 3,
759.88. The composite fell as much as 137.21 points in early
trading.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 19.05 at 10,706.58 and the Standard &AMP; Poor
's 500 index was up 13.86 at 1,452.56.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied in tech stocks later in the session as
bargain hunters picked up some high-flyers on the cheap. The
Nasdaq index has lost more than 14 percent in the past two weeks
amid worries about higher interest rates and slowing earnings
growth at technology companies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said tech stocks have fallen to a bottom and have
nowhere to go but up. Among the stocks which fell back into favor
were Oracle and Cisco System.
</P>
<P>
Investors sold tech stocks earlier in the session Thursday
after a number of tech companies warned that their earnings will
probably not meet expectations in the second half of 2000.
Semiconductor equipment maker Kulicke &AMP; Soffa Industries Inc. said
its earnings could fall below forecasts later this year while
Motorola told suppliers it was seeing lower demand for handsets.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index closed up mainly because of strength in its
technology and financial service components. Among them were
computer maker IBM and banking group J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 1.40 at 651.71. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 6.16 at 906.58 and Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 0.76 at 499.45.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New Stock Exchange with 1,545 down, 1,338 up and 465 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.04 billion shares from 983.05
million in the previous session.

LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Foreign Office Thursday
summoned Yugoslavia's representative in London to press for
information on the two Britons and two Canadians who were arrested
by the Yugoslav army on suspicion of spying.
</P>
<P>
"We summoned the head of the Yugoslav interest section at the
Cyprus High Commission. A senior official formally protested about
Belgrade's behavior in failing to confirm the arrests," a
spokesman for the Foreign Office said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav army said it arrested the four men Tuesday night
along the boundary with Kosovo. It said they had military
equipment and explosives with them and appeared trained for
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
But Britain said the two Britons were policemen who were sent
to train the Kosovo police and they were on holiday from their job
in Kosovo when they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Britain also alleged that it had received no formal
notification of the arrests and Belgrade had failed to reply to
numerous requests for information even though it was legally bound
to inform Britain if it detained any British nationals.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia broke off formal diplomatic relations with Britain
in 1999 when NATO launched air strikes to force Serbian troops to
pull out of the province of Kosovo.

BUENOS AIRES, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Foreign Minister
Adalberto Giavarini said on Thursday that the European Union (EU)
and the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) are both
strategic options to Argentinian exports.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that Argentine chose the Southern Common
Market (Mercosur) as its first element to build a block, and in
second place the expansion of Mercosur to the rest of Latin
America.

<P>
Referring to the negotiations between Mercosur and the FTAA,

are going to have the agreement of Vilamoura where for the first
time the issues of agriculture and services are incorporated in
the agenda; this being considered as a success for Mercosur and
Argentine.
</P>
<P>
He said Mercosur gets strengthened, because among its members
the commercial exchange grew an average 16 percent per year
between 1990 and 1999, and emphasized that the growth potential in
the intra-block trade is high.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur is composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
